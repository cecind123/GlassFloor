good,"Kroger is a great company to work for, everyone is so friendly and living in a smaller community, it seems as if everyone knows everyone. A typical day includes bagging groceries, collecting carts, and helping customers with large orders to their vehicles. Working here I have learned that Kroger takes pride in their products and always puts the customer first. My co-workers are really great people and they make me look forward to coming in everyday. The hardest part of the job is keeping all the customers happy and multitasking to help more than one person at a time. The most enjoyable part is being able to help a customer with whatever they want and knowing they left with a positive attitude."
good,very friendly environment. the pay could have been better. we have a few different managers while i worked there. that made the place a little crazy just due to the fact that the NEW managers didnt really know what to do or where to start.
good,I have been with kroger for a very long time and seeing as thou their pay rates only change by .10 is the only real complaint I have.
good,"I love Kroger's, they are one of my favorite stores. To me, we don't get paid enough for all the hard work we put into our job."
good,"I enjoyed everything that I did while working at Kwik Shop, but the hardest part for me was when I got called into work one night because there had be a shooting outside the store and as acting manager I was called."
good,"I was told I would be getting more hours than I am currently getting."
good,"you had many opportunity to receive a raise and good clean workplace overall. all of my co workers where very pleasant and friendly, management was somewhat lazy, the hardest part of the job was having to stand for up to 8 hours at a time."
good,Client had consist ant work and heavy moving and lifting of furniture daily busy environment. nothing was enjoyable it was work  coworkers are nice management is nice
good,I was out there for around 2 months as a temp. My only issue i had was the Temp agency I worked for paid 8 bucks an hour while employees who start off w the actual company make 11. Overall I was treated well by full time employees and their managers. Definitely looking forward to being able to get back out there from a different temp agency.
good,"Working at Kroger was not too bad in my opinion. In fact, I learned that I should have definitely been more grateful for the job I had to where I am now. Typically, my work days started off early at 6am in the morning, and if I can recall, I believe my shifts ended between 11am and 1pm for five days a week and $9/hr salary. That was pretty good."
good,"Excellent Benefits, 401 K matching up to 5% after one year. Great one on one employee problem solving. Quick in-store mechanical fixes."
good,not a lot of hours but will hire people in high school. jqew pownfbg 9ou0iwenfghb9u eiaur5 4bn94u3 0w984 u8909wr4ugfa80wreufhaw-rufh  retag ear  ertg a
good,Frys is a great place where all co-workers are like family. We do a lot of games and family night. The hardest thing is that Frys  does not work with your schedule...If your a working mother good luck with balancing work and home because Kroger comes first!
good,Its different people that come in and out the stores so how to learn how to be a people person or just know hot to deal with people.
good,"Steady busy, good company with good core values and customer respect and appreciation. The work was easy and the aptmosphere was pleasant. Management stayed on top of their main issues but fell behind on the feel of the store. Moral spike and fell but was maintained some how. The funnest part of this job was the customers whilest they were always the hardest part, you know how people are."
good,"Stocking managing my people,checking emails, and putting on orders, making schedules."
good,A typical day at work is getting dept ready fro daily operations. The hardest part was too much lifting and not enough people working in dept. Overall the customers were great to deal with and co workers were okay at times.
good,"Working at Kroger was okay, it's a job, nothing special to tell, it's a grocery store. Not much direction was given, just thrown out there and left to figure it out."
good,"Union job for associates."
good,"Great place to work, friendly and store management really cares about their people. Work/life balance is horrible, upper management demands more with less everyday. Some advancement opportunities, but limited if you don't want to move."
good,This is a business of LOVE. I enjoy learning from my customers what their special occasion is and helping them to find that special item that will be a token of their everlasting love.
good,Great company with friendly mangers and team member who enjoyed their jobs.Plenty of room for switching department for advancements with the company.
good,Fun place to work. great scheduling so you can get your house and have a life. get a chance to learn almost all departments. benefits are good.
good,Had great co-workers and managment team was amazing to work with.  Was able to advance to different departments to learn more about the job overall.  Enjoyed seeing the same customers and having a working relationship with them.
good,"They don't give much room to move up and you truly struggle for hours. Its a constant battle to try and get full-time and even if a spot opens up they are more likely to choose someone who works half as hard as you."
good,"Overall quite a good place to work. Most stores I have been at though have at least one lemon of a co-manager. The union makes it difficult to discipline associates at times. Most co workers are great, it is a very stable job that is always seeking to improve its customer base, but in that is making structure for associates difficult."
good,"Great first job, flexible, with good hours depending on location. Not too much room for growth, but if you are there long enough you can make a great living."
good,"I worked during the summer, and as a first job it wasn't so bad. I worked about 40 hours a week and so spent approx. 8-9 hours standing up cutting fruit on my assigned days. Eventually, it became sort of relaxing, like a rhythm because I was cutting the same fruit every work day and putting it out on display for the customers. I really enjoyed working there because people were nice to me and showed me the ropes. Of course, there were some trying days but all in all, it was a great experience. The main problem I had was with the pineapple and the trash. I had to cut a lot of pineapple because it was the summertime and everyone wanted watermelon, pineapples, or strawberries. My skin burned because of the pineapple juice. The greatest part was the 30 minute lunch break. I usually brought a few snacks from home but I always bought lunch in store. I really enjoyed being able to eat lunchables one day and eating a hot dog or chicken tenders the next (the chicken tenders are the BEST there). It was a great experience for me and I would love to do it again."
good,The work wasnt overly difficult and the job security was good. not many things to complain about other than the managerial support was less than polte
good,Having a friendly place for associates and customers to shop. Ensuring we are clean and well stocked so the customers get what they are looking for. Work well with my management team and have good store visits. The hardest part of my job is disappointment when I do not achieve a goal. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with people and customers. My biggest enjoyment is driving sales I love to sell products.
good,"I've been working part time at Kroger for about three years now, and my experience has been pleasant for the most part. The only catch is that getting full time status is impossible, and you're only guaranteed twelve hours a week by the union. It's a decent job, nice working environment."
good,Kroger was my first job. I got it during high school and only left because I was leaving my home town for college. If I could have stayed I would have because the raises were frequent and the hours were good. The people were amazing and I liked Kroger as a company in general. The customers were nice and it was an easy job. I wouldn't stay for years on end because the wages do top out fairly low but it's good for a few years while getting your education or if you just need something to add onto an already existing paycheck.
good,"I loved working at Fredmeyer, customers are great, and the environment is wonderful as long as you are not working in Deli or Grocery. Most of the management works from their desks and often times will avoid working in their designated areas. Once you learn to overlook that aspect of management, and learn the essential functions of the job you will excel!"
good,Kroger was a pretty good company to work for. There was a lot of room for advancement but the pay was not always up to par. Co-workers were good to work with.
good,"Working at Advantage was great. Everyday was a new challenge, and every day took you somewhere new. It was non stop, but a great work life balance. I enjoyed meeting so many new people all the time."
good,"A typical day started with bagging groceries, transisitioning to managing the lot with carts, assisting customers, and eventually taking the initiative to sweep or clean the store in the free time."
good,"The environment was always busy, although it could get fairly hectic at times. The employees were like a second family, and I still visit them from time to time. The biggest downside, as with most retail venues, are the unruly/aggressive customers. Aside from that, many of the regular customers were great to talk to, and I keep up with them as well."
good,"Nice working environment and friendly,familiar faces. Main focus is making sure the customer is satisfied when they leave the store. Management was going through a few changes, but still decent. Co-workers are very friendly and helpful.Department manager never kept track of everything."
good,If you are looking for a company to grow with. then this is the company for you. You have understanding and knowledgeable people working at your side that take notice of the work you do and move people according to where they deserve to be.
good,If you plan on working Grocery or retail for the rest of your life this is the place to go great benefits and pay but only for those who want that business.
good,"My typical work day included: being an Accounting Lead completing accurate balancing and reconciliation of Kroger Gift Cards on a weekly basis, completing accurate balancing and reconciliation of Kroger depository accounts on a weekly basis, Resolving any outstanding issues within 60 days of reconciliation, monitoring cash control environment and assure compliance with Kroger control policies, creating and process journal entries, creating multiple account spreadsheet and other documents for detail, and customer Service."
good,this is a great job for a teenager and it even lets you accept tips from customers management is very cool and they have a grace period of 7 minutes for those late people
good,"There was lots of travel for this position. I was able to see many areas of Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan. Long hours with great benefits."
good,"I able to use me costumer service skills to the best of my abilities. Providing friendly, charming, and responsive assistance when needed."
good,"The job is fast-paced and great experience in sales and customer service. Management is fair. Advancement is good, but full-time opportunity is almost impossible unless you advance to a manager type role. Benefits are excellent, but pay is rough."
good,"I've only been there a short while, however, management/leadership is very approachable and is proactive in recognizing talent and providing guidance on professional growth."
good,A excellent place to learn and develop your skills as an technician. However the pay that Kroger offers you seems to be the lowest in all of the retail pharmacys. My co-worker are good at there job and very good at training new and incoming technician.
good,The Kroger i worked at was a very Fast Paced work environment. I learned how to be a good Multi- Tasker. It was a good company that i grew and built from.
good,"Working with Kroger was what helped me grow as a manager.  I respect the management training program and how detail oriented it was."
good,"In a typical day, you could serve 200 customers with varying personalities. Adjustment and leaving a positive impact with each individual is the rewarding aspect of the job."
good,"I enjoyed working for Kroger, until they noticed. I was given a heavy workload while other people, people who were making more would often stand around simply because of seniority."
good,"Kroger was a pretty good place to work. This particular location was very organized and I enjoyed working here. At times i was not a big fan of the management but besides that, I liked it."
good,i was a dairy clerk it wasn't a hard job but it was a demanding job you have to stay organized and keep up with dates to ensure the freshest product stayed on the shelf management only made a appearance if their boss came in but other than that it wasn't a  terrible place to work
good,grocery store branch great for experience a union cultural environment all about team work i enjoyed my time at ralphs helped me grow as person and manager
good,I like to stay busy and this job does just that it is very fast pace. My only reason for looking for another job is that I would like full time with benefits.
good,Worked an assembly line putting different products into packaging. Was on the clean up crew as well. Great co workers we all we team workers.
good,"I really liked this job was there a long time and held many positions. I started pushing carts, then a cashier, then a deli clerk, then deli lead, last but not least a meat clerk before my departure. Management were ok but they kept changing them out so I seen a lot some I liked and some I didn't but I did like the stability back then and getting paid every week"
good,"bag groceries and do carry out for customers."
good,"I miss the days of a strong union, but Kroger gets the point at last. You treat your employees well and they treat you and the customers well."
good,"Mariano's was a great place to work it gave me lots of real world experience and overall just a great place. Management was put together co-workers were very friendly and the entire company made you feel as if you were apart of a family. The only downside that came from Mariano's is that they cut your hours if you don't give them open availability but, they were still flexible. the hardest part of the job was just working on the busiest days of the week since its a grocery store we all know that grocery stores are abnormally busy on Saturdays,holidays,and around the first of the month."
good,Great place to work and interact with customers.  Very organized and goal oriented job.  Management was always encouraging and personable.
good,While at Kroger I worked in many different departments so I had the opportunity to get to know the customers. Over the years I worked for the company my customer service skills grew and that is why I decided to further my education and get into the medical field.
good,"fast  paced work environment, learning new things and meeting new people. Growth with the company  is possible. Training new employees and meeting all diverse type of people"
good,I cut up fruits and vegetables for the salad bar and for the fruit wall. I also made party trays. An important part of my job was to help any customers that needed it.
good,It was a great place to work for a high school or college setting. Very flexible hours and it was a great way to enter the work force
good,Good work environment. Good coworkers and management. Relatively stress free. You know what is expected of you and should have no problems getting it done.
good,"Mostly I enjoy working at Kroger. The company truly cares about their customers and ways to make their shopping experience highly positive. I have a good job that always keeps my on my toes and I usually end up with some funny stories to tell friends at the end of the week. Most of my co-workers are great and have become friends as well. However, I do wish that management would be able to do something about our complaints. Whenever I tell them about a co-worker not doing her job or some mistakes that are constantly being made, management will listen to me, but the problems never actually get fixed for some reason."
good,"A typical day would be extensive cleaning while balancing serving customers. But it would always be a fun work environment, the customers were friendly as well as the employees. Management did vary, some managers were friendly but with a sense of authority. But some management lacked and left us with a mess. The most enjoyable part was that the employees and customers became like family, and created long lasting relationships."
good,"Work usually starts with a "" here we go again "" but then when meeting the customers, it's just a change of table because they're kind and joyful. Meeting new customer and providing the best customer makes everyone happy at the end of the day, so I do my best providing what the customers need is."
good,"order product to fill shelves, stocking product to fill shelves"
good,my usual day is coming and greeting customers. Helping out the cashiers bag the customers products. Also jumping on the register to ring out customers when there are not enough cashiers working.
good,"cleaned shelves off ,unloaded truck twice a week,had a lot of fun with co-workers.manager was really cool and fun to be around,and the most enjoyable part off the job was stocking shelves without running into people."
good,a typical work day is cookies and crackers running being shipped out of the door. i have learned that in other for people to work beyond their potential you have to respect people and treat everyone fair. my manager is the best and wish all other managers are like her. have really good coworkers and we work well as a team. the hardest part about my job is getting everyone on the same page. the most enjoyable part about my job is making sure everyone goes home safely.
good,I liked it at Kroger. The store(s) were nice and the management were productive. The general culture of the stores are friendly and customer friendly.
good,"When I 1st applied for this job it seemed like a new start for me after everything that went wrong for me a year before. I was told their were great benefits, Friendly Associates and chances for advancement. I started out as a Carry-out and it was a nice start but a few months in I really started to notice what was happening."
good,my manger was great people around me was very nice and it was nice when i got to be cashier because i got to talk to every one. it was nice when i was outside working felt great
good,I enjoyed working at Kroger because the staff were all helpful and friendly. It was a friendly environment. I liked seeing regular customers and new customers and helping them with what they needed.
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting new customer's and having my regular's. I'd say the hardest part of this job was learning the U-scan and cashier register's. But as soon as I learned them it was quit easy. My co-worker's was great and made the day fly by. They reminded me of me happy,out going,helping other's. The management was wonderful very understanding people and they loved helping people. A typical day at work was clocking in started working on  the cash register greeting customer's helping them to the car if needed. Also cleaning the breakrooms and restrooms. Going to breaks and lunch. Helping my other co=workers bag if they didn't have a bagger."
good,"Depending on the time of the day, the deli could get really busy, the job never failed to keep me on my toes."
good,"The most enjoyable part about working at fry's are the people. Friendly, energetic, and positive environment. However, everyday the job is hard, but as for the hardest part of my job was making sure when interacting with customers as you have a ""feel of what they want as far a product and service. My co-workers always had a positive smile and work ethics when they came to work no matter what time of the day, and that's what brings customers coming back each day."
good,"Great place to work, full or part time. The work is never boring. Customer's are very friendly. Offers flexibility in scheduling which is great for most employees."
good,"i loved my hours, i learned how to be come a cashier, i had to great everybody that came to my line, my co-workers was very nice"
good,"My time at the Kroger location in Jefferson, Georgia was brief. While working as a courtesy clerk my tasks involved gathering and sorting shopping carts and bagging customers' groceries. The compensation was fair (minimum wage) for the tasks required of me. Management was fair and worked around my schedule which involved playing High School Baseball at the time."
good,"*Front End Maintenance: I sort out grocery items and return them to their shelves and I sort damages and take them back to their areas (deli, bakery, meat, produce and dairy)"
good,"What I learned working in the pharmacy at Kroger, is how to fill prescriptions, certain brand names of medicine and the use for them, HIPPA policies, how to read RX prescriptions, and how to handle important calls such as doctors offices, hospital's, etc."
good,"A normal day at Ralph always starts with providing fantastic customer service, always greeting customers with a friendly attitude while assisting them in a timely manner and maintained great attendance and knows how to assist the customer and get the product sold.Well that really is it."
good,"if you don't like to check all day this isn't the place for you,if you work outside the dairy dept ,you'll never check but if your a dairy or wall deili manager be prepared to check all day"
good,prepared the food cleaned the cases cooked the hot meals served customers and took orders for trays and cakes Very personal management and staff
good,"Pretty good place, good hours, pretty decent wage, paid vacation and personal days. Benefits and insurance available."
good,I've worked for Kroger for 9 years and believe it is a good company to work for. It is an industry leader and is continuing to grow in sales and market share. I've been a Store Manager and Pricing Analyst for the company so there are opportunities for advancement. Management works a lot of hours and weekends so that could be an issue for some.
good,"they are a good work place for a beginner worker to start so they will be able to indetify the machines an chemicals, they are a very friendly team, they allow you to pick your own time to come into work an allow you to drive golf carts around instead of your personal cars."
good,"The people there are great, the job was okay at best. Three hour shifts at six days a week gets old fast. Not much else to say."
good,"Fred Meyers was probably the second most fun place I've had the pleasure to work at. Management was very reassuring and wanted you to succeed and promote when enough experience was garnered. Great people, good management, good pay."
good,"i love my job but it time for a new chapter in my life.i  would put order for the product that i need in dept.to make my customer happy or help fill there needs. make arrangement from birthday to funeral and do balloons bouquets  for baby,get well and birthday. i had to know about the product in dept. or flower in general. but it hard to run a dept. when people call off everyday"
good,"A typical day at Fred Meyers would consist of cashiering, customer service, and talking to customers. I learned how to process returns, operate a multi-line phone system, and how to handle difficult customers. Management was great and understanding. I enjoyed working with co-workers most days. Hardest part of the job would be handling difficult people. Most enjoyable part of the job was the flexibility in schedules."
good,"Kroger was an excellent place to start working. They care very deeply about their customers, placing customer service above nearly all else on the jobsite. The store manager at the time was a respectable person. They worked very hard and weren't afriad to get their hands dirty. Regardless of the job, they were willing to work and help me when I needed it. I quit shortly after that manager retired. Their example in leadership impresses me to this day, showing that even the boss can appreciate a hard days work. The only drawback was that any promotion came with a pay-decrease. In order to be promoted you needed expirence in the store, with that came raises. When you accepted a promotion you were put back on starting pay."
good,The hardest part of the job was the family and work life balance. The constant changing of holidays and always being open on holidays really stops family travel.
good,"I loved this job in Evans, GA because it was peaceful and fun. The produce manager did set aside a little time to help me learn a few more things to make my in-experienced job easier to perform. And the only down fall about the job was not enough hours or pay. But I would most definitely do produce as well as  cut fruit person again. And everybody at this store was pleasantly nice and kind, and it was a fun place to work. Something you don't see or hear often. The only thing was the freezer/deep freezer needs expansion for the perishables they order to have appropriate storing so everybody doesn't bump into each other."
good,"I was able to be trained very quick in becoming a floor supervisor, cash office assistant, and doing various things.  This company is great for people wanting to grow within the company.  The pay is low for starting but the benefits are great."
good,"Great place to work, lot of manual labor as a Co-Manager.  No weekends off really but was a great career start for me."
good,"A typical day at work for me would to put out product ,break down pallets ,ring register ,and assist customers all at the same time.I learned how to be very patient at kroger.The management was always nice and helpful. The hardest part of my job was to maintain balance with all my tasks at hand. The most enjoyable part was the people that worked there."
good,"working there it gets a little crazy and hectic at times but nothing to hard to manage. I enjoy it for the most parts, the hardest thing about the job is probably the customers; the rude customers any way. if you know how to handle yourself it's not that bad either.I learned a lot of social skills while working for kroger. I also learned how to be a cashier because kroger was my first job. management is very nice and they take charge when need be. my co workers were fun and polite."
good,"I started off working at Kroger during my senior year at school and I was pushing carts at first. It's not at all the most glamorous job in the building but at least there's not much you can do to get yourself in trouble. You also make tips which is a really good experience, it makes you a bit more motivated to keep working. The customers don't bother you so much as a cart pusher but when you're bagging their groceries they will eye you like a dog so it's best if you know what you're doing and that you keep up with the cashier. "
good,"A typical day of work was generally fast paced, but enjoyable. Usually a 10 minute run down of what needed to be done that day and then working down the to-do list. Handling customers every 10 to 15 minutes was also a thing. Management did tend to be on the nit picky side, but overall were good people who cared about the job getting. Most of my coworkers were great people who I got along with even outside work. The hardest part was defiantly juggling multiple departments if someone was out sick or came in early and left earlier than when the relief would arrive. It was fairly fast paced and you never really ran out of stuff to do."
good,This is an easy job wants you get the hang of it. Although lack of team work could make the work more difficult than it has to be. Managers only look to complain just so they can get a bonus for associates hard work.
good,"The hardest part of my job is that I have to depend on Upper Management to make sure that price changes are input correctly. When they aren't, then the store comes to me for problems."
good,Fun place to work but pay is hard. Benefits are fantastic after longevity.
good,"Got carts at 7am then cleaned restrooms, bagged, put up put-backs. Tom Rumler was a great manager but after him it kind of went down in my judgment and all the co-workers were great."
good,"Clock in, scan groceries, go home"
good,"While I worked at Kroger, I was a Courtesy Clerk, and sometimes a Cashier. It was a very enjoyable job, but at the same time I was always on my toes. It helped the time go by faster, that's for sure."
good,"Daily operations of community pharmacy (dispensing, counseling, compounding). "
good,Work was fast pace and you always had something to do.  Management was overall good to work for.
good,Customer service was the best part of the job.  Knowing the customers shopping experience was better than expected was always my goal.
good,I enjoyed working for the company in general. I worked in the Pharmacy and wasn't to happy due to one fellow employee and how management let her get by with everything.
good,A typical day with the Kroger family is helping customers every second of the day. The store was never slow. We were always busy and I enjoyed working with the customers
good,"I loved working at Kroger.  Management was great, everyone got along with one another.  No empty promises."
good,This place is an everyday store. I've learned how to provide the best customer service to the public. Management is great and they are always there when you are having a problem whether it be personal or work related. My co-workers and I are like team mates we all have to work together in order to make the whole thing work. The hardest part of the job is when it gets so busy in your department but the hours in the department fail to give us the help that we need. The best part of the job is being able to work with some of the best friends that I have ever made.
good,"Definitely loved working at a place like Mariano's.  Very lively and outgoing for a grocery store.  My coworkers and managers were always helpful and heavily involved with their work, as well as mine.  Working in the meat department is the way to go.  I was able to serve customers, cook, stock the cases, and much more.  Recommended to anyone seeking a job in retail.  Some staffing issues and transfers, but other than that a genuinely good place to work."
good,"A typical day would start with getting the department organized for the rest of the day, fill low and empty stock items , order product based on sales days of week special holidays and customer request. I learned how to work and talk with many different people, learned to train people based on how they learned and to motivate.  I have meet some amazing people in both management position and my co-workers which I still consider friends today.  The hardest part of the job would be the amount of work on certain days if something happened with one of my co-workers like they called in or felt like not working or if we had a problem with equipment.  The most enjoyable part of the job and by far the best part of the company I worked for and one of my favorite things in my life was the people I meet with and talked with, learned many of things from many different people."
good,"This was my first job in the pharmacy field. I learned drug names and in essence what retail pharmacists do. "
good,"This job is hard. It is not for the weak or lazy. If you can last the first two months, you can do it. You always work 10 hour minimum shifts and most of the time you are held over for at least another hour. You are expected to move as fast as possible and they can give you mandatory overtime at the end of your day and they can give you whole days as mandatory overtime. If you want a job with hours this one is awesome. 70+ hours is not a problem here."
good,"A typical day is you either turn on your line, replace bags, and clean the line. You check out customers, and possibly bag if you don't have a bagger. "
good,"I have been with Kroger type companies for many years and many things are great about them. The pay is not one of them. As a transplant employee I was making almost seventeen dollars an hour at the previous location having earned my experience, when I was hired here I started at seven sixty per hour. Despite that I still continued to show up for work and give my all everyday."
good,I stocked the shelves mostly at night. Co-workers were great. We worked as a team.
good,The hardest part was the lack of associates working. I learned a little bit of everything.
good,"I have worked at two different Kroger pharmacies, and have had two very different experiences."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of coming to work in the morning ready to work. Having a meeting with other coworkers and managers to discuss the highlights of the companies weekly budgets and statistics. The management was very supportive and willing to help their workers. The coworkers were very easy to get along with and very personable. Long term friendships came out of the job. The job could be difficult at times, it took a great deal of multitasking between getting your work that was expected of you for the day and making customers your priority to ensure their needs are met to ease their shopping trip. The job was also very rewarding in that you get to build relationships with customers of the community which really grow to be like a family."
good,"I was a cashier so my job was pretty easy, I really didn't have much to do so it was boring at the times when we weren't busy. I didn't get any benefits (health care, dental, etc.) But they liked to give gifts cards during contests and your birthday and anniversary of being there for so long so that was a plus."
good,"management team wonderful"
good,"I learned a lot in my time of working at Kroger. "
good,"I would arrive to work, and proceed to break down pallets of groceries so the team could stock the aisles. After break down, I had my assigned aisles to get completed. My first store manager was my best, he made sure to know each employee's name, even if he hadn't had an opportunity to meet them. My co-workers is what made the job so great, we would have fun, but still get our work done."
good,A typical was ranging up customers items they purchase. My co-workers was very helpful. the hardest part was when the had a good sale and so many people came in for the sale.  That was also the enjoyable part of my job.
good,"I worked a variety of shifts and positions. I started out as a cashier, but moved up quickly. I went to work in Customer Service, then became a supervisor, I greatly enjoyed it when we were really busy. I love to organize and motivate employees. When we were busy, it was almost like leading a well-trained army. It was so fun. I liked the days when I could stay on the floor and ""float."" I could run a register, bag groceries and handle customer issues. All of the employees worked so well for me and we loved working together. I enjoyed all of the customers and even 6 years later, I run into them and they remember me. I was being prepared to be promoted to Assistant Front End Manager when I got pregnant (at 44). That was really hard on me because it was a high-risk pregnancy. That is when they trained me for accounting where I could work in the office. That was a challenge, but I figured it out. I had an amazing store manager. The worst part of the job was when I was in my advanced stages of pregnancy, I had a hard time getting breaks because there was never anyone scheduled to back me up for my breaks, so I was constantly called back to work. I had to go on maternity leave before I planned."

I have learned alot from this company in terms of handling rough management and learning how to do several tasks at once.

The hardest part of the job is meeting green half hours at the checkout and getting cashiers to meet their ring tender percentage, it is a challenge . The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers, I like turning a customers bad day into a great day at my store.

My fellow co-workers are mostly great to be around and enjoyable to work with."

good,From my time at Turkey Hill I've met many great people and have made great memories and even made amazing friends. They make you feel like a family there. A typical day consists of coming in to see a bunch of smiling co-workers who greet you and ask you how you are. Then once you clock in you either grab a register or get assigned another task within the store. Throughout your day you'll meet a wide array of interesting customers many of which I've come to know by name and even enough to know what they came for before they do! The people are nice and the manager of my store was a great guy who could have fun but also keep us at the top in our district. The hardest part like any customer service job would be some unruly customers but luckily that is a rarity there! The most enjoyable part was just getting to know and befriend many of my co-workers and even a good bit of the regular customers. All of which have interesting stories to share.

Then the prep room clean up is next on the list, as well as running the new truck. The co-workers are amazing. Management is nice though communication and trust could be way better. Maybe a little over micromanaged as well. The hardest part is the lifting and the occasional unhappy customer. The people and customer service make for an awesome atmosphere."
good,"Being with my co-workers was fun.  I considered them my family, because we spent more time together than we did with our own families."
good,"I really enjoyed my job as a service technician. I would travel from store to store, making repairs on any issues they had with point of sale, telephones, computers, scales, cctv, or anything electronic. I worked with almost no supervision, and had the flexibility to take a few hours off for a doctor's appointment, and make it up later in the day or week. The stores were always glad to see me, and I felt a sense of belonging because we all worked for the same company. The atmosphere was relaxed  and friendly. If I was low on work, I could call one of my fellow techs and help them with their workload, and if I was falling behind, I could call on them to help. We often took these opportunities to cross train one another, and pass on our knowledge. I worked with a great team. "
good,It was just a job I took to make money during college. Great hours in the beginning then no hours toward the end due to advancement.
good,Everyone I work with is very nice and very helpful. The hardest part about the job is just being able to have to stand for hours on end. Its not the most fun but its tolerable.

However, the compensation is at minimum wage and it takes a long time to work your way up to better pay and advancement. All in all it is a good place to work."
good,I enjoyed working for Kroger.  There was never a dull moment working there.
good,On this job I had a couple tasks. My first tasks would be the cashier postion for at least 4 hours. Then by that time I would have to load or unload the shipment trucks. My co-workers were amazing. So was my manager. We developed one of the best relationships. The hardest part I had with this particular job would have to be the sweeping and condensing of boxes throughout the whole stockroom. The most enjoyable would be cashier position.
good,"Kroger was a nice place to work, however the pay was bad.  I worked in multiple departments and gained lots of experience there.  I learned how to be very organized and I also gained some great retail customer service experience.  Store management was pretty good overall.  Co-workers were decent. Lots of them who been there for long periods of time felt as if they didn't have to work as hard or do there job as well as a new hire or someone who hasn't been there a long time.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who weren't satisfied."
good,"A typical day at work would be clocking in, put my hair net on, clean up a bit, shine my cutter, look at my schedule, put gloves on, and serve the customers. I learned how to cut mean and cheese perfectly at any size the customer wanted. My co-workers were very grumpy, i was the youngest person working in my department and i mean like 20 years young than everyone so some i guess were threatened by me a bit, they complained and gossiped a lot and took some long breaks. For the most part my job was easy and very forthcoming. The hardest part of my job was learning how to properly place the meat on the cutter. The most enjoyable part of my job was tasting the new meats and cheeses then i would Google them on my break and tell my friends about what country i tasted today."
good,This was a company that I knew what to expect. I guess because i worked there for so long. I met so many wonderful people along the way. It was a little different than Whole Foods because it had more structure. The management was given a set of instructions so it was hammered home to us.
good,a typical day at Kroger was fairly busy i learned many things about food safety from my supervisor. the management at Kroger was very easy to talk to and also very helpful when it came to solving issues.

This job has taught a lot about effective customer service and even when they are completely wrong, the customer is still always right.

Once we complete our duties for the current time we go push carts and if the cashiers need us inside to clean a spill, take back food, or help a customer out we go and do that right away.  Working at Fred Meyer I learned to work as a team helps the day go by smoother.  My managers were very good at what they did they made sure everything went smooth.

A typical day at work you have a set of tasks that needs to be completed before you leave. Sometimes it can be hectic and you must work at a faster pace,but you have a great team there to help you out. If you ever have a problem or any kind of issues management is more than willing to assist you. Variation in tasks is probably the hardest part of the job. You come in and do the same thing repeatedly, after a while its become less interesting. The most enjoyable part of the job is coming into your work day and seeing your co-workers.

The hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers because sometimes you just could not make them happy. The most enjoyable part was talking with the customers. Finding out weekly how their lives were going.
good,"The job mostly entails scanning a customers items for about 2 hours at a time, depending on how long the shift is. While this is simple, the efficiency of the cashiers dependent on the floor managers ability to put the right people on the right registers. Some registers are reserved for smaller orders and therefore slower cashiers will do better on them. When a faster cashier is placed on an express lane they often end up with nothing to do because they get through the orders so quickly."
good,"As a customer service representative, I had many duties. I was able to coordinate breaks and lunches for the front end staff, as well as help out customers with any concern they may have had."
good,most days you see the same customers and it is nice when they call me by my name or give me a hug. i have learned alot about how the business runs and how important our attitude towards customers effects our success. Unfortunately alot of the associates are very young so there is alot of turnover as they go off to college or they find others jobs. The hardest part of the job is when you have done all you can to help a customer and they dont appreciate it and it is kind of a let down and it is hard not to let it effect me.
good,The benefits are top notch and pay is very competitive!
good,I was a cashier at Kroger. I would spend my shift making sure that people received the deals they were seeking. Occasionally I'd help sack groceries or help put things back that were returned.
good,A typical work day was interesting for me as I had just converted over to a new job role. So i was considered to green (so to speak). Everyday was challenging and fun as most of us had work for the pervious company that was bought out by Kroger. It was a team enviroment and effort that made the job itself seem so much enjoyable. I learn how to balance my worklife schedule from working 40hrs to 40plus hrs.

good,Company understood its business and had put great effort into making it operate well. Gave employees the tools and access to the systems necessary to do their jobs right and encouraged them to try new ways of performing tasks. Company policies requiring management to move from store to store prevented management from getting too comfortable and required them to focus on their jobs and the performance of their present store.
good,Very busy taking care of the sick an elderly that need their daily medication. I learned that there are many different tyoes of aliments out there. Management an co-workers were great an i am glad I had the pleasure of working with them. Hardest part of the job was the standing all day for me. All the people I got to meet.

good,"My typical day at work consists of a lot of duties like operating the cash register, expediting orders, as well as providing great customer service. I've learned that the customer is always right and no matter what the situation your in you should always smile. The managers were always helpful and making great role models for us co-workers. The co-workers were very friendly and easy to talk too. The hardest part of the job was to try to talk to people that didn't speak English so I use either pictures or hand signals and soon their orders were in. The most enjoyable part of the job was operating the cash register it was just too easy because once I've been taught a job I perform it successfully."
good,"Kroger was the best place I did work for out of all of my experience. I gave the best 10 years of my life to Kroger and I can say that it was never dull. The management was the most friendly that I have ever worked for. The hardest part of the job was going home. If I ever had the chance to work for them again in the deli, which is where I had all of my experience, I would do it again."
good,"I loved my time at the Kroger Company. This is a company that allows for advancement in both the management and hourly positions for those who are willing to work hard. You must be able to thrive on stress at this job, as there are frequent visits from high level executives and these visits make or break your ability to move up in the company."
good,"Always come into a busy working day, lots of things to be done before store closes."
good,"Meeting new people and helping customers,great friends hardest part of the job is working with people who are not self starters"

I was responsible for lane accountability, depositing large amounts of cash, balancing the cash office, assisting customers, assisting co-workers, working on a register, the manager on duty when my Customer Service Manager was gone and scheduling. Management was friendly, kind, and good people to talk with if you had a personal problem. My co-workers were friendly and courteous.

good,I enjoyed working for them but they closed all the locations in Arizona and I lost a lot of respect for them
good,"Kroger was my first job at 16 and through most of college. I worked there until 2010 and ended up putting 8 years in there. During my time there, I made alot of good friends, had very good leaders/managers at my superiors and generally enjoyed working there. The only problem is that the pay/advancement opportunities are very limited. Due to it being union, which I am not necessarily against, your pay is 100% scaled and nonnegotiable."
good,Learned a lot of customer service skills while working there. The hardest part was keeping up the pace with all the customers flooding in to get groceries. It was nice to work there. Great people!

The parent company decided to move the operation back to Cincinnatti and closed our local office."
good,"A typical day at work is the grocery store scene of people in a check-out line or at a customer service counter. I have learned that a well trained employee is a happy employee. Even if they need to be retrained because they were hired before new goals for the company were implimented. Management should be put in their positions not only because of their detailed management skills but also because of their ability to work with their employees. Many unfortunately are put into their positions because of the first and not their people skills. The hardest part of my job was to convince management to let me retrain existing employees before writing them up without them getting propper traning. But the General Manager listened to me and we succeeded and they are happy employees that succeeded. ""Our people make the difference"" is the front line people who are important to me and the business. My team knew this from my actions. The most enjoyable part of my job was to successfully train and see my team succede."
good,I work in the Deli and its like a up and down roller coaster ride and very fast pace but can be very fun .
good,"Come in at 8 am, set fresh seafood case, serve customers, stock frozen and fresh product. Day ends at 4pm."
good,"A typical work day for me would be decorating and making cakes as well as helping customers and making sure their needs are met. I learn how to be more patient being in a work environment. Being more patient with the customers especially,not every customer is the same. When there is a problem in my work place (bakery department) I know I can call whomever is in charge to take care of the situation I'm in. My co-workers are very dependable and we work as a team to give great customer service. The hardest part of my job is that sometimes it can be very hectic and very busy during the holidays,I've learned to work under pressure. The most enjoyable part of my job is of course making my customers happy when I present them a cake that they requested I make for them."
good,Energetic group of co-workers
good,"Fred Meyer Jewelers was my first position after graduating from college. I started as a sales person and quickly rose through the ranks to store manager. In the management position, I learned valuable lessons about the effectiveness of listening, and that it is more effective to be a leader rather than a boss. The hardest part of the position was the time away from my children while the most enjoyable part was leading the growth of those who worked for me. Helping others to succeed is as satisfactory to me as succeeding myself."
good,"Kroger was my first job. I was a young Courtesy Clerk/Cashier. Work was good, management was good, but personality wasn't there at all. There would always be an argument at work over something. I enjoyed it overall, but I wouldn't work there again."
good,"A fun, fast paced environment. I meet very interesting people on a daily basis. I'm writing a book about my life at Kroger titled: What We Know About You."

good,"Although everyday is basically the same, it is also different. I learned how to work in a fast pace work environment, manage my time, direct the work force and motivate my coworkers and employees. The hardest part of my job is that i work with a lot of teens, who tend to care more about a social life than the job. i love the interaction i get with customers and the trust i build with my coworkers."
good,Great work environment for people of all ages. you have to work really hard to get promoted.
good,I worked with an excellent pharmacist who taught me everything and this company offered training programs with raises for completing them.This was were I also learned the importance of building a trusting and friendly relationship with patients. I also became experienced with insurance and billing. The fax machine was introduced and made contacting doctors for refill requests efficient.

good,Typical day at work contains me getting my supplies that i need to complete the task at hand.
good,Kroger was a great place to work for overall. Customer and co-workers were always so friendly. Learned so many new things a lot of people do not get to experience. My mom has worked for the same company for 20 years or more so it was great to learn and work with her on occasion.
good,I like working there because i enjoy working with people. However some times the management doesn't schedul people properly.
good,"Kroger was a good place to work, the management was kind and fair and there was a fun work environment. The greatest critique I have is that I was in a department where I primarily worked alone, and I would have loved to connect with people more."
good,Enjoyed working there. Busy at times but coworkers were there to help.
good,"i worked there for year, and it is great place to work and the management are very friendly."
good,Hard work starting at 5a.m. and working until 5p.m. but you get 4 breaks including a 30 min. lunch. The pay is good but you have to have discipline to work there.
good,Everyday I was doing something different working close with my supervisors.

good,Its a great job for those with a social life. If you work hard you get rewarded for it.
good,"Responsibilities included cashier, freight receiving clerk, stocking shelves, facing shelves keeping floors and shopping areas clean and neat. Management was very good about explaining work duties and following thru. Good benefits and profit sharing"
good,Learn a little about helpdesk.
good,I worked at Kroger since I was in high school and was very flexible with me allowing be to keep my job when I came home from college.

Dealing with the public is always have their ups and down.
good,Great place to gain retail experience! Busy fast paste environment.
good,"The place was rugged and the work was hard. but overall i didnt mind because the time went by so fast during the day, anyone hardly even noticed. Pay was Great and Management was hardly seen."
good,Kroger has very friendly associates and they are always coming up with better ways to better serve there customers.

good,"This job was the first job I had. I worked there for about three years since the age of 17. It was a good first job, but in no means a permanent first job. It gave me skills to work with people ranging from compliant to difficult."
good,It is a great place to work and i love all the people that i work with. I really like my job but they are just not coming through with things i have been promised and i believe its time for me to move on.
good,The Kroger company offers good benefits. Management is fair and respectable to employees. I never had a problem balancing work with my personal life. They are flexible for the most part with their employees schedules.
good,"working for Kroger was a good experience for me because working for them was different the pay was sub-par, the management was very difficult to deal with."
good,I enjoyed working there because of my co-workers and management's commitment to helping all employees.
good,"We were always given a task to do to keep each and every employee busy. If the task was never done right the first time you were to do it again. Kroger is a very financial and stable employer, they take care of what the customer needs before they walk out of the double doors. Kroger also has a great shrink system. They do the best they can to keep the company safe!"
good,Good place to work at for High School and College Student looking to gain some experience while maintaining a balanced work and social life
good,"It was definitely an enjoyable experience. I would go back there to manage the store , but I have interest in pursuing my career in other areas."
good,"Kroger is a good place to work, they pay a compatible rate and always put the customer first. They offer plenty of opportunities to grow and get promotions."
good,Management is fair. People are nice. Big stores to walk around. Lots of work to do. There's a job for everyone. They are now hiring assistant managers.
good,"Kroger has great opportunity if you are wanting to pursue retail. I've worked for other retail giants, but Kroger really did a good job of creating a good working atmosphere. I only left because I was offered a position somewhere else for a substantial pay raise."
good,We were told on making sure everything was always fresh and friendly throughout the store and staff. The donated to areas in need which is nice to see. Managment was helpful when in need in the areas of the store.
good,I loved my job at the gas hut . I love working with the community.  My fulltime nursing job was over whelming at times and I had to quit the gas hut could not fulfill my hours.
good,"I understand how to work and operate back room machines such as forklift, manual pallet jacks, scissor lift and also learned how to stack merchandise for customers."
good,"Ever since 2017-2018, Kroger has helped me set my work experience for the work force. The managers were always happy and cheerful about us and their job, they wanted us to succeed, and their hours were mostly flexible. The work environment was very clean and organized, but the pay was fair. Overall, Kroger was a very nice job."
good,Kroger is a solid company to work for despite management at stores.   Store management including Department heads need better training in people skills.   There should be an adult work environment.
good,"Great bosses, a real sense of great leadership and team building. Even though it was a professional environment I consider them part of my family. It was a great learning experience to get me to where I'm at now."
good,The people here make me happy to work. It’s a nice store full of great experiences. I just wish I can get a little more money for working at a part time job
good,I loved all the people there. The pays wasn’t what I would like but it was a good trade off to all the good things that Kroger brings to the table. Other than that I have nothing bad to say about Kroger.
good,I love my job and the people I work with but my work does not have enough hours for me to work. If I could work part time in another location while keeping this job that would be ideal.
good,Cant say I was disappointed with the job overall. Really enjoyed my coworkers. The work was straightforward for stocking shelves. Pay was fair. I was part time and worked there right out of college. Not a bad job. Left for a position with better pay at another company.
good,Working at Kroger has evolved my skill set in a variety of ways. Kroger has allowed me to build strong partnerships with co-workers and customers. I have gained hands on knowledge of point of sale systems and how to handle problems quickly and effectively.
good,"I've been working here for a little over two years now and its been great so far. I moved around the store, then moved up pretty quick on the front end."
good,This is the North College Hill Kroger and I enjoyed the time I worked there part time as a customer service rep I enjoyed meeting new people I enjoyed the workers as well
good,I enjoyed working here for the most part but like everywhere there are people who make your job hard  that being said it was a good company to work for
good,"Management is good, but the work hours were inconvenient and the store is horribly understaffed. The job environment is good but could get a lot better with simple fixes."
good,"Not every Kroger is the same, but I enjoyed my time at my location on the south side of Indianapolis. There is some room for advancement, and there's various departments to apply oneself to."
good,"This was my first job when I was old enough to work, I enjoyed working here while I was in High School, it was good to meet all different kinds of people and get to know all of the coworkers."

good,Great work environment friendly staff and customers good pay and benefits lots of opportunities to move up lots of different stores and positions in this company
good,"Kroger technology is a nice place to work on most days. It's a very large company so naturally the processes involved in getting things done are complex. This and the sheer size of their solutions can provide years of challenging work. "
good,It’s Ight the hours are decent the place stay clean I learned that they will fire you for a stupid reason the hardest part was dealing with some of the managers the most enjoyable part were breaks
good,I do my job the way I am instructed to and follow company policy.  I leave just down the street and have reliable transportation to work.  I am hard working and the job was not to hard to learn or do.  I enjoyed my job and the company I worked for.
good,"As a front end clerk I mainly bagged groceries  and pushed carts in from outside. I rarely  did cashier  because I was not really that good at it. Management  I have to say was great, if you needed help they would gladly help you."
good,Kroger is an excellent work environment. The customers and work were the best parts of my job. Managers always made employees feel like family. The hardest part of working at Kroger are the employees.
good,Always busy.  Learned to organize my time. Workplace is good. Lifting in the dairy dept. The day goes by quickly. Managers are very respectful and willing to work with employees.
good,"a typical day for a courtesy clerk is bagging, cleaning up spills, retrieving items for customers, pushing carts, and doing sweeps. it’s a pretty easy job."
good,"This is a miss tagged survey, I have never worked for Kroger stores. I did like shopping there when we had one... filler, filler, filler, filler, filler, filler, filler,"
good,Working for kroger was one of the greatest employment opportunities i could ask for everyone was friendly helpful and overall a joy to be around there were days but everyones has bad days right
good,"I was fired in December 2019, rehired in January 2020. Great union. Great  place to work. People are friendly. Coworkers are cool. Overall, a pretty cool place to work."
good,"had a great time working at Kroger. enjoyed helping guest was uplifting. enjoyed my job. sorry it was just part time, really needed more. got to meet a lot of great people to work with."
good,"A enjoyable place to learn new skills, not much of an incentive to go above and beyond due to strict pay rates, the job is based upon time put in rather than experience/effectiveness which is frustrating."
good,"While the work load was easily completed given each employee completed their tasks, the work schedule wasn't set in advance. Through this experience, I learned a lot more about how to deal with customers and where I excel the most."
good,For the short time i was there co workers and a couple of managers helped me with things i had trouble with and better understand my job duties. Which is was a major plus
good,Working for Kroger is a lot of fun I get to meet a lot of people daily I’ve made a lot of friends with all the customers would love to have moved up within my position
good,"Fill prescription orders, submit and adjudicate insurance claims, dispense medication, manage drug inventory. Detail-oriented work with fast pace and high volume."
good,"the location of the store is actually extremely beneficial to the customers and the company, which I thought was pretty hard to find now a days, especially for what kind of store this is. also, great gas prices. only downside was the lot was kind of small for the amount of business they get."
good,"Everyone at Kroger is very friendly and the managers always support and lead you in the right direction. The work hours work out with my schedule at home, they always allow me to make it felixaeble."
good,It’s hard to get days off standing all days only get a 30minute lunch break mangers are nice sundays are hectic lines are very long but overall a good place to work
good,"Good place if this  is what you choose to have as career. It was a good learning experiences during training as well."
good,it was the best job i had so far. there were a few problems but all very small and easily fixable. worked very well with my school schedule. very good place to work.
good,Company is too big for any sort of meaningful recognition/advancement.  But the organization is great and its mission and values are things you can really get behind.
good,Would work here again if needed. Liked the atmosphere and the people. Moved out of the area so couldn't stay working here. Would recommend it to others.
good,"This is good job for high school students. The minimum age to work there is 15 I believe. Not the greatest pay, but the labor isn’t too bad. So it makes sense."
good,"As a courtesy clerk, I was motivated to exude quality customer service while maintaining an efficient pace in my duties. My time in this position has taught me the importance of customer service and the work ethic to be open-minded to new ideas that improve my ability to work efficiently."
good,"Never really had a problem with Kroger other than the fact they would not give me time off when I needed it. Everyone’s super nice to work with, if you needed a day off they most likely would have given it to you. Not an awful place to work"
good,"I liked the job, maybe if they weren’t super stricted on showing up. I had problems with work and sports. I learned how to be friendly with customers."
good,Work days are fast busy .. Dont judge someone you dont know ... Management is very helpful and friendly help out when needed.. A mad costumer or when someone call off...
good,"Here I was expecting from a ton of reviews that management is bad at the store. Appearently, the one store that I got accepted in, the management team isn't that bad and has always treated me fairly. All the store managements are good and the front end dep. managers are alright besides one front end manager that is an oddball and not like the others that do manage the front end and stays up near the service desk & cashier lanes."
good,Working there was exciting at first because it was my first job but after awhile I began to feel underpaid for all the work I was doing and once I was finally promoted the work was just so tedious and repetitive
good,"The way schedules were picked was fairly archaic at the location I worked, but management was always willing to talk if there was an issue. I would have stayed if not for medical reasons."
good,"Kroger is very well known, this store was not the best location but it had many good items. Many rude people but there are rude people everywhere. Managers are respectful for the most part"
good,As a high school kid Kroger worked great with my schedule. Also anyone young is excited to start a job and begin making money. Now starting at $10 an hour I believe it to be one of the best options out there.
good,"If i were to describe the job in one word it would be fast. We sometimes never get a break because of how busy we are, and other days we’re so slow that we get sent home early"
good,"A typical day at work - dispensing prescriptions"
good,Good place to work.. the Kroger company was good to me.. feed the human spirit is their  company mission and what they saw what all about. Learn their history and do well in interview.
good,"Kroger is a good place to work for those who enjoy working in a climate controlled environment, but not confined to a cubical or office. There are also opportunities to advance to management level in a short time."
good,during a work day there were always reports to run in a timely manner.  Working with Buyers there was always trucks to be tracked to determine if they were going to make it on time to get fresh products out to the stores.  Making sure all fresh stock was available for Kroger customer was a high priority for all associates.  Working with the team was great experience.
good,The store is pretty good it’s just that the managers don’t communicate as well like if one manager tells you something the other managers won’t know what you’re doing until you tell them
good,"work many hours, got to meet lots of new people, working outside pushing carts for hours was probably the hardest thing for me. A typical day for me was chilling outside getting carts."
good,"This job is a fast-paced and stressful job, but it allows you to think and react quickly as well as sharpen your management skills. This job gives you the opportunity to learn how to work with a wide variety of people. The benefits are fantastic, but the work-life balance can be a struggle at times."
good,Kroger is good like management & discounts. As in getting hours that you want can be little difficult depends on if u full time or part time. 👍🏾👍🏾 But the will always work with you.
good,"This job was a learning that showed me how to be a team player."
good,I enjoyed my time working for the Kroger company. I worked at the frys branch in Arizona and had a good experience there learning how to communicate with costumers.
good,"it was fun I had a lot of friends there the mangers were nice and very caring , its always busy up there so your always doing something. the environment was on one hundred."
good,"Kroger Grocery was fast-paced and could be very stressful at times. However, it’s a great way for young adults to gain experience with working with the public and other people skills."
good,Good place to work very friendly and very open have a great staff very clean friendly and good place to shop amd wonderful. Shopping is good and prices are fair
good,"I was mostly put as a cashier. All jobs i new more than 2 positions. So wherever i was needed, that is where i was put. The store had a few hours where it was fast paced. But other than that it was all relaxing."
good,Kroger is a great place for young adults or people in between jobs. they have good standards and flexible hours. if they paid more i would have worked there longer
good,"I would say the hardest thing I went through at this job was having to work by myself in customer service on Fridays because the line would seem like it would ever go down, plus my breaks were always late."
good,Everything was great besides me not getting hours. The discount was great. It was fast paced and I got paid $11.25.  It would be a great job for a high school or college student.
good,Kroger has been a great company to work for. I have gained so much knowledge over the years any multiple positions. Customer service has always been number one .
good,"I think Kroger isn’t a bad job just need new management, you need to be on time and work hard before you come to work. Always be on your tip top shape, keep your mind roaming and don’t doze off but it’s a well decent job."
good,I really cant think of a much better job to start out with to learn how you are expected to act in a work environment. though occasionally I would feel a little overworked but that was more due to me having a completely open schedule so they would put me in some weird shift combinations like working until 11pm then coming back in at 8:30am
good,"My job was to assist the customers, appreciate the customers, and acknowledge the customers. I would also return the grocery carts back the store from outside."
good,"Part time pay is not competitive. Work your way up to full time status and the health insurance is worth it, plus 401k options along with dental and vision. Upper management opportunities are available if you plan to make more money and advance up the corporate ladder."
good,"The place was a great place to work everyone was helpful, and nice. Management was not the best they have people as managers who does help or does they job. and will have you work hard fo no help."
good,its a good place to just to have a job. I needed a job during school and Kroger was accommodating with hours that would allow me to also to be able to go to classes.
good,"Management is great, friendly co- workers, flexible schedule, you get the job benefits(insurance)after working there for a year. Holidays can be overwhelming but than a great job."
good,Kroger's is a great place to work but it can be stressful at times. There is room for upward mobility but you must ready when the time comes. Stress levels and high turnover rates all depends upon management.
good,Fast paced but felt honored to  work with the manager that I did. Everyone I worked with was wonderful. I will miss them. I enjoyed the everyday structure and excellence of the store that I worked at.
good,I enjoyed working here because it was a nice place to work thanks to the well-managed team and my co-workers. I would 100% recommend working here in the long run too because of the pay they give and the benefits.
good,"A place where everyone helps when and where possible. "
good,It was a good job that I enjoyed. I liked the workers around me and the managers were nice. I wish I could’ve got more hours but never did. I quit because I was trying to enjoy my summer
good,Good place have worked here for ages they do promote writhing. They are union passed but they should work more on paying the pharmacy what they deserve
good,Its not the best place to work but its a good place to work. You get a break every 2-3 hours. It was stressful at times because some workers like to take longer breaks than they should.
good,"Face paced and busy at store in Spring, Tx. made hours go fast.  Enjoyed co-workers and made good friends with customers with my friendly service.  Most managers were helpful and  consider my needs.  Majority of regular customers were very enjoyable and came through my lane when I was working just to because they liked my friendly service and to talk to me.  Tried hard to be as helpful as I could, if there was a problem did need help from my front end manager which were very helpful in solving the problem.  Do admit some days and time did get stressful but that just came with the job and times.  Overall was pleasant to work and that I did enjoy the people. Was turn over on Management several times in the time period I worked there.  Turn over quite a bit on cashiers and other workers.  Had hard time keeping up with names of workers.  Did like many of the front end managers I worked under they were very helpful and over all respectful to my needs.  Would like to work for Kroger again now that I have moved to Rifle, Colorado and have submitted applications online for cashier at City Marked hear in Rifle and other positions gone to job fair one Saturday had good interview with lady but was told if had opening hiring manager would call,  I have never heard anything still get alerts through Indeed of positions even cashier and I apply.  Hopefully something will come up. Understand is small town and not a lot of positions open but just keep trying."
good,"A fast pace job,  I learned a lot from working here.good management.  Learned how to managed a department. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the customers."
good,"The compensation at Kroger Pharmacy is a little less compared to other big name pharmacies, but the work environment is much better. There is also more help in terms of number of coworkers."
good,"I recommend this job for men because of the cart pushing and being in the heat. It’s a good job that pays well and pays every week , the hours are flexible and time off is good too."
good,It was a positive work environment but management needed to change . At one point the manager would nit pick on your a/r accounts wanted them done her way vs they it should have been handled.
good,"fast pace environment,customer service driven, team concept between departments,management works with associates on time off needed for personal family issues"
good,While working at Kroger I enjoyed the atmosphere and work environment. I learned about customer service and working to not only meet the customers needs but the companies as well
good,"I worked for Kroger for just a little over 5 years. Met a lot of great, interesting, caring people during that time. Any young person looking to start somewhere, this is a good place to start."
good,kroger is good company to work at. They have very competitive benefits and opportunity for growth. The company takes care of their employee pretty reasonably.
good,Great environment to work in.  Very pleasant surroundings. People seem friendly and seem to work together well.  The store is very neat and clean and always looks well cared for.I would start my shift by checking to make sure everything was displayed properly.  The hardest part is that we were under staffed.  I learned how to cut meat.  T managers were always understanding and would listen.
good,"Management at my store was nice, no problems with any managers.  The hardest part of the job was trying to make everyone happy, I usually follow an 80/20 rule.  You can please most people, but there will always be a few.  The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to some of the customers, some of them were honestly cool to talk to."
good,Ralphs is a good job for any individual that needs flexibility and does well with face to face conversation with customers. The managers are understanding of outside the job demands
good,"I was hired on as a grocery clerk and worked up to Operations Manager within 4 years. Hard work and a desire to learn and take on more is rewarded, but the every day challenges of retail still exist in the company as well. Productivity is key as well as following processes, the company will equip individuals willing to put in the work for success."
good,"Overall nice environment to work. Pending on area of work at the pharmacy, have to meet quota a day. Paid holidays, paid time off, insurance coverage on first day of work."
good,Great Employer. Was willing to work around my school and soccer schedule.  Was fun and upbeat. A great first job experience and an well rounded learning experience.
good,Great stepping stone to get your feet wet and get some job experience. Opportunities to grow and achieve a lot with the company but also unpredictable and hard to get things accomplished do to unorganized management and higher up.
good,The pay is not that great. You deal with alot of customers daily. Sometimes they are short staffed so it's like you're doing the job of two people. You see alot of the same customers so you kinda get to know them.
good,"Traveling from distant residence was unfortunately a not so profitable decision from “personal” opinion for my “personal”  family or Kroger. However, Kroger was excellent to work with regards to all aspects of the company."
good,Caring for the Customers with hardly any downtime i have learn how to work as a team and to deal with difficult Customers.  The management was very helpful for backing up the employees and cared about there job and the culture of Kroger none of individual jobs were hard but all together can get challenging but with the team work i have experience there made even the hardest job seem easy.
good,Safe and productive workplace with opportunities to change departments in a teamlike setting dealing with people on a daily face to face basis and great benefits.
good,"Working retails is very busy and you have an opportunity to work with individuals from all economic status, to different ethic folks from all over the world."
good,"Throughout working with the Kroger Industry, I overall feel the work experience is a positive environment. The only feed back I would give to help assure that some issues are taken care of would be, reduce the amount of paperwork that is done through out the work day."
good,"The job schedule seemed very random but here I enjoyed the atmosphere, & energy. Opening the store was slow but mid days was higher paced, & nights a bit soothing but I learned many skills here for I was a UC( universal clerk), a cashier, Dairy worker, & Grocery clerk. but I may not have received all my benefits for the fact I was terminated before for a misunderstanding of my schedule being confused it was taken as a no call no show but everyone loved me here & my work performance to I always got back in easy because they seen me as a great member of the team for my fast pace of go back carts, 1+2( cashiers, & customer service skills), training & helping other employees, relationships with customers, etc. Besides that the hardest part to me was probably collecting carts in the snow, or doin go back carts that only had small miscellaneous items when I was a UC, & the most enjoyable was being a cashier interacting with customers & helping out the best that I can."
good,"Job was good, hourly rate, also amount of per week 28-32 better. When rainy not real fond being outside especially others wouldn't go to lot. These issues least enjoyable. But other opportunitie arose"
good,I really enjoyed my time working at Krogers. Staff was very nice and liked helping customers. I enjoyed being a team leader and everything ran smoothly.
good,"On a typical work day, I would get to work and immediately start bagging groceries. After around two hours I would be sent out front  for about one hour to collect shopping carts from the parking lot and bring them inside. After my hour is up, I would go back inside and bag more groceries for the rest of my shift."
good,"I had a day of someone (who didn't talk much and just stood there) walking with me and then after that I was on my own. I didn't get much explanation of all of my job duties. I was expected to know things in the department, even though I never was told or got the chance to do web based learning before actually taking on the role. I was thrown straight into the Lion's Den."
good,I really enjoyed my time at Kroger I felt I was paid fairly and the management was very respectful if not a little overbearing. There was definitely a path to advancement through the company that you can take if you want a career.
good,I love working at kroger its a fun place to work they give good advice gelp workers move up in the company the give goos healthcare and good working in
good,Am happy with my current position with Kroger but the lack of spousal medical coverage could cause me to consider other employment. They provided it originally but sropped it with the passing of Obamacare
good,A typical day at Kroger on the front end is very fast paced and can be very stressful. All cashiers and baggers are to be pleasant and friendly. Each day we must meet standards in goals the company sets. A lot of paperwork eac day. A lot of stress
good,"Management changes store to store. I was lucky to have four wonderful and caring managers in my last few years here. Customers do feel entitled and will not hesitate to yell, mock or even belittle you. Pay wasn't the best but we did receive really nice discounts in the store and products from other companies as well. I loved working with all of my co-workers and it really did feel like family."
good,"At the time I was working for Pick N Save I was in school. They were great with my school schedule flexible. This was one of my first jobs, it taught me a lot of responsibility."
good,"Job is interesting and challenging.   However, customers can be extremely rude.  Management will let customers tear into you for a bit before coming to your aid."
good,"Kroger is a nice company to work for. After one year of employment you gain a weeks vacation. They give you money for going to school, you can get all kinds of discounts savings from your phone bill, movie tickets and so on."
good,"Ok company advancement is low scale growth"
good,Kroger is a great palce to work but im looking for a full time and they don have any full time position for me now. That is way I am looking to get another job.
good,"Alright job, didnt like management, didnt appreciate the ""senoirity only"" approach to pay, would have liked to have been payed for the contriubtuions put in as opposed to being payed for how long ive worked there."
good,Good place to work with several opportunities for growth and flexible hours. Staff is friendly and easy to work with. Management is available for concerns.
good,"It's Fast Pace you always need to be on your toes,  the customers are amazing. Lots of nights lots of weekends always have to work the holidays your schedule is constantly changing... and I just want something more consistent...."
good,Great company great training great management possible advancement great customer service  will work with your school schedule if you let management know at the interview. Great 1st job
good,Kroger is a great company and is very flexible with your schedules. Kroger is a great job for teens and young people. The benefits are also really nice.
good,it was fun and interesting it was hard but it was worth it because they recognize the effort put in and will help you move up accordingly i love working here
good,Learning how to do just about everything how to cut and clean the meat taking care of the customers great experience for anyone who likes customers !!!!!!!!!!!!!;;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
good,"While the pace is laid back mostly, the pay was far too low. And vacation does not kick in til way later. Further Kroger is a union company built on the concept that seniority rules over skillset."
good,overall korger is a great part time job if you have school or something else going on it is a great way to learn more about custumer service and to be part of a team
good,"I have learned to enjoy working at Kroger. If you smile and take a sincere interest in each customer, it will make your job a lot more enjoyable. Most of the managers are very likable and understanding."
good,Kroger is a good-paying job for a young person that's trying to help their parents out with bills or that's trying to get a job skill on a resume you need to help you learn about a whole bunch of new stuff you ain't never learned before how to respect customer customer service how to stack and pack everything at the right place you put it in the right place
good,I worked graveyard shift so it was easy-going for the most part. Very friendly co-workers and management was very considerate of their employees and their needs.
good,"Kroger is a good place to work, most people are friendly like a family,  only downside is that, they will not pay good enough for a hard work you do or hardly for you to get the full time 40 hours a week."
good,The Kroger in Dawsonville is a great place to work. The people you will meet are friendly and give you a strong sense of teamwork. I highly recommend working here.
good,"It was a great store to work for. Employees and customers were nice. Opportunity to advancement is there if you desire it or you can stay in your current position. The Company is continuing working on updates with departments, including technology and safety. All stores has a great selections of products"
good,This job is great for someone looking for their first job. They offer many advancement opportunities and often hire internally. The benefits are one of the best for a company their size.
good,"Kroger was a pretty good place to work at as long as you did what you were suppose to do. I would come in and do my job, then clock out and go by my day. "
good,I spent a total of 4 and a half years with the Kroger company and was never completely satisfied. At the morgantown Kroger I was doing 2-3 other peoples work to make up for their lack of work but there were no disciplinary actions taken against them.
good,Kroger is a very fun and productive job. It has taught me good time management and good work ethic. The only thing the job lacks is hours and decent pay.
good,"Great benefits, startup culture. Lots of fun activities. Leaders have vision. Promotes innovation. Cautious of becoming more like kroger instead of influencing kroger culture. Cut the lot of middle management. promote more technical leaders."
good,I loved this job just need to pay more but easy enrollment process easy to move up if you do the work very very great staff. Wasn’t a difficult job to do
good,I worked in the meat/seafood department was it easy department to work and not hard and stressful I set it up the seafood in the meat department counters
good,"Managed 8 employees at King Soopers in Aurora Colorado. Ensured all merchandise was made and displayed, loss prevention, scheduling, baking, decorating."
good,"My review for Kroger is great. Great store, great people, great experience working there the last couple of months. Our daily costumers are great, and very nice people as well."
good,"I love working here. Most of my co-workers are a dream. Managers care and ask you how you’re doing on the daily. Good work. Nice If you’re in high school and don’t have to pay rent or any sort of bills. Lacking in amount of hours they give you. I am currently working an average of 16-18 hours a week at minimum wage and I am barely living right now. I asked for more hours and I was told no. I think they only way I’d get more hours is if I asked for a different position. But even then, that might not be enough."
good,Overall good company. Current division leadership micro manage everything and make the job extremely stressful. Makes being a leader in the store very difficult.
good,"Workplace culture is fun, and fast pace. Nice employees work together as a team. Initiate and complete sections process for customers' on-line orders."
good,"This was my first job I got while I was in high school. It taught me how to speak and help people, work the front (cashier) stock groceries and bag people's items. There was always something to do, especially evenings. I loved how Kroger really is very family and school oriented so they'll understand if something comes up."
good,"It was my first job and i enjoyed working there, the managers weren't over bearing and as long as you did your job well they did not nit-pick you very much."
good,"Good work environment, nice  associates an great management , busy holiday weekend , busy days are often. Benefits are good too. Hardest part of the job is wen it slows down and u already have everything done"
good,"The people were friendly and helpful, the place was clean and they tent to keep it like that. Moving up in the company is good it has a great opportunity to grow!"
good,"making sure customer service was all ways their"
good,"I learned that if you want something you have to work hard for it."
good,"Kriger is a great company. Advancement up to th ghe position of department manager is attainable to anyone who strives for it. The down side is to advance beyond that,  you have to resign and rehire into the company losing all seniority and accrued benefits."
good,"Working at Kroger was an amazing experience. From the people you met to those you worked with, it was a positive experience. Besides the scorching heat of the day work with cart pushing and peak rush hour, it is generally a non-stressful work environment!"
good,"I haven't worked for this company in over twenty years, so I can't say anything about the current management, benefits, or culture of the company.  Unfortunately all info I have is too dated."
good,It was fast pase work place and it was always keep you doing something to keep yourself busy. The management is flexible with work days and understand if you need to take a sick day. I learned how to talk to customers with their questions and enjoy working at Fry's Food and Drugs. The people are always friendly.
good,"I loved my time there at Pick n' Save but it was difficult because I had to balance schooling while working 5 days a week and moving at the time. Typical work days varied, they were either slow paced or extremely hectic especially around holiday seasons. I learned how to work with different kinds of people and met amazing customers along the way. Like I said, the hardest part of it was balancing my school life, personal life, and my work and it got over cumbersome at some points but I stayed with it till the end. Would recommend honestly to any high schoolers or anyone looking for a part-time or full time job but it is not enough to make a living off of unless you are like the manager or higher-up's in the company itself."
good,"Typical day is to stock cases, clean department & prepare for business."
good,I would love coming into work and getting on the register and checking people out. While I was there some of the customers loved coming to my line I would talk to them while getting them out quickly and proficiently.
good,Assigned all technology incidents for about 550 employees in an accounting center.  Resolved numerous tech issues myself.  Enjoyed the challenge and the fact that Kroger treated its employees with respect and valued them.
good,The pace is in some areas but once you settle in it becomes second nature everyday of the week .Management is hands on  so they help you with tasks throughout the day
good,There never is a dull moment always had something to do even when we were not too busy. Could always get time off when requested. Great benefits and pay
good,I been with the company for 12 years and have worked my way up from a cashier to department manger. If you don’t mind customer service and actually doing work you will like the job.
good,"Kroger is a fast paced store. Between stocking, helping customers you a;ways have something to do. Hours are flexible and its pretty easy to get days off."
good,Kroger is definitely equal opportunity worked 9 yrs for Kroger and did many different things there enjoyed my time there but I decided a change for me was needed
good,"A typical day for me at Kroger was clocking in usually as soon as I got there despite being early due to the lack of workers. Once I was put on a register, I would usually be there for my entire shift and delayed breaks depending on who else is working. Some times the front end manager would have me go outside and gather carts. From this job, I have learned how to better work with customers even when  I am seen as less than them. I really bonded with my coworkers. I usually saw them everyday because when I was not working, I would be shopping."
good,"Good place to work at, good employees and the work atmosphere is fun. costumers can be a pain at times but overall its a great place to be with lots of fun"
good,"I worked for Fry's (aka Kroger store) for almost a year and had a fantastic time. Everyone I worked with, the associates, were all wonderful and unique people. Everyone helped one another when they could, everyone worked together. Sort of like a family. The only major negative I experienced was feeling like the black sheep to management. I did my normal duties and then some, but management always made me feel like it was never enough. They always assumed you could handle the whole world on your shoulders. If my department was lacking staff assistance (which is did all the time) they would ignore coming back to help. They will literally help any other department except for mine and the ones near it. They don't tell you when you've done something wrong, they just write you up. Rather than doing 1-on-1 verbal punishment, they'd have up to 5 managers in a room, when you'd only need 2 (one writing you up, the other as a witness for paperwork). Not only did this happen to me, but several of my coworkers. They have a select-schedule, where you choose your hours based off seniority. Managers are not allowed to change your schedule UNLESS they have asked you, which they never did. They'd assume you would take and get angry if you try and oppose of it, even if you found a solid replacement to work said hours. If you want to transfer stores, they lie and give false hopes of ""yes you can leave, BUT once we find a replacement for you,"" which is not okay. I do understand, but it shouldn't take 6 months to find a replacement, especially if you put your two weeks in and they find a replacement"
good,When I get to work I would count my drawer and get right to work I love to work here because my co worker's were very out going like me i like to have fun at work and like to make my customer's laugh that was my goal. my co workers were all different ages and there was really nothing hard about my job i like because when i got to work I knew exactly what I needed to do with out anyone telling me anything what i really miss about this job is my customer's the bond we build with one another.
good,"Kroger is a nice place to work, pharmacy specifically is extremely demanding with not a lot of staffing.  Overall though I am happy with the position, compensation, benefits package, and people I work with"
good,"I liked working as a clicklist associate, the supervisors were great and everyone was super nice. It was hard though because that is a rather physical job and I have a lot of joint problems. But I liked the people I worked with and the quick pace, it kind of felt like a game trying to find all the items in an order as fast as possible, which made the hours fly by. The supervisor did forget to send people on break though and we would have to ask about it, which was a little awkward."
good,"I cook food for the bistro, chicken, and five side dishes, I get to choose what to serve besides mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese. The hardest part is learning all that needs to be done. The most enjoyable is dealing with customers."
good,I meet a lot of friendly people while at Kroger. The workplace had a nice environment. My co workers made work fill like family.. I really enjoyed my time at Kroger.
good,Overall thouroughly enjoyed my time working here and hope nothing but the best for this company. They helped me while I was in college and were a great company to help get me on my feet.
good,"Kroger has been good to my family in a number of ways, but they do need to acknowledge their dedicated reliable long time employees. Need better benefits for them."
good,The best part about the job when i was working there was that yoy are paid weekly. Hours were ok they adjusted for me because i was in school at the time.
good,I worked between the cash registered and customer service desk.  Career advancement opportunities are available for those who strive toward the organizations mission and values.  The hardest part of the job was the not set schedule.  But loved the atmosphere and other employees. Working for Kroger chain was a learning experience.
good,Kroger is a good place to work. good people. Some management harder to deal with. Stress level can be tough to deal with for some. A Union company...not so good.
good,On any day at work i'm always on my feet 95% of my shift. The job is fast paced and very interactive. You deal with lots of customers needing different types of assistance from you. While working there i learned different ways to communicate with others.. I learned  how to adapt to different situations. In my place of work the management is very respectful and nice to its employees. They are very considerate of their employees and want to accommodate its employees. In the place where i was employed it was very diverse. I was able to learn about different cultures and learn about peoples upbringing through the conversations that I've had with people that I've encountered.The hardest part about working their was remembering the codes for different fruits and vegetables because its a lot to remember. The best part about working their was enjoying my coworkers and interacting with different customers. Its very nice and interesting getting to know new people and getting to know about their life.
good,Over the years the working environment at Kroger Co. has taught me the importance of hard work and giving your best effort. Such a mindset creates path for you to succeed and gain attention and praise from those you work for and work with.
good,I learned so much from working at ralphs they helped me with anything i needed outside of work. Management was always something that i never had to worry about.
good,This was my first job every and I really enjoyed it. I had no interest in leaving but McDonald’s offered me better pay so I did. If I could go back I would’ve done differently. The job taught me a lot about being kind and gave great customer service skills.
good,Krogers had great pay and good benefits. The managers were professional . The company was a safe environment to work at. The scheduling was very flexible.
good,"Very fast-paced work environment that teaches multitasking, customer service, interpersonal interactions, communications, EPRN software usage, and MTM experience for interns"
good,"I can do four jobs in the store: cashier, date-coder/ mark downs, click-list, and diary. Management loves to see someone cross train. My co-workers are nice and helpful. If you are a people watcher like I am, you do see patterns how people shop and pick items."
good,Working for Kroger has been interesting. Kroger is a good place for advancement. Kroger offers great employee benefits and incentives for working for this establishment.
good,"great place to work, would go back to work there again.  competitive work environment, great coworkers, plenty of opportunity to move up and always overtime is available."
good,"Enjoyed my position there. However they closed my position and was asked to leave as result,. Was not allowed to expand my horizons at all beyond the greetion position."
good,Great starter job for someone that is looking to start their career. This is a great opportunity for young adults looking to start their career. Great managers.
good,"Employees look to help out new hires become better workers. Showing the younger guys the tricks of the trade benefit the group as a whole. The hardest part is working alone when things occur that are out of your control or preparedness, but they develop your mental toughness and customer service skills."
good,It was great working here at Kroger. A typical day at the company was busy and productive which made it easier to the work done. working with Kroger gave me the opportunity to meet people from different cultures and I really appreciated that
good,"Kroger is a collaborative and highly motivated workplace. They strive for excellence, and are adamant about group cohesion among employees. I very much enjoyed my time working for Kroger."
good,"The job was great and all of the employees worked well together to get the job done. The environment was good as well, there is always room for improvement and great advancement opportunities."
good,"There is no such thing as easy or hard when I hear the word work. And for Kroger you have to remember, we all shop and we all eat . So, driving to your nearest neighborhood Kroger is a trip. Because you don't know what's in stock (pun intended) for dinner or for a late snack. But, surely you can count on Kroger because they stay open until 1 a.m. Not all. Working here has most def taught me a lot about the work field and from there on I hope to expand my horizons to better myself."
good,Loved working for the company. The people and the customers were amazing. We were like a family and worked as a team all the time. Even the mangers helped out when needed to also.
good,Kroger was a good place to work it was competitive with a lot of other grocery stores it paid a lot more money per hour and there were a lot of hours to be worked.
good,Great place to work. I enjoyed the environment. This location was really well organized and the benefits were great. Management was great! Love the bakery and the staff.
good,I have been with the company 23 years I have learn many things. The mangament staff is always willing help you improve on your job skills. Kroger is a very diverse company to work for.
good,"Workplace culture is fast-paced and it includes you to have a lot of interaction with customers at all levels. "
good,"Great company , good people , a family type atmosphere among employees. My only complaint is that they shut down the kroger in my state. Leaving me and a lot of people looking for new employment."
good,"The coworkers who I worked with are great and they help me with anything I had a question about.  The workplace was fun to be at at times and the customers that show up have great hospitality which was great, because it matched my energy well."
good,"I liked the job when I started then they started to play with my hours. The management was fine. I get along good working with others, I just didn’t like being a courtersy clerk."
good,"Daily work orders addressed. Equipment issues addressed through preventative maintenance, and an as needed repair. Fast work environment , would recommend anyone to work there."
good,i learned how to work with the public and how to handle money. a typical day at work was sometimes slow but faster as the day went on. the staff and management was nice
good,"was a good place to work, I started off as a bagger and quickly worked my way up to newer and higher payed positions. but I don't think that I was paid enough for the amount of work I did"
good,"Not a bad place to work i just don't care for the service industry. "
good,"I started cutting meat while going to college in 1983. I started part time for school money. I went to North Texas University for 2 years and worked in meat department. My mother was killed in a car wreck in 1985,and being from southeast Kansas,I moved to Wichita in 1985 and started cutting meat full time,back then the money was good. I really enjoyed it and in 1991 was promoted to meat manager,very young for that job,and spent next 17 years on that position."
good,"Very Inspiring Place To Work. I met some amazing people there and i'd never forget about great that Kroger was. A typical day at work went like a breeze if you know what you're doing. From re-stock to the parking lot you'll learn how to put in some hard work regardless of the environment. It's a great place, I recommend it !"
good,"Supervise six customers at a time"
good,"Typical work day included filling prescriptions, provided customer service; processing and coordinating with insurance companies, etc.  Developed good relationships with co-workers."
good,I've loved working at Kroger so much i kind of got stuck. The job doesn't pay the best though. Co-workers are fun and friendly most of the time. It's a very busy place though so no down time.
good,"loved working for kroger. although at the time i was not making enough salary to live off of. i first started off at 8.15 an hour, and then we had a pay raise and they moved the pay rate up to 10 an hour. raises were based off how many hours you've worked."
good,"take care of the customers was the number one thing, provide fresh fruits and vegetables. the management was great, and the workplace was very diverse and fun"
good,"Lot of staff that had worked for Kroger Company for a long time get good benefits, such as medical, dental, vision insurance, also other benefits are yearly evaluation, pay raise, bonus, promotion ,and lots of good company discounts, even after retirements."
good,"good palce to work, you need to be flexiable, learn all you can, work hard and you can go up in the company. have a tough skin to work at a place that is not perfect. time and energy and you will go far"
good,Company and culture are wonderful. I had to leave because of my move other than that I loved my role and what I do here at Kroger. The company is fun and great humor in the accounting field.
good,"It doesn’t feel like a career choice for new employees it can take so long to move up in the company and it takes forever to get raises, you can’t raise a family or buy a house working at Kroger."
good,Busy every day of the week as store is open 24 hours/7 days a week. Much be able to work in a fast paced environment. Be willing to assist customers not matter what the situation is.
good,"At Kroger stores are a great place for advancement, when working there I started off as the overnight cashier and advanced to Frontend Manager.  Holidays are crazy fun."
good,Fast paced work environment with team building exercises daily. Daily interaction with costumers from the community. Great energy and atmosphere for extrovert.
good,It was okay working there. I was they had better pay and benefits. I think full-time employees didn't have the option of having benefits. But overall I loved the people I worked with.
good,"Kroger gives large discounts on food, clothing, and gas. It almost makes up for the low wages. I enjoyed the years I worked there, and I miss the people I worked with."
good,"Working overnight has it's ups and downs. Health insurance is worth the job, I was paying $60 a month for awesome policy. Downside is working overnight, on weekends. I would go back though"
good,Kroger is a good job there are many opportunities with Kroger I would love too continue working with them I also would recommend Kroger to a friend they are  awesome
good,I would recommend this job to anyone looking for a new job opportunity where they can work with a wide range of people and have room for growth in the company. You will have to pay attention to job duties and listen to the managers because a certain work competence will be expected. Stealing will not be tolerated and will quickly land someone out the door.
good,"Management worked with me regarding my schedule and would allow me to work plenty hours.  If you are not a hard worker though, they will not give you as many hours.  Most of the people I worked with were nice and helpful.  Some of management was hard to deal with, but most of them were reasonable people."
good,Its a great job it just need a better pay rate. you can learn a lot as a overnight stocker and do a lot of lifting and learning and you'll also have to follow your safety rules.
good,"A typical day at work was getting there in the morning and running a Cap sheet which was a scan of what you need to produce for the day, after that you would start up the fryers and ovens and get started on cooking the roasted chickens that go out to the customers as your fryers were getting heated up after they were ready to start frying product you would have to grab product that you would need for the entire day and start cooking it. a typical day you would always learn something new that would help in the sells for the company Management were are making sure that product was going out at the right times to the customers and making sure there was enough staff for the day. The hardest part of the job was when a rush came through the store you would have to keep on your toes and make sure that you were well stocked with product as to not run out. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with other coworkers that wanted to be successful just like you"
good,"Setup machinery"
good,Each day i worked was going to the stock room and getting the groceries that needed to be put on the shelves and taking them to the designated isle so that they could be stocked correctly
good,"For the most part, working at Kroger felt great. The experiences that i have gathered throughout my year with the company will always stick with me. I had fun for the most part, but i felt as though most of my problems i had where with management. (at least at that particular store)"
good,"good environment but due to moving and relocating, I had to leave.  Responsible for utilizing customer service skills and food handling training to assemble deli orders for customers"
good,Very helpful management and a  great working environment.  Great place to work for any first time job or even a long-term commitment .  What definitely  work there again.
good,"Great Job, the pay is great for the responsibilities at hand. It’s also one of the better jobs that you can get at Krogers’s. The only think that I don’t like is that we’re not allowed to accept tips"
good,Kroger’s is a great place to work. Very diverse and you have many ways that you can move up in the field. They have different areas of work as well that way you can get a better for feel for what you really like and want to do
good,"Kroger in general is a very good place to work if you are still in school or are working multiple jobs. However, if you are looking to advance in the company then it isn't the place for you."
good,"The individuals I work with were considerate, and listen to your concerns and worries. They also helped in training and explained the details of the job. They ensured that when you worked there was nothing left to chance."
good,Advancing a career in Kroger is ill advised. Anything above department leader is nothing but aggravation and being yelled at to improve with no other feedback..
good,I enjoyed working with and learning from the management & associates at Kroger's.  I had the opportunity to meet a diverse group of people from all walks of life.
good,A typical day at work consists of interacting with the customers while providing an efficient check out experience. Management can be flexible considering hours.
good,There are many benefits offered by Kroger. My location had its ups and downs. My experience is a bit skewed because of the negativity at my store location.
good,Pharmacy felt like we were independent from the rest of the store...not micromanaged by the grocery store manager...only answered to the pharmacy manager.
good,I was able to gain experience in many fields during my internship and was fully supported by my co-workers to find what matched my interest.  This team is amazing to work with.
good,This is a very organize workplace. All staff are well trained and know what they should be doing. They are very resourceful and always done their assigned duties.
good,Working with the Kroger - Fred Meyer stores was good. I would like to work for a Kroger / Fred Meyers store some time in the near future. The co workers and managers where kind and helpful. I learned a lot working for Fred Meyers.
good,Kroger wasn't my favorite job but I would go back there before other places in a heartbeat. The specific store i worked at management didnt seem to care about your needs.
good,This is a good job to start off when you are a kid. The pay is decent and every week. The people are friendly and it will always keep you busy. the hours are very flexible.
good,Manager of the store I could not keep help due to people not wanting to work night shift. I worked a lot of overtime due to them not letting me hire extra help.
good,"Great staff and Management. Very helpful and work with your school and sports schedule if you are a student athlete. The management is very professional, co-workers very personable, and just a great positive work place."
good,"Its a good place to work and earn money, however it is very fast paced and requires a lot of work to keep up. An average day is usually very busy and often needs your best customer service work. I learned how to up-sell items and how to talk with customers and keep them engaged while they are waiting for their product from me. We have good managers and the culture there is wonderful and everyone is very welcoming and kind. The hardest part of my job I would say is closing time, although I no longer have to be out and help customers I now have dishes to wash, slicers to take apart and clean, and many other things. I never do them alone of course, there are usually at least 3 people closing at a time but more often than not 3 people are barely enough to get us through the night without any major issues. However, the best part of my job is engaging with the customers. I enjoy seeing regulars come by and greet me by name and I enjoy a nice conversation as i assist them and even if i don't know the customer, most people bring nice topics to chat about till I'm finished with their order. Overall its an enjoyable work space if you don't mind hard work and busy days."
good,"I am a department lead, so typically I come in and assess my department. I fix things that wont take long, write my order for the day, condition the department, and start working my truck. It has good benefits, and my stores managers were amazing. The hardest part is being a surge, which means if they are short on checkers I will get called to the front to help. This happens very often."
good,I enjoyed working at Kroger Starbucks I made a lot of new friends and it taught me to stay on my toes and task! I really liked the employees and cuatomers! Who doesn't love coffee
good,The store I worked in was a non-stop store... we were always busy no matter what time of the day. It was one of the best places I've work for. I would still have been with them if I my school and job didn't keep me from the job.
good,"This is a fast paced environment. Constantly changing new sales items, promotions, and restocking shelves. Great customer service is mandatory. Great place to work."
good,It was hard to manage the time because of the work was given on the day it was due. if the work was given before the time it would have been better because it would be less workload for the stuff.
good,"I loved my job, the store manager switched was I was still there and she changed the entire environment and attitude of the store in a negative way, over half the store left before she ad been there an entire month."
good,"it was an nice well job. I got paid what i deserve, management was great. Kroger didn't have any issues with me i would recommend people to work their if they can. I say all great things about Kroger."
good,The great people that i worked with was a great experience for myself. I would recommend this place as a career devolepment center and somewhere that you can grow with.
good,I work here when I was in high school it was a good job for the time being they paid me well for what need to get by with foe that part of my life......
good,This was my very first job it taught me a lot about customer service and hard work. The employees and managers were like family. They were very understanding if you had to call off for emergencies or appointments.
good,I was hired to be a Pharmacy Tech and they trained me on the job.  This was in Virginia.  I passed the state and national exams and worked there for a few years.  When I moved to Washington state I wasn't able to find another pharmacy job because they wanted a degree.
good,"Depending on what department you are in, a typical day at work involves you doing the same duties every day"
good,"good benefits pay is okay, they just need people who are driven to work. They go by seniority, so if you want Sunday's off to go to church you will need to request it in advance or don't put sundays on your availability"
good,a typical day at Kroger is usually a relaxed day mostly fast pace grocery service and customer service. there would be a lot of carts in the lot because some of the cart people that we had would slack and hang out in the lunch room.
good,Being a Pharmacy Technician is not an easy job. I feel like most pharmacy technicians are under paid for the work load they take on. We deal with numerous people who are unfriendly.
good,"A typical day would involve daily task set by your immediate supervisor. Hours will vary depending on where you work, but staffing is always a pitfall."
good,"Cashiering, helping customers find items they can't find, get to talk to them serial times a week. I learn how to best help people each day. Management is there when we need them. It's pace varies throughout the day and and night. On Self Checkout, when everyone needs you r attention to help them, I just say ""I'll be right with you"" and help them in turn.There are 7 registers.I enjoy helping the best I know how."
good,"Getting full time is a bit of a chore, but the company itself is decent compared to the competition, I would work there again, the employee discount is great."
good,"Busy at times, cash register area a bit small but easy to maneuver. Book of sku's you may look through if item is missing a barcode/sku. Nice park across the parking lot."
good,I worked at Kroger while I was in high school and it was because I worked with friends.  The management not alway the nicest but it was okay.  I had to pay union dues even though I wasn't in the union yet.
good,"I learned how to manage my time and how to keep up with constant change. I also learned how to code time, assist with leaves and different trainings. I am an efficient Operations Administrator with successful experience in executing quality care and precise monitoring in various settings with a strong emphasis on maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and ethical practices within the workplace. -"
good,I enjoyed my time with Kroger. I love the job I had and everyone I worked for was great! It was a fast paced place to work. I also had interaction with customers on a daily basis.  I worked in hiring staff and training them for each position.
good,"i honestly wish i could go back to work at krogers, because i loved it there. the only thing that i didnt like was pushing in carts. they maded whoever do that in freezing snow and ice among other weather conditions, and i was one of the unlucky ones to push in carts when it was sleeting outside on one day in december of 2017. other than pushing in carts it was great and i loved it. i honestly wish i could go back but they wont let me due to me not giving a notice of when i was quitting."
good,Typically worked the day shift. Worked in produce and stocking area. Would collect shopping carts. Management was good. Helpful staff & crew. Most enjoyable part was working with coworkers
good,"Overall, the job was fairly easy, the crew I worked with was great, my immediate manager was amazing. The only downside was the pay, the job I feel deserved better pay, especially since we were always going above and beyond."
good,"Payroll was low so I had to cover a lot of shifts when people called in. Was pretty fast paced with customers, vendors, ordering, and inventory. Mostly hired younger kids who had not developed good work ethic, so a lot of teaching, training, and building them."
good,"A typical 8 hour day, some days more demanding than others. Excellent on the job training and the manager keeps use up-to-date on training. Love co-workers, we all get-a-long well."
good,"it was ok working here. was there to my job and make a check, if i had a option I would not work there. It wasnt a terrible experience, it taught me more customer service"
good,I had a lot of fun working with Fry’s and was possibly going to make it a careers until I was let go. I just wasn’t doing my job at the time. Sometimes there would be poor management if we were busy and people were in a hurry.
good,The mangers where very disrespectful day barely came down stairs to help us when we called them. We did not have a lot of employees on the front ends so the where so  lines are long.
good,"It was a very fun place to work, very fast paced work environment but not to strees demanding.all in all i would say kroger is a very good company to work for."
good,"I worked at Kroger while attending PJC, in Paris, TX.  It was a great part-time job.  There were flexible hours and the staff really worked around my school schedule."
good,It was a fast paced environment to work. They workplace culture was very good for students to learn customer service in a busy environment. Management was considerate and flexible in addressing issues.
good,"A typical day of work includes collecting groceries, helping customers find items, running a register, and bringing groceries out to cars and loading them."
good,"It was fun to work there and I appreciate working with the team. The company offers some good incentives and work-life balance to its employees. However I worked from full-time to part-time, this company always paid all vacation time off as required. I will recommend it to anyone who would like to work for this company."
good,I worked for Kroger Foods for approximately 13 months before I had to leave due to my pregnancy. My manager at the time was fantastic and was dedicated to making sure all staff had what they needed to complete their job.
good,"I liked it but not the management, management was expecting more out of people they could give. Really unfair for new employees. but other than that I recommend applying"
good,this job was just something temporary and it got me through high school. it was very fun and i enjoyed it being my first job. i still wish i could go back but it was fun.
good,good place to work and great opportunity to learn new skills.  The management was easy to get along with and the environment was welcoming and inviting.
good,Overall a decent place to work be prepared to work hard. Not a very good work home life balance. Compensation is great if you dont mind not seeing family much.
good,"I have always had a great experience with Kroger. Management are hard working and under the same stresses as the other staff. My location has a terrible time finding and keeping people, mostly due to location and pay. Location as the employee draw are bus service transportation reliant for many of those who don't stay. The pay is terrible when area employers are paying more. The lack of staff puts tremendous pressure on those department and other managers to deal with in-stock inventory demands for a company store that does a million a week in sales. Kroger has outstanding customers and all levels of management attempt to fulfill customer expectations. There are many pet project issues, whereby time consuming paperwork requirements in a perfect world,although intent and value are positive, are simply impracticable when staffing shortages and in-"
good,I have no issues when I was with Kroger. I enjoyed where I worked in Kroger and when I was with them I had the opportunity to advance in different departments and even did Loss Prevention. I learned how to prevent loss of merchandise and detain and shoplifter. Management was great that I worked with and was very friendly to all their employees.
good,"A typical day at work was just ringing up customer's groceries and bagging them. There were some customers who were very nice, and those customers would come on a regular and they would always come through my line no matter how long my line was. Time would go by quickly, i guess because I am always at a steady pace, and on holidays we are very busy."
good,There were lots to do for a courtesy clerk. The carts outside were a lot for someone as small as me. During the summer it was really hot outside.  okay
good,"Pallet Jack driver, picking orders and wrapping picks on pallets? Picking orders for Kroger stores n the Indianapolis, Indiana area! Worked at a fast pace!"
good,it was a good place to work but now they are all closed in durham they were a union job to that was good workers also got 10 percent off things in store
good,"The position i was hired on at kroger was entry level, but there is quite alot of room for advancement. Everyone ive worked with has been friendly and enjoyable to be around. I loved almost all of the managers i worked with. The star bucks and sushi bar are great places to eat when you take your break. Starting wage at the lowest level position i believe is around $8.25 including 50 cent raises every 6 months. Pretty good deal if you're looking for an entry level job to get through college. If you like it enough you can definitely rise through the ranks and make a career out of it."
good,"worked for Kroger for 12 yrs, had a very enjoyable supervisor, good benefits, and compatible coworkers, 401k was very lukerative in order for me to make a career move."
good,"It’s a decent place to work at, just pay isn’t the best and management isn’t the best either. Very relaxed work place. You have your times when it is very busy but other than that it’s prwtty chill."
good,"Kroger is a large company, and offers various job advancement opportunities. A typical day is either a 5 or 8 hour shift with 2 15 minute breaks and 1 30 minute lunch. Your days will be spent stocking shelves, providing customer service, working the cash register if they call for you, and doing anything else asked of you. Kroger likes to stretch their employees thin and have them do as much as possible. The hardest part for me was having too many things put on my plate for a 5 or 8 hour shift. The best part of the job was the people I worked with. Management at the stores I worked were always very professional and down to earth."
good,It was a good job. I was working while I was still in school. So the job was good and the people where very friendly. I got along with everybody and the customers was very nice.
good,"I worked, the fuel center, so it was generally always busy. the system would give some problems from time to time, but it was alright. the hardest part was telling people we ran out of gas."
good,Not a bad company to work for. Job is very secure with good opportunities for advancement. Kroger makes some good changes and some questionable changes.
good,Good employer providing pay and benefits. It provided me with a job and allowed me the ability to learn and move up in the company. Learned a great deal about the grocery industry.
good,I worked as a cashier and then eventually as a dairy clerk in the dairy department. I enjoyed both positions and was able to assist customers with any questions they had.
good,"It's a great place to have a starter job, it teaches you good skills and people skills. The time that I spent there helped me to want to know people better. I was able to connect with most of the people I worked with and I learned how to enjoy fast pace work."
good,"I have worked for the Kroger company for many years. It was always the place I wanted to return to once I was finished with school. I was so excited when the opportunity to join the team opened up to me. Only recently have I felt that Kroger is not what it used to be, based ."
good,"Was a good experience cause i had alot of roles to fulfill like i helped customers around the store, push carts and u a maintain the bottle room. There was alot of freedom as long as u didnt do stupid things"
good,"Working early in the morning was a challenging but rewarding experience assisting customers finding items in the store was difficult but was a less stressful situation ,management were calm , and collective dealing with many customers a day and helping with any problem whether it was simple or extreme.  Kroger had a variety in the culture experience at the store with staff and employees showing Kroger was a safe place for customers to get their groceries and for staff to have a safe working environment I would say this is my favor part of the job just meeting new people.  But the jobs had its challenges  electrical problems throughout the store which include the lighting system flickering on and off making it difficult to see, the stores computer systems not working or the Kroger operating systems being shutdown making it a difficult to see my shift for the next day"
good,Helping customers and patients with their needs and whether with prescriptions and personal needs.  I enjoyed my work and felt like I truly making a contribution
good,i really enjoyed work there i loved my coworks my boss was a good person. i worked hard and  i came to work as i should. i had many friends it's great
good,It was many years back when I worked this job but from what I can remember I enjoyed it. I enjoyed working with others and helping the customers. It was kind of laid back and I am more into staying busy.
good,"Not a bad place to work. Fast-paced, quick training. Dealing with different faces day in and day out. Must have great customer service skills. Go into work with an open mind, not every day is going to be like the next."
good,"For Kroger, mainly i was a cashier. I did not help with stock but i helped wherever else I could help. I am a fast learner, so whatever they asked me to do. I did it."
good,"union work, room to advance and grow with the company, many departments, short shifts, different duties during shifts, many customer service oppurtunities"
good,I enjoyed working at Fred Meyers. The management was considerate towards employees but also pushed for quality. While some employees lacked dedication most were very capable.
good,"It takes a lot of time in to benefit from this place, but if you stick with it and move to where the money is throughout the store, you will make a decent income."
good,"Daily facilitating the overall management of a retail grocery store. Duties were divided between HR, merchandising, and operations. Learned all functions  of these roles including certification in food safety. Culture was fast paced but focused on serving the customer by feeding the human spirit and delivering a service to not allow any customer to leave dissatisfied. The hardest part of the job was real time management of employees who called in due to family or illness issues and finding quick fixes to meet business needs. The most enjoyable part was serving the customers and engaging with the employees."
good,Krogers is a good company to work for. I cashiered in the evenings and worked the customer service desk when needed and stocked shelves.  Also I trained new cashiers. The hardest part of the job is sometimes trying to make a shopper happy when there upset because your out of a grocery item. But when you work with the public you have to have a positive attitude and smile. I enjoy working with the public.
good,Great place to work and great benefits. They have opportunity for you to be promoted. You can work overtime as much as you want. Plus you will get store discounts.
good,It used to be less stressful but the last year it changed a lot. We can't keep employees and we are always short staffed and getting yelled at for long lines by customers. It's to the point where my check doesn't come close to my stress level and thinking of my sanity more than money.
good,I like working at Kroger. I like that after a year you get paid days off. Some days are be crazy. But I love working with the public. I love getting to to know my customers
good,"Enjoyed my time with Dillons and was very disapointed they chose to close the stores in the Springfield area Had great employee support which helped the whole store work well together as a team, which showed in loyal customer support."
good,"Its a very simple job, something to do fresh out of high school so you have some money in your pocket or to work while you go to school or pay for school, i would recommend this as a first job"
good,"The work was strenuous and hard but the pay was good. the work day lasted 12 or more hours, and any overtime was well paid. Everyone got along well. lunch was paid and we got 3 brakes throughout the long day. Lifting of heavy objects was the work"
good,Kroger focused a great deal on maintaining a positive work environment through team-building exercises and activities. They really encourage in-house advancement through leadership training.
good,"A wonderful place to work for. Vibrant as well as positive moods and always cheerful. Loved that the customer interaction was always a positive one, and if not then I could always do my best to help the customer with what they need."
good,"It was a nice first job for me, I was able to advance if I wanted to and they trained me for relief for the fuel center which was nice if I chose to pick up some hours but with it being a union store the union really protected the unmotivated workers which I didn't enjoy because it made our jobs harder sometimes. It was a nice first job though I learned a lot from it though."
good,"A normal day would typically be fast paced, but easy if you were able to stay on your toes. A physically demanding job, but not exactly strenuous. The hardest part of job is working during the summer collecting carts, the most enjoyable part is being able to help customers and be of service."
good,Working with Kroger Stores had a very welcoming environment. All employees are friendly and willing to help. The schedules are very flexible. The store provides opportunities to learn new skills.
good,Coworkers there were really nice and help each other out when they can. I would work there again when the opportunity arises. I do think that more than one person should retrieve carts during closing. It is a very sketchy area at night.
good,I was pleased with the work. so he worked as best he could. there were good relations with colleagues. I like cleanliness and order. I also tried to maintain cleanliness and order
good,Everone knows Kroger.  They have stores everywhere.  Customer service is number one for Kroger. If you havent shopped here then you should switch companies now.
good,"During the time that I worked there, I was a student in high school. As a high school student, they still make it mandatory to join the Union. As a student, there is no need for me to be a part of the Union as they take mandatory deductions from your paycheck. Plus you would have to drive all the way to downtown LA just to register."
good,Well out of my 14 years there I had a good working relationship with the company. Most my training and job skills came from working at Kroger and for that I'm greatful. As far as advancement I wish more came up towards the latter part of my career with them.
good,15min paid breaks if you work 6 hours or less and 30 min brakes if you work 6 hours and 30 mins or more but the break starts when you leave your post. Kroger discount on a few items but you have the same discount as an everyday customer so you’re giving you money back to the company that paid you so it’s smarter to bring your food from home.
good,its a good store as far as im conerned never really went or shopped there and im not sure why im being asked this. its been a long time since iver even heard of a kroger store
good,"This job was very interesting. You learn more than your job. You develope good customer service skills. You work very hard. You learn to respect your co workers."
good,The typical day at Kroger was fast paced in peak hours and slow after 7pm. The most enjoyable part about working at Kroger is have the opportunity to make a customer happy to find a rare item that most store dont sell.
good,"A nice place to work, good advancement potential, upper management treats employees equally, vacation and insurance is good, employee discount too.    ..."
good,"Kroger was an awesome first job! I loved my time spent there. They were always very understanding of life things that would happen and never failed to make sure you knew they cared and whatever you needed they were there. I left Kroger because I was ready to move on, however I do miss working there. Such an amazing company."
good,It is room to Advance in the company but u have to be there for a while for that to happen if  you have the patience to wait for something to come up you good
good,I absolutely love how I can make unlimited amount of money as much or as little as I want with their incentive program. The only con would be working in the extreme climate controlled temperature areas for an extended amount of time takes a physical toll on your body and a lot of people are always getting sick like bronchitis or flu like symptoms.
good,The Job is hard but pay is great and its long hours great benefits they have many different positions they will train you and work with you until you can perform correctly
good,"While the job seems fun at face value when you get to a higher position such as supervisor, you begin to relize your coworkers are just teenagers who don't exactly care enough (not to say there's not any hard workers just not that many)"
good,It was a nice place to work.The work environment was pleasant.I learn how to prepare food and follow recipes from scratch.the customers were grate I loved working there.
good,"Why do I need to write a review.  I worked there for 17 years.  I had a hiking accident, and surgery to my left knee.  I was off work for 5 months.  I tried to come back but I really couldn't stand long anymore.  They could not find a place for me at corporate so I took disability retirement."
good,A great place to work.  Relaxed environment with a balance of personal and team goals to accomplish.  The store I worked for did extremely well as a team under a strong leadership from management.  I highly recommend the store due to the environment one is able to work in on a daily basis.  This company is fantastic.
good,"loved working for Kroger. Just wish they had one in Tyler Tx."
good,I enjoy working for Kroger. The culture at Kroger is great.  I love working with my team members.  They make work more enjoyable.   I have learned a lot about their mission.
good,I enjoyed working at kroger. I moved up for a bagger to working and running the u-scan area. There were opportunities to train in each department so plent of things to learn and do.
good,"Working for Kroger was fun . I had lots of opportunity to move forward but wasn’t given the right direction.  When they promote you they send you to another store,so moving up means moving away."
good,I really can't say to much it has been a long time since I worked there and  a lot of thing have change. the most enjoyable part me was the people that I worked with.
good,Expect to work in areas other than your position for 90 percent of your job. They don't give departments enough scheduled hours so you will have to fill in whenever someone calls out
good,"I liked working for Kroger, you never stayed in one place and rarely ever saw the same store more than once in a month time period, unfortunately I didn't do so well during the probationary period so they let me go, good paying job good training and a great team."
good,"Good pay and we have the Union, the workplace culture is very friendly and enjoyable job, and holyday you get overtime.  It great work with clients because they have different cultures."
good,I worked in many different positions of the pharmacy. Any where from inventory to helping customers to typing up prescriptions. I would work with others and helping them with their daily tasks as well.
good,"I work the closing shift in the deli. It's just cleaning and packing things up, and as an introvert this is the best job you can get in retail. There are some customers, but there is no rush late at night."
good,I enjoyed the time I worked there. I got along with my co-worker and enjoyed my ability to be creative. I love working  1&1 with customers and seeing them happy
good,I love working as an customer service representative for Kroger. I love working with customer face to face or over the phone. I love handling things in a timely matter . I just live Customer Service
good,Day to day consisted of standing at the register scanning products for customers. The managers were mostly polite and it wasn't incredibly stressful to work there. The work itself is easy.
good,Great place to work to gain work experience. Management is ok.  You learn about customer service.  The hardest part is collecting carts in the cold. Overall I enjoyed the job.
good,Working for Smith's was fun. All of the people were so kind. I liked it so much because I always had something to do so I wasn't just sitting around all day at work.
good,Busy days a lot. Learn how to multitask more each day. Management was ok most of the time. The hardest part was bagging the food. Most enjoyable was the customers.
good,It was a good place to work at the commute was far for me thats one reason why i left. you dont received a raise until u work their for a year but it would only be a 5 cent raise.
good,My experience at Kroger was a good one. I came in as a part time meat clerk and by the end of my time there i was a  full- time front end supervisor. I worked hard every day and my bosses let me know that they appreciated it. They gave me opportunities to advance withing the store and eventually planned to send me into management when the time came. They allowed me to work as a manager around the store and replicate their actions and experiences so that I would know how to deal with future situations. The reason I really enjoyed working for this company was my coworkers and the atmosphere they brought to the store. All of them were unique and very good people at heart and we all looked out for each other. I essentially felt like I had a giant work family that I could lean on when the times were tough and that made the job worthwhile. The pay was alright at best for the jobs I performed but I did enjoy my job.
good,As a front end clerk at kroger you have a wide variety of responsibilities. The main jobs are bagging groceries and returning shopping carts from the parking lot.
good,Busy. Would come in and immediately have some new arrival dairy products to inventory and sort. Lots of uses of pallet jacks and utility knives. Recycle boxing when completed in the bailer.
good,"Not bad hours, and the benefits were really good.  Kroger paid for most of the premiums.  Regular raises, including cost of living expenses. They had a great 401k and sick leave."
good,"I learned a lot about customer service. I learned a lot about food service, cooking, cleaning, and sanitizing. Also worked on the cash register, so I handled money as well."
good,"I had a decent short experience with this company and for my first ever job, I felt pretty good about it. The tasks I had to do weren't that much of a struggle and I was trained on how to do it for about a week so that was helpful. I didn't enjoy having to push carts in the hot sun during the summer for about 30 minutes to an hour but it had to be done so I did the job. Overall my experience wasn't bad and I'm happy I worked there because I appreciate that company for giving me life skills."
good,"Kroger gives you a challenge every day. If you like hard work, customer service and possess good organizational skills it is not hard to advance with the Kroger company. They value excellent customer service and the hard work of a level headed, loyal employee."
good,Kroger is a fun and productive place to work at. It is a good first job for people who are looking to make some cash while in school. The starting pay is little so you have to work a long time in order to get paid higher. Otherwise it is easy and comfortable.
good,Kroger was a very pleasing working environment. It was a fast paced job where you got the opportunity to meet all kinds of people everyday. I would recommend it to a friend.
good,"i was an intern to learn the process and techniques. i learnt a lot, but still felt uncomfortable with their PRX system. they had no actual time to teach me how it worked, or any printed outline in case i need help ordering or filling same drug from two different companies for one client."
good,"Working for a Kroger company, like any other company has is pros and cons. Pros are if you've been there long enough the benefits ( medical, dental and vision) ate really good. Cons are when you're a new employee you struggle to get a sufficient amount of hours."
good,"Typical work day is busy"
good,It's a typical work place and is good for the younger and older age groups. I have enjoyed working at Kroger but need to move into the health field. thank you.
good,"My job at Kroger was in the Clicklist department, which was an online shopping service that Kroger has been offering for over two years. Over the two years of being an associate there, I strengthened my skills in customer service and time management the greatest. We were on a certain schedule for each order, and my manager was very particular in completing the orders at least an hour earlier than it is scheduled to be picked up. The culture of the department I was in had a family atmosphere. The hardest part of the job was dealing with a difficult customer, though it didn't happen often, it was hard to try to make the customer feel great after they felt they did not receive proper customer service."
good,It was a fun place to work  the first or last  person they talk too I didn't like working swing shift that was not good for me or my family had small kids
good,My time at Kroger was great given the my regular customers and my relationship with my managers given the grocery base for our friendship. Although we were quite friendly that didn't interfere with the job
good,Working At Kroger’s Was a a great Experience and I Would Recommend It To Any Of My Friends. The Customers Were Very Friendly And Understanding Towards Situations We Would Fall Upon.
good,In a typical work day we would see about 80 customers picking up their groceries. It was a fun place to work. I learned a lot about the grocery industry. Management was hands on. The work place culture was filled with a lot of teenagers. The hardest part of the job for me was when we had to work in different departments. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a lot of kids. They had different stories every day.
good,The pay was good and always on time without any issues. Management handles any issues as fast and time allows. Management will work with the employees to ensure the work is complete.
good,I love it just wish it aloud us to get more hours nd that they didn't get paid every week but other than thay the management was great and team was the best
good,"I would recommend Kroger to anyone. Good pay decent hours. "
good,"Started as a part time fuel clerk, promoted to Pricing coordinator, in less than 2 years promoted to HR manager 2nd in command of store number 574. Did all interviews, hiring, maintained files and worked directly as the proxy for the Store Manager."
good,"work/life balance is difficult, work weekends, holidays. they do provide continuous training and development. I learned so much about myself and the individuals I work with."
good,Kroger store in Tucson was clean and friendly. Management was always willing to accommodate with their employees personal situations.I learned great customer service.
good,Dillons/Kroger is a very good company. They treat their employees well and I learned a great deal during my tenure here. I experience excellent team atmosphere and greatly enjoyed my job experience with that company.
good,Good environment for first time employees teaching skills from time management to understanding different customers and their own tastes IE paper or plastic
good,Kroger is a nice place to work. They work with you on your schedule days work. The Kroger family is very nice. I love customers. The conversation is awesome and I learn new things every day
good,It’s a very nice part time job for high school students. Due to working as a cashier this job has helped me be able to easily talk to people. They’re willing to give you more hours if you ask.
good,very fast paced job and the customer is always right. very people friendly store. most enjoyable part of the job was the customers that you meet are the friendliest. because ive know what they ordered every time they come in
good,"Kroger is a well run company that values its employees contribution.  "
good,"i enjoy working for Kroger but i just need more hours now that i am almost 18 and have a car, insurance and a phone to pay for.  i enjoy meeting new people and helping customers."
good,"I loved being there and the people i met and worked with. It was great for while i was in high school, but the pay wasn't quite enough to maintain an adult life."
good,"Overall I'd have to say: Amazing teams/staff, enjoyable atmosphere, with plenty to do giving very little downtime between projects/timed responsibilities."
good,"I really love my job at Kroger. I like being a chef, it is rewarding to teach others and watch them grow as I also learn from them as well. I am a hands on chef. I prefer to lead  by example, it has served me well in the pass. I like being engaged with the customers knowing their likes and dislikes. I'm a good listener. I will not act on a situation without all the facts. I need to hear both sides before I make a call one way or the other."
good,Store management has the I don't care attitude which trickles down to the employees. The company does have one of the best benefits but needs to bring the pay up for the employees to live on.
good,"Some of the managers are not professional. they don't quit understand how to conduct themselves in a professional manner. they're rude. some individuals come off as immature for the role they are held responsible for,"
good,"Great team that I worked with, immediate supervisor was helpful and willing to do what was needed to see you progress. Felt wanted and needed. "
good,"Great atmosphere normally , good pay, short hours normally for part time workers, fast pace and always busy, stand on feet all day, some long shifts, 15 minute breaks every 4 hours."
good,"Very good place to work, union, paid vacation, flexible hours, opportunity for advancement. Stressful at times depending on the business of the day. Would recommend for a first job."
good,Kroger is an ok place to work. We get work done and we get busy there. A lot of people there and different things to do at the job. People are helpful and nice.
good,Work is basic in regards to progression. Good starting for a first time job seeker. Afforded opportunity to change roles with time in current position.
good,Bagging groceries while greating your customers while bringing in carts when they are running low. I would suggest bringing your own water bottles for when you go outside to get carts cause you want to beat the heat
good,"Good place to work.  Team environment.  Flexible.  Good management."
good,"Depending on if I have customers I'll help then load their groceries onto the belt, if need be and then get started scanning. Once I get finished scanning I'll help the courtesy clerk help sack the groceries. After they pay I give them their receipt thank them and then check out the next customer. That is pretty much it.. I interact with a lot of them and have grown to really enjoy them when they come into the store. For me the management is really cool.. I like my management team. The hardest part for me sometimes is when I have a big order and NO sacker... It's hard sometimes but I do get a few customers that are more than willing to help me sack the groceries. The most enjoyable part of working for Kroger is honestly the customers and employees themselves.. I look forward to going to work at Kroger every day! There are never really any dull days.. Especially when I work with some of the younger staff.."
good,I liked working at Kroger u get paid every week the manager is not standing over u u get to help customers show them where the food is located and you learn new stuff everyday
good,"40 hour week bookkeeping ,hired employees,inventory stocked coolers and shelfs customer service.hardest part of job working all night .deposits ,daily paperwork. 8 hour shifts alone"
good,"I worked as a cashier.  I also worked in the meat, produce and dairy department.  I also worked the late shift at the self checkout.  I did whatever I was asked."
good,"If you are a high school student in need of a job, then Kroger is one of the best places to work. The work schedule is very flexible if you are willing to talk to the manager in charge of the schedule. The pay is good, the hours are good, and the people are great."
good,"I enjoy working here but need something else on the side in order to sustain myself and save up for the school year. However, I do not plan on leaving."
good,"It has been many years since I worked for the company and at the time, the pay was excellent as were the benefits. I have been gone too long to know what it is like now."
good,"Good and easy process, great discounts and managers. Simple job and easy to carry out. great associates and employees. 8/10 recommended its pretty good"
good,"Great start off job for a highschool student or someone looking to get back on their food. Always busy or moving. Cleaning bathrooms, getting Carts, bottle room service, or bagging groceries. There was always something to do."
good,"What you do on a day to day basis will constantly be changing. If you enjoy challenges and fast pace, this could be the career for you."
good,This company and position was a great fit for an entry level position.I would reccomend this position for teens looking for a first time summer position.
good,Was busy during rush time but nothing I could not manage. Friendly co-workers. Helpful Management. ...........................................................
good,"When I worked for this company it was under 'Roundy's Supermarkets, Inc.  It was over 12 years ago that I was there but I remember it being a good company"
good,"A typical day at Kroger was good I liked interacting with other people. I learned when I worked front desk to be firm but with employees. Management was great, they always asked how your day was going and cared. Workplace culture was good I think most of the time everyone was in a good mood. The hardest part of my job was counting the money at the end of the night and locking it in the safe. I enjoyed the most was making the customers day."
good,"hours weren’t really good and neither were a lot of the workers. sometimes they’d fight with customers and even the workers. but i enjoyed working there, it was a good first job."
good,"Working there is a good experience, job was easy once you get use to item locations. You work till you get finished instead of the clock. If you have a good crew the work load will be balanced, if not good luck lol. I enjoyed it though. Overnight grocery clerk"
good,"I worked in the service desk so I would cash checks, do refunds, pay utilities, western union, ticket master and prepare bank deposits.  I learned how to run my own service desk.  the management was knowledgeable and helpful. it was a fun place to work.  the hardest part was getting employee schedules to work out.  the most enjoyable was the people I worked with."
good,"On a daily basis, I cleaned and stocked the areas that I worked in. I also made sure that the backroom was ready for the delivery truck in the morning. I assisted customers when need be."
good,Kroger pharmacy was a very good place to work.Upper management was very professional and supportive.The pharmacy provided excellent customer care and the workplace culture was outstanding.
good,"Management"
good,"Kroger was my introduction to the workforce. It taught me how to be responsible and take ownership for my actions. I learned to work together with others to better help customers. It's a job with can be fun when you get to know your fellow coworkers, and challenges you to work in a fastpaced environment."
good,"A very organized business. It does care about the employees and does offer great benefits. They do have a shift differential pay scale. They have a 15 min. break for every four hours worked that is paid, and a 30 min. lunch unpaid after 7 hours. Good communication between all people employed in the store."
good,It was an awesome store! It was so busy.  The customers were primarily elderly or people with children.  I enjoyed my job.  I was the director of customers to checkout stands.  It was awesome!  I would love to work for them again.
good,It was an ok job but it wasn't my type of to work there I was more of a stock unloading and receiving type of person being a cashier wasnt my thing but I let it slide then it got boring
good,"I am pleased with my overall experience as a Kroger employee. I would like to see higher pay wages, as it is hard to retain employees because it is more often than not, that new employees leave for a higher paying job that is less stressful."
good,Clean updated store with the highest of standards  in place always. Weekly manager meetings kept everyone on the same page as a team. Great support from within.
good,I pushed carts as an employee. I  cleaned as in the bathrooms and took out trashes. Not a fun job but I   learned to work hard as an individual and with other co workers.
good,"Fun environment, who does not like shopping and cooking. I enjoyed helping customers find the products they were looking for. I enjoyed assisting special need customers."
good,"It's an nice company too work for , dependability is an must, management is very good too all. I really enjoyed working here and I will continue til r"
good,"Heavy emphasis on excellent customer service and training. Plenty of benefits and opportunity to advance. The customers were the hardest part f the job, often rude and irritable."
good,"a typical day at work was non-stop movement but i really enjoyed being able to help customers. For the most part, all of the associates there are friendly with one common goal in mind. that is to make every customer's shopping experience a pleasant one."
good,"I love my hours that I work and the opportunity of meeting new people."
good,"Kroger offered decent compensation and helpful work experience as I made my way through high school and my first few years of college. It was an awesome part time job that I would recommend to anyone in a similar position. "
good,I have been away from Kroger for over 30 years and I know a lot has changed since I worked there. I left in 1995 and at that time it was a pretty good place to work with very good benefits.
good,"Its a cashier job, exactly what you would expect. People are surprisingly nice. I would say that a job like this prepares one for other jobs, especially quick-paced and jobs that require one-on-one connections."
good,Was a contract job through staffing agency.  was nice place to work. lots of advancement.  Would like to work there again. Great training and support.
good,loved my job. Physical and fast paced at times. But loved it. I was young and it was perfect while in High school and after.  Courtesy clerk/seafood Dept. part time cashier. Hardest part was cleaning the restroom.
good,It's a good paying job if you are in HS or College. If you are in a higher that gets paid more than kroger is okay. Management is cool and laid back but stay on you.
good,People that I worked with were nice and fun to be around. It was hard work and paid well. Most enjoyable part of the job was getting off. Management could be better
good,"Overall I had a good experience there. However I wanted to advance in the Kroger job chain and I never had a chance because they wouldn't let me show them what I'm capable of with all the experience and knowledge I have,"
good,i actually feel like this job can be a lil bit better because you have to deal with the altitudes and the customers but it made me be more humble cuss everybody makes mistakes but we also had to learn from them also
good,"Very Good company to work for, especially if you are planning on staying with them. They have a union and employees who want to stay can receive health insurance along with other really good benefits."
good,Overall a great place to work at but personally not for me. They are very flexible with hours you basically make your own schedule with approval of corse
good,I am a cashier. It is kind of boring to me because all I do is stand there and scan items for 8 hours. I rather be moving around. Some customers can be rude.
good,"I loved working at Kroger even though the work was tiring. The people that were there were what made it a fun and enjoyable experience, I will have fond memories of kroger."
good,"I learned much at Krogers (Bakers) I cashiered, customer service, file maintenance (scanning) was supervisor in file maintenance for short time after previous supervisor went to another store"
good,My days at work are nothing short of regular. I do make some form of small talk with my employees whenever there's time to do so.So i overall like it.
good,It is a very fast pace place. It is almost always busy. You have to have a strong back bone to work here as customers can be mean at times. But i belive its  great place to work.
good,"A typical day as a cashier really depends on the time and day. There are peak hours where you are likely to be swamped and stressed. You will be potentially thrown at whatever time you are needed at. You could end up closing the store at 1 AM in which you would be the only person from the Front End present and rather lonely. A large diversity of customers shop at Kroger so difficult and upset customers occur regularly. However some customers are also very friendly and will have uplifting conversations with you."
good,Great place to work if you're in school and needs cash on the side but if you're trying to make a living then this isn't the job for you. Managers are fun and inviting.
good,Trying to pay bills having 20 hours one week and 35 the next did not work. Management was extremely lazy. Sat in t offices up stairs with little employ interaction.
good,"It was fast paced, but busy enough to keep you on your feet.It was an enjoyable moments at all times of the day.  Teamwork was always enforced at weekly meetings."
good,"Productive and fun workplace with shopping carts. loved working there, honestly met some great and awesome people and would recommend friends and family alike to work there."
good,"nice place to work,  it is very busy and i feel that kroger stores should pay more. I  would like to see kroger stores to pay better for the hard work but other than that, its a great place to work"
good,I have enjoyed working at Kroger over the past 5 years but I would not like to work there over the course of my entire life. It has been very good to me in the sense of part time work but when I have asked to take on more responsiblilities and move up in the company there has been no information given to me on how to do so.
good,typical day at kroger is providing great customer service by greeting ech customer with a smile and to make sure everyone is happy and were able to find everything they needed.
good,Loved the environment and all the people in it. Every one was willing to help other to learn. I learned many basic skills while in this job field. It was a good experience.
good,Working at Kroger you got to encounter many different people and always stayed busy. The hardest part about being a courtesy clerk is parking lot duty but it was nice to get out of the store sometimes.
good,I learned  a great deal of information and talented skills       There are many ideals with working in the department which are included in the day by day routines included with opening and closing the department.
good,"Good place to work if you are in college and need a part time job. They are very flexible and will work with your school schedule. "
good,"On a average day at Kroger, I would make sure the signage was correct as well as daily scans. Then there were the tag hangs for new weekly sales. I would get enough people available to hang the tags. I would also put my share up as well. After 2am the new prices would go into effect, that's when making of new sign for the end caps would start. That is the most stressful part of doing this job, but I take pride in making sure it looked good."
good,It was very good job to work. Everyone is nice and I learned allot from working as a cashier. I learned new information about customer service and more.
good,Working in the service industry is hard. Many times i had to bite my tongue because costumers can be rude! However i worked along some really awesome people. I left because of the hours.
good,This company is well organized. Pick n save also has great team work. This was my very job and it has improved over the years. I would recommend this company to anyone.
good,It's an overall good place for teens to work. Also a very friendly environment. Fun atmosphere. Customer service is great. Management is also great they will work with you on anything.
good,"My job wasn't too hard so i fit in fairly well. I learned to deal with horrible costumers but joke and smile at the nice ones. Management was nice. As long as the work got done is a swell manner then they let us do what we pleased. For example, if someone enjoyed pulling carts they could take others cart shifts as long as it didn't cause any disruptions while they worked so people got to do what they felt best at. I enjoyed the job."
good,Worked for this company for over 7 years. They can be tough to work with but they definitely inspired me to become a Pharmacist. So I will be grateful.
good,Kroger is a good start off for young teen that want to make their own money..  they are willing to work with you on the different shift that work out for you..
good,Honestly this job is decent for those who want to go to school. Just be aware of some of the management favoritism . That's all. Other than that it's a steady and a great environment to work at.it has good pay and very flexible schedule if told on time. Shortbreaks tho. Expect nothing else.
good,"My typical day at work was always very stressful. Constantly running back and forth throughout the store putting items back on shelves or getting items customers wanted. Pushing grocery carts back inside as well as bagging groceries for customers and helping them out to their car if needed. I learned that each customer is different and you always have to go out of your way to please your customer no matter what. The management was great, I had great managers. They were always on top of everything, they made the job fun. They were very strict managers but very fun and outgoing as well. The hardest part of the job was having to do go-backs. They always had a lot of carts filled with items which made it a bit hard to get it finished. What I enjoyed the most working there was getting to meet a lot of customers that come every day and getting to know them as well as making friends with my co-workers."
good,"This is a nice place to work , but people don't know the difference between working and friends. I fell as if they get the friends part mixed up. Then they are way older than some of the people in there 20's. But yet you got people out here feeling like im the problem"
good,I loved Mariano's and the HR managers are the best people I have ever known. Opportunity of growth and recognition for hard work. Best place I have ever worked!
good,"Kroger is very employee friendly, professional company. Learnt multiple technologies and working in Agile environment. Working with Business was fun and an involving experience."
good,"Working at Kroger has been a fun experience for me, the employees were friendly. Kroger's hours are flexible hours and paid well, they were always willing to give people hours, but they never wanted anyone to work overtime."
good,"My review is that they are a good company to work for, but no communication. They have good benefits and will help you with what you in financially like transportation, or school."
good,For the position I held I learned a lot about communication and people skills.  They will work around your schedule if you have days you can not work.  You are not always able to get as many hours as you would want.  I also don’t think you make enough to support a family.  It is a good place to work when you are young.
good,"Retail is difficult with any company, but Kroger offers solid pay and benefits as well as job security. The farther up the chain of command you climb, the more stressful the work becomes - there's a lot of what I think is unnecessary red tape and meaningless tasks that you have to perform. They do offer promotion possibilities, so if you're looking for a company where the rules are clear and solid work is rewarded, it's great. There are just no creative outlets if you like to try new ideas in your work."
good,The main reason I wanted to work at Kroger is because I was hoping to improve my art career by working my way up to advertisement. But  so far it never happen. I'm still a front-end clerk.
good,"It was a fun place to work, but sometimes the management was always changing around and some were hard to get along with. the co workers is what made the job fun,"
good,Lots of good for this company. I would say that the young hungry guys are being held back. Recycling old employees who don't care is not a good model. They don't care now why would they care later?
good,After my two week training period I was on my own in the gas station with a step by step hand written manual on how to close and lock up at the end of the night
good,Kroger is a family oriented business that seeks innovation and new ideas. It was great being apart of a team that looks to keep up with technology and advancement. I enjoy being able to implement some technology that i also used out side of work. They truly care about engagement and the employee welfare.
good,"Kroger is a awesome place to work. The people are nice, I love my manager, but We need more hours! I do multiple departments for little of nothing, the environment is what keeps me there"
good,"I never intended to go anywhere with a job at ralphs, but it provided me with valuable experience that I can use for future jobs, such as time management, organization, and money handling, among other things."
good,"Working at Dillons can get somewhat stressful and a little exhausting, but it's good work experience. It's also great place to meet new people and make new friends. In short, if one seeks their first job, give Dillons a shot."
good,"Good entry level job to start off with, weekly pay is good as well along with being to cash the checks inside of the store. The staff makes you feel as if you are apart of the family they are very welcoming."
good,"I loved working at food4less the only thing I wished they had done was give me more hours.The people were very friendly and helpful if you had any questions. Managment always helping employees out wheter it be helping them get bus passes to get back and forth to work or just gving them a few more hours for a larger check for a special occasion such as a kids birthday,etc."
good,Kroger was a very good place to work. If you want to learn more about retail this is a great starting place. You will be able to learn and comprehend the in's and out's of what it is to own retail at the entry level and proceed to further that understanding to a management level with time. A great hands on experience and environment.
good,It is a good job for someone starting out in the work force Not demanding or stressful. Many tasks to keep you moving and alert. Good break times and flexible hours.
good,The work place is very laid back usually. But on certain days of the month the store can get overwhelmingly busy so you have to prepare yourself to be able to do the work.
good,"Good Place to work. Very competitive. Great managers to work with, and who knows what they are doing. The employees are great there. Very fun environment."
good,"I started as a cashier but move to a customer worker, its a lot you have to learn working in that position but I feel like if you can work that position you work anywhere."
good,I feel the job I had at Kroger was pretty fast paced and the people were pretty cool and helpful. Sometimes though there would be tension on busy days like Sundays so try to stay calm.
good,"Frys was a good place to work for but if management wasn't so much in favoritism to others, especially working for the company for so long, I'd could've gotten me a shot in a management position. That would be the only thing that has been a downfall, is the managers but other than that. I would reconsider going back"
good,"worked with customers "
good,i had to check people out and help them find things around the store also help keep the front end of the store clean and organized as i can  at the came time making sure my job and my coworkers jobs are done
good,"Working there is straight, friendly employees and just a nice peaceful work area. I recommend anyone who’s interested in working in that field to apply for Kroger"
good,"Management is wonderful at Kroger and everyone works together as a team. The pay could be better, but you do get a fifteen cent raise every six months."
good,Good Company.  
good,It is a good place to work for students. The hours are flexible and you get paid time off after working their for a year. The management is nice and employees are friendly.
good,The atmosphere was good overall I had good co workers that helped me reach my full potential. I worked two great years at Kroger and my time there will be missed. I do recommend this job to anyone starting out with a job or is trying to find some work.
good,"Over a decade of working with they company, I have learned many valuable skills. How to work with other people and manage people around me. I have learned the ways of retail starting from the bottom of the barrel and working my way up. I typically start my shift at midnight scrabbling about trying to put the store back together. All so the customer can have a grand open feel in the morning when they come in to shop.  Between putting the store back together I have to unload trucks and order product for  the stores everyday sales. Very fast passed job and takes a lot of planning to execute 100% of the time"
good,all around a very fast paced enviroment not so easy when you first start dut great employees who help you get through it .Made many friends and meet alot of good people
good,"You are around customers all day that you can get to know. I like to be physically active, and this job had me collecting carts so that was a plus. Overall, the environment there is very friendly."
good,"There are so many good things about working for Kroger. The downside that is causing me to leave is an extreme emphasis on your job level instead of your level of competence.  Actions are based too often on who made the decision or recommendation instead of how effective it will be. Too often, projects are top-down instead of collaborative."
good,"Very nice environment, guaranteed to work. Although I wish they had higher pay and more hours, but it was still a good place to work. The hours were very flexible and you do have a good vibe working in the store."
good,"enjoyed working for the company and learned what was needed  to achieve good management skills, i was offered supervisor position in El Centro California."
good,I interacted with customers all day to give them professional service and to provide professionalism when I was on the clock. Working in a fast-paced environment is what i live for
good,"The local grocery store is a nice way to ease into the workforce for a high school student, like I was at the time. Most commonly, they were flexible with my work hours, and the pay was good for a first job."
good,The most enjoyable part of the day was when we all knew it was all most time to go home so all the guy would start pushing hard so we could get of at a decent time.
good,This was my first job and I didn't know what to expect but it really broke me into the work force at a nice rate.  Wasn't too stressful but also not too easy.
good,"patience is key, must be able to be respectful towards customers and coworkers, must be able to brush off any negativity thrown your way and be able to walk away with a smile no matter what"
good,"Work was hard, but paycheck at end of week made it all worth it. If you don't work out you will be in pain before getting used to the jobs work load. Get time to learn how to perform job correctly, like 3 month training period."
good,A typical work day was to assist the customer in whatever capacity we were able to.  Whether it was helping them find an item or to help them in the checkout lanes.
good,"I started out as a courtesy clerk pushing carts and helping customers out with their groceries. I moved to a cashier and rang up customers groceries, learned how to handle cash, check and credit card transactions. It was a friendly place to work. The hardest part was dealing with angry customers. The most enjoyable part was helping elderly customers find what they were looking for."
good,"Easy days "
good,"I attended at the gas station as a fuel clerk/cashier a typical day at work usually busy. I learned alot of different safety tips understanding the process when something goes wrong with the pumps. managetment was on hands a call away if needed."
good,"I really like the customers and people I work with, but the management is  always trying to treat there adult employees like kids and that is what makes it difficult to work there. The environment is extremely stressful and I used to really love my job but with the changing management you get ones that don't show any compassion or sympathy to what's going on in your family life. Every day I come into work I feel like it's chaos and every one is very stressed out and angry."
good,"I worked in the same store for several years, in several departments. Management is always the worst, they rarely do their part in making sure everything runs smoothly."
good,Most of the employees are bothered by the job either to little hours or not enough pay. The jobs themselves are not all that hard though. The biggest issue is there is very little communication between management and the hourly employees.
good,Fun  place to work at and a good work environment. There's a lot of  weird people that work there. But they all are very unique and fun to be around. I had fun here
good,"Kroger is a good place to have as your first job but not to work there for your entire life. Everyone es nice and the work experience is very organized. However, the amount of work they expect from you is not enough for the amount you get paid."
good,"Loved working there, many wants to help and only a few co-works didn't care.the managers don't pay much attention until they are called to a situation."
good,"Food/lunch option is very good."
good,It was nice and some of the supervisors wished they were managers. I just wish they would give me more than one position. i just wish they had me in more than one position.
good,"95% of our customers are extremely friendly and understanding. My co-workers are great (including those from other departments) Managers are generally very understanding and friendly, I feel confident confronting most of our managers if I have an issue with anything."
good,"Great job for high school students to begin a work experience related  to retail. Lots of advancement opportunity, great health and insurance benefits."
good,"Although the full time, third shift work straight out of high school was very tiresome for me physically, I enjoyed my time at Kroger. Working the self checkout was almost stress relieving in a way"
good,"Very welcoming place, and employees were great to work with. The job was very understanding and worked with my school schedule. The only thing I would wish is that the starting pay was more."
good,I feel as though Kroger tries to incorporate whatever they can in to making the best working environments they can for their management staff. It is a lot of hours and at times can seem like more work than possible to achieve but they do appreciate what management does for the company.
good,"The Food4less I worked at in Alsip. Busy business everyday, especially Saturdays and Sundays. I learned to greet the people in everyway I can. To be kind to co-workers, supervisors, managers. The most enjoyable of this job was to meet and greet customers, new bosses that came in. Got to know my co-workers very well."
good,Great workplace . Friendly attitudes and positive environment. Good pay based on merit. Great customers and very good employees. Some times there are hard schedules to work around but we get it done.
good,a normal workday consisted of showing up to work 20 minutes before the shift started to inspect your pallet jack and the work consisted of going and picking perishable boxes of food and sorting the pallets about 7 feet tall
good,I loved the staff and the customers and there was always something new to learn whether it be about a new product or how to be better at helping to make our team the best. Happy customers and happy boss' and happy teams are very rewarding.
good,hours varied from 4am to 6am working an 8 hour shift every day was a learning experience with something new about produce management was very supportive the workplace culture was very diversified The hardest part of the job was adjusting to new management as it was rotated about every2-3 years. each management has their own way The most enjoyable part was meeting and getting to know the customers
good,"productive and fast paced. had breakroom with a tv very supportive management. coworkers worked as a teamalways learning something new everyday about the produce most enjoyable was meeting new prople and sharing stories about their travels as in the summer time there was a great diversity "
good,"A typical day at work was mostly assisting customers and paying attention to details. I learned better communication skills, and how to manage work and school. The workplace was very friendly and helpful. There weren't many hard parts of the job, yet the most enjoyable part was making friends and working hard."
good,"Job was fine in beginning, but when the cutbacks began, it became unbearable. Customers are rude enough, but now they're implementing stupid programs that don't even work correctly. Being a tech is just awful in general."
good,Once you clock in you begin your day by going to your supervisor and they send you to your first task and they direct you as the day goes on until the end of your shift.
good,I actually truly enjoyed my time as a courtesy clerk at King Soopers. The work is fun and engaging if you are surrounded by great co-workers and management.
good,Kroger was a great company to work with while I was going to college. They worked with my school schedule and were understanding when I needed time off to do my school work.
good,This position was a very easy one and the pay was adequate for the work done.  I would recommend it to anyone that would like to apply and you will be most likely happy with the employment.
good,"I learned a lot, great people to work with and for. In my experience – This was a good company to work for. This is a very large company with a lot of moving parts, multiple divisions and levels. Internal transfers were open to all level of employees and welcomed. Every area of the organization was open to suggestions, so you had the ability to create your own opportunities and follow through with them. Because this was such a large company it was very structured in it processes and some of the guidelines were cumbersome and time consuming, it could take a year or more to get a process changed depending on the work load, approval process or system limitation."
good,"Overall, my experience at Kroger was exciting and managable between college and my work schedule. However, there's always some issues with scheduling due to managers' not remember previous conversations or private conversations that dealt with them."
good,Working here was a new experience for myself. I worked inside the fuel center where customers would come to receive their gas along with other minor items such as chips and drinks. It was a nice little area fit for one worker
good,"Could be very busy but fun, I learned more about different jewelry pieces, management was not always helpful and caring. The culture could be competitive . The hardest part was the retail schedule. The most enjoyable was helping customer , meeting people."
good,I learned the proper health and safety regulations regarding meats and seafood. I also learned how to properly clean up after messes left by certain meats and seafood.  It was very fast paced with all the customers coming to the meat section all the time.
good,A typical day at Kroger consisted of making sure product was out on the floor and making sure everything was rotated and fresh. I learned a lot about interacting with people and customer service.
good,"For the most part it was preferable to other retailers I have worked for.  Management was generally understanding and active, dress code was still relaxed enough to work in comfortably, and day to day activities were fairly manageable."
good,Lots of new things to learn with constant changes.  My supervisor was very fair.  The hardest part of my job was learning something and then it changed and I had to learn all over again.
good,Frys is a good place to work at the job is almost doable by anybody who is able bodied. Once you get the hang of the job it gets easier and you can get more done in a day
good,This was a part time job that I had as a cashier. I would get there right at the peak of rush hour. The people that I met there we are still friends to this day
good,"Good place to build a career and test yourself. Enjoyable, organized, a lot to learn, management was okay, plenty of career opportunity my favorite part of the day was driving the pallet jacks."
good,I learned a lot from working at Kroger. The most important thing I got out of it was job experience and the value of working with co workers to solve problems. Definitely a great summer job due to the flexible hours.
good,"a typical day at work consist of , sweeping the whole store ,within 15 minutes, doing bathroom checks, and doing carts, bagging and assisting customers with questions, and finding products that they need."
good,"Up to 6 paid holidays, quarterly bonus, and vacations. Paid on the job training, Great discounts on products in and out of the store."
good,"World known  Company, pleasant company to work for. steady work, fair pay. good family benefits. fair hours. Management is fair. Company good with the community."
good,always got at least 40hours a week. Was always busy which was nice. The work environment was stressful yet fun at the same time. I learned a lot about the grocery industry.
good,"I worked primarily as a deli clerk. I enjoyed the customer interaction. They were tough on cleanliness, which is of course a good thing. The  co-workers were friendly and easy to interact with. My boss was good and did a good job. The hardest part was working in the cold cooler in the back cutting fruits and vegetables. It was very difficult and required effort to tough it out. It was hard and cold and unpleasant. I became well-versed at interacting with customers and employees. Social skills and conversational skills improved."
good,"Krogers Store had a friendly staff and was a fun work environment. You got the chance to help customers and have decent conversation and the chance to be able to help. My experience at Kroger was pretty new for me because it was my first job, and i started working there only when I was 14 years old and a freshman in high school. Working at Kroger helped me build maturity and learn how the work life will be in life. I started there i December 2016 and I gave my fullest potential all the way until October 15, 2017 , my last day working for the store. The store location of 2913 Olentangy River Rd, Columbus OH, 43202, permanetly closed on October 16, 2017. I was not able to transfer because locations weren't convenient at the time. The hardest part about working there, was mann i had t get used to waking up earlier than I would even on the weekends. I eventually got used to getting up and my habit of waking up getting to work on time became a everyday normal thing."
good,"Kroger, or Fred Meyer Inc is a large national store chain. They are one of the top two grocery company's in the US. They are aggressive and can be a hard environment to work for. They do have  a lot of positions available. Just expect aggressive management, especially in the non-union stores. If you can get into a union store its not soo bad."
good,Management is great. Special Fry's Card for discounts on certain brands. The department work is very busy and fast paced. I work the overnight shift while the store was closed which was great. Truck night is every night so there is always boxes to fetch up and down the store.
good,"baking cookies and bread and then packaging it, "
good,Good place to work for. i like to make customers happy and get them out of the store as fast as possible. They worked with your schedule. Good customers
good,Mamagement was good just in the deli area.  Coworkers were sometimes hard to understand.  But over all the deli department was a good position.the company was ok for krogers.
good,A typical grocery store environment. Lots of job duties. Cashier and stocking positions are not as hard as courtesy clerk positions in terms of workload.
good,"kroger was a fun place to work. I always stayed busy. Also being in the pharmacy was interesting, so many stories, and always something to do. depending on who you get to work with, it is a great place to be."
good,I like working at kroger. The pay is pretty good for teenagers but the amount of hours u work is random. You dont get scheduled for your own availability until 4 months into working. The management is pretty good. They were always on us making sure we were doing our jobs. The worst was pushing carts.
good,Frys was amazing it was my first job yes theres thing people dislike about being a bagger but i felt like i grew so much worked in almost all departments but had to move
good,this was a great company to work for . I highly recommend it if you are looking to move up in a company and they have benefits so that's is a plus......
good,This is a good place of employment.  There is customer service daily so you need to be good at dealing with various personalities.  It is also outside work so weather is an issue to be dealt with also.
good,Work shortage. Layoffs quite frequently.  Busy busy invironment. Nice vehicles. Nice place to work. Stores were nice. Enjoyed the routes and paperwork.  Would return
good,"Here there was a fast-paced yet considerate work load. Adequate staffing in most departments kept the heavy workloads bearable - though there were some who were severely lacking. While Co-workers had a very enjoyable and efficient culture at work, there was a disappointing lack of communication between lower-level workers and management."
good,"I enjoyed working at Kroger Pharmacy call center.  I did not work inside of the store, but I did love the management.  They taught me a lot while I was there."
good,Working at Krogers was and okay job for me and I really liked it... The work experience was very different because the mangers had their favorites from the beginning... And treat everyone else different.
good,Hard work pays off which is what I have did. Sign job bids to try to get full time as soon as possible that way you get paid more. Once you get full time then you can move up the ladder and be your own boss with your own Dept which is what I get the 11 years with the company.
good,"learned how to work in a deli and the cheese shop. did training for the cheese shop in Knoxville Tennessee. got red jacket certified. was able to pair cheese wit different crackers, paste, jams, and even wine."
good,worked in deli a lot of food prep very easy stuff ...................... ........just a good store to work at they have good benifits and good coworkers
good,"ok company to work for, but no major career advance. ok hours, management was poor at my location. pay was ok, fast pace environment, great job for high school or college student."
good,Love it I'd worked dairy n meat departments. Dairy I usely start my day stocking milk then work on frat an finish that. Then some days I come in an work the meat department stocking n cutting meat.
good,this was a great company to work for everyone was always friendly and everyone got along for the most part. the store was alway nice and well put together.
good,"I thought I was going to work in the meat department, but instead they through me into the seafood department. I was a little upset about that but I understand that they needed help, and the seafood manager was so much nicer."
good,"Loved working for this company. Fair management, ample opportunity for growth, great training, great team atmosphere. Exciting and engaging place to work."
good,"they had scheduled me as part time which at times had me working little to no hours each week, but had fun being around the employees and customers. Everyone was friendly, helpful, and easy to talk to."
good,"I'm a hardworking and dedicated employee who has done excellently this year. My work performance has been excellent. When performance review time comes around, you are sure that my work will speak for itself with management."
good,"My review for Kroger, a fast pace very up beat, atmosphere the challenges created promotion and or salary increase however it can sometime effect work life balance."
good,"Opportunities are very easy to come by, promotions or transfers between departments or stations are available and it's easy to find a good fit for abilities and schedule."
good,"great place to work for a retail environment, fast paced and customer based. got to know how to stock and help customer efficiently. most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers find what they want."
good,Great pay raises along with great advancement opportunities. Trained across multiple departments and helped with liquor licensing. Friendly atmosphere and fun people to work with.
good,"It was pretty awesome,very productive and just hardworking.As long as you’re a hard worker ,responsible,respectful and trustworthy you should be fine ."
good,"I usually ran uscan from 5pm to 1am and had to close the store down. It was nice because I had the overnight stockers there to finish locking up when i left, but usually I was upfront by myself and helping my customers by myself."
good,"While the job is adequate for part-time work, I do not recommend more than 24 to 32 hours because of severe lack of concern for employee support."
good,It was a great place to work. You come clock and go to your department. From there its pretty much self intuitive on what you are suppose to do unless stated otherwise by management.
good,Kroger was a wonderful place to work. The staff and management were friendly and worked hard to serve customers. The company also had great benefits...
good,Great place to work for those entering work force. offer god dental health and vision as well as life and works comp. anything after that will be hard work and determination
good,it was a fast paced fun filled job. The management I was under didn't do a very good job at keeping employees. They didn't really have a good work ethic
good,I'm happy to continue to work for Kroger but they currently do not have a position with health benefits.  As a Floater Pharmacist I excelled at getting along with all support personnel at the various locations and the customer base.
good,My typical day include stocking and making sure there was fresh produce out for our customers. The management was great. it was a diversified work place.
good,krogers is a ok place to work they pay every week which is good and they work with you with any problem you had and laid back place most of the time but its a job
good,"Dealing with customers,slicing meats,slicing cheese,preparing party trays,cooking food answering the phones placing orders,handling money,washing dishes,cleaning the hot tables fryers,dumping old grease,take the trash out etc. I loved the job they just didn't pay enough money for all the labor"
good,Working at Kroger has its ups and its down. Ive been there for almost 5 years. Its a steady weekly income. You have to earn your full time. You are offered the same benefits regardless if you are full time or part time. Great for a starter job or a job while you are still in high school.
good,"I worked in the Deli that required production and I learned how to use the cutter to slice meat, and cheese.  Also I learned about the different types of meats that were high quality and how to weigh my food on the scale."
good,"A typical work day consisted of decorating cakes, and visiting with customers. I learned lots of good tips and tricks. Management was always rough on the Bakery department. The hardest part is only working a few hours at a time."
good,This job really helped me with my ability to engage with people I had never met before and often provided opportunities to help people daily which gave me a sense of achievement.
good,"Lots of training and easy work environment, ability to work around schooling.  benefits for full time employees and ability to join their union securing job placement."
good,I was a front end clerk nothing fancy about this position needed employment so it was a good fit at the time.  I believe I could had made full-time if I had not relocated back to southern Califonia.
good,"met a lot of nice people there started as a temp and was hired full time the manager doing our temp assignment was great, I advanced as a temp and he gave me kudos and made sure management knew it. they did not pay a lot but it was easy and fun"
good,The most satisfying part is doing everything in your power to help employees achieve work standards and the joy when a fellow employee achieves the standard.
good,"The job that I had started at the last few opening hours and ended when morning breaks and customers are pouring in. To keep things short, as long as you are using your head, work quickly, and can lift heavy products and pull/push pallets with a large amount of products with a pallet jack, this job won't be a problem."
good,It was pretty easy working as a cashier for Kroger. not many problems and the managers made my schedule around school and my athletic schedule. There wasn't really any hard parts.
good,"Fry's Pharmacy is a great place to work, though depending on how long you've been there, only late and weekend hours are available. The management is good, but there's no wiggle room for the hours I can get."
good,Kroger was a great store to work at. They expected a lot but gave you everything you need to succeed. It is always nice to walk into work and feel like you are seeing friends rather than hating your life.
good,"throw all product out, mark done soon to go out product, work load. help clean up deli. put deli product away, clean, put sale prices on shelves. order product"
good,"Overall I would say that working for the The Kroger Co. for eleven years was a good experience but after time I decided it was best to move in a different chosen career path. The management team was very supportive, work place culture was very relaxing and friendly."
good,I say this job was people place because whether you were a stocker or a cashier your main focus was the customer's care. We did our job at our best...
good,The job itself is your average Cashier position. Their biggest problem is over hiring and low staffing hours. There are more cashiers than available hours and it leads to low hours per week.
good,"I bagged groceries and helped customers put their groceries in their vehicle.  I would gather up all the carts and handicap carts and put back in the store.  I would stock shelves and help with inventory.  I enjoyed working at Kroger and being a team member. I am very fast helping customers bag and deliver to their cars their groceries.  I did not mind working in the rain, snow, cold, hot weather when go back and forth inside the store and outside to help customers."
good,I did this to earn extra money.  The climate of the company is one of collaboration.  Everyone is willing to help each other.  I really enjoy meeting and talking to the customers.
good,"Hard work, but if you put in the work you will succeed. Long hours so be ready to put in some work. Met many good guys that kept me motivated. Management will not be on your back unless you are not proforming"
good,"I was mainly either working the cash register or bagging; therefore, I would encounter many types of people throughout the work day. I enjoyed that aspect and the overall atmosphere. I was not fond of the rate of pay but the actual work was enjoyable."
good,"I enjoyed being able to do my own thing while working, such as listening to music or being able to have a drink with me at all times, often worked alone and sometimes with others."
good,"Kroger is a great start up job with lots of chance to advance if one so wanted, Flexible work hours, pretty much able to choose your own. Also you could transfer to another store , city, or state"
good,"Although it is not full-time, and the pay is less than $10 an hour, the employees and management are great! It is perfect for a temporary job, and it is easy to climb as a Kroger employee."
good,"I was able to sharpen my stocking and communication skills while here. Stocking product while customers shop teaches one to be effiecient , altruistic and aware."
good,It was my first job ever and I loved it the people were generous and I love some of my coworkers. My manager was the best she helped me when no one else did. The hardest part was having to go into the Freezer other than that it was a great experience.
good,It’s a good place to work and the employees are always helpful. Bad part with working at Kroger’s was when my grandpa was dying they didn’t seem to care.
good,"Great place to work, busy and never the same thing twice. Opportunities are there to advance but the position was only temporary and time limited so no opportunity."
good,Everything about this company was great and I spent a long time. I was laid off for getting a piercing on my day off. I was told that it would be ok but than told otherwise when showed up to work.
good,It is a nice place to start a job and continue a career. I would recommend it for anyone who is looking to get career experience and find a way to to get there foot in the sort of the workforce
good,Fun place to work maybe for a high schooler and for a first time job. eventually you should move on to a different job because they pay isn't very good to support yourself.
good,Depending on the person you are this may be the job place for you. I left after working there a year only receiving a raise of 10 cents. I was able to decorate cakes and cross train in deli.Being paid 7.25 an hour then only 10 cent raise didn't seem fair. But depending on how many hours you were willy to work each week could be rewarding especially sense paid each week every thursday. You were paid two weeks after you are hired though the job is a hire and fire at anytime kind of job . You are also drug tested .
good,come and clean and stock and prepare meat. i learn how to cut and use different machine. and learn different meat. i learn how to close the store and break things down
good,"It has been a long time since I worked there.  When I was there, I really enjoyed it.  Initially, I worked for Ralphs.  We became Kroger's because of a merger.  Kroger's treated the Ralphs employees fairly work."
good,"company cares about the associates,fun place to work.hardest part was working 2 overnights aweek to do price changes and working a day job was hard..but kroger needs to hire more full time."
good,"cashiering for customers, stocking merchandise and cleaning were very wonderful experiences and my co-workers made the job very enjoyable; one that I would highly recommend to others"
good,This job is very demanding. You can fill about 300+ prescriptions a day. You have to be willing to work hard and deal with rude patients. You have to have to be able to go with the flow.
good,The culture at kroger is like no other place even though some days can be stressful especially around the holidays. Depending on the dept. you work in you'll be given different task to do for each day.
good,Great place to work if you're starting a career. Requires patience. Management helps and understands the needs of its employees. Family environment. Recommend working there
good,"Recommends"
good,Very good place to grow and develop. Good career mobility and opportunities. Great work life balance. Awesome benefit package and other options for associates.
good,Kroger was a god place to work and meet friends in my group of 5 guys. the problem was average pay for no advancement and to much of being on call 24/7
good,It's a good place to work you get good management to work you meet great people at Kroger it's usually a good time to work everyday at Kroger I learned a lot at kroger
good,"Typical day was very fast paced and stressful if you can't handle the pace. I learned a lot about the food preparation and a bit about the customer psyche. Management expects a lot but was very nice. Very friendly coworkers. Hardest part of the job is lots of standing, hard on the body sometimes. Most enjoyable was the friendly interactions with coworkers and customers."
good,"A typical day at work includes working with technicians, prescription processing, discussing issues with patients, doctors, and insurance - fairly standard retail pharmacy practice."
good,"I had fun working at kroger, they were flexible with hours and i also loved the people i worked with. The hours vary and some weeks you may get 4 hours and other weeks  you may get 30-40. you never know."
good,Not really good on pay. I learned to work well with customers.The management was okay. The hardest part is fast pace. They barely work with you on hours.
good,Work place was great. Managers were very nice and helpful.  The hours were flexible and they were lenient if you were sick or needed time off. Would definitely recommend working here
good,"It was a grocery store job. Goes about as well as a grocery store job goes, had a bit of responsibility, managed it well, left when a better opportunity came up"
good,"Great benefit package including associate discounts.  Cultural Council creates employee incentive/recognition thru employee meals, raffles etc.  This employer does require high physicality."
good,Well my experience here was really good I got to over come something I didn’t think I was going to ever get over and also try new things for once the would be a really good job for some of you high schoolers looking for a first job
good,"A typical day at work is knowing that that myself, as well as my co-workers, are game, and prepared to give triple A1 service to all our customers. Tha hardest part of the day is trying not to overstep boundaries making sure everyone is doing there share of responsibilities. The most enjoyable part of the day is knowing that all of the clients are satisfied."
good,"Working at Kroger, the people you work with begin to feel a part of your family. They care for you and your personal life. The work is face-paced and long hours, but there is always someone there to help if needed."
good,"its a good place to work get to meet lots of people and do different tasks, good pay for the location as a cashier you have to move at a quick pace and clean when its slow."
good,"A typical day at work, I stayed to myself to stay away from tension and problems.. My co-workers were great indiviually, but together there was tension."
good,"Easy going"
good,"I enjoyed working with my coworkers. They were very nice people, worked very hard at their job.  Some of the managers were just very angry people.  I'm happy to have moved on, but thank you for giving me the experience that i got."
good,"A good place to work a lot of chances of advancement. They work around school schedules and other things. Some of the managers don't your circumstances into consideration but, overall a decent place to work."
good,Kroger is excellent. They are dedicated to the customers satisfaction and are very good at making customer and employee relationships. There are always smiles when I walk in and as I walk out.
good,"i started off as a courtesy clerk help putting the groceries into peoples bags and carts i would help unload if needed. greet customers always. A few months later i moved up as a cashier. Two years later i got promoted into the floral department, i would make displays blow up balloons work on flowers make bouquets as well."
good,"I Stock product on shelves.I was a nice place to work I got along with the co-worker and it was a good place.  Got along with management, and have no more to say."
good,I would recommend a job at krogers to anyone . its a good place of employment always room for advancement. Its a union company. The employees are very friendly and willing to help the customers.
good,well well well I love working for Kroger I have to dilling with a lot of good customer and a lot of bad customer at the same time you just need to know how to make them happy again.
good,"Great company, great opportunity, but very stressful, long days, had to work weekends, evenings, and holidays.  Very fast paced and lots to learn, but overall a good experience"
good,"Good company to work for. Excellent benefits. The work hours a flexible. If you have a problem ,the management will work with you! You can advance depending on your skills and how quick you can pick up the computer."
good,Awesome place to work great experiences. I was able to progress and make better money with successful results. I was able to meet interesting people which helped me excel my opportunities.
good,Working there was fun.  You got to meet all kinds of people.  It was hard work and fast pased. I worked at a regular register and I also worked the self check out registers.  I would help customers with any and all needs that they needed.
good,"Advised customers on the location, selection, price, and use of goods available from the store, with the aim of encouraging them to buy and to return to buy in the future"
good,"it was a laid back place to work "
good,stocking all drug/GM products adult/infant nursing and  hygiene  products also my job was to stock medical products such as vitamins  and over the counter medications
good,I learned a lot from Kroger the people were great and I still keep in contact with most of the including today.  Kroger helped it easier to go to work and do what you needed to do especially when the people care about you and your well-being. I started working there when I was 18 and I grew with the company.
good,"Although a company with many divisions, they are always focused on the bottom line for each division.  IT department is very cognizant of the potential for data breaches.  They standardize their brands through each division.  Corporate is very supportive and reactive."
good,"I was working during the renovation period and even with all the noise, the customers were patient and didn't seem to mind repeating themselves and the other employees that I worked with were nice people who seemed to enjoy their job. All the managers were nice and were always checking to make sure I was okay and not overwhelmed, and I really did enjoy working there."
good,A typical day is fast paced and a lot of customer service. The customer service is my favorite part. Seems to be a good company to work for! I love the employee discounts and benefits. I enjoy being a member of the Safety Team!
good,"Not a terrible place to work. Customers can be fussy at times but that is to be expected of customer service. The hours were random. You could have 35 hours one week and then 8 the next. Friendly staff will help you get through the day."
good,The environment in a Kroger is like a family. There everyone helps each department out if help is needed. Certain times there is period of fast paced especially when it is busy.
good,"Kroger was my first job, I continued to advance and work at there for 10 years, they have great benefits and pay and a wonderful retirement plan. I owe my continued success to retail to Kroger."
good,Great for someone in school or first time job. Management can be tough at times but they are pushing you to be better. Most enjoyable times at work are co-workers that make you laugh even when your having a bad day.
good,This company is well organized a great place to shop for groceries and other household items always great customer sservice with  Fast Lanes. I would recommend anyone to work for Kroger.
good,"I like working at kroger though it can be very stressful. The management is pretty good. Everyone can be really nice and they offer a lot of perks for their employees like discounts, and insurance."
good,"Managing inventory"
good,I love working for Kroger with very extraordinary customer. The management was always ready to assist associates in times of needs. It policies are very flexible.
good,"Great company, friendly staff, low prices, awesome benefits. Clean stores, fair treatment, understanding management. Work/home life balance. Everyone became a family."
good,"Overall a great store to work for. Very high volume of sales as it was in a resort town. Lots of upper management changes during the time I spent there. Great, friendly customers, and very good hard-working co-workers."
good,Excellent place to work with encouraging coworkers and good teamwork. Grocery store pharmacy is a great work environment rather than stand alone traditional chain pharmacy.
good,"want you to work more hours than scheduled, and wanted you to work from open to close by yourself.  The store manager only cared about what the upper management thought."
good,Really all in all a good company to work for I think they have got rid of alot of the red but head bosses that it is there way or the highway because they have never done it and think they now it
good,Our associates at our store are similar to a family we are close yet not too close. It is sometimes fast paces as well as stressful because of that pace. Other times its so slow you feel like you've worked 4 hours in 30 minutes.
good,i loved working at kroger except for a few people. it was a great place for high school students and they worked with the hours i could work. in the end they screwed me over and it was not right how they treated me in the end
good,"The paid training was good. My managers and coworkers were good. The job had the usual amount of workload and stress as with any other job in the customer service/retail industry. The pay was not as good as it should be, but the perk of having an employee discount was fair. Store Managers come and go, so that can be disappointing especially if you have a great one, but also, quite refreshing if you have a micro-manager or one that tends to plays favorites."
good,its was a good place to work. the people were nice it was a good learning experience. the only thing is that it was hard to move up there.but other then that it was good.
good,"it was a good job when i was in school. easy, fun, good pay for a high school student. i worked a lot and made some goof friends the management was very good to me"
good,The environment isn’t the best everyone seems to have an attitude. If you can get pass that then you’ll be fine. It’s like any other work place though
good,A typical night was  to  break down  truck  and get to work. All the guys got along great and were good workers who  supported each other.The manager left us alone because they trusted our professionalism and  experience.
good,"Will work with your schedule, and the work you do isn't micromanaged. You are expected to get work done in a certain amount of time. The pay is fair enough for the position."
good,"For the most part, Turkey Hill was better to work for than most people think. Most of the crew that I worked with were pretty fun to be with. But personally, I think for the amount of work and responsibility required for the job in QSR, they could pay the employees a little bit better. There is the risk of irate customers and robbers.."
good,"learned that you sometimes have to accept help where you can get it, and that are people that care you just have to get to know who they are so you can be friends"
good,If I had to go back to working this job I most definietly would. I enjoyed the pay being that I am a part time student in college. The management and coworker I had were great
good,"Kroger is fast paced. Loved to be challenged on a daily basis, and always learning new things. Excellent team work makes the days go by fast. I worked 21 years for Kroger and just retired in August. I want to learn all fields of pharmacy and become very educated and well rounded. I helped trained new staff and old staff on new software, handled internal and external audits, inventory control, order medications and supplies, data entry, product dispensing, prior authorization, customer service and so much more. I loved that my co workers and I are like family. It was a difficult decision to retire, but I am relocating so it is time for a new chapter."
good,"Kroger was always having something for us to show that they appreciate the work we do. I love working with the employee's, and seeing the customers that know you by name."
good,a typical day as a cashier where do i start fast paced you need to be aware of sales and discounts the customers were very nice a few of them made my day made me smile thats what makes your day are the people.
good,"The management was stellar. They would always be available to help me out with problems and were as kind as could be. I loved working there, and wouldn't be opposed to it again in the future if I had to."
good,i go in and do my job ...mind my own biz and go home it is a good place to work some times but others can be real hard as with most jobs...and not knowing what your future holds
good,Cashier hours varied you worked as needed.  Bakery You Started at 2 am get as mamy donuts done by 6 am and try to leave by 7.  If you are not done stay until yoou finish and risk being yelled at for working too many hours.
good,"I worked in the meat department manager was very cool. Always something to do. Co-workers were very cool, and management was very understanding and flexible."
good,"good technology"
good,Making things  were ready. How to communicate with customers. Management was okay. Everyone knew each other and their customers. Standing on your feet the biggest part of the day. Getting along with my co-workers.
good,"I enjoyed my job at kroger. I started my day by clocking in and setting up my stations. Then I opened up the bistro. I served customers, made chicken and sides, and cleaned up. i also did dishes and other things as well."
good,"I enjoyed my time here, I moved in to management within a year of working and enjoyed most of my co workers and customers. Pay was good once I got into management but expect minimum wage if it is your fist grocery gig."
good,It's a good place to advance in. It has great benefits and the people are great to work with I highly recommend it to someone who wants to advance in their career.
good,"Hard work, never get to sit down. Not many hours to work either. Your job seems to never end and some customers are really unappreciative of you. I'm glad I moved on."
good,Kroger is not a bad company to work for. You get good benefits and you can meet plenty of good people in the company. I've had good experiences with the business and also bad experience with the company.
good,It is an overall great place to have a job. Just the one thing that will hold someone back is the compensation. Hard working people are here and I just honestly feel like you can utilize your talents in a environment where the pay is better.
good,"Enjoyed working for Kroger"
good,"Kroger Mountain View started up on 2014 as a State of the Art facility.  Although it has its challenges with new technology, the way things are done are a lot easier and not as labor intensive as other manufacturing plants.  The plant is very productive and busy.  The Dairy industry is a stable, there will always be milk at the grocery stores but what is unique about Kroger is the Quality that it stands by.  The only concern would be Work Life Balance.  Milk is demanding even with a high shelf life in product so production runs every day."
good,"It was fine place to work very straight forward, just couldn't work there any more because wanted more money and the physical requirement I couldn't meet any more"
good,"Various duties, fun, and very pleased with management staff. The hours are very flexible. The training and team work makes Kroger a great company to work for."

good,Shifts could be very busy which is good because it makes time fly.  Coworkers are very nice.  Most customers are very nice.  Can be a lot of fun.  You get to meet and know a lot of people.  The hardest part of the job is when the store is quiet with very little shoppers.

good,"Kroger is a stressful job, but in working there I have met some of the best people I will ever meet. They do ask alot out of you, but they are willing to work with you until you get it right"
good,"Kroger is committed to be a leader in the pharmacy industry. There is plenty of support for pharmacists although sometimes corporate ideas can add extra stress on the regular employees. Technician help can be an issue. There are not always enough hours for the adequate help to the pharmacist. Overall, as community pharmacies go, Kroger is a nice place to work with lots of opportunities for pharmacists."
good,"Typical day is spent fulfilling customer online orders in a timely manner."

good,workplace was good people are good management was decent love the job in the mornings hardest part of job was doing the whole job by myself during the whole shift
good,Kroger wasn't a horrible place to work but the hours and pay just weren't there. It was your typical retail environment. I do not recommend this type of work if you do not do well with the public because ti can be a stressful job at times. Some days were more relaxing than others.
good,"I learned a lot being an associate at Kroger, people at the work place were very helpful when I had a question and needed guidance. I was in college still at the time of working at Kroger and management worked with my flexible schedule so i can go to class. Overall Kroger is a great place to work"

What i mean by that watch for those who breaks laws such as customer wise.Management was very laid back when they could until it was under certain circumstance. Workplace culture was relaxing and stress free.The hardest part was dealing with customers who had very bad attitudes or impatient. The enjoyably part was being able to smile and assist customers that was telling you that you were wonderful.
good,"Loved working here for the 6 years just was looking for better pay and they always needed more help, not enough hands to go around. would go back for more money"
good,"The job at Thompsons Station is great and fun place to work, but the hours could be more family friendly, the only reason i quit was because it was an hour away"
good,"Its a good place to work. Not a lot of opportunities for full-time. I liked the manager, easy to get along with if you are hard working and do your job."
good,I worked at Kroger as a customer service representative for a short time.I have very good people skills so the job was relatively easy. Overall Kroger is a good company to work for.
good,"Great experience, awesome workplace, kind customers. Perfect customer service, and good managers ad great employees. It was such a enthusiastic environment to be in."
good,You can go years without a pay raise but placed with demands for producing more than your share monthly.  If you don't produce due to lack of employees or anything else beyond your control they penalize you with commissions!!!!  Unfair business practice
good,"working at Kroger was great. the team was awesome, the pay was great,the benefits was amazing. I will recommend people to work for Kroger. only thing the don't have discount."

good,"Good job, good benefits, cares about employees. would consider going back if open position available. very structured and good pay. would rate highly."
good,"It was great when I started, Management was involved with employees. Cared and made it a great place to work.  New management was young and wanted to rule with a iron fist.  He lost some good people behind that."
good,"Terrific advancement opportunities."
good,You go to the Kroger school for training and they work with you.All ways learning new things and helping others. Also there is room to move around to other departments.

good,"A typical day at work was to make sure the bathrooms got cleaned along with the garbage taken out.  The front patio got swept-ed and cleaned.  I would go in back of the store and straightend the skids, and milk crates.  Picked up all the trash and filled the compactor with the cardboard.  I ordered the supplies that each department needed along with the supplies I needed.  I also helped bagged customers groceries along with take them to their cars. Working here, managers worked with my needs.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up with all the other employees needs.  I really enjoy working with the public."
good,It all depends on the store that you work at.  I love the store that I worked at. The management staff truly worked as a team and was very open to the hourly associates.
good,Typical day at work was busy and hectic.  I learned to cover your back. Upper Management did not take care of their people.    Workplace culture was ok.  The hardest part of the job was the long hours.  Training and taking care of the team members.
good,I liked krogers very much they were all nice people how were good to spend time with. I made a lot of good friend there and meaningful relationships.!
good,Its alright just not the job i thought it was and the management is not that good and they barely gave me any hours to work but other than that it's ok
good,Usually slow in the early mornings. Food items are being stock and departments are being cleaned and organized. Usually busy around dinner time. Mangers are out front helping out employees or customers.
good,The people are great and the job is fairly easy. Main jobs are receiving and shipping floral orders to over 650 stores. We work separately but as a team to get the daily list done.

good,"If you like a fast paced environment working with people, this company is really easy to advance in. Bosses are friendly, the coworkers are really team-inspired, and the customers are fun to serve."
good,"We typically fill 200-300 prescriptions per day, so it is a smaller staff than many other pharmacy chains. Some Kroger pharmacies are Yellow Fever vaccine certified, which adds an extra layer of scheduling if you have several people coming in for this vaccine in one day."
good,"I loved working here. Managers were overall pretty cool, workday was easy, and you got a 10% discount on all Kroger products. You pretty much do the same thing every day though, so it might get repetitive."
good,This was an pretty cool job especially if you were in school this employer will defiantly work with your schedule and to make sure you the work the hours you need to work. They have some benefits they are very helpful to teammates.
good,"Fred Meyer is an excellent place to work. I was actually excited to go to work.  The employees are amazing and friendly, and management is very helpful."
good,Show up and do as much stocking as you can while still providing customer service.  Generally 9 hour days with an hour for lunch.  Management was rarely on the floor but was almost always available to assist associates and customers.

I started at Kroger as a cashier, and then shortly started training for You scan, accounting, and customer service, then I went to Drug GM, and now I am the receiving clerk."
good,a typical day I would handle high volume of customers and was responsible for money and great customer service. Multi cultural environment. the most difficulty part of my work was handling drunk customers with their offensive vocabulary.

good,"Cashier"
good,good place to work at while in highschool. they have a great work ethic and system for young workers 15-21 to get money and knowledge while doing so..
good,It's a good place of you're trying to balance school and work. Really flexible hours and great work environment. Pay rate is pretty good depending on your experience.
good,Show up for work in a timely manner and do your job and whatever comes up. Show reprect to your coworker. and try your best to complete anything your supervisor ask you to do.
good,a typical day is coming into work and starting your job whatever position that may be its as simple as that it will teach you some life skills how to count money and how to handle food products.
good,There is plenty to do. Coworkers and managers are really nice and helpful. Customers are almost always nice. All the stuff we got was fun to set up and sell.
good,Kroger is a great place to work as long as you don't mind the work hours that come with a retail job.  The only reason I left the company was because of the inability to have a stable schedule.  Having a young family makes it very difficult to work different hours from week to week.
good,"Great co-workers and managers.  Prepare to walk and be on your feet for the whole shift. Busy work answering calls, customer service and your duties as sales associate, but it's not too bad. Holidays are very busy, be prepared to work full-time even if you are part-time worker."
good,Great place to work. treated fairly and pay was decent. hours were nice and managers were helpful. always able to keep busy days went by quickly which was nice.
good,The company emphasized teamwork and customer service.  The training was excellent and very effective.  The most enjoyable part of the day was working with people.  I thrive in social environments.
good,"Not a bad place to work especially if it is your first place of employment . The management is fair, the hours are ohay and the job itself is not stressful."
good,Kroger was a great company but my higher up managers in store werent always the most respectful to their employees. Truly wish i hadnt of lost my job but rstherthan give me another chance and switch departments they felt termination was best.
good,"Very fast paced, you learn true customer service, people who work there are amazing people if you really get to know them. Hardest part is dealing with stubborn or snobby people"
good,"A typical day at Kroger is standing on the back side queing. Making sure every customer receives 1+1 service. That's not a problem if you were giving more hours on the schedule to give each customer 1+1. You are expected to stay on the floor and not o a register but when the predictor is calling for 5 registers to be open and you only have 2 cashiers and you are one of the cashiers because that's what the schedule called for it is impossible to give the customers what they need. Management does not come when they are called to help. Making everyone happy and giving the higher up what is the hardest part of being a front end manager, because knowing you are giving them everything you have and it still isn't good enough. The most enjoyable part of the job are the employees. They are great and they treat you like family."
good,"Pros"
good,"Kroger is a very good place that works with schedules and gives you time off if you really need it-- as long as you don't try to push the grain. They are very understanding about many things, and will do their best to help you get whatever it is you need."
good,Take the stuff out of the freezer unwrap it and put in in the service meat case wait on customers and weighing products  up and answering the  phone and making some  prouducts up.
good,Great entry level work. Good management. Tons of opportunity for personal and professional growth. Excellent career options as it is a massive company with stores everywhere and a corporate support system.
good,"I was given the chance to start my working career at Kroger  and have advanced to managerial roles in my 4.5 years of dedication. I believe this company is great for a first job, there are many things i wish I could personally inform corporate on my ideas to enhance the functionality of their stores. I have and continue to mostly enjoy my time working."
good,"Everyday its something new, from customers, to employees. management was very helpful on teaching and explaining what was needed from me.the only thing i found to be the hardest part of the job, was me leaving to go back to school."
good,"I usually worked the 4pm- 12am shift, I learned to work at a quick yet efficient pace. I also learned how to interact with customers therefore making my interpersonal skills strong."
good,Company liked to do things for employees- bonuses etc. Nice group of employees. Customers really nice too. Floral dept. fun to do displays and help customers decide what the wanted and do arrangements.
good,"Started working here as a deli associate. I was only here a few months, but my experience was actually good. Management works with you and gives clear instructions on their expectations. For anyone going into the Deli, my word of advice is this: ALWAYS USE PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) I learned most of my safety with Food Handling practices here. If you go in with a good attitude and willingness to learn, there is room for advancement."
good,"Really enjoyed working at Kroger, They treat their employees fair and pay very competitively. I would go back to work for them, it was a good fit. Very good company."
good,from costumer service to cashier is a good experience. the environment are inviting associates smiling and well mannered. newcomer associates well take care of.

good,enjoy working with others and meeting new people daily. I learned to operate different machines. the most enjoyable part is enyoying what I do. the company also have great management
good,This company is a great company due to benefits 401k and opportunity for growth. The work is easy and the pay is ok if you are in management.  Its hard to grow within the company.
good,"Easy going, steady paced. Some days are slow and holidays, Sundays, and Mondays are the busiest days. Typically for younger people around the ages of 16 - 25."
good,I am good worker. I arrive early before the scheule starts and I stay till my shift isn't needed. I am a hard worker and I get along with the people/management.
good,"a typical workday was lining out the associates for the day. communications of jobs duties and assut]ring that all product was acceptable to put out for the customers to purchase. Worked with the RF handheld making signs, price audits, CAP, and backstock review. Scheduling was part of my weekly routine as well as ordering product four times a week. Once a month I worked a graveyard shift doing inventory. The associates I worked with were wonderful in the bakery and deli department. At times I would manage both departments up to 4months at a time. My days were stressful, challenging, in which, ""I love a challenge."" Each and every day was gradifying due to the assocites and customers."
good,Working at Fred Meyer gave me the opportunity to work with a very diverse group of people and the job also enabled me to use my skills as a trainer and gave me the ability to learn how o work under pressure but yet maintain the ability to meet beat deadlines and the different projected budgets.  The hardest part of the job was having to evaluate workplace performances and disciplinary action that I had to do.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people and being creative.

good,"Excited to work for Kroger. Good benefits great people. Always busy which made the days go by quickly. "
good,I've been a Kroger employee for 4+ years I like it of course everyone wants to be paid more. I feel it's great that you can get insurance benefits even if your just part time. Of course after being there a year or more. When most companies require u to be full-time to receive benefits. Every company has it's pros and con's  but overall I feel Kroger is a great company to work for.
good,"Good work and life balance, you can expect to get off work at 5pm and start working at 8. People are generally nice and easy to work with. Just hard to learn a lot of stuff"
good,"check shelves to make sure everything was stock"
good,"Can get a little ruff if it's your first day. Takes some time getting use to if it's at a busy location. Cashiers aren't strangers, they'll help you if they see you struggling. Managers are nice about helping out too."
good,"Kroger is a good company to work for. There is job security in working for a Fortune top 30 company, but keep in mind that this company seems to have entered Y2K and settled there for the last 15 years. Their computer systems are outdated and their corporate websites leave a lot to pine for."
good,"A typical day at work is walking to greating the customer with a smile offering help when needed, greta people to work with , the management is good people to work with , the hardest part of the ob is not enought communiction for all the new equipment that need to be learned"
good,never dull always interesting and there is always something to do. customers keep me on my toes and i love making thgem happy with my outgoing personality.
good,"Company is very competitive and fast-paced. You learn to multi-task, communicate with customers, organize daily tasks, and several other responsibilities. Workplace can be stressful and at times, overwhelming. The culture overall is nice and you meet great people.

The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to meet new people and learn something new."

good,Great safe. Supervisors were amazing.. helped when asked. Most of the managers were friendly and easy to get along with. Hardest part of the job was trying to help an angry costumer. Id get a supervisor to help and everything was just fine. the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing and talking to the costumers.
good,"My time as a Kroger employee was mostly a good experience. Most days were easy. Made friends very quickly and most people are nice when they want to be. Management was fair, enforced our rules, but always had our backs if we needed it. I looked forward into coming to work everyday just because of my co-workers. The worst part about the job was the pay but for an entry level job thats flexible with hours, I could give a little with it."
good,"At Kroger's, it was a good environment! Especially for it being a grocery store. The people I worked with were very easy going and very personable. Managers were very consistent with their job duties as well as with they relatable roles. Work was always a fast paced environment, which worked well within out team."

good,"working at Kroger i learned how to bag groceries properly, and excellent customer service skills. working for Kroger i also learned how to slice meat ,and run the hot bar when needed"
good,"Typical day- troubleshooting tech issues remotely"
good,"Everyday I was greeted and surrounded by coworkers who were loving and motivated to do their jobs exceptionally well. Although there were some management issues, in my opinion, one bad apple does not always spoil the bunch. This work place was also in the middle of expansion and development and so I believe they did a wonderful job of balancing customer service, construction, and recruitment."
good,"The typical day will have you going to work at some semi-random hour of the day, standing up and putting groceries into bags for several hours - occasionally doing some physical labor with pulling in carts, leaving at some random hour of the day - and then when you get home look at your schedule to see when your next random hours are going to be. "
good,At Kroger it was a Union store so all employees loved their jobs and were compensated for their work. The attitude and  behavior of co workers was always high spirited. It was a fun place to work. I also loved decorating the cakes.
good,"I can definitely say working in a big grocery store such as Kroger's was definitely an incredible experience! The team of people there were phenomenal in every department and there was always room for advancement and growth. Shortly after being hired as a courtesy clerk, I was super determined to train as a cashier as well. I asked my manager and unfortunately she declined. Lucky for me, she made the promise that if I worked hard enough the position could be mine. As promised, about two weeks after that, I was working the register. I showed so much hard work, determination, and skill in that store. I bonded with everyone and everyone loved me as well. The long hours of constantly moving and staying on your feet was probably the worst part about it all, but honestly it was one of my favorite jobs."
good,I love this job. It's been an amazing first job. It has very very very flexible scheduling. Work atmosphere is a balance of fun and hard work. Multiple coworkers as well
good,great place to grow up in if you are young it take same time to get promoted and the raises is not that much but it a big family everybody look out for each other
good,"I was a pharmacy technician for almost a year.  The store pays for your training and certification.  There was also plenty of hours to go around at my store.  Even if you are not going to be a pharmacist in the future, this is a great healthcare related career for collage students who are completing a healthcare degree."
good,"I was a temporay employee during the grocery strike. It was a lot of pressure to do the job correctly, but when it was done accurately, a lot of pride and appreciation was given by the manager of the store."
good,"I will love to work here. This is my type of job. I'm Nice With Customers,Kids, and will live to help people out around the store. It's my type of job and will love working here."

good,"It was my very first job and it was a great job for to start out with, it's a good pace, not too fast but not slow and it got me use to the job atmosphere."
good,"Customer service is a can or cannot do sort of job. its relaxed with the right attitude. Management could stand to be more relaxed. Pay should cover the cost of living,"
good,"it was a job that I needed to pay for school nothing to special about it, mostly nice people to work with. Payed well and gave me 40 hours which i was looking for"
good,"Good company to work for. The pay was low, but it was a job and a good part-time job while going to school. They were flexible with the schedule and worked around different things going on during and outside of school."
good,"I worked at City Market from 2007-2013, and in that time I was promoted several times. Kroger provided me with healthcare—before the Affordable Care Act—and job security. Unfortunately, during my last few months with the company, I didn't see eye-to-eye with the new management, and I made a terrible mistake—I deserted my job. I would definitely handle things differently today. When all is said and done, Kroger is a great company with many opportunities for advancement. My advice is to work hard, and stick with it!"
good,I always came to work with a smile on my face to make them fell welcome a kroger. I think this is a good place to work at if you have good customer service skills. I enjoyed baking bread and the smell of it when it comes out of the oven. The hard part is to stay positive and not let no one put you down.
good,"When I was a cashier at Kroger everything was a breeze. Everyone became like a family to me even some of the familiar customers. The hardest part of the job for me was definitely interacting and keeping a pleasant appearance with some the customers who came into the store with attitudes, but other than that working there was great."
good,Always be on time. Stay on top of your job and others. Always look presentable and look occupied. It's good to ask to help others if your do with your work
good,Filling our duties on a everyday basis. Making sure that your task was taken care at the end of the day.Helping costumer get comfortable with out company.
good,Typical grocery store job. Challenging at times with the store being crowded during peak hours. Was understaffed in some departments. Turnover was high. Management tried to keep store as tidy as possible but was stretched thin. Store was starting to outgrow the space it was in. Favorite part of the job was the people I worked with.
good,"I feel we got all along but when the head person came and start having words with our store manager and then our hrs got cut for some apparent reason,"
good,Quick paced but is enjoyable. Learned a great amount while working in the service. Recommend if anyone wants to start things off. A preview on the the food industries would be like.
good,It was a positive working environment that helped me learn how to manage customers and problems around the store and with food. The experience was beneficial in helping my social and cleaning skills. The experience also relies on self responsibility and effort.
good,I love the people I work with no complaints there. The only problem I have is you cannot cash out on sick pay and I've been with the company 12 years and I only get a little over 3 weeks of vacation.
good,"I had a great experience at working at Kroger, it put my foot in the door for work experience, the staff was very kind and helpful in training me. Working with costomers helped me get out of my shell and mature more as this being my first job."
good,Kroger is a good company but there is no work life balance. You must be prepared to work most all weekends and holidays. I normally end up working a 6 day work week because staff shortages. This can become difficult to maintain a person life with this type of schedule. Many stores are open 24 hours per day. As you promote up through management this does not change.
good,"I liked working at Kroger the night shift was quiet and fast paced so it went by fast stocking shelves it takes some time for your body to adjust to all the moving your back does so be prepared to be a little bit sore the first week. management was very helpful and did give me days off whenever i requested them.if you work nights, you almost always get your 40 hours so its easier to make full time status."
good,Great place to work with flexible hours and discount benefits for employees. Increases pay the longer you are with the company. I would work for this company again.
good,"Cashier/Stocker/In store deli service assisting customers with directions, assisted meat department, and cashed checks for customers, also money orders"

good,"good place to learn new things "
good,"An overall amazing place to be employed at. The atmosphere is very inviting, and everything you need training wise is taught on site and you are paid to do it. If you work hard and do your job, management will gladly cross train you in other departments, and there is s lot upwards flexibility."
good,"Overall working for Pick N Save was a great experience. I received he proper training I needed to perform the job tasks at hand, I worked with an incredible team, as well as received very valuable benefits!"

good,As an employee for Home Depot and Kroger I was a stocker as well as a customer service my job was to stop merchandise on the Shelf of the store and provide customer service to customers in a timely manner

good,I learned how to better work with others. a typical day at work was easy overall. My managers was always there to help. The most enjoyable part about the job was they gave us rewards for the amount of time I worked there.
good,For the bakery i would stock the bakery and clean bakery and make sure everything was clean for next day. Loved that there would be a variety of people to speak with along providing customer service.
good,"I started as a meat department clerk.  After a year, I was promoted to department assistant manager.  An important determinant to en employee or manger's work experience is the quality of the help.  I found this to vary from store to store."
good,The company as a whole is fun to work for. Plenty of opportunities for anyone to grow and become something . Also activities within and outside the company help others grow as well
good,I loved Kroger marketplace it was a great and friendly environment to work in. I had to resign from working there due to family issues. I would have worked there much longer if I could have. management and staff were amazing!
good,Its Kroger so i wouldnt expect much. They can be good to employees or they can be awful to you you. It all depends on how management is feeling that day.
good,"A great place to work! Friendly people and clean environment! Every day was a new challenge, but interesting nonetheless! The hardest part of the job was the learning curve needed to work in the pharmacy but it was worth it!"
good,"Kroger was one of the best places ive worked, management was great the only down fall was the pay was not the best and advancement was really not as easy as people make it seem unless you have a degree"
good,I enjoyed working at Kroger. You got to interact and meet a lot of cool people. It wasn't anything too difficult and I always seemed to have a smooth day

good,"Kroger allows for flexibility of your work schedule. They are willing to work with you on hours. Kroger also offers many opportunities to advance. This job is also part off the union, so job security is a plus. Raises are also given based on how many hours you work, so there is always room to increase your wages."
good,"Meet and greet customers, work cash register, answer questions about products and services.  Learned how to communicate with customers.  Great atmosphere to work in."
good,"There is no typical day, as this was the Corporate office for the Central Division stores. Though there are reports due on a particular schedule, the week began with getting the set up and prepared.  The management staff is generally good to get along with, detail oriented, friendly and concerned about work life balance. The hardest part if any, is that you do have to deal with calls from the outside public that think but have no clue how things operate, so skills in public relations and patience do come into play. The company over all does pride itself as being one big happy family, which only testament to the people who have worked there most of their lives, all in all a really nice place to work."
good,This store really taught me a lot of how to be great in customer service. Even though it is very fast paste. Kroger is always up to date and allows you to get the hours. That you want.
good,"I currently work in the pharmacy it depends on if you have a fast paced store or a slow store how busy you will actually be from day to day. Day usually consist of checking patients out and fill prescriptions based on your qualifications. Patients get to know you, you get to know them they learn names and it makes the experience more personal."
good,"A great job for those looking to pursue a degree and work at the same time. Decent environment, questionable management. All in all a great job with plenty of room to advance."
good,"regular stocking duties,regular meetings to get updates on store information. employees are pleasant to work with.job is not stressful. some chances for advancement. management for the most part is easy to work with,and they listen to your concerns."

good,Great job great customer loving doing my job with the crew members and I think it's and good job with and great staff always something to do and have fun doing the job
good,"I started working for Kroger halfway through my sophomore year in High School. I continued to work there until I moved states to go to college in 2016. I enjoyed my time as a cashier with the company because I was able to interact with so many new people each day and grow as a person though that experience. My management shifted quite frequently which left the team disoriented at time, but any issues never got out of hand."
good,"I enjoyed the atmosphere that the pharmacy department at my Kroger store gave me and the people around. Everyone was ready to help when needed and the pace was productive, fun, and lively"
good,horrible company and not enough hours. The rate of pay is very low and the management is not properly trained and does not hold everyone accountable for their actions.

good,"the way things get done in a work day at a retail grocery store."
good,The work was very hard and people needed to be on the ball and consistent.  I enjoy working hard so it didn't bother me and I had amazing co-workers that always did their part.
good,"Typical day:"
good,"Worked alone, no technician help or pharmacist overlap. Depends on the manager but rarely micromanaged. For retail setting, it has good hours. Not enough resources invested in the right place when implementing programming. No mentoring. Self learning."
good,"Great positive atmosphere that kept employees happy and motivated. Kroger provided me with my first job, and numerous friendships and memories. Great place to enter the workforce as a teenager."
good,"Hours are very flexible and the job is not too demanding. Need a considerable amount of patience, you deal with upset customers quite often. Overall, would recommend."
good,Assured the daily needs were being meet to the customers who obtain gas and other items from the fuel center; also assured that schedule of crew was cover as well as ordering of fuel center products.
good,Good hours for students.  Great training program with good management at all stores.  Company works well with student schedules.  Was always accomodating with work and life balance
good,my very first job started as a bag boy and work my way up to frozen manger very stressful and grueling hours but it was a good work place. the hardest part about this job was me being so young and having all being responsible for grown people kinda rub some employers the wrong way

good,"A typical day at Kroger involves customer service and support, and interpersonal skills with peers. The workplace culture is very good and management really does make you feel like they care."
good,I was a deli cook here for a year and a half before I got myself fired for not showing up.  It was nice working here but a 50 cent raise after a year and a half of full time employment was not worth it.  A typical day in the deli would consist of nonstop cooking and customer service ( multitasking).  Management was cool and had lots of respect for their employees.  The hardest part of the job was watching kids steal liquor right in front of the deli and having them taunt us.  I enjoyed snacking on the deli food while no one was around.
good,This company is a great place to work for. It brings the best out of a person. They promote within the company and gives great training. The customers are really nice and very understanding.
good,The company accommodates their employees in ways to ensure employment. I have worked there throughout graduate school and I really enjoy it. it is a great company to work for.
good,"Kroger had a very friendly environment. The customers, managers, and employees were nice and helpful. Management took time to train. Hours were flexible."
good,Great grocery store and friendly staff. Good high school job and great way to improve customer relations skills. Couldve been better about promotions and raises.
good,"Every day I come in, I come up to the front end to bag groceries, greet people, and occasionally I am asked to perform other tasks throughout the store, such as gathering carts from the parking lot or cleaning spills, etc."
good,The work done at this store is very strenuous and sometimes exhausting. You are expected to do a good job with unreal restrictions on how fast or efficient you may do it. You are often reprimanded if you push too many carts even when it is necassary to satisfy the amount of customers at the store. A bagger has more jobs than anyone in the store and makes the minimum amount possible
good,"replenish fruits"
good,"They hired me telling me I would make 10.05 an hour, I left the job I was currently working which was 10.00 an hour. When I go into my first day of work they tell me that I will actually be paid 8.50 an hour. I feel that I was tricked into taking the job."
good,"The company is very progressive and support employees. However because my interest is very much in MTM and CMR, and they are not ready to hire a full time clinical pharmacist in my area, I am willing to leave Kroger to get a full time MTM and CMR pharmacist position."
good,Everyone was very nice and friendly I never had and problems I couldn't handle and all the managers just want to see you work hard and work around your needs
good,"Worked for King Soopers for 30 years. Job security was beyond reproach. Fun environment to work in and opportunities for advancement were available. Wished I still worked there, great pay and benefits."
good,"my experience at Kroger was a good one. the management team were very polite and supportive. I would consider coming back on day, the pay could have been better."

good,"Gathered and removed rubble, dirt, and hazardous waste from construction site."
good,"While the time I worked there was short, the Kroger company is one that takes pride in its work ethic. From the outside looking in, I could tell this place was one of high status. And from the inside looking out, I can see why the employees there seem to enjoy what they do. The management was helpful, the instructions were informative, and there were staff who were always willing to give me a hand if I had any questions."
good,Good job with easy advancement as long as you put your work in and show up to work. Overall easy place to work with and make friends with your Coworkers.
good,"My schedule was always open for me to change it if I have a reasonable request, and the management was awesome, would work here again. Very good environment, and pay was good, should of been more."
good,I was able to assist customers in their time of need. i was pretty much always busy so i did not have time to wander or get into any trouble. Kroger taught me how to be patient.
good,"Majority of the day, worked on an electric pallet truck by myself. The workers are great people but usually stand and talk when work needed to be done. Overall, it was a good experience."
good,In every department i was in everyone was very open and was intelligent and enjoyable to work with. They had lots of training opportunities to be a part of and i took advantage of most of them.
good,At Kroger you learn a lot about customer service and good work habits. Management is always available to assist you by any means and will teach you hands on what a task requires. The work force is very diverse and makes sure the culture of the store stays positive and well rounded. Kroger does a fantastic job with working around your personal schedule and gives you the power to balance your life and your work.

good,"Kroger is a very diverse company, offers many opportunities for growth, and is very fast paced. "
good,"Teaches you time management, and basic skills to sales management. The workplace culture is fun depending on management, but overall you have a lot of freedom."
good,If you are willing to start and build then Kroger is a good place to go. How ever flexible schedule is required but the u ion helps keeps things balanced.
good,I worked for them for 4 years. They were fair. I am very well versed in customer service because of this job. All of the workers were friendly but still got their work done.
good,"The job was fair. Coworkers and managers were nice. It was just a summer job. It was very basic, easy work. Most of my coworkers were high school/college students."
good,"The environment was very friendly and well organized. They will work with you on your schedule just case your in school or have children at home.  A typical day at work is fun and very busy on some days, especially around the first of the month."
good,"A typical day would be assisting and serving customers."
good,"Usually when i work things are very smooth. some days are hectic but, i still manage to get through. i learned that customers are always right and also come first. management is ok sometimes they have there days. I handle go backs, price checks, help and communicate with customers. hardest part is when i'm working alone. the enjoyable part i understand everyone feelings and everyone has a smile"
good,I just think that some managers should be attentive to their employees.And stop firing people for no reason.I think that it should be a lawsuit thanks
good,Getting to know customers what my favorite part of this job. I am very glad to have the experience and skills that I acquired while working here. thanks!
good,"Decent place to work. Good for someone in need of a quick job, or currently enrolled in high school or college. Would recommend to an acquaintance to work there."
good,This job allows you to cross path with people with every walk of life.   it is an enjoyment to see the customer that comes in every week just to see me and sometimes just looking for a kind word
good,A typical day would be greeting customers and making sure teal is balance. I have learn how to make sure things is balance and make sure you count it twice if you have to.
good,Produce Clerk. Interacted with a lot of customers which was both fun and sometimes infuriating. Good work culture. Politics with other departments was always a challenge to solve.
good,"This company has great service, they make sure that the customer is   satisfied and has everything they need. working in marianos will help you become a better person and and it teaches you different ways to deal with certain situations because of how diverse the store is."
good,A typical day at work involves cashiering and saying hello to customers. then after about two hours going on a break for about fifteen minutes. I learned through out working there that I am beginning to get out of my comfort zone. The management at Pick n' Save is pretty well. I really enjoy the fact that the managers are very understanding about everything. One of the hardest parts of a job is that I am in a wheelchair and all I really can do the whole time I'm working is sit in one spot and nothing else. On the other hand the most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that all my co workers are very kind to me and everyone around me.
good,"I enjoy the people I work with and the work I do, but management is callous, unforgiving, and often straight up rude to their employees."
good,A typical day started by stocking meat and seafood display cases. then it was time to stock the shelves from cooler with product. customer interaction was expected.
good,"To be honest, my time working here was very short. I cannot really say much. Within that short time I met many very mature and understanding people. They worked hard and I put my best foot forward, hoping that I would not let them down."
good,"I work 5 days a week, and the schedule was never the same. However, I learned many different aspects of a store. I learned how to manage money, and use a cashier. I also learned how to run a liquor store and follow state guidelines.The hardest part was the hours because they were never the same and the amount of hours a week could have been far, few, and in between.  I loved all the people I met and all the friends I made."
good,A day at Kroger consisted of 8 hours of taking care and solving customer's issues. It also included counting numerous amounts of money from the cashier drawers. I learned how to solve problems quickly and sufficiently. Management was great and had the store running very well. The work atmosphere was filled with young and vibrant personalities. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the hectic holiday crowd but the most enjoyable was putting a smile on the customer's face.
good,When I started I loved the job. Met great people but after my deli manager retired everything went down hill. They wasn't hiring anyone in the deli. there was nights that I had no one from 6pm to close so I had to close by myself. I had to slice meat and run the food bar alone and I had customers that felt bad for me and went to management but still nothing was done.
good,"i typical work 6 hour days, 4 days a week.  i learned that im really god with people during my year at Kroger. the management was great along with my fellow coworkers."

good,"I had a wonderful time working for the Kroger company, I was just not offered enough hours to be able to take care of my family as being a single mother."
good,It is a great place to work.  I'm sorry I ever left Kroger to work for Holiday Retirement. The people are a good bunch. They are always willing to help with anything. customers are friendly and patient.
good,"This job is a simple job not require a lot. You are simply shopping for others, and if you would not buy it for yourself do not give it to the customer."
good,I enjoyed meeting new people on a daily basis and being able to do anything i put my mind to as far as making the store a better place
good,i was a cashier so you got to meet new people everday. some were nice and then you get a few that was just unhappy. but overall it was a freindly place to work.only thing is if you had to work nights it was late.
good,The job was good.First job while I was in high school. Convenient because the town is really small so everyone knew each other.
good,"I worked in the floral department at Kroger, deciding prices, servicing customers, stocking, and making the floral arrangements."
good,Fine place to shop if you ever just drive by one . Has a minimal of what you think you would ever need ! Helpful workers . If u ever have a question just look around an one of them would be there !
good,"The people you work with tend to be great. The hours vary but they're flexible with my school schedule, which i love. The pay is terrible though (minimum wage for me). Would recommend if you're in high school or college."
good,My time with Kroger Inc was spent in the fuel center. I did enjoy my time there with the customers. The down side is not enough coverage to allow adequate breaks.
good,Kroger is a great job with many opportunities. Whether its your first job or not they have many options as well as many balanced managers. Working for Kroger is a great first opportunity to get your foot in with a great company.
good,Not much to say really. I worked for facility engineering where we did all the stores maintenance. I had 15 stores that I oversaw all the maintenance on the store owned equipment.

good,"Some good days and some not so good days, but Kroger pharmacy is not a bad place to work. I enjoy my coworkers and several customers. We are a diverse group, but very accepting of one another."
good,Overall Kroger is a great company to work for because they have a family store feel. Management is willing to work with you to accomplish your goals.
good,This Kroger was an overall good place to work at.  I had wonderful customers and wonderful co-workers.  I didn't enjoy working late hours however but that was something that I had to do. This Kroger was a great place to shop and had a wide variety of items to choose from.
good,"Clock in. How to run cash register and worked in the front office. Customer service. Good management. Friendly. When it got busy you had to stay calm. Helping the customers.Did Western Union, handled returned checks, answered telephones and handled money deposits. Took care of front end cashiers breaks and lunches. Relieved for breaks and lunches.When busy opened register."

good,"I learned how to work a cash register and was trained for a week before I was able to work on my own. I learned that not every customer is kind, so I had to accommodate to their needs whether they were right or wrong. However, the customer is always right. That might have been the hardest part of the job, but the most enjoyable part was when regular customers would come and make conversation with me like I was a person, not a robot."
good,"On a typical work day, i would have about two or three rude customers come to my department, but that wouldn't discourage me i would continue my day with a smile on my face and if needed i would talk to one of the store mangers to get my head back on right."
good,"Great people to work with, and a good place to learn and the slowly move up into different things for you. It is a pretty good place to be, had no problems."
good,great co workers everybody gets along . usually busy between 4-815 the normal times for them to be busy and a lot of traffic. great customer service no complaints.

good,"I started in the pharmacy clerk for 3 years, I would help customers also stock patients medications...make sure Pharmacist is stocked with bags, area is clean, put patients information in the computers. I really enjoyed working with the employees worked as a team."
good,"Great place to work, learn about sales and grocery, nice and accepting coworkers, the store is run by acceptional mangers that are very understanding"
good,You start off with the regular. but over all i learned that you need to be fast and organized. management understands that you have things outside your work and if chhanged aare needed then it will be changed.
good,". I once had multiple interviews with an organization, including one that required me to drive six hours round-trip. The responsibilities seemed like a great fit for my experience. I liked the people I interviewed with. They liked me. And then I learned the salary. The gap between my requirements and what they could offer was too large to surmount."

good,great hours and a great place to work. i learned alot for it to be my first job. my co-workers was great. wouldn't work with my hours and i just had my son.
good,"Almost everyone was amazing in my experience at Kroger. The head store managers and a few of the co managers were not the greatest people. They highly micromanaged over a few things and made waiting on customers and trying to complete day to day tasks very frustrating and actually put us behind most days. They were also unwilling to assist when we were behind. There were only two or three managers like this though, the rest were absolutely amazing as was most days of work."
good,"as a meat clerk i would cut & package meat for customers."
good,"HR and management work around your school schedule. If items in the backroom son't get put on the sales floor the blame gets pushed on the next shift and that shift blames the previous shift. They need a safety person in store. I try to put my safety input in but feel that it is not that important to management. Co-workers are ok to work with. A lot of stress is on every department because the store is understaffed. Management expects you to get products out on the floor but some individualists like myself have to cover multiple departments on second shift so it the product either gets put out later, never gets but out (because management doesn't want to pay overtime) or if it get real back management puts the product out on the floor."
good,"Loved making decorating cakes! I also helped out in other places like the deli, bakery, and making sure produced was on the floor."
good,Kroger is a good company to work for and the benefits are also OK  Kroger company also try to work around your schedule and your family if you are looking for a stable job Kroger is the place
good,It is a great job for a teenager just starting out .i like it very much i just need something with a better pay ..i have nothing bad to about rule foods
good,"I don't have any complaints about Nashville's corporate office. Most days are 9 hour work days with a short 4-hour Friday to follow. We get paid every week. The work can be intense at times, but the teams I've worked with can be extremely helpful. Healthcare benefits are extremely affordable for individuals and families."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is working with my team/coworkers. I've learned that you should always be kind to people because you never know what is going on. As far as management, they don't work with you as much as they should and it seems we work harder than the manager."
good,"There are many opportunities to grow yourself, advance and move up and around with Kroger.  With nearly 3,000 stores, 20 Divisions, 40 Manufacturing plants and Distribution centers, there is an opportunity for everyone and as an associate, you can do many different things.  Work/Lift balance can vary substantially on your job function."
good,Their is always something to do - you always stay busy which of course is a good thing.  I have been with the company for 7 yrs and it had been wonderful.
good,"A typical day at the Mariano's deli would include slicing meats and cheeses for customers at the required slice thickness. Others tasks would be serving salads, knowing proper measurements, taking catering orders and efficiently providing kind and fast service. On certain days I would open the deli or close the deli. To properly open our deli we would count the previous days production like sandwiches, fully cooked cold foods, salads, and many other items. After that our system(Periscope) would tell us how many more of those certain items would need to be produced based on our current inventory. We then would fill/ make salads, fill olives, replenish the deli meat/ cheese show case, and begin to serve customers. While doing these things we were also required to go back and forth making custom catering orders and the normal periscope items. Closing the deli was comparatively simple; including serving customers and cleaning the whole deli. Not to forget checking temperatures on all products/ cases, and signing the cleaning log."
good,"I would make sure that I used all resources to help my customer to resolve any issues that they were having and if I could not, I would find or locate them to the right department."
good,I really enjoyed baking the cookies. It was a very small staff and huge communication gaps. To much drama and drugs. Had the highest turnover in employees

good,"A typical work day at a Kroger deli often starts before 8 AM, that is when we prepare the cold salads for the case, and review customer orders for the day. It can be quite difficult, at times, to maintain composure when the customers rush in and mob the deli, particularly around the holidays. Hardest parts of the job there is trying to help as many customers as possible, especially when short staffed, and not completely burn yourself out. Often times employees must juggle several tasks at once to ensure everything is done in a timely and orderly fashion."
good,"I loved working here. My coworkers were so kind, I loved the benefits and the employee reward card. "
good,"This job is great if you are a high school student or college student looking for a part time job, because they are very flexible around your school schedule. I would not recommend this job as a career, because they do not pay very well first starting out and don't give you a whole lot of hours when first starting your job."
good,"Great company with good workers! I learned to multi task and work with other employees, as well as work with customers to achieve great customer service experience. The hardest part of the job was organizing your day with the employees you worked with to get the job done, while keeping up with the schedule especially when it got busy! The most enjoyable part of the day was seeing all my customers and bringing a smile to their faces!"

good,I was working there it was a nice job and I was making good money there I stopped working there cause I move from Houston back to orange
good,Just being with the customers and the other employees are a plus. The hardest part of the job is doing the truck. Many boxes are heavy. A typical day is getting to work and doing the truck then going to the registers and checking out the items for the customer.

good,"I enjoy the work environment, and the people I work with. Since starting in february of 2016, I have been promoted from produce to the deli and meat department."
good,I was hired as a bagger but was moved to cashiering fairly quickly.  The store I worked at eventually put in a movie rental place that I took over and managed it.  I was also responsible for working out the Drug/GM products for the store and was over ordering the cosmetics and tobacco for this location.  I then moved to Conway and continued with the company where I was a cashier but then moved to customer service where I learned accounting and doing payroll as well.

good,Its a very hands on and fast paced job. They take the time to train you in all aspects of your job.  After working for 9 months you get great health insurance even if you only work part time. You also get a 10% off discount on all Kroger products.  They don't always grant schedule requests though
good,"Learned a lot about customer experience and was very happy I got to learn what I did about produce and nutrition. My Managers were always challenging me to see how far I could push myself and go, I think more workplaces should follow that and push their associates to see what they can really accomplish."
good,this is a good company to work for .  they have good pay and good benefits  if you are full time you get paid vacations i worked over night so i was unloaded the truck and stocking shelves .

good,"Overall, Kroger is a good company to work for. There are good benefits available and lots of ways to make new friends in the workplace. Managers are nice, but also strict."
good,"I enjoy going to work every day because Kroger gives me the opportunity to interact with great people and help others on a daily basis. There are many ways to make sure a customer gets great service. I have worked in many departments, and each area meets the goal of customer satisfaction in a different way. For example, as a stock clerk, your job is to ensure that the shelves are full of merchandise and not out of what the customer has come to the store for. At customer service, your main goal is to listen to any concerns, solve issues, and even furthur, exceed expectations. As a supervisor, your job is to anticipate potential problems and preemptively solve them, and ensure the workflow at the front end continues efficiently. Management has seen the potential in me and given me the opportunity to grow by promoting me to a supervisor and continued to help me grow both in this position and as a person. My co-workers have become my second family and I have learned so much from each and every person I have had the honor of working with. I don't feel that I get fair compensation for my loyalty to the company, however the best part of my job is that I get to build great relationships with customers and co-workers. I have met some of the best people working with this company."
good,"I've enjoyed working at Kroger but would like to advance in my career. "
good,"It's a nice place to work at."
good,great place to work. You will learn a lot at this company. You have to be a people person to enjoy and deal with this job for you deal with nothing but the public.
good,"Majority of employees showed up at scheduled times due to satisfactory work environment; I learned food processing and packaging, good customer service skills, and communication skills. Co- workers were enjoyable and all got along; restocking because tedious due to heavy crowds in the aisles. Working with the public became enjoyable."

good,"Its a good place to work at, they just need to be more fair to the employees. I have learned alot about my surroundings, The customers can be nice sometimes. My management isn't fair to alot of people. My coworkers are great people. The hardest part of my job is the closing shift when there is only one cashier after a certain time. I enjoy being with my fellow friends and laughing all the time."
good,My Co-workers were very helpful during training and also while on the floor. Great attitudes was all I ever received from everyone.

good,I have learned that people generally are willing to give a company 100 percent and willing to provide for their families. They also are eager to try new things as well as new skills.
good,My first job dealing with the public that would prove a valuable asset for the rest of career. Management constantly provided training that allowed advancement from within. Long hours and lack of compensation shortened my career with this company.

good,"Working as a Courtesy Clerk at Kroger Supermarkets was a great first job with friendly coworkers/management, and consistent workflow/scheduling. Employees are encouraged to work together in order to ensure maximum customer satisfaction and optimal work place environment; therefore, building healthy workplace friendships came easy. All staff worked hard to make sure all employees were happy with their work, and excelled in the workplace."

good,"I like working there. It's easy. Talking to the customers can be fun. I like my coworkers. I don't feel that the training matches up to the experience. They drop you in. It is ok if you absorb things instantly. If you don't, be prepared to ask for help often."
good,A typical day at Kroger's is mostly business with customers and trying to get them everything that they need. I've learned a lot about how to handle a business and manage a busy environment and keep control throughout the day to day operations. I co works are very nice and respectful and hardworking and we all encourage each other to get the job done. The hardest point about my job is having the patience to deal with other customers that can be kind of difficult. I enjoy working with other and interacting with customers.

good,"As dept. manager, I am in charge of around 50-60 people. It was my responsibility to make sure the department was running smoothly while I was there. I deal with more than 500 customers in a week and all the associates. The hardest part was learning how to work with and manage so many different people who have different personalities. When I figure out a new way to communicate with an associate it makes the job enjoyable. The day to day interactions with people are enjoyable too. One of the hardest parts is making the schedule because not everyone will be happy, but if a majority are then it's not too bad."
good,"Working here was great. It was fun, very fast paced and excellent to work in. Very relaxed and able to complete tasks at the end of every shift."
good,"A typical day of working as a stocker is I come in, assess what is there to stock, begin stocking it, and condition my department if I am the closer. I learned how to give great customer service, and work under stress with speed. The management is helpful most of times, and all my co-workers were great to work with. The hardest part of my job is filling in as a cashier when the lines become crowded. The most enjoyable however is being self motivated to do all the work, when no one is watching you."
good,"We had to ring customers up in a timely manner checking ID making sure they found what they needed, I learned it is important to make sure you ring up things under the cart. management "

good,Could have some better people skills and know how to talk to people with out the favoritism.But it was alright while I was there.
good,Working at Kroger's I learned how to open up and talk to the customers. Make it right is our motto meaning if someone needs help we help them no matter how hard it is. The co-workers are like friends we laugh and play around but we still get the job done.
good,I would clock in and see my supervisor. get to meet new co workers that start that day its really cool. supervisor are friendly and hardworking. hardest part is knowing what is going on. breaks are 15 min long
good,It's not bad if you don't mind working all the time to get anywhere in the store management bracket. Not a bad place to start out at though.

good,"Working in this department over the last 1.5 years, has been an exciting and hard working job. I've learned a lot during this time, and continue to grow as an employee and person."
good,"A typical day at Kroger was to retrieve karts, bag customer groceries, and always be ready help a customer when needed if needed. From this being my first job I learned how to really push myself and get the job done day in day out. Management at the time was great, and it took them short notice to see how much of a hard worker I really am. My co-workers were great. Most of us were still in high school so it was easy to stick together as a team getting work done, but also for those who were not. The hardest part of the job was on bad weather days having to retrieve those karts. The most enjoyable part was seeing how happy I made the customers and my fellow co-workers from all my hard work."
good,"I'm a full-time student, and management has always been more than understanding and accommodating with my schedule, if I ask for fewer hours or tell them I have an extra day I can work that week, they always comply. The work is hard, but it's usually harder than it should be because of co-workers. Most of the employees there do the bare minimum and it is really straining."
good,"I left because my family was relocating to Texas, due to this fact I had to resign my position there. Otherwise I would have stayed and moved up in the Company."
good,"Kroger was my first time working in that kind of environment and I can truly say it was an enjoyable one. the people I meet there were nice and engaging. The customers for the most part were respectful and nice.My typical day was I would walk in check the temperatures of all the cold cases. I would then help customers if there were any and also load the case, slice meat, or start the rotisserie chickens. Followed by that I would clean up the work space. The most important lesson i learned from Kroger was treat others how you would like to be treated and always provide good customer service."
good,"It was a fine job overall, I wasn't too fond of the hours(~3-10pm) but it worked out in the end. My co-workers were good people, and made working there that much better, and the managers kept everything running smoothly."

good,Kroger is great company to work for. They pay well and they are secure. There is always something to do at work. I enjoyed working there.
good,best job i have ever done and would do it again when given the opportunity and chance. good working environment and nice pay
good,Working in the Kroger Product dept help me better understand teamwork and getting along with others. There I learned how to pay attention to detail.
good,"Overall, I have had a great experience with this company. I like that they do work with your availability. I only work the third shift so a typical night at Kroger is focusing on the job at hand and not so much the customers (due to the store being closed two hours after I arrive). "
good,"I was always productive through my shift which allowed me to get a relationship with my boss, He showed me alot of things while i was working there. The bad well I had to pick up the slack most of the time from the others."
good,"Excellent place for advancement and overall great place to enjoy oneself. Hours are consuming, but fulfilling and at times be stressful."

good,Roundys is a fast pace company you have to be a team player to work there its fun nice once you get there you already know what to do
good,Management and co-workers very helpful. The most ejoyable part of the job is the different customers.Least favorite part is how there is a set schedule of shifts.
good,"I like working here, I thrive on organization and take pride in my work,I have come to enjoy the company of people the condition of the store and the yearly proffit sharing check!"
good,"Kroger was my first paying job. It was a little different from what the average 18 yeard old worked at. I did learn a lot from working there, and I also made some long lasting friendships. The hardest part about working there was working around my available schedule. The co-workers were overall very lovely. However, there were some cases where they weren't. The management at Kroger is very strong and reliable. They we're very considerate when I needed help with something."
good,This was my first job at 15. I was a cashier working with other teens I loved going to work. I work 4 hrs during the week and 8 hours on the weekend.
good,Good. It's has a friendly atmosphere. The employees work very hard to help out the customers. The management team are very helpful in assisting the employees and customers.

good,"fun place to work, great management. able to get creative with cake decorating. good customer base. benefits could have been better."
good,Fun and fast pace environment. Enjoy working the customers that comes in the store. Friendly co-workers. Great management team

good,loved my job as a deli clerk. the co workers were nice and I fit right in. I like helping the customers with their needs. you received your quarterly raises. and you get discounts.
good,I loved working at kroger!! It was very easy to get off if needed and to change my schedule at the touch of a button. The bad of the job is I worked for several months and never advanced position wise (did receive several raises tho) and I had to go outside regardless of weather. Loved the managers at my store though!!
good,"Was able to learn skills that have allowed to gain employment with other companies. Learned the mechanics behind different cuts and packaging of meats. Remembering the varieties of meats and seafood was the hardest part of the job. Actually, learning how to cut meats from different parts of animals: such as the cow and pig."
good,I had a blast while I worked at Kroger.  We had very good bosses and co-workers were great.   It obviously doesn't pay well so its not a job where you could make a career at but overall I liked it.
good,Very nice staff. Consistent customer base. Friendly atmosphere. Sometimes high pace but always interesting. Would definitely work there again. The hours sometimes sucked but normal for that position.
good,"I learned to run cash register, bag items. My co-workers were ok. The management was not that good. I had problems with one of the managers."

There is so much going on in multiple departments that it is almost impossible to keep tabs on everyone/thing and take care of your own duties.  Your day usually ends when you decide to put your foot down and say ""it's time to go, because I'm never going to get out of here!""  Being at the mercy of the general public didn't help either.  "

good,"With proper notification, the management can help maintain a balance between job and life balance. Though it is important to step up to the plate if a break, lunch, or schedule change is not satisfactory. Retail can be a difficult environment, though many of the issues I have with my occupation is also specific to my location and my fellow employees. It is a very demanding environment, and when it is busy, it can easily become overwhelming to some. Since I am older, my shifts tend to have me working until midnight by myself, though I can work independently. Even though it can be tough, I have received enough training and have enough experience to handle each daily challenge."

Another activity that is done on a regular work day is helping customers in the bakery and writing on cakes for them as well. At Kroger I've learned how to write on cakes for customers. Management there is wonderful they all know you by name and actually engage in conversation with you and want to know you as a person not just an employee. My co-workers are great they are always helpful and encouraging to customers and other co-workers. The hardest part of the job is doing the closing checklist while still assisting customers.

good,"I had a great manager. I will say it is very hard work and if you want full time employment Do Not Go To KROGER. I waited for 3 years"
good,"The Kroger Company is a great company to work for, however, it is difficult to move up in the company.  It almost seems like they try to block every door for an internal to move up in the company.  They only want to hire outsiders.  A typical day at work for me would include coming in and doing a replenishment report which is filling out of stocks on the floor if the product is available, then if the product is not available making appropriate changes in the CAO system so the system will order it for the next truck.  Then if a truck day, myself and another associate would work the day's truck."
good,Like coming into work and interacting with customers and other employees yet the store is not ran very strict until corporate is going to show up then we have to bust our butts to do work that should be done a daily basis to keep the store looking good and clean.

good,"I loved working at Kroger, employees and managers were very nice. love the customers and friends I made working there. Overall a great place to work."
good,Typical day primarily revolved around filling the shelves and making sure everything was organized and professional. I learned everything from customer and employee interactions to inventory management. Everything you would need to make the jump into a more challenging position. The management is professional and caring.  You will work with people form all walks of life. The hardest part of my position was employee discipline and the best part was interacting with customers.
good,"A normal day at work consists of heavy lifting, organization, cleanliness and time management. To start the day we must do a full cull of the department to rid the bad products so customers can buy the best and freshest produce available. Once the department is fresh and faced, we fill any empty holes or sale items and make sure the cooler is ready for the incoming delivery. We then make sure that we take any items from the delivery and put them out right away and prepare for rush periods. Later in the afternoon when it slows down after the noon rush and before the evening rush we make the rest of the delivery is put away and arrival dated. To close we must face the entire department and make sure any remaining holes are filled. Before leaving any trash must be thrown out and any refrigerated items must be placed in the cooler. The management team at Pick n Save is friendly and energetic and makes sure to help with any issues before prime time. My fellow co-workers are active and humorous as well as hard working individuals and use teamwork to get the job done. On any given day things can go wrong but you must learn to adapt and deal with the problem at hand. One of the hardest things to do is to handle the problem and keep your cool. Loads can be late, customers can be unhappy or unsatisfied and product can be sent in poor condition or cut completely form the order. Its only a problem or a bad day if you make it into one. Any bad day can be turned around and when everything is fixed or sorted out in the end you look back and realize that it wasn't even that bad or that difficult"
good,working for this company i have learned a better scene of team work working in a bistro we have to work together as a team and for that i am grateful but i feel as though  my time is up and i need to look for something a litter more challenging.

good,"worked in deli and bakery. priced product put on shelf,  decorated cakes. waited counter ,baked products.cleaned work area and did dishes."
good,"A typical day at work includes talking to customers and providing customers with information regarding their prescriptions. I learned a lot more about HIPAA guide lines and the penalties for not following them. There has been a lot of shuffling between supervisors, but management has done a good job at bringing in someone suitable for the job in an efficient manner. All the co-workers are friendly and very helpful. Hardest part about this job is the occasional irate customer. The most enjoyable part is the friendly co-workers, the sound of a customers voice when you have helped them, and the freedom to browse the internet between calls."
good,"I loved working at Kroger. The company shows that they appreciate their employees. The job was something that I really enjoyed. I worked the front desk, checking in guests, scheduling meetings and coordinating training classes for new hires. I would check all new hire paper work, see if any corrections are needed.

good,"A typical day at work would be to always provide customer service and give every customer a comfortable feeling. I would bag customers groceries and tell them to have a good day. Then later push carts or restock. I learned the importance of customer service from working here and met a lot of friendly co-workers. The hardest part of the job would just being in the harsh weather of outside pushing carts, but the most enjoyable part makes up the bad knowing you helped customers and being surrounded by your kind co workers for most of the day."
good,"My typical work day is fun,excellent,"
good,"I can only tell from my experience the 4 years I worked there, so a typical day was working self checkout or supervising. Trying to not allow any negative attitudes to effect mine. Trying to provide the best possible customer service I could at the time. "
good,Everyone here made me feel like family. Lots of room for promotion from within. In less then 3 months i was promoted 4 times.
good,"Stock product, keep the department clean, collect shopping cart from outside and bring them all in and clean them out. Great place to work"
good,"I'm responsible for being the last impression to our customers reflection of the store. I've learned that all the different people I interact with may require different approaches to handle. Management needs to communicate more. My co-workers are a wide range of cultures and personalities, which is interesting. The hardest part of my job is not having enough employees to keep things flowing effectively. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting the many different people."

My managers are awesome they always want their employees to feel secure and safe while working in their store. My co-workers are awesome as well they are very funny and great to chat with about either work, sports, or life in general.

good,"As the department head for the wine shop I was introduced to sales techniques, seminars and Kroger/Diageo sponsored winery tours in Napa Valley, CA."
good,Great place and the people are awesome.  A lot to do and no time to rest.
good,Answered customers’ questions and addressed problems and complaints in person and via phone. Helped customers select products that best fit their personal needs. Educated customers on product and service offerings. Offered exceptional customer service to differentiate and promote the company brand. Kept current on market and product trends to effectively answer customer questions. Built customer confidence by actively listening to their concerns and giving appropriate feedback.
good,Very good opportunity if you have the ability to move up. Very thorough when training for the job at hand. Communication is very good and you always know what you need to do and the expectations.
good,"Open in the morning, greet associates and store management, balance books from previous day. Coach employees, help on floors, assisting and directing customers.  I really enjoy working with people, and getting to know my customers!"
good,"a typical day at Kroger was scanning peoples groceries and helping people with questions"
good,Great customer service skills and great with people. Love the fast enviroments
good,great experience in customer service and retail. loved working here
good,Overall great place to work at! Great environment! Management and staff are such team players!
good,A typical day at Kroger is to clock in and immediately be thrown into a fast paced work day. This job taught me that sometimes being super busy can be rewarding and how to deal with some less than polite people. When not busy we are expected to clean or help customers. That is when the fun begins. Most of my coworkers are as competitive as I am so cleaning and pulling customers to our lanes becomes a friendly game. Our managers are fun people who aren't afraid to model some of the Halloween merchandise for us in the break room. One of the best things about Kroger though is that when we have a damaged crate of items we can't sell they will put the products in the break room and we can take as many as we want. I once scored a two weeks supply of instant Starbucks coffee.
good,kroger is a good place to work starting from a young age management is great its a good working environment
good,"Sitel                             "
good,"fast paced"
good,"Although it was work, I had alot of fun with the employees and my supervisor. It was a great learning experience."
good,Great pay and benefits. The work environment is very pleasant. The company strives to give the best shopping experience around
good,Work for not that much pay. Customers alright but sometimes mean
good,great company for students that are currently in school and seeking a part time job .
good,i love my job because it gave alot of benefits. i just knew everyday i was coming into a work place full of hardworking people.this would be the job i would want to work at again. just because of the people i work with before
good,Kroger is a great place for you to work if you are looking for the least amount or hours and really horrible pay.
good,"i work in a fast pace environment. smiling and greeting customers assisting with their needs. scan items for purchase. "
good,"good company to learn the retail industries pros and cons. "
good,"A typical day at Kroger would be determined by our weekly schedule.  If my supervisor needed me to be the cook, or bake, make party trays, or work inventory to the floor, or make the weekly orders that is what I did.  I learned that I could always learn and do more.  The management was great, they did the best for you.  I had great co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was making sure that I got all my work done before I went home, but it did get done.  The most enjoyable part of my job was taking care of the customer.  Making sure that their needs where always meet."
good,It was a cool place to work. Plenty of opportunity for advancement and lots of great benefits.
good,"Learned how to enter health insurance into the computer counted pills learned how to work drive thru..staff was very helpful when i needed assistance with anything ..the hardest part of the job was trying to handle the customer drive thru and keep up with what was going on in the pharmacy all at the same time in a timely manner..the most enjoyable part about this job was the friendly staff and them being able to work with my schedule,"
good,It's a job that keeps the paycheck going. The management there is pretty easy going and keep everyone moving in the right direction. Haven't been at this store to long but it sure has great possibilities!
good,"Fast Paced"
good,"A day consisted of balancing my drawer at the beginning of each shift and performed customer transactions. Advertised products, restock shelves, and return perishable items. At the end of each day, I balanced my drawer and closed."
good,the company is good but the particular store I was at was poorly ran. Management was not up to par.
good,"Kroger pharmacy was an amazing place to work for, and it was fun getting to know my co works as well as our patients"
good,"We had several, Culture Council events outside of work that promoted unity and fun."
good,"I was looking for a higher rate of  pay and more hours ,and less week end work. Went to truck driving school ,after I left kroger."
good,I loved working for food4less I had a set schedule I learned how to make over 360 sandwiches in 4 hours or less I had a great manager and my co-workers was fun to be around the hardest part of my job was me thinking I couldn't get it done the most enjoyable part is when I actual did it and in a timely manner with or without accommodation
good,I learned a lot about how to make customers happy. i learned to work with co-workers and managers to make the business run efficiently. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers.
good,"Learned customer service qualities. How to be a butcher. I dealt with meat and seafood. Stocking, cooking, packaging, unloading trucks into freezer. Managers taught me what i needed to be taught and pretty much gave me full responsibility of my day with the occasional monitoring of course. Only difficult part was clean up, it was a lot in the area working though which was understandable."
good,it was wat I needed when I had to make it I like to thank them for the opportunity they gave me.
good,I was the scheduled closer almost every night. I learned a lot about assisting customers and working with food. The management was always very friendly and helpful to the employees and customers. Most of my co workers were very helpful and a joy to work with.
good,It is always busy in retail. Never a dull moment. My managers are great and I feel I can go to them with any concerns of mine and they will listen. Benefits are awesome and you pay nothing compared to pretty much every where else. They are always looking for ways to help make their company a better place to shop at but also a great place to work at. It does get hard when hours get cut and it leaves you short handed in your department. When you are used to giving your customers a certain level of customer service and you have to scale back on that because you do not have enough people to help everyone its really hard. But the people I work with are great and we work together as a team and provide the best we can to our customers. My manager is so great at teaching me everything. Not just about my position but also teaches me about different things in the medical field.
good,"When I go in, I typically start on customer service.  Take care of any customers in the drive thru and at the counter.  We change stations every 2 hours.  Then, I usually do product dispensing.  Which you scan bottles, count medication, and label vials. After another 2 hours, I move to data entry.  There, you take customer information, doctor prescriptions and place them in the computer to be filled.  "
good,Not too busy and great staff help. Great pay but hours not the best for family life
good,"I enjoy working at Kroger because of the flexibility it offers.  They offer  tuition reimbursement, as well as full time employee benefits."
good,"A typically day at work started off the same as usual. I would walk in to the front of the store where I would clock in. Then after clocking in I would go help who ever looks like they need help with bagging. A few hours later one of the supervisors would ask me to go on carts for 30 minutes to an hour give or take. Basically I could stay out there as long as I wanted as long as carts were being brought in. Then I would come in and let the supervisor know that I was no longer out there so she could send someone else. Upon me walking in I would look to see if anyone needed help bagging if not then I would go over to what we called ""rejects"" which are more commonly known as the items that never got returned to where they were supposed to go. For example if a customer was going to purchase something and then realized they reluctantly forgot their wallet but in reality they probably just didn't want to buy anything after seeing the price. Well that stuff has to all be put back in the right place. Then while I'm doing that eventually it will get busy in the front and I'll get called on the microphone to come help bag. Usually I would get closing shifts that end at 11pm and if you are a bagger that closes then you have to make sure all the carts are inside before you leave. pretty much a regular. Co-workers were generally nice because they were in high school so we often had things in common."
good,"A typical work day was wrapping bread and taking cake orders. What I learned at this job was the many different types of breads. My co-workers were helpful at times when I needed. The hardest part of the job was not knowing a bread type to print out on the computer to be wrapped. Sometimes no-one was around to ask for 30 min. The most enjoyable part of the job was taking cake orders because, sometimes people would have their own twist of ideas and I could learn from the idea they have. I could use that idea at home."
good,"The job is good if you have good co-workers; they can make or break it. It's a union job so everyone starts off at the same pay rate and works their way up. If you're an above average worker you'll receive the same benefits as someone who doesn't work too well. If they're out of their probation period, you'll have to deal with them. However, that also means good job security. The management can also make or break the job. If your managers don't discipline or do their job then it'll make your job harder. This job is enjoyable if you're part of a good working team. Otherwise, keep looking."
good,fast pace and hard work. you can get fired for anything inn the first 30 days. management is half and half. co-workers can be friendly
good,"it could of been a lot better,i learned to deal with attitudes,management it was alright,my co-workers was alright with me,the hardest part of the job get called in because someone called off last minute and i had appointments i had to reschedule,co-workers and i get together for lunch and just had good old laughs."
good,"I started working at Kroger while I was in high school, then off and on through college. Kroger was a wonderful starter job because it taught me responsibility, the importance of customer service, and what my future career may consist of. A typical day of work was very busy, which is good in my opinion because you felt that you really accomplished something at the end of each shift. I learned a lot about different departments, how to do different jobs, and the importance of teamwork. Management was very flexible, worked with each individual department to help them reach goals set by corporate, and they were very understanding and flexible as long as you communicated with them. My co-workers were the same way. The hardest part of the job was switching between different departments on busy days and trying to keep up with your goals for the day. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know my co-workers on a personal level at company outings which were always a blast!"
good,Must have great customer service skills. Fast paced work environment. I loved the management and the advancement opportunities.
good,"Cool experience! very fun working here, however wish i couldve stayed longer"
good,Great place to work and meet interesting people. The manager position is laid back. Manager responsible for handling customers issues. Great employees that goes beyond their job description in pleasing our customers. Management enjoyed taking care of customer concerns assuring them great quality customer care.
good,"•	Safely and accurately calculate, build and assemble customer orders to prepare them for delivery, inner-yard transfer or customer pick-up."
good,"A typical day at work includes the first priority - customer service.  From there, my duties included a mirage of responsibilities including sales of food products, preparation of food products, and inventory maintenance to include identifying products that need quick movement, out-of-date and rotation of product daily.  I have had experience as a back-up to the department lead for a specialty  cheese department within the retail store I worked in as a Sales Associate.  I worked alongside approximately six to eight co-workers at any given time and trained many of those associates.  Each of the departments in the deli and bakery utilized employees to best meet the time constraints of many different duties and any given time and orchestrating those time constraints while providing excellent customer service required discipline and a great deal of knowledge regarding the preparation, sale and management of daily perishables.  My most enjoyable moments by far were when I received direct appreciation from my customers.  I am known for my customer service and sales skills and it pleases me to receive positive feedback."
good,"While working at Kroger, I've learned to better my communication skills, as well as learning all I could, from different departments. My job was challenging, working different departments was almost a struggle but I remained calmed and made sure no matter what I did I always made my customer feel more than comfortable to come to me for anything. The job itself is so fun, the employees are hilarious. We always made time to make each other laugh, but, when it came to handling our customers, when we did it, we did it right. The only hard part about the job was working a lot of hours on an empty stomach."
good,"A typical day at work began very exciting, I would have to stay in a refrigerated room most of my shift and unload pallets of product while also tending to the customers needs. What I mostly learned from it was time management. My managers pushed me to try my best everyday and were easy to get along with. My co-workers and I were mostly on the same page. I worked after them and they would leave me notes of what they did and organized for me so I could see what needed done. They were friendly. The hardest part of the job was truck days. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with, I made many friends."
good,"very family friendly"
good,"Employees were fun to work with, job had great pay and benefits. Each day was a new challenge to conquer."
good,a good work day i learned socal skills i did customer service things and pharmancy tech things i love working with people and seeing all the different personalities
good,There are many different jobs that would do one a daily bases. I would help cashier to remain focus one there jobs and to make sure they take there breaks in a timely manner. The management was strong and kept me on my feet. The hardest part of the day is when thing slowed down.
good,"•	Consistently maintain a positive attitude and enjoy helping people."
good,"Typical day is very productive, great co-workers and managers."
good,"Corporate Compliance, worked for 4 ""bosses"" who were responsible for federal, state and corporate compliance for the Kroger stores, plants, and distribution centers."
good,"First I create, edit and review all orders in my department. There isn't to much that's hard about my job except working in freezer day in and out. Co-workers and management sometimes get overwhelmed with what's going on from day to day pressures. I learn everyday to take each day and deal with each customer with respect and one problem at a time. Dealing with the varies customers is by far the best part of my job. No matter what's going on in your personal life, you never take your problems to work and enjoy life."
good,it was a great place to work fast pace and very productive. very diverse. company really cares about their employees.
good,The hardest part of the job was moving up and changing positions around the workplace.
good,I worked the night shift because I had to take care of a baby at the time. I did what my supervisor told me to do. I learned to be patient with customers and how to do my job. Co-workers were nice. I was happy when I made customers happy.
good,its a ok place to work co-workers and managers are always friendly and helpful but it don't pay enough
good,"The work is hard at Krogers but the benefits are really good!!!"
good,At Kroger the customers as well as the employers taught me how to treat other people better.
good,"you stock shelves, help customers, and unload trucks. Its a decent job."
good,"A typical day includes counting and sorting pills, entering insurance information and new prescriptions into the system, and releasing finished prescriptions to patients. The management and the co-workers were a delight to be around. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate patients. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the benefit of positive healthcare work."
good,Great company with good benefits. Enjoyed working for the company.
good,As a Co-manager for the Kroger company gave me the experience a manager goes through each day.
good,Work[ed there 7years the advancement with the company took awhile but it came management can be a bit of a hassle but i worked almost every department in the stores i worked in the experience was a good one
good,"Great work life balance.  "
good,Great working with people and also helping people in any way I can.
good,ive learn to work with others at a fast pace to get things done thru out the store.
good,I was loading and unloading trucks stocking shelves overnight. I would arrange things and the back with the forklift by picking up and dropping them
good,I've learn a lot in the 29yrs that I work at the company. The hardest part of my job was keeping up with the work dead lines.
good,"Kroger is an amazing place to work at. A typical day would be going to work, clock in and go find a supervisor to see what register i go to. I'll greet customers and be as polite as i possibly can. My co-workers are really nice and friendly and always willing to help. The hardest part of my job would have to be dealing with very rude customers, but i can handle it. The most enjoyable part would be talking to different people every day and all of the people I've met are great."
good,"From the start I loved it, 5 months in my days where hit or miss, recently I'm much more appreciative of my job. The downfall of this job is Express. Generally people pay absolutely no attention to the sign or different size of the lane. I have had people come up with several carts full before in a 15 items or less express lane. 84 was the last time I checked a person with a lot of groceries. No Express, no stress. Other than the fact that I also feel like it's as bad as school was. I can't go to the bathroom when I want, I get a 15-30 break at the absolute most, you can't move, and people just irritate you from there. The one thing I love most about my job is the management. They will bend over backwards to make me happy, I'm one of the few MVP's at work; all I had to do is promote customer surveys. They have recently moved me into a department, and are in the process of moving me back just to make me happy. They are literally all I can ask for in employers. I'm also about to be promoted if I continue my work."
good,Kroger has opportunities for advancement within their company.
good,"Company communicates openly with expectations."
good,"Fred Meyer locations offer a fast paced and challenging customer service environment.  All associates are able and expected to provide excellent customer service at all times.  Team mentality is imperative to achieve success in the store environment. when it exists it can be seen by associates and customers alike."
good,"If you are a college student or high school student this is a great place to start. However, if you wish to advance pass management assistant you should look further. Overall a great place to work."
good,fun environment and each person is very friendly. managers show that they care if a problem occurs.
good,"During my time at Fred Meyer, I moved up quickly in positions and pay. I found I enjoyed my work the most when I was at my busiest even though it could be hectic at times. I was able to put my people skills to test as the home 4th PIC and with working with the customers especially when having to up hold policy and not having a happy customer as a result. I always strived to stay within company policy while delivering the best customer service."
good,"op een typische dag, was ik vooral bezig met het helpen van klanten."
good,I worked dispensing product 1 and product 2 . I also release 1 and 2 to costumers.
good,"packaged product, and placed merchandise out for sale."
good,great place to work I enjoy my job needed balance with work life .
good,"Taking care of customers a lot of fun ."
good,busy days filled with a great time.  Great people work at the company.
good,Reassuring that customers get the best customer service meeting all of the customers needs
good,"This job kept me on my toes with many things to do, I love being busy and thats what this job provided to me."
good,"Working there was fun knew a lot of people everybody stayed busy for the most part,i learned to work smart not hard,being on time no excuses.Far as management goes i was treated fairly could've been paid a lil more but its okay.My co-workers was like family we all got alone well with each other and helped one another out when help was needed.The hardest part was trying to finish a lot of work on time but i did, when finished i help the next person thats just me and how i am.I enjoyed the overtime they let you do and it was really nothing hard about the work we did."
good,"Helping customers shop"
good,I love Fred Meyers as a retail pharmacy job. A typical day at work involves typing prescriptions for a few hour then rotating to product dispensing and release to patient. Everyone is very friendly as far as co-workers and management. The hardest part of the job is trying to make everyone happy while being realistic about wait times. I am a very fast typer so i can get things done quickly but there are some that have other strengths. I believe if we all work as a team we can get things done quickly and efficiently with a smile. My favorite part is being able to help people and just being around friendly staff and customers makes the job very enjoyable.
good,"I have been working at Kroger for 5 years, and have worked my way up from a bagger to pharmacy technician at the same store. The people are what really makes me want to stay with the company. Kroger takes pride in its employees being friendly and fun to work with. Hardest part of my job being a Pharmacy Technician is the general stress that comes with the control of people's lives and trying to make their visit to the store as swift and friendly as possible."
good,days starts by opening fuel center and being with paper work. maintaining all the operations of the fuel center
good,typical night at fred Meyers unload freight restock shelves work freight
good,I enjoyed this job because it taught me some new perspectives.
good,Scale items and collect money from customers then half way through shift I would bag groceries as well
good,A job for high school kids needing the money. It was pretty fun while it lasted. It was great interacting with customers. I would recommend this job for teens.
good,This was the best job I have ever had in my life atleast this point in my life. The people and managers were great.  They probably gave me more chances than I deserved I just wish i wasnt so immature at this point in my life. The typical day of the job would be coming in and taking my spot as a cashier and checking out some of the friendliest people ive ever met except for a occasional grumpy tourist. They are very good at giving you your break usually no more than a 3 hour wait. The hardest part of the job for me is i was somewhat forgetful of customers coupons and of course that situation is never good. Overall I would recommend this job to college students going to school and great for older people who may have retired but just want something to keep you busy.
good,"Kroger is a place where you work hard and have a great time.  There are a lot of great people that work at Kroger and those people always strive to do their best.  If you enjoy working to serve the customer, Kroger is the place to work."
good,The best part of my job has to be making someones day whether it be helping them out in anyway or just simply having a conversation with them.
good,I work part time at a store.  It is pretty good experience for part time job in high school.
good,"A lot of customers were hard to deal with but the ones that were easy going and friendly were what made it worth it. Also, the friendships that developed between coworkers. They were also pretty laid back. I had a nose piercing at the time and dyed my hair about 5 colors during the span I was there and I was never scolded or asked to change it."
good,after I moved to the sales floor I got to work all over the place it offered me a great challenge and learned how to interact with different people
good,with all that is going on in the economy this company is still putting great service and taking care of employees. enough said.
good,I love my job as a meat cutter.. I know this job well as I have done this for many years before going into management and then again after.
good,"I Have been a Cashier at Kroger since 2010 at the Clarksburg 773 store.I love the people who I work with,they will do anything that they can to help you. I love the interaction that I have with all the customers. The hardest part of the job is to lift the heavy items cases of water and dog food. The most enjoyable part of the job is help others and make their shopping experience more enjoyable."
good,Typical day is hectic fast paced but seemed to be balanced from management.
good,"While working here, I mainly scanned groceries in the check out lane. I learned money management and that groceries are not cheap. I probably enjoyed my co-workers more than the job itself. I also learned that my co-workers did not all have as strong of a work ethic as I did. I can't really think of anything that I found challenging at this job or un-enjoyable. I loved working here and each day was a lot of fun. The manager was fun and made it a great place to work each day."
good,"Hours seemed to be flexible. Pay was alright for the timeframe I worked there, I was able to worked in multiple departments, so advancement is there if you want it. co-workers were great, and management as well. Just do your job, and everything works out fine."
good,"great place to work, learned lots of things, meet new people everyday. hardest part for me personally is working 40 hours and going to school full time, but hey you got to do what you have to do."
good,"Typical day at work would require critical time management skills.      I have learned more effective time management, multi tasking, customer service experience, and prioritizing skills. Management gives very effective feed back and coaching. The hardest part of the job would definitely be time management, as well as holiday seasons. The most enjoyable part of the job is having the opportunity to be creative, and getting to meet new people, as well as become familiar with regulars as well.."
good,"a day at work can be stressful, but fun. I have some good co works and some that are just rude.. we have some great managers. the hardest day would be a rush hour."
good,Days long and hard. I learned team work and dedication. Management was above par. Co-workers were helpful. Hardest moments were the hours. The enjoyable was the payoff.
good,"Great Place To Work, Great Customer. Great Co-workers Fast Pace Always Changing Place To Work"
good,"Working for Kroger, there is always something to keep me busy so most days go by quickly. I work in all different aisles and sometimes run a register so nothing gets too repetitive. They have worked well with my school schedule and balanced my education and work load so I can stay current with bills and invest in my future."
good,"Exciting and challenging. A typical workday includes customer service, and identifying customer needs and satisfying those needs"
good,cake decorating and baking is so much fun. the people you work with are great.
good,"Connecting with customers while making their favorite beverage keeps the customers happy! "
good,"I enjoy working for Kroger Company, it is nice and helping customers on a daily basis. A lot of the customers that I deal with come in on a daily basis because they know the employees and a bond has been created. Kroger puts a lot of emphasis on family values because they allow you time off for family, allowing employees to work and maintain a quality of life with their family. The employees are like family, most of the employees have worked together for years, and spend so much time together that we are like family, A very nice environment. I would have to say that my most enjoyment part of the job is the interaction with people. During my employment with Kroger, I have met a lot of wonderful people of which I have become very close to, They will come in daily and weekly and share their lives with me. I think it is very nice. Overall I would  say Kroger is a good company to work for, after all I have been with Kroger for over 16 years."
good,"Good  company to work for. Benefits if you worked in store, working in fuel center only get vacation after 1 year."
good,You learned something everyday at Kroger.  We work an average of 10 plus hours a day.The store that I work in has over 360 employees.  The biggest challenge is getting them to work together instead of working against each other.  I enjoy my job mainly because of the people aspect and and also I love it because there is a different challenge everyday.
good,"I AM ALWAYS BUSY AND HELPING MY CO-WORKER"
good,my co-workers where fun and funny to be around. they made the night go by fast. didn't even fill like work.
good,Small box retailer that is stable. Must be hands on and a producer. Responsible for all aspects of P&L except for labor budgets.
good,to review a company that terminated me for every one to see would be unjust for me and them.
good,"A typical day involves working the registers and getting patients in and out of the pharmacy as efficiently and quickly as possible. Technicians screen phone calls, type up prescriptions, and call insurance companies. Inventory is done daily and medications are stocked when a shipment comes in. Working with so many different people from very different backgrounds and personalities can be challenging. People have very different work ethics and working with others really teaches you to be flexible and a team player."
good,Management at Kroger Pharmacy's department was very reasonable and fair. There was balance and the culture was very enjoyable. Compensation was also appropriate.
good,Clock in go see cart schedule for the day. Head to back of an isle and start bagging quickly while sparking a conversation with current customer and maintaining a smile. When its my hour to get the carts i put on the neon yellow safety jacket and bring the carts inside and put them in a neat order.
good,It's a perfect place to start your job experience. I've gained the majority of my experience from Food4Less. My peers are great and I've had the privilege of training with management for a higher opportunity.
good,"I have worked retail for over 6 years, and I have come to a conclusion this is what I was meant to do as a career. I am a very sociable person and friendly. I don't mind talking to customers about their day or a item of their choosing at a store I work in. If I cant find the item they want I will find the store who carries it."
good,Loved interacting with the different customer that came into the store on a daily bases.
good,At kroger we made sure every customer was happy and returned to our store .I helped assist customers with their problems and concerns. Helped the senior citizens shop on Wednesdays i liked this they were very friendly toward me . i always had a positive attitude with them.
good,"Kroger is not a terrible place to work. It is, however, retail. The compensation for the work is fair. The only issue is management. I was never really sure what I was supposed to be doing, and when I asked, management didn't seem to really know either. The job wasn't for me, but if you like retail, it would be a good place to go."
good,"start helping customers"
good,"Ralphs is a great place to meet new people, practice my customer service and communication skills"
good,"You must really know how to negotiate with customers and have a firm character when handling collections. You must be able to work with the customer, provide alternatives of paying back."
good,Go in and previous cashier had station ready for the following cashier to come in do their job
good,I enjoy working for Kroger.  I enjoy seeing the same customers and hearing about their family.  My co-workers are fun but young. My day is typical everyday.  Working for a grocery is not the most exciting place but you make it what you want.  I make my day the best I can and make my customers feel like they are the most important people in the world.
good,Was fun to socialize with the customers. I learned that there are nice people in the world. Co-workers were very pleasant and respectful. Management was friendly and listened to your suggestions. The hardest part of the job was pushing shopping carts into the store in 100+ degree weather. The most enjoyable part of the job was working inside the store. I really liked that job and it was fun.
good,I really enjoyed working with Kroger. The Customer Service manager at that time made working pretty difficult sometimes but for the most part I wont complain. I worked at Kroger for nearly 10 years and the day to day experiences were very delightful. I really enjoyed meeting new people and interacting with the public.
good,"Every day I was acknowledged for being helpful, and having great communication skills.That really helped me look forward to coming to work. The hardest part of my job was not being able to be there all the time, to help. The customers would always ask for the manager, just to inform and thank them for hiring me. I was highly respected by customers and staff for store and product knowledge."
good,A typical day at work was to help customer look for a certain brand or to answer questions.
good,"The people I usually work with are a very tight knit team. If you need help, you usually get it unless they are helping another customer. A typical day is stocking shelves that may become low and building displays for sales that may be going on. The hardest part is trying to train a new hire on how to do certain things. But once they understand how to manage their time and realize the order of operations then its a breeze. The most enjoyable part is my co-workers. There's hardly ever a dull moment. Some of the best people I've ever met."
good,The job entailed moving forward and learning more. I had to take classes to be able to read prescriptions that the doctor wrote and what that meant.

The ability to shop from yoyr phone and travel to the store to have everything waiting for is amazing. Great management. Super informative, helpful, and kind. Made me feel like a part of the tream."
good,Kroger's was the very first job i had coming out of high school and was one of the most beneficial and enjoyable experiences i had. following the procedures was very easy and interacting with customers made the day enjoyable.
good,"The insurance world can be daunting.  There is a lot to learn and many exceptions to the rules which can be confusing at times.   Managers were supportive,  but sometimes unavailable to help.   Large case loads and short breaks and had daily metrics that had to be met. Seemed like a very nice place to grow at, I was just unable to stay on due to health reasons."
good,The job culture is welcoming. A typical work day includes managing the most urgent tasks first such as ringing up customers and putting the orders away. Each day presents new challenges.
good,"Some things I liked about Kroger are the diversity, cleanliness , customer & employee happiness, pay rate , location , & flexible hours . I learned very much from this company & I will take everything I’ve learned with me to my next employer !"
good,"It’s a union store so seniority matters, accrued vacation, protection from job loss and discrimination. Downside it can be somewhat consuming at times. My experience was good. My performance was noticed, and advancement opportunities were made available."
good,"I’ve learned working at Kroger to be as positive that i could be through any situation possible. For example always try you best to make someone happy/ and help them out, you never know what they’re going through in their life"
good,"What I liked about working at Kroger? Everyday presented a different challenge. Even though the yearly goals were the same as far as increasing revenue, the daily and monthly challenges were different. My typical day was traveling between stores to ensure getting the department right. That meant conditioning, setting up corporate mandated displays as well as interacting with management and vendors. Management at both stores communicated well and were supportive. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interacting with the customers. The hardest part of the job was when the stores closed."
good,"As a high school freshman, a typical work day for a courtesy clerk was not bad at all it was a quick easy job for the youth especially for those who were athletic."
good,My typical day at work was an office supervisor. This intels of me to taking care of customers at customer care and doing schedules for employees and making sure the checkouts were running smoothly and properly.
good,"You learn a lot about working no matter where you are or what you're doing. You notice the difference in people, you run into people who you may already know or someone who you've never seen in your life. You never know where lifes gonna take you but whats more important is working your way into that progress. You will have those days where you feel like work is worthless and other days you will just be thankful that you're even alive and making your way into your goals. I personally have never had a job but I learn from the people around me."
good,"Being my first job, I would say that it was an excellent introduction into learning how to maintain time for my work, money handling, and learning what it means to have a job."
good,There customer service is great. Works well with employees and customers. Always negotiable with both customer and employee. Great sales when they are available for associates and customers
good,"Kroger has a customer first attitude, but my bosses recognize that customers are really not always right.  So they will appease customers just to keep them happy that they will come back again to shop at our store.  So I have been told what is going on as my supervisor knew the customer was wrong."
good,I loved my job experience at Kroger. The days went by smooth and the customers where for the most part always in a joyous mood. Kroger taught me a lot about customer interactions and how to deal with people so it was very helpful towards my future.
good,"A typical day at work for me would be coming into work saying hello to all of my employees. I learned to be optimistic and way more helpful to every customer. The hardest part if the job , was chaining prices before the store opened. The most enjoyable part of my job ever was making beautiful connections with my customers and employees every single day."
good,The store environment was good. We worked as a team here. The best thing was we were all of different origins. Work was real busy that you wont know how fast the time goes. interaction with the customers and their demands were amazing.
good,"If you are looking for a good entry level job, this is a good place to work. Management is very helpful with any questions that you might have about specific responsibilities."
good,It is a good place to work for plus great benefits.They are good about work schedules also. They treat their employees well. You always get your hours
good,"Great place to work. Management always helpful when needed. Multi-cultural employment. Excellent benefits. Had I began working there as a young woman, I would have considered making a career with the company."
good,"By choice I was a seasonal worker because I worked over the breaks from school. Summer, Christmas, so of course the store was busy. Being busy was stressful but it also keeps you busy and time passes fast."
good,Good first time job. Nice people to work with. The pay isn't that good especially if you have rent and a car payment.  Would be a nice part time job.  Or weekend job.
good,"Fast paced, hard working, customer service, friendly employees, on a typical Saturday I would decorate 25-30 cake orders. Through out the week I would decorate and bake desserts."
good,"I started working here over the summer, knowing I would have to go part time when school started. My bosses were wonderful about working with my school schedule, and they were so understanding when I had to cut from about 20 hours a week to one shift every 2 weeks. That being said, we have had many issues with people leaving and having no one to replace them, so we have been short-staffed for about a month now with only 1-2 people working each day when we are supposed to have 4-5. We usually get a lunch break, but with the current circumstances, it is very difficult to find time. However, when the store is fully staffed, it is a pleasant place to work, and the pay is very fair for requiring no experience."
good,"Kroger was actually a pretty decent place to work. The pay isn’t high at all but job satisfaction was high. The job was pretty easy, there wasn’t too much pressure from upper management, and customers were typically really nice. Generally, if you give enough advanced notice, your time off will be approved, though it will be unpaid unless you’re management. There wasn’t any benefits offered but it’s definitely good for someone still living at home or someone with a roommate."
good,They allow for further exploration of your skills already brought to the table and learning new skills to contribute to your team. They allow reviews every year in order to keep you on track on how you feel with the company and your own self-growth within the company in order to keep the train moving without a hitch.
good,"It’s great when you have the best management, but if you have people who don’t listen to you than it can be a problem. Also never think your hard work goes unnoticed because my managers saw something in me i didn’t see in myself."
good,Frys is a good place to work and they offer a lot of benefits. They are competitive and they good for their employees. They have special team-building events throughout the year.
good,"I worked for one of Kroger's subsidiaries which is Food4Less located in Chicago, IL. it's a pretty good place to work depending on location & what you're looking for. The store I managed was a million dollar store, so we drove a lot of business. I started off as a cart pusher & worked my way up to assistant manager, if you take it serious,  they will.  The pay was great back then because you were able to automatically receive a raise weather it was 15 cents to 50 cents. But now they start you off at a flat rate & it's hard to get a raise unless you get promoted. Pretty basic attendance policy.  They have great benefits that people dont really take advantage of."
good,This work environment was a good first job because it helped me use my communication skills and being able to stand for multiple hours a day helping around the store.
good,The management team is great.The majority of the Associates are nice to one another.They are a great company to work for.The different customers and stories you hear day to day makes the job worth while.
good,A typical day at work required me to concentrate on making sure I put the right at items and the crack bags paying attention to the carts in when the cart corral was empty I had to run out and grab parts of. What I weren't working at kroger was how to concentrate on a  Certain objective and how to work with. Management was very professional and kind and always help me whenever I needed.  The work place called chair was as very professional fun. Dealing with very rude customers And Working out in the heat when  Tethering The most enjoyable part about the job was I got to meet many new people and speak with them about my interests and holding conversations with my coworkers
good,"Many resources to find answers. Management willing to help with issues and if they cannot solve it, look for answers from those more knowledgeable. Always respectful."
good,"As an assistant store manager I learned about sales, growing a business, hiring and retaining associates.The days can be stressful. King Soopers overall is a good company. If you are willing to learn, they are willing to teach and promote. They believe in promoting from within the majority of the time."
good,I learn a lot by working for Kroger. It showed me leadership and they trained me for a career. The most enjoyable part is helping the customers finding and getting what they need to have a great day
good,"The Kroger Company is a great company! However, certain stores within the kroger company can be very stressful, pressurized and inconsiderate. They could always improve however, I believe they don't have time to or have the tools too. Though there are some good days as well."
good,My typical day at Kroger starts with getting started with my off shore calls and review code with the pending pull requests in queue. IT has very good work life balance and you need not stress too much about getting work done. The work space will be productive with fun at the same time. I have learnt great deal of things with the roles I was offered.
good,"Fast paced work environment."
good,Kroger was my first job all throughout high school. This was a really good start off job to the work world and I enjoyed my time at Kroger and I would recommend them to anyone trying to get on their feet or a little start off job for someone. Like any job they are some managers who arn't as friendly but that is part of it. They expect the normal out of you at their company.
good,Kroger is a good company to work for. The expectations are high but you're given the tools and taught the skills needed to excede them. It takes time to make your way up the ladder but in the end it ends up worth it.
good,I have worked for kroger for over 25 years. I have great benefits and retirement. I really like my coworkers and customers. The hardest part of the job is working holidays.
good,Krogers does a very good job at selecting who works at their stores. Not once have I met someone there who didn't have a different personality. That in my opinion is how the workplace runs as smoothly as it does and why everyone is as friendly as possible. The happiness being spread there is honestly contagious and makes it worth working there.
good,"I worked at Ruler foods which is a subsidiary of Kroger but still under the same parent company. I enjoyed working there a lot and enjoyed my co workers and some of the customers. Overall, it is a great place to work when you have no experience and a good foundation for work experience."
good,After working at Kroger I understand that you have to put a lot of effort into working retail. With that being said you have to deal with super fast days like holidays and then you have the slow Sunday morning .
good,Its has both slow and fast paced days but its always a busy moment there. From cooking to cleaning and learning your normal customers is ok. Kroger is the best company I worked with so far.
good,They help me improve in the field of customer service. I would recommend working at Kroger to anyone who is young or in high school looking to improve in the customer service field.
good,I loved my store that I worked at the managers were so nice and friendly and my supervisor was nice friendly and did his job very well. And my associates were the best
good,good place to start working to understand a work atmosphere and get accommodated with he environment. Helped certainly with dealing with upset customers
good,I worked the deli/bakery for a few years. I would love to keep working there but I moved to southern Alabama and they do not have one here. 7/10. No one likes their job completely but it was one of the best I've had.
good,"Typical days here are always fast paced. You'll learn something new everyday and I definitely feel like I learned a lot. Pharmacy manager was passionate about her job and made a world of difference, but i think overall management towards the pharmacy could use some work. Hardest part was juggling the customers and workload due to staffing problems but  the gratitude and happiness of even one customer through the whole day makes the job worth it and i personally loved how you're constantly learning and honing your skills"
good,"The only things I have against Kroger is that the staff seems unmotivated for the most part or have miserable attitudes. This may not be the case at every store, just the store that I worked at. The pay was also not as generous as other establishments I have worked at."
good,Working at Kroger wasn’t such a bad experience. I learned a lot from them. Like how to work with other people and how to deal with customers. I’d recommend it as a first job
good,I left my previous job for Kroger due to a higher pay and more hours. Kroger helped me pay off my car and help out around the house. Dealing with customers had both its pros and cons. Some were delightful (my regulars-which made the job more enjoyable) and some would scream at you over a forty cent off coupon. Kroger taught me how to handle different types of personalities within the workplace: fellow employees and customers.
good,Kroger Distribution Center it's a great place to work. They provide paid training on all machines. The managers are very collaborative with their employees. Great pay.
good,i liked it a lot. it was fun enjoyable and it nice. you have to start by bagging the  groceries and then you have to clean the bathroom after your lunch break then put up the cart outside to put them back inside.
good,".I enjoyed the customers I also enjoyed working in the flower shop .I learned a lot management was great. I just wanted parttime work  "
good,"As an employee of the Kroger Company, you serve as the face of the organization. We interact with hundreds of customers of all ages, races, cultures, and economic backgrounds. We are encouraged to do something that goes above and beyond the normal duties of customer service, such as remembering names, acknowledging birthdays and anniversaries, supporting the community for charitable events, and assist in relief efforts during disaster events. It is a great place to work for people who enjoy seeing others happy, and treating the workplace as  you would your home. "
good,Really great place to work managers and human resources are really good people along with coworkers. Would recommend to anyone looking for a warehouse job.
good,Had to go for school but the time I was there is was great. And it was 8.15 an hour but still  made good and the people were good. But some were bad yup.
good,"Place to hang with friends and talk on break"
good,"It was my first Job and I was hired about a day after Interviewed. I worked there for three years and loved most of it. My immediate bosses were great and I really liked them but by the end of my working there, the store management had gained the nickname ""The Firing Squad"". This was because they would fire somebody at the slightest inconvenience. They once fired everyone who worked at the Starbucks, hired all new people, then fired all of those people when they didn't know what they were doing. All in all, a great workplace but management can be a bit sketchy."
good,"I bagged grocery, get carts off the lot, I clean the lot, clean the bathrooms and help the costumer as much as I can to give them the best experience that the store can give you."
good,Kroger is a place to work for young people with strength they treat you like family there are different departments of your choice I would High recommend anyone to work there.
good,"Dillons is a great working atmosphere, with opportunities for associates to work their way up in the company with hard work, and patience. Management is great about working with employees to improve their skills on the job, and further the employee's education if needed. I enjoy working in the produce department."
good,"On-Line shopping is the wave of the future.  More and more people are using this kind of service, but they have to realize that the items that are asked for are not always available.  There is human interaction with what they want and what they get.  Most people are happy with the fact they don't have to shop for themselves and some are very disappointed with the substitutes they have been offered.  The customer has to go the extra mile and fill out the suggestions as to what they will accept."
good,Fast paced and good place to work but hard on my back to stand in one place for hours.A mixed up schedule everyday of the week. I would rather have a more set schedule but ok when it has to change from time to time.
good,Most of the people are great.  Be prepared to do a lot of walking as you will be getting groceries for customers online orders.  The job is not very stressful but when there are a lot of orders things can get a little hectic.  The pay is not very good to be honest.  However a raise could be coming soon for all Kroger employees so that is a plus.
good,"The discounts are the main pump for wanting to hire, everything, such as managers and coworkers are dependent on the store(mine is great) the only drawback is in the summertime when you have to be outside to pick carts and it’s hot. The other issues is people complaining or stealing by abusing prices. So really the poopy thing are the costumers themselves"
good,"Overall a good opportunity for a first job, good benefits. I just had poor management team. A lot of people were familiar with my face and customer service."
good,"This was an awesome job, but they weren't able to be as flexible as I hoped they would since I wrestle and was competing that summer. I had told them in advance that I would be unable to work one day, but they called me asking me to come in when I was out of town."
good,"I was a co-mananger at Kroger. I actually really enjoyed the work and the people I worked with. I enjoyed interacting with my customers most of the time. The benefits were great, but the work life balance was non-existent, and more so for management than for store associates."
good,"Management team was typically helpful."
good,"Kroger was good,i just had so much going on in my life.It interfered with my job to frequently.Other than that i have nothing but good things to say about Kroger."
good,"It was fine working there. The management was great, and really understanding as long as you weren't trying to pull one over on them. Fair and equal in my mind."
good,This is a great job to work out in-between careers. It's definitely not worth making a career out of unless you are really into the grocery retail business.
good,"very nice place to work. managers are great . very fulfilling job. hardest part of job was instructions were not always clear enough."
good,Working there was an injoyable place to work. Meny frindley coworkers. Good pay a benafents. I was responsible for restocking the lunch meat wall. Unloading truck with power jack.
good,"A day at Kroger mostly depends on weather and day of the week. Sometimes its busier before a week of rain or even the prospect of snow. Other than that, it's a pretty relaxed environment. Good benefits as well."
good,"The work environment was diverse. I loved this company, but we worked to the end of production. Which means I would have to work more than eight hours a day, it was rare that i worked a eight hour shift."
good,One of the best pharmacies I have had the pleasure of working for.  They were very flexible on scheduling and very interested in the welfare of the associate.
good,"My overall experience was fine. Nothing personal towards the store itself, but one of my supervisors did not give a single care towards the workers' schedules and weather we could work or not."
good,"Kroger was a fast paced environment with good benefits. Managers were awesome, and I made a lot of friends with my coworkers. I would definitely recommend working here."
good,"Kroger is the perfect first job. It's fast paced, usually busy, the time flies. I learned great customer service, working the cash registers, monitoring self checkout cash registers, Fun environment. The hardest part of the job is getting through so many customers during the rush hours (All day on Sundays and around 3pm-6pm on weekdays). The most enjoyable part was being with friendly colleagues who made being at work pretty fun. Being a cashier was a great job. You don't have to do much but engage with customers, be fast, and keep you're area clean."
good,"I’ve been a pharmacy technician at Kroger for around a year and a half now. I can say before I write this review that it’s been my favorite job I’ve ever had and also, the hardest. It’s a long process to get hired and once you are, just pharmacy tech mostly, it takes a long time to learn and retain the information because it’s all new. Once you get the hang of it, it’s a good job. I love my manager and my co-workers to death, and there is a flexible schedule. (I had an unexpected surgery and it wasn’t a big deal like it may be for other jobs). I really feel at home with my work family. Only Con really is that we are understaffed as some pharmacy’s are so it makes it tough, and hard to have lunches but, overall. Great job!"
good,I enjoyed the flexibility for getting the days off when I had a special event.  The people were really nice. The employee discount on Kroger products were appreciated. Great benefits.
good,kroger was an okay first job too have because you get experience of working in retail and grocery plus you work with some really amazing people my usually work day at kroger was collecting carts and bagging groceries for customers plus you three breaks as well two 15 minutes and an 30 minute lunch break.
good,"Kroger is very fast paced, and you have to be able to talk to people. The managers are very nice and the coworkers you work with are very nice, always willing to help out."
good,A typical day started with greeting customers that walked through the doors. Kroger is a great learning experience as there are many opportunities to learn and grow as a worker.
good,Kroger is a fine place to work however the salary for non management positions i believe to be slightly low for the amount of work and responsibilities put on their employees
good,"The benefits Kroger offers are very good.  They provide vision, dental and medical.  There is a good 401K program with employer matching.  One big focus of the stores is safety."
good,you will learn a lot and meet new people everyday. People are helping others. The company culture and value are really great. Don't try the retail company if you does not give your best at 100% everyday
good,"Fast promotions, the culture is really laid back and management varies. Very Good health insurance and flexibility i must say is really good, good for individuals who want to go school and erab some mony"
good,work hard in follow orders  an listen an do as you told an help others all gettin finish an helping other people when they need help finding somethang
good,"I had 20 great years with this company and would live to get back on full time. I have many other retail firms that I can go to, but love my Kroger! Loved the upper management. Very respectful. Enjoyed every single minute."
good,"I liked my job as the Visual Merchandiser because I got to be creative and display my work ,which made the product sell faster. And my coworkers were great to work with and everyone worked as a team."
good,"It was a typical retail experience. They gave me great job security, and if I needed time off, I got it. The management was approachable and knew how to deal with most any situation. The hardest part of the job was advancing my career in the work place."
good,"There's always something that needs to be done whether it's working the load or backstock, helping customers or even pushing in carts. The hours are flexible and most of the time there isn't any issue if time off is needed."
good,repetitive work place with chances to learn different departments and good for promotions i learned how to give excellent customer service skills and also be a great listener to customers needs and how to manage a crew of employees the hardest part was the up and down schedule but the most fun part was feeling like a family with co workers and the holidays
good,I enjoyed working for Kroger. It's a great company to work for. Don't expect much for advancement for different areas. Not much advancement for Guest Service Representatives.
good,There is always something to do at Kroger. If you are looking for more hours they will find them for you. Benefits as far as insurance are fantastic..
good,"In my experience at Kroger I learned many things. With it being my first major job in high school I learned a valuable lesson about time management. I also learned about responsibility and that I still needed to go to work even if I didn't feel like it. All of my managers where very nice and great at there job. The hardest part about the job for me was that it was very stressful. As a cashier, I am the last person customers see in the store and that is a a lot of pressure not to mention when it was busy it was stressful to look up and see five plus people in my line."
good,Very talented and nice System architect and friendly manager. It was one of the 100 best places to work in IT. Office location was in peace and safe environment. Used to have some outdoor activities in summer and some fun indoor activities in winter.
good,"It’s okay but it’s not enough to support a family, plus it was great I live right around the corner, but the discounts are great and the people were great."
good,My first job out of high school. Nice relaxed vibes except on holidays. Pay could be much better. But other than that I liked working at Kroger. Plus the free wine I always drink
good,"If you are a person who likes to stay busy, can multitask, learn fast, can handle being challenged and work fast this is the job for you. If you are a person who needs a slow paced job, are unable to multitask, are learn at a slow pace, and don't like challenges it isn't the job for you"
good,"The store ive worked at constantly had managment changing, even since I stopped working there almost 6 months ago theybhave all new management. It made thinga harder because every new manager changed things up making it harder to keep entertained or involved with the work enviorment."
good,Taught good people skills and how to handle stress during rush hours. Taught to keep accountability of products and stocking numbers. Worked well with the team in stores and individually in the lot.
good,I would love to work at Kroger as a bagger as soon as possible because I want to work on helping me an my family out on money. My availability times is pretty flexible. M-Th- 5-9. F-S-5-9 or after. Sunday- anytime in the afternoon through the evening.
good,Management is very easy to talk to about anything especially upward movement in the company. Hardest part but the best part is making sure customers leave satisfied with everything they wanted
good,I think the hardest part of the job is to find something to keep me busy when I get done with everything but the best part of working there is helping customers out and putting a smile on there face
good,"Greet all customers "
good,Kroger is a well oiled machine that thrives from its diverse and dedicated workers.  With a good paced and hospitable work environment to match. Kroger is a highly recommended place from shopping to work!
good,"Kroger was my first employer after high school.  There has not been a day when I have walked into the Kroger label of stores, that I have been disappointed with.  The service is always friendly and fast paced. (before my ice cream melts).  Thanks Kroger for being the best grocery store in the Midsouth."
good,I feel like this is a great place for teens to start their work experience off. Kroger was extremely patient with me and managers were willing to work with me when I needed guidance.
good,"I still work there and plan to for a while, but when this company is very flexible and understanding and gives great benefits to both part time and full time workers."
good,"At the grocery I worked at (Ralphs) near the Robinson-Pico district of Los Angeles, Meat and Seafood was easy to be a cleric of.  The customer traffic was not too much to handle either.  The only drawback was probably the rearranging of my job duties just to have discrepancies in my weekly pay stub upheld.  There is a region-specific Kosher deli that I was trained in during light customer traffic in the store.  In general, there are a lot of menial tasks that a perfectionist workhorse has to keep in mind in order to be efficient."
good,This is a good company to work for. You must always work with a sense of urgency. They have a union and care about the employees. Management treats employees the way they want to be treated. Management assists employees whenever a department is short staffed. There are opportunities for advancement.
good,Good place to work. There is always something to do to keep busy and people help. Good breaks in 9 hour shifts. Can get overwhelming at times but overall great place to work.
good,Great people to work with. Great hours. Fair. Work days seemed to go by fast due to being busy with alot of different things needing to be done. Good overall.
good,"I have worked at Kroger for two years in November.  It was a big adjustment, but I was able to fit in.  I like working with the customers, and my supervisors are very fair.  I have made one advancement there, and an going to start training for a role with more responsibility."
good,"Good place to work good people to work for with a good team, wish they paid more. Worked around school and personal schedule, definitely recommended working here!"
good,"My review of Kroger Stores is that it may be stressful at sometimes but it is a very good working environment for someone who is starting their first job in the beginning of their career. In conclusion, I recommend Kroger Stores to anyone who is starting out on their first job hunt."
good,"It is a nice job if you are not too shy and talk to people very easily. I consider myself very outgoing and a lot of customers that I would get were very friendly and I got to learn about a lot of cool people. I had a fun experience too because most other workers were my age, so I was able to relate to them pretty well on many things."
good,This has been a great part time job for me while I have been in school. They are very flexible with my school schedule and it is fairly easy to get days off work when needed.
good,"Very organized ,respectful customers, great management and nice area to work in .I would go back Anytime .employees work together with everything.👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼"
good,I love working with all the people that are there down in springville. they make working a fun experience.a very opened atmosphere. friendly customers.
good,I love wether is a director or a manager or the most lowest postition everyone treats everyone with respect. We work together instead of in competition
good,Kroger is an fun place to work with the ability for advancement. Its a wonderful place to work if you are a people's person and love meeting new people everyday.
good,"Kroger is a great job I recommend it to anyone else, great people to work with productive steady income steady work, good pay ,good benefits, union job I worked 10 pm to 6am 5 days a week opportunity for overtime."
good,Liked my coworkers fun group of people. If I did not find a better paying job I'd most likely would still be there. The supervisors were all good taught me alot
good,Union job. All benefits if you do things right. Pay is low but great place for a second job. Insurance is much cheaper than any other similar place. Relaxed environment. Management is not too noisy if they see you working they’ll leave you alone to do your thing.
good,"I loved my coworkers, and had fantastic professional relationships with our clientele. Not only did I learn how to be a Starbucks barista (as I worked for King Soopers in a Starbucks licensed kiosk), but I learned how much work goes into running a successful store. Management was usually really easy to get along with, and understanding of individual associates' needs while still keeping the store's needs in mind. The overall feel was always really positive;  the associates from other departments were a very friendly bunch that I enjoyed being around. I would say the hardest part of the job was the physical side of it, as my feet always felt like murder after every 8 hour shift. The most enjoyable part for me was learning new things and being able to bring a smile to everyone I worked with, customers and coworkers alike."
good,"I love Kroger and the people who work there, of course everywhere you go you are gonna have problems but I wouldn’t trade it, it’s not a pain and the customers are great"
good,"Typical day at work was very fast paced had to do 25 items a minute didn't  like the experience of having to be rushed at scanning peoples food items some people didn't like the fast paced employees."
good,"I mostly liked working at Kroger. I was able to work all three entry level positions and I enjoyed learning how to do all three. My only complaint about working there was that one supervisor and one manager were very rude and nasty to me when I made a mistake in my first couple of months. They ended being the main reason I left. the job. The other two managers were great. As for the job itself I liked working all three positions. I enjoyed Stocker and Cashier the most. I would recommend working at Kroger to anyone I know although I would warn them about the aforementioned manager and supervisor if they still work there. A typical day at work for each of the three positions are as follows. As a stocker I'd usually go in at around 10 A.M. and I would start with backstock carts for the first hour or so of my shift, then I'd move on to the back room and help coworkers unload trucks. Truck days were Thursdays and Saturdays. I almost always worked on those days. I would take a short lunch break around 2 P.M. and then spent the next 3-4 hours stocking new items from trucks. The final 1-2 hours would be spent helping check inventory. The above paragraph would be for the first 3 months that I worked there."
good,"i enjoyed working in the deli, fast paced, working with the public. although at the time i was there, the pay could have been better. i would work there again"
good,"Best there is around the area, fun work envoirment with room for advancement, it was an old store so things were constantly going wrong and taking forever to repair"
good,I feel everything was well organized and displayed to accordingly..Prices were great..Management was great and worked well with us. Better Security alot of thiefs
good,It was a fairly fast paced job however you are well trained as well as receive paid training at a separate location from the store. The management during my time there was very kind and helpful. the best part of the job was the ability to get time off and flexibility for hours.
good,"The work experience was average, I did not appreciate being mildly  reprimanded because of my inability to work as fast as the managers would have liked, due to my disability."
good,"Kroger is union, which surprised me at the time but its very nice. the insurance was good. "
good,"I found that working as a bagger was overall a fine job to have while you are attending school. It has flexible hours, and pays relative to the work that you do. However, it is not alright as a job that you plan on going with for a prolonged period of time as the pay is rather low. It can also be quite demanding at times."
good,"I started as a cashier, and had prior experience so I got a good pay. But barely worked over 12 hours a week when it wasn't busy holiday weeks like Christmas or Thanksgiving. I mostly worked a 4 hour shift. Unfortunately the worst part of working here was dealing with petty customers. People tried to scam all the time which didn't happen at the smaller retail companies I worked at. Sometimes management was able to intervene but not always and that resulted unhappy people yelling at cashiers because we wouldn't take fake coupons or expired licenses. There really isn't any room to advance unless you want to move to a different department."
good,working with this company was really enjoyable. I loved working with other associates and getting to know them better. I had a few issues but the were quickly fixed.
good,great costumer services and it was a lot of people so if they need some help u always be there to help them what they are looking for it was a great place to work and it was a safe environment
good,"I enjoyed my job as the wine steward immensely.  My job was different than most at Kroger.  There were definitely cliques of people, but I got along with most of them.  The general corporation often imposed policies that didn't seem to make sense to most of us."
good,"It was a nice place work at and many of the people were very nice to me there.  I did a variety of things as a courtesy clerk:  Cart retrieval, go-backs, bagging, and carry-outs.  l"
good,The workplace at Kroger is awesome and the people that work at Kroger are great to. The job I worked was a fun job but very tiring. Overall was a great experience to work at.
good,"This job is a great wok place and has a comfortable work atmosphere. They start you off with good pay, work with you throughout your training and overall being are willing to work with you to help you grow."
good,"if you can get into the management training program with Kroger you will learn a lot, and become immersed in a fast pace grocery environment. great people, and lots of room for advancement. It is very competitive, and not easy to move up. however if you work hard you will be noticed. the schedule can be hectic, and you will certainly be working some nights, and most weekends."
good,"When I first came to Kroger I started out working in produce now I  work in the deli, between then and now I have done stocking, been a cashier, courtesy clerk, that should give you some idea how much you can learn and in many ways they can teach you to help you grow with the the company and many directions you can go depending on the career you want. Overall Kroger is a good company to work for cause they have flexible hours and many chances to move up to manager in the department of your choice."
good,"Kroger was a great company to work for and it was a great community. However, my only complaint is that it is mandatory to join the union and you still have to pay union fees even when not working. For students who are in other activities and may miss a week of work, paychecks were very small."
good,"Working here wasn't bad, but there could have been improvements."
good,"you were held to a certain standard and expected to withhold it. raises every year as long as your union. not much to say, i worked here five years ago"
good,working with kroger was very good for me as a first job the management was amazing the hardest thing in this job was i stayed on my foot for at least 7 hour
good,"decorated cakes,baked cookies, fried chicken,slice meat and cheese, some experience with cash register, make sandwich trays, put whole chicken breast in the oven. it was a fun Job!"
good,"During my work there, I keep getting crazy hours. Some in the Morning, Daytime, even late. They gave me 8,7,6 or less. I only takes breaks for 30 minutes on long hours and 15 minutes on short hours."
good,My time at Kroger was enjoyable. It wasn't revolutionary it was rather run of the mill but it was a really good job. It was very relaxed until the peak hours or until you would run into a ver dissatisfied customer. That is the case with any job though.
good,I took this job so that I could save up money so that I could eventually relocate to a better job after I received my college degree.  I did find it to be a pleasant place to work.
good,"A great company to work for if you are young and don't mind standing for 8 hrs. The store I work for had great employees and management. You pretty much could ask to work a certain schedule but when it was time for you to get off, I didn't like asking can I leave. Every time your day ended you had to ask is it ok to close your register. if I'm there from 8 to 5 I'm ready to leave for the most part. I don't mind staying sometimes but this was everyday practice and the employees didn't like that."
good,"During my stay with Kroger, we prided ourselves on being at the forefront of retail MTM and holistic patient care. It's definitely the right mind-set for the company to have."
good,The marketplace was a bit challenging to work for. They wouldn’t give me full time benefit because I had to have an open availability. They liked competition.
good,"great store to work for , company events and potlucks. managers are very helplful. opportunity to move departments. sometimes have to work late because the store closes at 1am."
good,"Enter the building to clock in. Expect Pallet Jack before operating it."
good,work from 7a-3p i learned to work fast. I found the management was ok. hardest part was the short breaks. the most enjoyable part  was talking to customers!
good,"A typical days work at Kroger would include: bagging groceries, retrieving carts, cleaning store spills, and maintaining a healthy enjoyable work environment."
good,The best part about working at Kroger was easily the costumers. I really enjoyed getting to know the frequent shoppers and helping them out around the store!
good,At king Soopers there were many opportunities for advancement. The store managers helped to coach and guide clerks in the right direction for management and even took time to prepare clerks for interviews. Department heads did this as well as provide hands on training for the next position they were training for. There were many classes available to people who wanted to move up in the company as well as a college course you could take.
good,"FUN productive job, easy going management, interview process was easy & not too stressful.  Management at this particular store could use improvement due to the fact that it was a brand new store & everyone was getting into the swing of things.  but I feel that in time, management improved greatly"
good,"Things I did there Pushing carts , Filling ice machines, helping people out , bagging , puttting go backs up. "
good,Great work environment! Just not enough hours for people seeking more work. It's a team oriented environment and the customers always make it a great experience!
good,I'm trying to leave Kroger simply because I don't get paid enough for as hard as I work. The jobs aren't hard but the stress and customer service that you MUST provide deserves higher pay or at least steady hours.
good,"A typical day for me was mostly busy because that's mainly when my shift begun. Around 3,4 & 5 the peak hours, I believe. But I love a good rush. The best thing about Kroger is the Friendly Crew and Management, they are really what make the store."
good,Since that day I have school and stuff its very hard for me to keep with homework and keep track with work too. To be honest it's a good job to work but you have to focus and organize your schedule.
good,a typical day in kroger is predictable you know that around prime time there will be a super rush of people. I learned how to have patients with people. People like that you at least tried to help them. I also learn that you can not please every customer if the rules say no then it's not possible. The culture of the work place at my store is well we enjoy working with each other. Work is what you make it if you are going to pout about working why apply. The hardest part are the customers if you can keep your composure and just try to help as much as you can you will survive. Whats funny the customers are the best part some of your regulars will be come some of your favorite people.
good,"I enjoyed the consistency it brought, yet every day was different, my co-workers were excellent and we are still friends to this day, overall it was good."
good,The hours went back and fourth.  Sometimes you worked a lot of overtime and some weeks you barely got 32 hours.  Good supervisors that were always and willing to help you any way they could.
good,"Good management at my particular location. Employees have a good attitude toward one another. "
good,"Enjoyed the day to day operations, working with vendor partners, and"
good,"I was young when I started here, so from what I remember the employees were nice and helpful. The customers and overall store were great. They train you well for all things to come. It was always fun trying to be #1 checker on the list they had, something to look forward too I guess!"
good,"the store I worked at was friendly and flexible. If they saw potential in you it is easy for you to move up to a different position. the hardest part of the job for me personally was the pay rate, but you get a raise every 6 months so that helped."
good,"I originally left to pursue a career elsewhere, that turned out to be a misinformed venture. Part of me wishes I could turn back the clock to before leaving and stay the entire time"
good,"employees have their fun times there, management is great. just wasn't working for me cause i needed day hours, and i couldnt get them. but over all i do miss working with some of the employees"
good,I mean i only worked this job when I was a senior in high school. It gave me money to spend and money to save. I would recommend it to be your first job if you want customer service experiences.
good,Kroger is a great place to work overall. The employees are nice and treat you like family. Plus the store has great employee perks. The only downside to kroger is the pay to workload ratio and how often you have to work just to get by. I felt married to kroger more then my husband.
good,"Kroger has very fun employees to work with, their hours are flexible and they will work with you if you have appointments or kids, they also honor and show when you do a good job or good deed at work."
good,"I can't say a whole lot about Kroger Marketplace, but I do like the discounts and benefits that I receive as an employee of Kroger.  I work as a janitor and I make sure that all trash is cleaned when needed; sometimes I work as an assistant bagger.  The most challenging times are when we are understaffed at Kroger, which causes us to work as a ""team"".  Even though this happens often, we learn how to adapt and manage such difficult situations."
good,"Excellent, clean, friendly, I love the team sometimes...a.little to much complaining from some people, but all in all it was great..most likely I would recommend others to work there"
good,Quick paced job but it's fun. Good learning experience. The store is nice & neatly organized. The atmosphere is fun & loving & the workers are nice & funny.
good,Continuously busy learning new things about the products about the customers while working with your manager if problems occurred well trying to handle the big rush
good,"Administrative work, filing, multi-tasking, time management skills, team oriented, 8 hour shifts (sometimes 10 hours for the union workers), ability to advance within the company"
good,This company is filled with incentives and grand benefits but an expectation of nothing but the best from its workers. Company advancement is possible
good,"It's a good place."
good,They were one of the best jobs by retail & sales. Great showcases & offers throughout your shopping experience. Sometimes people were unfair but overall it was a good experience.
good,The part I enjoy most about working with this company is the customers. I really do enjoy making connections with each and every customer whether it be just smiling or them actually checking in on a life event that happened.
good,"I bake breads, cookies, biscuits, pies and fresh tortillas. I close the department every night I work.I clean the department be foe closing, I mop and sweep the floor ,clean the equipment. I re-stock the bread tables and straighten up the displays. I learned to make fresh tortillas and the routine of dealing with customers.The hardest part of the job is dealing with customer's complaints. Giving free cookies to the children and their parents"
good,The managers should be worked on.  They have good prices and the other employees are amazing. They always smile and that's great. I love shopping at Kroger.
good,like helping customers...the friendly conversation and majority of the people were nice and very helpful..i wouldn't mind working there again if there paid more
good,"All my coworkers are fun and exciting although other departments are very strict and can be a bit rude, but otherwise the entire workplace is much better than working at some fast food place that barely pays you"
good,"I loved working at Kroger until I recently transferred. I learned very quickly that different stores are very different from one another. I thought there would be a likeness given that it's all the same company, however, the new store is horrendous. One day in my new location and I'm so done with Kroger. There's no management, just a highly paid warm body. No structure or support, not even from my union rep. The store I was at previously was amazing though.  Management was awesome, they did their job while also being very courteous and approachable. As far as benefits and such they didn't change, only the stress level and overall happiness at work."
good,I loved working with the food and customers and the employees are very friendly but the boss constantly fought with me over me not wanting to work Sundays.
good,I didn't mind working here except people not in the union got treated as if they were when it came to issues where the union would typically be brought in. Besides that it was great.
good,"Hours can be hard, but they do provide PTO and health benefits once you are there for a certain amount of time. A good first job, but nothing I would want to stay with long term."
good,"Even though it could be stressful, the company is great to work for.  The pay definitely compensated for it. The store management I worked for at the time is the reason I quit. There are plenty of ways to advance in the company. Kroger promotes employee advancement"
good,"Krogers was the first job I got when I moved to Ohio. I had a very positive experience there. The managers, and employees were incredibly helpful and friendly. It was a great opportunity for me as I learned how to use a cash register, and the basic ins and outs of a grocery store, such as stocking, and keeping track of inventory."
good,"A typical day for me is hiring, training, orientation. I have learned how to recruit, train, do payroll. I am part of the management team so I work very close to them on a daily basis. For the most part this is a very family oriented place to work. They are big on Family first. The hardest part of my job is staffing. The most enjoyable part of my job is the employees I work with and all the new faces I get to meet."
good,"Kroger Company is a good company to work for. If you have a need the managers are almost always willing to help if they have the time. This company also provides friendly customer service. Overall, I have had a good experience with the Kroger Compnay."
good,Kroger was a good company to start out as a teenager. no good money made unless you work for corporate.was flexible wit hours and let you switch shifts
good,It is a great company to work for. Having excellent benefits available to you is another great factor in working for this company. Your' typical day can turn from a relaxed day to a fast and busy day from one minute to the next. There is never a dull moment. There is always something to do to keep one busy and productive throughout the day. Every day is a new experience or lesson to be learned.
good,"Decent work environment, flexibility with hours, opportunity for more responsibilities. I enjoy working at Kroger, interacting with customers and my fellow co-workers."
good,"when i was employed here it was a rather enjoyable time. my front-end team was the best ive ever been apart of. however when i was offered a chance to move so i could go up, i took the chance. unfortunately after getting there i found out why they couldnt keep anyone there.. the people they had there are some of the most aggressive personalities ive ever seen in a workplace."
good,This was a very fast-paced and fun place to work. The schedule was very flexible and there was never a dull moment. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to make life long friends at a workplace that wants to see you succeed.
good,You should come work here it's a wonderful job .. it's have good customer service. The staff is wonderful overall just good.. I love the staff we have a wonderful bond
good,long nights by yourself and it wasn't no hard part and the most enjoyable part is going home. my management showed respect and teamwork and the workplace was something
good,"Working for Kroger is intriguing. There are fast-paced days and slow-paced days. Its a company that needs every department to play its role to ensure a friendly, fresh environment for its customers."
good,"fast paced, fun to work for mostly, like all places corporate is obsessed with cutting hours and doing more with less, the pay could be better, however the benefits are very nice"
good,"The employees are nice and they are able to match my speed. It is usually me bagging, helping customers, and cleaning the store. It is the basic route in other retail stores but I don't mind because they theme days and special event for both the employees and customer when needed. I do recommend this for a starter job."
good,"its simple you go to work talk your supervisor and began your task."
good,"After 41 years it was ok, it paid the bills, had a great hard working crew, it was a job that you had to hurry up to get done, my night at work was a good job, I worked one side of the store, and when I got through I helped my co workers, I learned how to work hard and to help customers while we were open, management was good, they were there to help you, it had a good culture,  the hardest part of my job was long nights and big grocery trucks, had to work at a very fast pace, lol, break time was a most enjoyable time of the job."
good,"Working as a jewelry sales associate I started with no background experience straight out of  high school and was taught by management in the store the moment I started working. Learned about customer service, product knowledge  and how to do simple repairs in store such as; watch battery replacements, ring straightening, checking for loose stones in settings,  replacing watch bands and size adjustments. Sales team was amazing, was team oriented, and encouraging. Personally the hardest part of the job was selling ad-on sales like store credit cards to customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was selling pieces of jewelry to my customers  and knowing I helped them find that perfect piece for the occasion and making it memorable along with personal."
good,"Overall a nice place to work, especially when there's teamwork.You can grow and advance if you are a hard-worker. If workers are not trained well, it can be a hassle and hold you back from your own work. Managers are overall great, but at times micro-manage. Good hours, weekly pay, and direct deposit is a plus. You will learn a lot of new things and gain lots of skills,if you are promoted. Health benefits are great. I went in for  a check up that would've cost about $300, but only have to pay $45. The hardest part about the job is when it gets really busy you can have a huge workload and managers expect it to be easy, but the best part is that you still benefit in the long run from the flexible hours and friendly co-workers. Also love it when customers recognize you because you have helped them a lot."
good,It's a fun place to work especially while I was in high school but it's getting old. I really like the managers and the store directors and I made good friends while working here.
good,"Kroger was a good place to work where I felt like my job was secure. I worked in a high paced store, so there was always something to do. The management was always available and understood and respected the difference between the pharmacy (the rules and laws we have to abide by) and the regular store rules."
good,"Everybody, had their own jobs to and procedures to follow. Everything was organized. Friendly environment, everybody working together to give each customers the best service."
good,"A typical work day consists of working rotations around the pharmacy such as inputting prescriptions, counting the medicine, and releasing them to the patients. My communication skills improved dramatically while being here, especially learning how to talk to unhappy patients during stressful situations. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers who blame you for their suffering because they can't get their medicine due to various reasons. The most enjoyable part of the job is physically counting the medicine and knowing that you are allowing someone to feel better and potentially be a productive member of society."
good,"I would bag groceries for customers & if they needed help taking them out to their car then I would do so as well as helping them shop. Stocked groceries, cleaned the bathroom, pulled the carts inside, sometimes cashiered. Very quick paced job and amazing to meet so many people and smile at them and provide the best customer service possible."
good,Kroger has a outstanding management and balanced work schedule for there employees. The union is so helpful if there is a employee that needs help or information on something.
good,Kroger is overall a good place too work. The are hard on there employees too drive them too do good. working with the public can be difficult at times but they come in and love too talk too us about there days sometimes we are the only people they see that day.
good,"Co-workers are friendly, pay is competitive, most stores are run in a professional manner. Only negative is Pharmacists who are fast efficient workers are put at awful stores.  In other words, one is rewarded for setting their work standards VERY LOW, those who bust their behind are stuck at THE WORST LOCATIONS!!!!!"
good,Punching in and going right to where you are supposed to be. Good benefits. Decent Pay. The hardest part of the job is pulling in the carts and the most enjoyable part is when you have big festivals in town and get tourists.
good,i believe its a good workplace to start with but the management isnt the greatest they need to learn to cooperate more other than that its a good job.
good,"My hours vary from 5am to 1pm or 4pm-12am. A typical day at work includes setting up register tills for the day and preparing the store. if supplies are needed for customer service, I put an order through for those items. Throughout the day I run customer service desk and help customers with their needs. I try to help the customers with the best value that I can get for them in one stop."
good,"Overall I would say that Kroger has great benefits with Health Care, vision and dental.  In the nine years I have worked there I have worked with good people."
good,"Working at Kroger is very enjoyable. Meeting new people, learning different things about the job, etc., but it's hard to enjoy the work when an entry level associate is barely paid minimum wage. Someone with a GED or HS diploma should be able to support themselves working here full time. This was not the case during my time with the company. It was a great experience, but merely a stepping stone for greater things."
good,"What I learned work at Kroger was Union and Non Union positions.  My position was talking to the team members listen to what they have to say and then report to the management of the store about their concerns.  "
good,"Your managers and coworkers feel like family. It was a great place to work and gain experience. I loved every position I had there, and if you work hard and show skill you will be offered other positions fairly soon."
good,The overall feel of working at Kroger is very relaxed and is inviting to its employees. The management is very helpful and strives to get the beset out of its employees. Definitely recommend to High-school and College students.
good,"I was an courtesy clerk which made me not enjoy the job. I had to do carts and bag groceries, because of my age. If I was an cashier I think I would've enjoyed it more."
good,Kroger's was a really nice place to work at. Especially if starting younger. They do great with getting young kids jobs to start their working careers.
good,The environment at Kroger is a friendly and fast place to work. It is the customers that you enjoy to see everyday. Management could be a little more put together in some areas.
good,"You get what you put in. It is an unionized company for a reason but I never suffered from either the union or the store management. learned how to manage time. Most enjoyable part was the customers who were regulars and became like a family member, downside management didn't appreciate the contact employees made with its customer."
good,every day is different and can be tiresome. hardest part of the job is when you are slow or very busy and not enough cashiers or baggers. some of the most enjoyable times is when you can talk to the customers.
good,I loved working here. Kroger was actually my first job ever! I will say it was a joy working here and very balanced. They were very flexible with scheduling which I loved. Kroger is a friendly place. Sometimes we had upset customers and I would always reassure them that I would do everything it takes to make something right so they would be satisfied.
good,"Good place to work, good benefits, good compensation, works around school schedules, room to improve in the company, friendly environment, and management is there when you need them."
good,"Typical day at work in my department, included engaging in conversation with customers. Meeting certain goal requirements by our manager as well as the CEOs. Filling floor with priduct, baking items needed for the floor at a timely manner. Packing and scanning floor. Writing on cakes,  helping in the deli with slicing meat and cheese, serving chicken etc. Do all this while helping custoners"
good,the hardest part was when it got busy. was a typical grocery store setting. the managers were cool. there were cool people working there. the customers that came all the time were cool too.
good,It's not a bad place to work but it's a lot of work.. I have to help manage a lot of employees and make sure everyone is doing something productive not just standing around on their phones.
good,"I was always jumping around the store, helping most Departments with their daily tasks. I learned customer service, organizational skills, cashiering, and time management."
good,It was a fun place to work. Management doesn't really listen to what you have to tell them. Co-workers were always a blast to hang out with. Made many friends with the customers that came through.
good,A typical day at work was to supervise the cashiers and customer service department. I learned how to run a productive front-end staff through great training program. Management was easy to work for and clear about the company policies and procedures. Workplace culture was fun and interpersonal. The hardest part of the job was leaving the company to move to another state. The most enjoyable part was a great relationship with co-workers.
good,I would recommend pick n save as a good first job because they cater to you schedule  and they have a very good staff and the job itself is pretty easy
good,"great workplace, great coworkers and management. not much room to  get a promotion. it had above minimum wage for a first time employee. i was paid on time, and took breaks on time."
good,Unless you plan to manage 55+ hours per week this is a starter job and should be viewed as such.  One definitely can not support a family while working here unless they go into management which kills your ability to spend any time with that family.
good,"Expect to start where you have some skills, there is a lot of customer interaction, some light cleaning depending on the department, and many of the employees are very nice"
good,"As my first job, I moved up and had the opportunity to really advance with this company! Although, with school and relocating I chose a Leave of Absence."
good,"A typical day involved putting items on shelves and helping customers look for items. The manager and coworkers were very kind and helpful when I was getting started with the job. Being a stock clerk the job was fairly easy to do with the hardest part being to locate the area where new items go, and the best part of the job was helping customers."
good,I worked at corporate and it was high stress with a lot of politics.  Grocery industry is extremely competitive and merchants are always looking for new ideas to try in the stores.  Great opportunity for advancement
good,its pretty much a easy job just don't get behind nothing is hard about the days go by fast because it stays busy the other employees are good to work with its a friendly good evironment
good,You get paid fairly for the amount of work that you do but it is one of the most boring jobs I've ever had. Not to mention the countless hours of standing.
good,"In a typical day, I would usually greet customers and help bag their groceries and it was a nice experience as you can make someone's day, just by saying hello"
good,The managers were extremely respectful and kept the environment positive. My co-workers were helpful when I had questions about anything. My schedule was easy and everyone was flexible.
good,"Good job to have for High school kids and college students. Its well paced,  they are understanding.  If you have things to come up you are able to notify and they will fill your spot and try and give you the time back later that week to make up.  Absolutely great job."
good,its not as bad people figure it would be since its retail! it has its up and downs for during the holiday seasons.....but other then that its a fun experience!
good,"A good place to work for, they have a lot of good incentives for the employer, and strive to do a good customer service to everyone. "
good,The job was very fast paced with high expectations of running the night crew.sometimes you could get it finished sometimes not.generally never enough help
good,Being a cashier and a Customer service associate is a great and very instructive experience in a multi-cultural country as America. It's give you a certain ability deal with anybody regardless where they from.
good,Kroger is a very friendly but the benefits are only good for the summer then it goes back down. The job has taught many communicating skills and  to meet new people. The managers were pretty cool and wanted us to have a good environment for the customers and associates. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting along with all the associates.
good,The customers who come into the store are amazing and the people that you get to work with are so amazing. The management could do better the way the store manager talks to his employees could be better
good,"Most managers are great to work with,  They are a variety of cultures to work with. The hardest part of the job, was being put on a register with, out, ""the fast lane'  a bagger. The most enjoyable part was working at night alone pricing."
good,This was a great place to work and I really enjoyed my time there. My co-workers were some of the greatest people to work with but the hours are what killed me.
good,Worked as a pharmacy technician and it was an overall great experience. It was a fast paced environment with extremely supportive and knowledgeable staff.
good,"•	Provided exceptional service to customers"
good,"I've worked for them three times. I've left due to births or health issues. Good place to work, but you must have a great work ethic. Great employees, feel like family."
good,"Very friendly people, easy to get along with and work with. Friendly environment and great management. Management is extremely helpful. Work is busy but not physically demanding"
good,This job offers many entry level opportunities and many opportunities for advancement. It also works well with balancing having a life and a job at the same time.
good,"The company is a great to work, great benefits, the way the bonus structure is set up is great, the people are amazing from the workers to the customers. Higher management needs a little more working on  with the way how the handle certain situation."
good,"Normally I would take inventory of what needs to be stocked in produce, and I would get the produce and stock it. I would also stock that days truck into the walk-in cooler."
good,"A typical day includes clocking in and getting started immediately. There is very little time between customers, if any. After working for about half my shift I get my break, 15 or 30 minutes depending on the length of the shift. Afterwards I go back to work and go home. Management is pretty nice and forgiving. The culture is diverse. Hardest part is dealing with rude customers when you're just following policy, or explaining to customers why you can't take their coupons. Most enjoyable is going on break."
good,I worked there for 6 years some of the best years of my life I met the best people in my life here easy to pick up lots of opportunities I was part time tho and offten it became hard to get hours still was my favorite job
good,Really enjoyed the employees and managment. The customers were always great. Was paid well and it was a pretty layed back enviroment. Company goes out of the way to make all employees feel wanted.
good,"Kroger Pharmacy has become a diverse entity n the retail pharmacy community providing, immunization services,  and service to many insurance companies."
good,"I feel good to work at Kroger Pharmacy.  All of my staff members are very co-operative.   I work part time at Kroger store.  "
good,"Kroger was a pretty decent job I worked in the fuel center so I wouldn't be able to paint a picture as far as the in store experience, but in the fuel center your by yourself you're allowed to be on your phone, otherwise you'd die of boredom."
good,speaking and assisting customers . pay is very reliable and so are the hours sometimes work is face pace but overall very enjoyable the hardest part would be working on a holiday
good,krogers is like a family they help eachother out when needed i loved working there many many great smiles and sprites there true hard working company .
good,"A typical work day for me was clock in grab a shopping cart, which was used for the boxes, plastic and any trash in the store. I would go to the back to get some pallets and start putting the iteams on the shelfs. When that is done you would make everything look nice, and bring things that were pushed back bring them up so people could see it. "
good,It was alright working there.  The breaks could be 20 minutes instead of 10. But overall employees are friendly and helpful and most of the customers are friendly too.
good,"I liked working at Kroger as a bagger and a cashier.  While I was there however, I was attending school and other extra curricular activities, so Kroger could not work out with my lengthy schedule."
good,Always stay busy. Theres always something that can be done. Mystery shoppers tend to stop in and out of the store so make sure you stay up on your A-game.
good,"A typical day at work would be me sending money transfers, doing money orders and assisting customers with their  transactions."
good,Advancement in the company. There are many variety of  opportunities in job positions and learning skills. Team building.
good,"I miss working here. The co-workers were nice and the pay was good. The only problem was the work load, it would tire me out most days."
good,"You would be given a task and worked with a group of individuals to complete it in a timely manner. "
good,"Preparing hot foods, cold foods, setting the deli case, helping customers, cashier in the deli. Enjoyed it for the most part. Hardest part was dealing with lazy co-workers and picking up their slack."
good,"A regular day at work would be stocking, cashiering and answering a question about a location of a product. Your co-workers and managers are all there to help you if needed."
good,"Even though you start part-time, the company actually has a good advancement rating. Great environment to work at and they actually care about their employees"
good,I learned a lot from my short time being at Kroger. I Learned how to move at a more work and complete a task at at work related pace and meet a few great people while employed.
good,"Here at Kroger we do a lot. The ClickList department that I work in get a lot of buisness and it's a lot to keep up with but we get the job done. What we do is load groceries for people who order them online, and this consists of people who are disabled, hurt, unable to go grocery shopping due to newborn babies. Our work environment here is very family based and caring."
good,I like the idea of meeting new people and the fact they work around your schedule. There's is always a chance for advancement. Coworkers are very friendly.
good,A typical day is usually busy and hands on.  I learned how to color wheel and rearrange department and even dress maniquinns.  Management was okay.  Coworkers were decent some were more stressed then others.  The hardest part is handling a angry customer  and trying to help them and improve their mood.  The most enjoyable is when you make a angry or stressful customer happy and want to come back.
good,A good place to work. The best part of the job for me was interacting and helping customers. I enjoyed working there and learned a lot about produce.
good,Didnt work there long enough to realy get into the swing the job is very fisical it made my ankel swell and found an extreamly old injury
good,"Kroger is a place that really cares for their employees. The hardest part of the job was managing the U-Scan stations, as they can become overwhelming. The most enjoyable part was the friendly atmosphere. Coworkers and customers alike are usually very pleasant to be around. Management was very kind and extremely motivated to make Kroger #1."
good,"Working at Kroger is basically like working at any other retail store. You deal with whiny customers on a daily basis, you put up with the manager in your ear at all times and they want to work you until you can not work anymore. You receive great benefits from working there, but trying to advance there is pretty tough unless you suck up to the manager and beg. The hours there are decent, but the amount of people who work on the front end is absurd. There's barely anybody working up front and if you are the bagger(bagging customer's groceries) you have to do a lot of ""bouncing"" from register to register."
good,None of the Kroger stores I work at really have the greatest management team and most associates lack a positive outlook on their job and tend to complain more times than not. I want to be somewhere where I can be complete control of what I'm doing instead of everyone working with me not pulling their own weight. I was being underutilized and unappreciated.
good,They really care about their employees ! I never had a problem with them they even helped pay for my college fees. Would def work there again.
good,This was my first job that taught me how to work well with others. I learned how to enjoy myself while working at the same time and that your workplace is as good as you make it. I made the best of it and really enjoyed it and meeting customers.
good,"A usual day at work consisted of a constant pace change, I learned how to organize a lot better (fitting items into one basket). I was pregnant when I had this job so I'd say the hardest part was lifting objects over 30 pounds. All the workers were friendly or just self kept, drama free environment. I enjoyed cart pushing, it was a chance to get fresh air and a work out, and meeting all kinds of people, it wasn't really ever boring. Management was very organized and caring of their employees at all times, that makes a huge difference."
good,"Everyone there was nice. Had no issues with anyone. The hours were fair. The work was fair. I learned customer service and how to stock shelves. My managers were great, i always felt understood."
good,"Kroger's is a great place of work. Where its much laughter, happy, and the upmost satisfied customers. Very welled professional Management. Kroger's is the place to be."
good,I worked with great co-workers and had great supervisors. My day was always busy and had to keep organized to meet deadlines daily
good,Love working with my co-workers. Time goes by fast when it is busy. The customers are very nice. This job is part  time. Management is easy to work with. Learned to ring people up in a timely fashion without errors. Learned a new program in the self check out lane.
good,Working at Kroger has allowed me to meet all types of people from all walks of life. I get to impact people on a daily bases and provide fresh products quickly and in the most friendly environment possible.
good,On a typical day I Restock any items that have been returned. I learned to always be ready to assist shoppers at all times and engage in friendly conversation with shoppers.
good,"At Kroger it was always full of happy customers, managers, associates etc. It was mandatory of course to be on top of your ""A"" game leaving and coming in to work. Everyday wasn't always easy but we all managed to get the job done whether of it was on our own or with a little help from a co-worker."
good,company invests good work ethics and life management skills. opportunities for advancement were available. team work is key and customer server is top notch.
good,"This was my first job! It's a really nice grocery store to go to, but it's been lacking as of late. When I first started working there, the management was relatively solid, but then everything slowly changed; new management, some power trippers here and there that ended up making some folks up and leave in the middle of their work shifts. Regardless, the store still has it's charm and still provides good customer service and care."
good,Everyone seemed very friendly and happy. You can see them diligenlty working and smiling all the while. However they could have talkeid to the cutomers more
good,If your looking for something simple then its an OK job  all depends on what Kroger you work at and if your into physical labor.
good,Great starter Job with benefits within the union. Management was reasonable and caring with their associates. I was pleased to have worked for krogers
good,Lack of coworkers and communication lead to slow training. I enjoy working here but as it's a part-time job at minimum wage I am not making a living.
good,"I loved working here. I loved my customers and fellow workers. The management noted to me that, even though I did training on my own accord there, I would never advance beyond my position. The fuel center is great for people who are a bit laid back and want spurts of business. Inside is great for being busy. Drew and Sherry are some of the best managers i've ever dealt with."
good,Loading and Unloading trucks. Working pallets with grocery stock to the shelf by specific aisle and scanning product that doesn't go on shelf. Managing backstock and ordering each night for trucks during the week.
good,"My review is from a management perspective.  I was not a store employee.  I worked in a division corporate office.  Working at Kroger provided the least amount of stress that I have ever had in a job.  Now granted, not every Kroger employee can say that, but for me it was true.  I had a good manager and we really got along great. They offer a good bonus plan for management level employees as well as yearly deferred stock.  Insurance was inexpensive but had a high deductible.  The did offer and contribute to an HSA that offset the high deductible some.  The job I had did not have a great deal of advancement opportunity.  I do wish I never left.  The company is growing and doing great financially."
good,"your co-workers is what makes this job worth wild. the work is steady. picks up during holidays. its union so you have job security. the hardest part of the job is dependent on your job position, mine i worked warehouse so the constant lifting can put a strain on your back so make sure you take care of it. get rest and wear a back brace if you need one."
good,If you have avaiablty you will fit in and management expect you to get alot done during the day and doesnt provide you with no help
good,"i use to love working there. the mangement was great, boss was great, and the employees were ok. overall a good job to have."
good,A good place to work with potential for more than just a part time job. High stress but then again aren't all retail stores? Breaks are a bit short and not very well managed and help is scarce even when called for.
good,"I learned how to come out of my shell, and be more talkative when having a conversation with the customers. There is so much room for growth and the trainers are amazing. When you go through training they teach you everything so you're beyond ready for your first day of work."
good,Overall a good company to work for. However the compensation is on the low side. $11 an hour and worked for the company almost 8years with great annual reviews and management referrals.
good,It's retail grocery and there are a lot of workers but if you have a stellar work ethic you will stand out and you will move up.
good,"Entering and processing prescriptions accurately, counting, filling and labeling prescription bottles , etc. Verifying insurance, communicating with insurance companies, assisting customers with questions and or concerns. Making sure every customer is satisfied and happy with our service."
good,"I love my job!  The people I work with are great and I enjoy a fast-paced environment.  I love helping the customers and getting the job done quickly but efficiently."
good,"Everyone works well together and they are all very professional. In a typical day all technicians rotate through out the pharmacy, while still   helping one another where necessary. I have learned data entry and easy fill, product dispensing and shelf maintenance, maintaining patient profiles, release to patient, adjudication rejects, and so much more. Every day is a learning experience. The other technicians as well as pharmacist and pharmacy manager are all very knowledgeable and wonderful people."
good,"A typical day at work for Kroger is all determined on which department you work in.  I am a seafood lead and have to set the seafood up five days a week.  also other responsibilities and duties include helping customers that need help whether wanting something from your department or another department.  The hardest part of the job is getting everything done on time or just done in general.  If you don't have a good crew that finishes up the jobs in the evening then you pretty much are running around all the time doing your stuff and their stuff.  All in all though it is a good job and most of the people are good to work with."
good,This job was fun! I was a cashier. There were some employees that would stir up some drama but thats everywhere. Typical day at work was just the same thing pretty much clock in check people out take a few breaks clock out go home and repeat. The managers were AWESOME! Loved almost all of them.
good,i had fun helping customers. i was always out to help any customer with any problem in the store if no one else was there to help out. just an great exprience.
good,"fun environment, work is less stressful because of the people I work with. handle problems pretty well. they appreciate what we do. team work!"
good,Company has awesome benifits. Have been working for kroger since I was 15 years of age. Started as a bagger and have worked my way up in this company plenty of opportunity if you dont have small children.
good,"co workers are great."
good,"nice place to work  costumers"
good,I love working for Kroger it was my first job the people were friendly we had the union of course they wasn't to happy about that but they took care of there employees
good,This was a great place to work while going to school. They worked great around my schedule. I learned my customer service skill first from this place while dealing with customers.
good,"If the position is available, Kroger is pretty flexible with people. It's actually really difficult to work mornings unless you've been there for a while due to their seniority policy, but they try their hardest to work with people's lifestyles."
good,Most of the employees that work at Kroger are nice and cool so making friends isn't hard. The management there is never slacking and treats you like family.
good,It can be a fun place to work at and really nice people. Good benefits and flexibility. The most enjoyable part of this job is the ability to learn new things.
good,Enjoyed working there for 20 plus years. very sad to leave enjoy my work. Got promoted 5 times in twenty years. Very sad to leave at the end of 20 years of service.
good,Helping associates was the best part of my day!  Many people don't have computer skills in different programs which they need to use but are not trained on.
good,"Nice considerate people there, that really care about flexibility and making sure we all got along for the better of the customers"
good,"Kroger is located in Versailles, KY. It has great management and inviting/skilled staff. Everybody works together to get the job done, make sure the customer is satisfied, and keeps customers coming back."
good,Kroger is not a place I would recommend working at for a long time.  It's a stressful job if u begin to learn the management.
good,The environment is great. The job allows a person to build experience to advance your own career. Loss prevention allows a person to advance their career in security.
good,"I loved working at kroger and if i didn't have to move for college i would still be working there today. My job was to be a bagger when i started. I had to bag groceries and also get carts throughout the day. When i turned 18 they moved me to a Dairy Clerk, which meant i had to fill and stock anything that was in the dairy department."
good,"Usually dealing with customers was not that stressful. Of course you had those days where management was involved for a specific reason, but mostly I liked the work that I did and I excelled in my field. If there was one aspect of the job that I loved, that would be the team of people that I worked with. It really was like having a small family of people that really cared about you and making sure that you succeed at the place that your at. The hardest part of my job are the details. In customer service you are handling so many things at one time that sometimes you might miss something important, and that one little detail could cause the whole project to come crashing down. But on the flip side, the most enjoyable part of my job is getting to interact with so many different people. I like mixture and diversity, because I'm always socializing with someone new everyday and learning about new things through that person and knowing that the next day of work brings a new experience is what I look forward to."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Kroger. I worked Customer Service for almost 16 years, and got along well with most employees. The benefits were great and job advancement was available, but I enjoyed what I did. I loved taking care of the customers, and tried to make whatever was wrong with their orders right."
good,"As a lead at Mariano's you have to run the break board, make sure all employees are checked in and assign them to a register or task. You must also make sure lines are not forming and take care of customers at the service desk. I have learned to be patient while working here. My managers are easy to talk to and I like that other employees seem happy to be working. The hardest part of this job is taking care of difficult customers. The most enjoyable part for me is the satisfaction of getting things done and helping customers with ease."
good,"Typically im cutting meats , making salads its pretty fast paced , "
good,My job is pretty repetitive but can be interesting sometimes. Management is good depending on which location you are at so it varies. The best part about the job is meeting new people.
good,I have worked for Kroger since August and have moved several different positions to be able to grow with the company and move up the corporate ladder. The hours are flexable and can be worked around your schedule if needed.
good,I enjoyed the experience and the opportunity to work for this company. Staff and team was cooperative and helpful. Fun to work with and supportive in every way.
good,Overall I must say that working for Kroger has been a rewarding experience. They continued to work with my school schedule throughout high school and college and allowed me to receive a full time position upon request. Kroger provides insurance that is affordable yet sufficient . Working at Kroger has blessed me with the experience to meet all kinds of people from all walks of life. It has indeed been a very opportunistic and multicultural experience.
good,"Stocking shelves and doing CAO numbers. learned nothing that i didn't learn in the army, management is very stricked with certain things, co workers are good to work with, speed will be the hardest things to get down if you go on different isles. most enjoyable part of the job is making sure that the CAO numbers are correct for the products."
good,"Typical day at work: Unloading trucks, taking merchandise off pallets onto "" buggies "" in accordance to where the merchandise belongs in each aisle. Stocking merchandise quickly, effectively, very orderly with the merchandise labels facing the front for ease of customer. What I learned: To be faster than some of my co workers and helping them to stock merchandise after I had finished stocking all the merchandise corresponding to me, Management: I didn't have to be told what to do most of the time because I have the motivation and initiative to look for things to do and very seldom was I asked to do something, due to me going through every aisle and making sure everything was in it's place and neatly ordered. My Co-workers: I got along just fine with them. The hardest part of the job: The first day at the job. Having to learn everything I learned. The most enjoyable part of my job: Once everything was on shelves, to ensure all merchandise was in perfect order and everything in its correct place."
good,In my time with Kroger Foods I learned some of the key things I have carried with me throughout my school and work career. Kroger was my very first place of enjoyment and I believe it was the perfect place to start my work career.
good,There is always something new happening at a gas station and where I was the manager was there from 6 am to 6 pm making sure that everything was running smooth and it was just a great store overall.
good,"Working overnight at Kroger is tiresome. Its kind of boring, I think I am more of a people person, i loved working in the day time interacting with customers and co-workers."
good,"At my home store, I almost immediately felt like a part of the Kroger family. The environment within the Meat Department was stressful as I started right in the kick-off of the holiday season, however after I made it through the ""test by fire"" I gained the respect of the rest of the store and every other stress related to work-load was easy to get past."
good,"As a pharmacy technician and full-time student, I've learned to balance my schedule and manage my time successfully.  My co-workers are friendly and cooperative.  While it can be challenging at times, I do genuinely enjoy the atmosphere of my job."
good,"I usually bag groceries and push carts that's the hard part especially in the winter.I learn to about the store, be nice to the customers and help them out."
good,"Busy, busy, busy. I learned a little from Kroger. Management changes quite frequently at Kroger. My co-workers are great! The hardest part of my job was Being told how to do something by people who have no idea what they are doing. The best part of my day was seeing my customers smile."
good,you can advance quickly if you desire and have aptitude. You work every holiday. They have a pension plan and health benefits and vacation pay.
good,I enjoyed the management team and my fellow employees. They trained us well and made sure we knew what we were doing but then gave us the independence of doing our jobs without hovering
good,Management was always motivating us to move forward and it was overall a great experience. I enjoyed working there. Holidays were exhausting but enjoyable none the least.
good,"I worked with amazing customers and employees, learned about myself as well as others.  Good pay.  Management was very understanding about life, and kids and work schedules.  The hardest part of the job was being away from my kids so much."
good,"I loved working for kroger. even though I was part time i was also pregnant and they understood that some times i just needed a break. I loved my co workers, everyone was helpful and nice and were always there to lend a hand. The hardest part of being a cashier is sometimes you get difficult customers but you learn different ways to help explain the situation and try to find out what helps the customers feel more at ease and try to figure out what has happened and what you can do to fix the problem."
good,They'll teach you anything you want to know to do the job correctly.  Management listens to both the customers and the employees to make each satisfied.
good,"Typical day started and ended with balancing the cash drawer.  I learned and taught new cashiers on the use of the self-checkout system.  In any given day, working between four check stands and helping each customer if needed, was a definite fast-paced and challenging working environment.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working with all the customers."
good,i really learn how to be a team player and know the roles of all my fellow co-workers. had a great atmosphere to work and keep me very busy which i liked.
good,I enjoy the Kroger company.  There benefit package is one of the best I have seen and they do work with you on your schedule as well as offering opportunities in other areas of the store.
good,A typical day at work consists of lots of customer interaction and making sure they are satisfied. Time goes by fast when you have lots of work to get done. I like getting to know the regulars and will have their drinks made before they even reach the register. Being a barista is fun!
good,"It is a great job to start out with, being your first job. I learned that you need a lot of patience to work here. My co-workers are friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is being the floor supervisor because I had to make sure everyone had their breaks and lunches on time. The enjoyable part of the job is when I get to move around in the department and help everyone out as quickly as I can, properly."
good,"Opened and/or closed department when scheduled to. Maintaining constant presence on the sales floor to address customer needs, and recommending appropriate items and completing purchases was all in a typical work day. In the nineteen years that I worked for this company, I learned a lot about jewelry. The hardest part of the job was overcoming objections. I enjoyed working for this company, the employees I worked with, and the job as a Sales Associate."
good,"A typical day in the position consisted of beginning my shift with draw countdown. Upon getting on the register, the day's customer flow was consistently steady for the entire shift. At the end of my shift, I was responsible for counting and balancing the drawer as well as closing refreshment dispensers. I got along with all of my co-workers extremely well. The hardest part of this position was working the entire shift with no breaks in customer flow. The most enjoyable part of this job was building rapport with customers."
good,I really enjoyed working at Pick N Save. It was a fun environment to be around with great people to work with which made my experience with them very positive.
good,"Was a fast paced, always on the go job that was enjoyable to me. Friendly environment and since the store I worked at was so small everyone were like family. The job itself wasn't bad as long as you like the general public and dealing with retail customers."
good,The store is always busy everyday. The only thing I say working there is to have an positive attitude because people there feed off that negative energy. Management will sometimes to take advantage of you if you dont speak up. Overall its a good company to work for.
good,Each day was different. Co workers were great to work with. Management was very flexible with scheduling. Great customers
good,"*My typical day at work would be to clock in. Set and prepare my work station, gather all the notes from the department manager. Prepare and tackle all job duties and responsibilities given to me. Assist customers in a professional, friendly manner."
good,Great company to work for. There are opportunities to further yourself in the company. There are plenty of stores to also look into furthering yourself in the company.
good,"This job was the greatest experience of them all. It helped me build character and people skills being that it was my first job and I started as a teenager. Its a very fast paced environment and helped me learn what great customer service is,"
good,Kroger was a good place to work. The day consisted of ringing up the customers orders and collecting payment for their items. I learned a lot about working with customers. The co-workers and management were a joy to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job was the opportunity to work with others on a daily basis.
good,A typical day is taking care of the customers and making sure that they find and get everything they need. I have learned that working for Kroger that you come across different various of people and dealing with multiple personalities. The management team is very stern but they're very family oriented.  My co-workers are a lot of fun to work with and we look out for each other.  The hardest part of my job is making sure that my accounting clerks keep everything in order.  The most enjoyable part of the job is making sure my customers leave with a smile on their face and come back to see me.
good,"Great place to work, building rapport with customers and closing a sell on a product. Heavy clerical and logistical work with an enjoyable work enviroment."
good,"Working for the Kroger company has taught me a lot about not only my self, but others as well. I've learned how to understand others frustrations and not only understand, but to lend a helping hand. Not only have I learned how to understand my customers, but also understanding my co-workers/team is very important as well. We have a good team here at Kroger and what makes us great.  I've learned how to remain calm in heated situations and also turn a negative situation into a positive situation. Did not realize how a simple ""How are you doing today?"" would make a persons day until i start working for Kroger. "
good,Everyday is different and many times affects how and when you do day to day activities. Mostly Good working with the public is awesome.
good,Kroger was my first job. I had a great person training me that made me free really comfortable and confident about being new to the work force. Overall the management was very flexible and understanding. I loved the people I worked with while at Kroger. We were without a doubt a family at the location I worked at. The hardest part of the job was remembering all the produce items and the long hours I worked while still in high school. Working in the floral department was my favorite. I got to work on my own and work with flowers. I learned a lot about time management and staying focused while working in the floral department. Often times I was alone and was given a list i had to completely in addition to a few other things.
good,Marianos was a great environment to work in. The fellow employees are all happy outgoing person. Over all just a great place to work and shop.
good,"I am in charge of setting up the sales displays and culling the floor and getting ready for the store to open .  "
good,"Every day, working with my team, put a smile on my face. The customers were always a joy as were the associates. Coming to work was the highlight of my day, being able to meet new people and have life long friendships with each and every one of my peers made it that much more special to be there. The hardest part of a day would be if we didn't have a product a customer wanted and could not order the product. I strived every day to be better than I was the day before. The management team I worked with every day, supported each other as well as the entire team. I enjoyed working for the Kroger Co."
good,"Kroger is a great place to work, especially for a first job or High school student. Managers are friendly and respect you upon your work efforts and cooperation. One noticeable think is that there is a lot more drama working in the front as appose to working in the back. Employees are treated fairly and disrespect, immaturity, and laziness are not tolerated. People who are prejudice in any way are not hired as for Kroger is an equal opportunity company."
good,"Steady Job"
good,"Helping customers at guest care with various tasks (Money orders, Western Union, returns, lottery), and occasionally helping customers  checkout quickly. Balancing money in store office and checking on losses and gains. Learned a lot of patience dealing with all types of problems and people. The management has some questionable people. They like to think they know everything, but do not. Communication between them and everyone else is very poor. And once they do it's very late. Hardest part of the job was balancing all my responsibilities in a timely manner. They ask you to do so much yet my store was so busy I spent a majority of my time on register. The most enjoyable was helping customers and making them the satisfied customer we rely on."
good,"A typical day at work would be I would take care of customers, check the customers out, handle money, help customers find objects that they could not locate and provide a teamwork environment with fellow employees. I learned money handling, and how to provide customer satisfaction. Management was very helpful to help me with stuff i did not know how to do, also helped me with being able to work around my school schedule. Co-workers worked together with me and others to help provide a functional workplace and environment for the customers we were serving and also helped provide a fast and functional check out time for the customers."
good,I loved working at The Kroger Company. A typical day of work was fine with me usually once or twice a day I would g outside and push carts in. I feel as though working here gave me better customer service skills. I absolutely loved all the managers except for one. I loved my co-workers we all really got along. The job was really fairly easy I have no complaints. Probably my favorite part of the job was the people I worked with.
good,"Trabaje de ayudante, dependiente, reponedor, etc."
good,"I learned how Kroger pharmacies operate, I enjoyed working with a variety of skilled people including pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and interns.  I enjoyed helping customers understand their health care options."
good,"As a pharmacy technician I don't interact a lot with the other employees in the store, but from my time as a bagger I know that 95% of the people that work there are super nice and helpful, I really like my co-workers in the pharmacy also. Management has always been pretty good since I got there but I know from other employees that it wasn't always the case. The manager we have now is always really friendly and helpful and isn't afraid to pitch in to help the store run more smoothly. The hardest part about my job is the customers, working in the pharmacy, a lot of things can go wrong either with the doctors, or the insurance companies, or even things that can't be helped but customers don't like that and you end up getting yelled at a lot. Oddly enough the most enjoyable thing about my job is also the customers, there are always going to be bad customers but the good ones are really good, working in the pharmacy you tend to form a more personal connection with the people who come in once or twice a week and some people really appreciate what we do."
good,"A very busy pharmacy, so time flies and stress levels rise, but with an awesome manager and coworkers like these, who cares?"
good,"Spent long hours maintaining flow of customers in and out the door while maintaining excellent customer service. Often closed store and supervised others. Co-workers are so wonderful, a very friendly environment."
good,"Main source of Customer service work by talking to the customer and   learning to more understand multiple personality's and how to interest or make them feel at ease in our environment. i learned how to get along and socialize with more co-workers old, young, shy, and talkative. stocking and janitorial work part-time taught me to calculate  items and properly place items on shelf so spills or loss of product is not an issue and incentives are given quarterly if done so. The hardest part retrieving carts gave me agility and conditioning in the Arizona heat to be the best at my job i can be with staying in shape."
good,"The Kroger Company is a good company to work for, with a few faults. Most everyone is part-time, which was a negative for me. The Kroger Co. is a union shop, which is also a negative for me. My H.R. manager told me Kroger would not employ anyone who did not sign the union contract, and I didn't want to lose my job, so I did. I asked her the benefits of the union, which she couldn't give me. She shrugged and said FMLA was a benefit, but I got that at another job without having to pay $12.50 a week. Aside from the union, they have good benefits and will work around your schedule."
good,A good experience when its your first job; helps build your customer service skills
good,"Usual day was to provide customer service in the Customer Service Booth. We handle all utility payments, check cashing, Money wire service, and general problems purchased at the store. At the end of the day we were required to audit all tills and make deposit for the end of day. We were then required to file an over/short report for the day's transactions."
good,"a typical work day is doing whatever needs to be done in your department in your shift and helping customers. I've learned how to be patient on the job and do the job right. Management is fairly well. I never really see my boss but when i do i do my best to show him what i've learned/accomplished. Hardest part of the job would be doing the same things each day and having patients with it. Getting different truck loads and having to deal with outdated and updated products while attending to customers needs can be a bit overwhelming but doable. The most enjoyable part of the day is leaving at the end of the day. Not only the fact of going home of course, but looking back knowing you got through the day and did your job and completed your tasks."
good,"Working at Kroger has taught my many new customer service techniques, and has provided me with a stable job for over a year."
good,"My co workers are friendly. The most enjoyable of my jobs is seeing my regular customers and making their day when I remember their pack of cigarette and the amount of gas they usually get. The hardest part of my job I would say its you cant please every customer. No matter how friendly you are or give them the best service. The customer can always find something to complain about. A typical day at the fuel center. In the morning you get all the paperwork reading for the day. You put the night before report together. Stock shelves, fill pop machine condition shelves, clean the fuel center. Later in the day you go in the store and get merchandise for the fuel center that is needed, scan it out take to the fuel center and stock it. Also during stocking in between that your taking care of customers. At the end of shift you count your till. I been with Kroger for almost 12 yrs. I have learned a lot. I have grown as a person, gain communicating skill, leadership skills."
good,I love retail pharmacy and appreciated the duties to be challenging which helped me become a senior tech. I enjoy interacting with the customers and the personal relationships we developed. I have excellent customer service and love the medical field.
good,"My typical day started with about five people wanting my attention before I even got in the door. When you are in charge of all the employees pay, they want to make sure it is correct and any mistakes they made are corrected immediately. I would them walk the premise to get an  idea of what needed to be done on the computer to help all the department managers get their day started. After I did this I went to my office and updated myself with the company emails. I would then do the list of things the managers needed before my boss came in. I then set my crew on their way to start their day with what I needed them to do. I prided myself on making sure that I did the best I could to make my place of business and my boss look good to his boss."
good,Company and management staff did a great job working with me that allowed me to maintain employment while going back to school.  They allowed me to change from being a third shift manager to a second shift clerk.  They even left my pay at management pay for the first year I was in school.
good,"Decent paced work, supervisors play favorites, good management for the most part, co-workers are nice and friendly, best part of day typically is leaving to go home, customers can be a pain sometimes,"
good,"A typical day at work is going into work about 10-20 minutes early to see how the day has been like, checking the schedule to see what my position will be for the day and who will be coming in and when. Kroger was my first job, I've been with this company for about 9 years, I have learned so much growing with this company. I learned about interactions with customers from all different backgrounds, attitudes, demeanor, which actually is the same way with the employees I work for almost on a daily basis. I had one manager take me under her wing and teach me about the inventory system, marking down products, and displays. I enjoyed it greatly until she got transferred then I was right back on the register. Then I transferred to a different store, there I was trained in the Customer Service booth helping customers a different way, Western Union, Bill Payments. It was an amazing experience. Management was changed out anywhere between 6 months-4 years. But They have amazing people working in management. Hardest Part of the job would have to be working with the really irate customers, you will get that no matter where you work it all depends on how you deal with/react to it and/or fix it. I was not so good with it at the beginning but with coaching from management there was always something new to learn, I have become very good in dealing with all kinds of different customers. All in all this is a great company to start with and there is a chance of moving up, but you will always learn something valuable and meaningful that will help you in every aspect of life."
good,Love working with people and I enjoy meeting new people on a daily basis!
good,the job experience isn't what I needed but it was a good job to have and loved the people I worked with.
good,"Each day you would check groceries and bag and talk to customer and help the customers. I learned how to cashier and the codes for different fruits and vegetables. My coworkers were all nice to work with. Everyone was like a family. The most frustrating part is that you only get your schedule a week in advance. It was hard to plan things like that because you wouldn't know what you worked Sunday until Friday night, but I loved helping and talking to the customers."
good,They supported me and praised me for the help everyday . Gave me hours when I needed them. No complaints
good,"- work 7 on, 7 off, night shift of a 24 hour pharmacy"
good,"A typical day consisted of cooking two large buffet style meals for over 200 people each, ordering perishable and non-perishable supplies, hiring and training new employees, scheduling, meetings, and managing our spending and shrink. Our kitchen was an open one so I had to learn to balance customer service with cooking; the ability to multi-task was an essential part of every day. My co-workers respected me and treated me like family. The hardest part of the job was doing all of my other duties while still cooking a quality food product. Food is very time sensitive and waiting on customer's while paying close attention to what is currently cooking proved to be a challenge at times."
good,It was a nice place to work. It had a lot of benefits and was a nice place to gain experience for future jobs that I may encounter.
good,"I have enjoyed my time with this company. The customers there are great. I know many customers by name & in return they remember me. The work environment is friendly, I get along with all the co-workers."
good,its was kinda hard starting off but the people there cared about the employees...didnt have a car then but i knew they still understood and worked with me
good,"I enjoyed my time at Kroger. Good people and working conditions. Good benefits. Was sad to leave, but wished to return to South Dakota to be closer to family."
good,I assisted the adjusters in a professional environment. The hardest part of the job was not knowing when this assignment would end.
good,"The company has been golden to me, but now im just looking to take the skills i have and make a name for myself."
good,"not to exciting"
good,"learned about QA work, HAACP, MSDS, following GMP's"
good,"I loved working in the meat and seafood department. Those departments provide the right challenges and have more to them than what most people would imagine. I loved butchering, running the seafood department twice a week, helping customers, becoming greatly knowledgable with meat and seafood."
good,"My typical day at Kroger was quite fun because I loved seeing the new faces and I also had the regular customers that would come in and request that I check them out, that would always make my heart flutter. The managers at Kroger were nice and was always on their and keeping the employees on theirs that was fun too. I honestly I really didn't have any hard experiences while working at Kroger because the duties came naturally to me."
good,"A produce department is a wonderful place to work. Everyday is something new, as the seasons bring different product. The colors and smells are wonderful! Building displays can be  challenging sometimes, but fun. Interaction with customers was what I was best at, as I really like people. I enjoy being a bright spot in another persons day. I also enjoyed working with co workers and outside vendors as well.The hardest part of the job was probably throwing the weight. On an average day a produce clerk in a busy department like mine would throw over 2 ton of produce. But the upside of that is it has kept me in very good physical condition for 24 years. Overall I liked this job very much!"
good,"Great Place to work, interesting people. Management was extra nice, and I learned alot from the people I worked around."
good,I was hired 2 days after I applied. It was very fast and they immediately started training me. Training was very smooth and the job was always fun. Great co-workers and managers. I felt I was treated great. I'd have to wait for a year to get health care which was ok with me. Pay isn't great but if you work many hours (you can get as many hours you want in spring/summer/fall). This was a very busy store and I like fast pace so it suited me well. We were always able to take breaks we were supposed to get.
good,"Write orders for perishable items throughout dairy department. Keep control of inventory, by accounting for damaged and outdated product. Plan weekly sales plan. Plan out holiday orders so you'll have plenty of product during holidays. Crew was usually good and followed through with instructions I left for them. The job was stressful, especially as a single parent. The most rewarding part of job was having good sales and be able to control balances on hand ."
good,"I worked at Kroger for about 2 years, and they were probably some of the best times I've ever had at a job. My co-workers were always super friendly and helpful. I thought of them as my family; everyone that worked in the area you worked in, were always really close. Learned on how to work together as a team; everyone being a switch on a plane and if theyre not all switched to the on position, the plane (store) wont run smoothly or correctly."
good,"While Kroger is a nice place to work overall, I would have to say that working there can become emotionally exhausting. Everyone I personally work with is wonderful, don't get me wrong. The area in which I work at is a very private area in aspects of actually having to be considered customer service. Rarely do I personally speak with customers at the store. On that note, I tend to work better at my own pace, which in a sense, Kroger has given me that. Cleaning the deli and bakery does have a time limit which I am able to decide which tasks will take me however long to complete. All the mangers in the store are friendly and take care of your needs. The hardest part of the job would have to be the job itself. While it's a pretty straightforward job, doing the work for multiple nights in a row wears the body out."
good,I absolutely loved working at Kroger Marketplace. I unfortunately wasn't getting enough hours or making enough money to pay my bills.
good,"A typical day at the Kroger Company is filled with pleasure. It is a diverse environment where I intervene with different personalities, cultural ethnicities, and characters. I enjoy the personal relationship that I form with my customers while assisting them on a daily basis. Working at Kroger has taught me how to remain calm in the most uncomfortable situations and how to sympathize with the customers on all personal levels. The most enjoyable part of my job is satisfying my customers and providing excellent customer service."
good,"I've learned many depts. in four years"
good,A typical day at work involved helping customer with merchandise maintaining customers safety as we worked on aisle. I learned how to face and reset merchandise. What I enjoyed was everyone worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was setting shelves.
good,It's never a time when you don't have nothing to do there a lot of on your feet action with alot of settle moments.
good,"I was a front end supervisor, I was in charge of helping to run different shifts of people on a good day it was 15 or more people throughout the day, as well as keeping business running the way the corporate office had intended. The hardest part of my job was when we were short handed, and we were busy as usual. I love to work with the different people I see come in on a daily basis, as well as the fast pace it had for a big company. I learned how to be a good supervisor, as well as tried to get the training I needed to promote with in."
good,"I enjoyed working for kroger,I liked making cakes.But I got moved to another position and I didnt like it very much."
good,"Working at Kroger allowed me to move between positions and learn different roles in a retail environment. One year I worked stock and back of house, and another year I worked front of house in the Wine and Spirits Shop. This job was really fun and I would love to work there again. "
good,"A typical day at work would be engaging with customers through out the day, making connections, and doing as much as you could to satisfy your customer. "
good,"Kroger does a lot of things right. My pay was well above what most other retailers offered at the time, and they worked with my schedule whenever I asked them to. "
good,I would like to say Kroger need  little bit more safety environment training
good,"Productive, stern people, busy Alot of people that are friendly understandable managers great co-workers"
good,I am outgoing person. I just need a job to help me out to start my further in life.
good,"day to day activities are usually the same with a few exceptions"
good,been with this company for almost 6 years and I don't plan on leaving any time soon
good,The management staff is very good. They always stop and ask about your day. They know your name even without the name tag on. When I was in college they were happy to accommodate my class schedule. 
good,"A typical day a work is spent at costumer care. I help costumers with western union, lottery, money orders, refunds, and costumer complaints. I also count tills and run breaks. I've learned better ways of handling difficult situations and ways to deliver ""bad news"". I love the people the I work with and get along with everyone. The hardest part of the job is handling anger and irrational costumers but that comes with costumer service. I love my job because I have multiple responsibilities and can constantly stay busy."
good,I have never worked for a better company or with better management.
good,Working at Kroger is an acceptable job but I need a career that affords me time with my daughter. I currently work the second shift and need a first shift position.
good,"A typical 10 to 12 hour day maintaince on serveral projects , learned how to connect and hook up warehouse light fixtures , rewire cables and other connections , operate standard forklift , management is very friendly willing to help , co-workers are productive ,hardest part is heights while fixing light bulb fixtures , most enjoyable the benefits"
good,"Assisting friendly customers, co-workers are outgoing, friendly, and easy to get along with."
good,A typical day at work consist of long hours and steady labor. The management staff make sure that the job is done efficiently and in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job is the friendly but yet competitive environment each day.
good,I enjoyed working at Kroger's. I thrived on pleasing the customers.
good,My typical day at work is providing customers with great customer service. I've learned to work quickly and under pressure. My co-workers and I get along very well everyone looks out for eachother. I wouldn't say my job is hard at all. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with customers and learning something new everyday.
good,"Working for the company was a positive learning experience for me ,i learned not only how to deal with rational customers but most importantly how to be professional in a work environment.I've learned how to deal with very large sums of money,bookkeeping,filing,data entry and dealing with impatient customers while maintaining a smile on my face.My co-workers where the best to work with we all were one big happy family no matter what shift you worked,the hardest part of my job was leaving."
good,"A typical day at Kroger (based on your department) involves you constantly going back and forth between the back docks to get your product and then put it out on the floor. You have to put product out while also expertly dealing with customers so they don't get angry when you don't have that certain type of meat or vegetable on hand. Its tough to multi-task different things, but its rewarding work. The added benefits for education, full dental and health are also a big plus."
good,Great place for your first job. The management are friendly. They really make you feel like family. The customers are allways great.
good,while at Kroger pharmacy I found it to be a team effort where everyone had everyone else in mind. After learning the computer system everything was pretty standard.
good,"Come in and make sure everything was up and running and ready. Check and fill out reports from the day before and if there were any discrepancies, find out why & where they were and correct them. I learned patiance & understanding when dealing with others. The overall management was very supportive and the co-workers were pretty much like a second family. The hardest part of my job was not being able to give everyone the hours they needed and the most enjoyable part of my job was being able to work with such great people and being able to provide the customers with quality customer service."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Kroger Pharmacy. The pharmacists I worked with were great! I learned a lot from the old way to do things to the new eletronically transmitted way. It was sometimes hard to read the prescriptions, but now its totally different from when I started in 1995. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was getting to know the patients.The hardest part for me was when the computer system was changed a few years ago, and I was so used to the old way. It took a while, but I learned it. A typical day at work was arriving in the morning and first thing emptying the que, which was all the scripts sent in by Drs and refills by patients. Typing in scripts, answering phone, stocking shelves, waiting on patients.etc. also keeping the pharmacy clean and clutter free."
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in frying chicken,slicing deli meat. Washing dishes and taking out trash. I have learned how to communicate very effectively with the public.The management there is excellent they are very flexible and are willing to work with yiur schedule."

Sweeping and mopping the floors. Gather all the shopping carts out on the parking lot. Clean and restock the restrooms."

good,Good Job great customers. work job while in high school. Management work around your schedule and try their best to give you more hours if possible.
good,The hardest part is getting emplouees there on time and showing up for work. Overall it's a great company to work for and great benefits.
good,-Every day I hold my assigned job with a high care.
good,I really enjoyed working here their benefits were very affordable and good. Room to advance if your looking to move up but must put in your time.
good,"A typical day at work is working with customers and serving whatever foods or needs they required. I learned to keep the Deli Shop clean, as it is highly required to be clean for health and safety purposes. Management was hard, but fair. Co-workers helped me and corrected any mistakes I made until I was able to do it on my own. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to customers and getting to know them briefly."
good,I was always good with people. I also learned how to adapt to many different cultures.
good,Great place to learn and grow in the Grocery Industry. Opportunities for growth and new skills always.
good,"great people fun energy, work can be pressful but I would take back nothing from the job."
good,"Great company that really cares. They are very open to employee ideas and give everyone the opportunity to meet the head honchos. In the span of three months, I met the President of the company as well as countless other vices and heads of this and that and the other. All great people, friendly and dedicated to improving the store whenever possible."
good,Many of our patients are so great to talk to and i would love to become friends with them so i may help them in any and every possible way so before they leave our costomer is satisfied.
good,fun relaxing job where people are friendly and proffesional and lend a hand if theres a job they cant handle by themselves. most enjoyable part of the job was talking to customers and hearing how they can shop in a friendly and helpful atmsphere
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Kroger and I was promoted 2 times so it was a great overall experience. Customer service was my first position and I got promoted to their online grocery department, I did not enjoy it as much as being a CSR because I was not able to work directly with the customers. However, it was interesting and fun."
good,Kroger is a great company. It all depends on who your manager is as in any place you may work. You are always eligible for raises within reason and you are able to flourish within this company.
good,It was an very relax environment. I want to be paid more. I tried to go for promotion but was rejected. It is a good job for people just starting out in life.
good,"The people I work with are genuine and most are team players. We are not given enough resources to achieve the goals set by corporate,needed more employees"
good,"From working at Kroger I have learned how to manage my time wisely. How to get through tough situations at work such as such having extra product and putting then on display. The hardest part is just being tired after work, and having to go to my 8 o’clock class."
good,I think that Kroger is a good starting job for anyone interested in the food industry.  Kroger's pay could be better I think that their pay could be increased to at least $10-$12 per hour.
good,On a typical work day it is a nice place to work at. Ive learned that customers love fast and efficient service. Management tries to make sure everyone needs are met. Workplace culture is a grocery store. The hardest part about my job is when the store gets crowed on holidays and it isn’t t enough help. The most enjoyable part about my job is that were all like a family.
good,"family friendly, seriously cares about customers needs....goes through great lengths to ensure quality products and goods. Flexible work and fun environment."
good,Kroger was a slow pace working environment with a lot of social interactions. If you had good social skills it is a good job for you. I learned a lot about the way different people interacted.
good,They provide flexible hours and will work around your schedule and treat everyone equally. The most important thing while working there is customer service and whether the customer is getting everything they need and more.
good,"Kroger is a very upbeat, productive environment. Management is truly there for you, as well as the union. You get paid fairly and consistently every week, and they are beyond flexible with hours and time off!"
good,Competitive paying pharmacy internship with a great group of people working there.  The upper management is comprised of pharmacists so they know where you're coming from and will bend over backwards to help you succeed.
good,"As long as you do your job, ignore all the corporate rants, you could have a very long, stable career for you and your family. Much tedium and grunt work, but pay and stability prevail. I never should have resigned."
good,"Flexible schedules make going to school or a second job much easier than any other employer."
good,"with my years with the company I have learned a lot .like budgets , hiring , training people and getting people to work for you . "
good,"As a first job, for someone in high school or fresh out of high school, Kroger can be a great way to get your foot in the door. Kroger is a fun work environment, but there is still work to be done. When hours aren’t being cut back, this is a good work place."
good,"Very fast paced job and a lot of preparation before you start working,  but I loved this store. Helping people and making sure we have the crew is very important."
good,Working At Kroger Was Pretty Good Everybody Is Nice And If You Need Help They Will Be There Some days Got A Little Outta Hand Especially When There Was A Sale But It Helped Time Go By
good,I really liked and enjoyed this job. I hate I couldn't continue to work for the company.I really would like to work for this company again. It was a really good experience.
good,Everyone is friendly and helpful especially when you are new. Laid back place to work. They let you know how the company is doing every day. You get 15 minute paid breaks.
good,"If you are committed to doing your Job, In a period of two to three years you can go far. Show up on time, Don't have a lot of call outs, do the work, put in the effort and commitment. Employee relationships are awesome once you get to know everyone. It's like having a family outside of your family."
good,"Great co workers, gave great customer service, always a positive vibe at our store except the customer service manager would ruin our vibe when she entered the store our morale would change."
good,Working with Kroger was not bad because I was in high school and they paid weekly but now that I am out of high school I need a better paying job and $9.50 was not enough for me
good,Was a part time job to supplement my income. Was close to home. Weekly paychecks helped with expenses. Most work there part time to supplement income or are in school.
good,"It's a great first job, it can be very stressful, but it is a great job with great benefits, my favorite part was being a full time cashier, and when ever I got to help in the bakery.  I suggest this job as a first job, don't Settle on this job and work for ever, but this is a great first job."
good,I had the opportunity to work with Kroger for 6 months and its a great experience for me. I learnt many skills and got hands-on experience with latest controllers and machines. The management supported me well and backed me in my projects.
good,I enjoyed helping the customers. My coworkers were great (lots of teamwork). In the 16yrs I worked there we had many different managers. I learned alot from them all. The hardest part of the came when they said the store was closing. It was very hard to be motatived.
good,"Check on cashiers, clerks over all look over the store.  Check with other managers see what's going on with lunches breaks and anything else with has to do with a store."
good,Kroger has a very good balance with everything. They take care of the employees and show them what real management should be like. There benefits were good. They gave a very good amount of hours and pay well
good,Work place culture is fast paced but enjoyable. Getting to know your customers and the operations of the gas station is pretty cool . Seeing the process with fueling and dispatch is nice as well.
good,"Great place to be employed. If you have the drive and want to advance in the company you will. District level management is great,Once you take on a department head role your pay gets better."
good,"Kroger has good benefits and discounts for their employees. "
good,Very nice place to work with great benefits at a great price.  Could stand to be paid a little more for hourly wages but was a great setting to work in.
good,"I love everything about my job from the manager to the co-workers. If I wasn’t relocating I would most definitely stay. A typical day in Drug GM is stocking shelves when load comes in, helping customers find what they are looking for, make sure shelves are stocked, make sure the outside furnishings are clean and neat, make sure the promotional aisle is set up and clean. I also make sure my areas are neat, clean and organized."
good,"Good place to work, needs a higher pay. Too many responsibilities but not enough pay for it. Very friendly store, very people oriented, and nice just needs higher pay."
good,"A typical day at work for me was getting out of school at 2:45 and working 3:30-10. I learned a lot of communication skills as well as helping others. The management was overall fantastic just had down days here and there. I loved my job because I got to interact with others, and be a helping hand."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working under Kroger Stores. The typical work day was pretty  easy going. I had a set plan of what I needed to do as a grocery clerk. I learned how to work an automatic dolly and a baler. Management was really nice and worked with you if you needed anything. The environment and culture wasn't too diverse but the store I worked at wasn't located in a diverse area. The hardest part of the job was making sure I got both areas that I worked in covered in one shift. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people and interacting with kids because I would be working on the floor, stocking."
good,"Great place to work. Kroger is usually fairly low on labor costs, so if you don""t do your work associates wont take to kindly to you."
good,"In my personal opinion, it was a really great gig for the most part. It is my first job, and from that regard it really is not that bad as far as retail goes. I got myself healthcare and got my prescription for my eyes completely free out of my coverage."
good,I have worked at a kroger as a courtesy clerk for over a year.  I think it has been a good job.  I am able to bring a lot of carts in for the customers now.
good,"Overall Kroger is a good place to work, with great benefits, however starting pay is just barely minimum wage & once moved up to supervisor you don’t get an additional raise because of their union."
good,"I enjoyed the work at Kroger, its a great job for a part time worker. They give great benefits and usually hire you pretty quick. You may just have to work long hours and back to back shifts at times."
good,Kroger was a great place to work. The environment was very pleasant and the volume was not very high.  It allowed time to address the customers more personally and to counsel them on their medications at length.
good,Great day to day experiences. Also keeping on your toes. Always challenging to keep customers happy. Sometimes frustrating to make each order fulfilled to its fullest.
good,"During my time at Kroger, I found that the overall environment was a steady, relaxing experience. The managers that I worked with were fair, thoughtful, and understanding."
good,Kroger is a pretty good company to work for. Great benefits for the employees and their families. Great dental plan and Great perks that comes with the job
good,Sometimes slow or fast paced but you will always be busy and have something to do to keep you busy until it is time for you to clock out but your in a good working environment
good,"The hours at this Kroger were VERY...VERY low. I had 12 hours for 4 weeks straight, and that doesn't help with a low wage. The coworkers  are what made up the bad aspects of the job. My department managers were cool."
good,"They start you off as a bagger which means bagging groceries, pushing carts in the parking lot (which is not as easy as it looks), loading groceries for customers, washing bathrooms and whatever else they tell you to do. For the most part, there are some nice people there, one bagger has been there for many years he may seem a little off-putting but he can show the ropes better than anyone and is pretty nice. You have to be able to move pretty quickly in this environment as there is a certain amount of time they want this all done in. Career advancement is internal and cannot be applied outside of the company. They post open jobs and you can apply for the position. They love hard workers and those who show initiative. Much of the job seems more of a job for teens and college-age people as you need energy and strength to be able to do this job."
good,"I had this job as a teen and it is a pretty good job to start off with but if one wants to work for Kroger long term, my best advice would be to try to advance from lower ranked positions. They demand lots of manual labor for the lowest possible pay."
good,"I enjoyed working for Kroger. The staff was pleasant and caring. I worked as a Cashier, Curtosy Clerk, and Cashier throughout my employment at Kroger.I would also steer teenage employees in the right direction if they questioned me about future aspects."
good,I had a great time with Kroger and had the wages been a little better for me in my situation at the time i would still have been there to this day. very reasonable store managers that will help you through majority of issues you have at the current day.
good,"It was a good job, but more temporary than a career. But the people they are always pushing you to do your best. Also, you are never alone. Though, they lack keeping workers. The ones that do stay always give a helping hand. Even in stressful situations, you always knew they was someone willing to assist."
good,"The pros of Ralph's is that you develop your social skills which helps boost your confidence, you learn hard work because your managers push you to do a task faster, and you get better service skills because you become more understanding of how a customers wants something done. The cons of working at Ralph's is that some oft the managers are bossy which puts you in an unhappy state to work, the coworkers make a task harder than what it actually is and it stresses you out sometimes, and the customers are sometimes rude and makes you feel unappreciated but overall great place to work if you want to develop yourself as a person"
good,"Roundy's Supermarkets began a merger with Kroger Supermarkets in December, 2015. It completed that merger in January, 2019."
good,Working for Kroger in a department is really cool. The people in your department are like family and they will help you complete the tasks that needed to be done without the harassment. Managers could use a little bit of work on being kinder to associates
good,"They have the best and most cost effective benefits available. Salary is on the lower end but with having a flexible schedule,  you can work part time for benefits while having another fulltime job."
good,The environment was friendly you did have some people that would try to get under your skin but other then a good work environment. Had good discounts and benefits management would be harsh at times but its understandable they just expected the best from others but sometimes they would go to far. It would be stressful and relaxful as a typical you would have the good and bad as any job the slow and the fast paced days in all it was alright.
good,Usually you just had to assist customer when you could and keep up your item number.You get to have an hour lunch on full days and #0 min lunch on smaller days.
good,I was in high school when I started this job but I seem to manage in school pretty well around this time I loved to get paid every week it will really help me out at the time of my life hours were very flexible customers and employees we're very sweet
good,"Independent work, once you are trained you will be left to run either bistro,bakery,or deli so you will learn to manage time.There is always something to do."
good,"The job is fast-paced for sure. If you don't enjoy customers, there are still departments you can work in. If you put in the effort and make sure to get your name out quickly, management is almost always happy to help you out in whatever way you need, be it transferring to another department or store, or simply needing help with whatever situation. I've even had management willing to take over for the meat department on an off day where I was alone, just so I could take a break and go to the bathroom. You get back what you give, so if you push yourself for the store, the store is going to do it's best to help you out."
good,Enjoyed meeting new people.  Each day was different. Learned to work with people from different cultural backgrounds.  The most difficult was value system of some associates.
good,This job was a easy flexible job to have when in high school but doesn't pay enough and not enough benefits. ...............................................
good,Kroger is a great company to work at if you are just starting to build your career. I highly recommend young kids to start their employment history at  a Kroger.
good,"good experience working. they fair employer, treat employees with respect. pay like most places is based on experience. i enjoyed working with this company"
good,"management was really pleasant and flexible  , teamwork was really good , quite and neat place , salary was really competitive  , overtime payment is really convenient ."
good,"There are many opportunities if you are willing to work hard, follow the proven successful guidelines and put in your time.  Attitude in some locations can be very negative so don't fall into that trap."
good,This was my first job in high school and it really helped me grow as an individual. Any questions I had I always got an answer when I wanted to move up and get trained in different departments my management team was on board
good,"I worked at a local one, so you'd see the same faces regularly. The managers were nice and helpful if you messed up or got stuck with a customer. Not much to complain about"
good,Opportunities for advancement are endless. Having integrity and a strong work ethic with a positive attitude will increase your chances of climbing the ranks.
good,"Like most places, you will either love or hate your job. I absolutely loved my job~ the only reason I am looking for another one, is I relocated, and I am over the hour commute each way."
good,"If you stick with company, you can make good money. Good benefits,vacations and personal days. Some food managers, some not so good manager. (As with any company.)"
good,"Lots to learn, awesome engineering staff, very collaborative knowledgable. They are interested in your growth with your company and as a professional. Would recommend to anyone."
good,I only worked 4 hours a day because I was in high school from my first day there everyone was very nice and made me feel welcomed but unfortunately because of medical problems I was let go but I do recommend this job for anyone that is in high school and is looking to make a quick buck.
good,"lets see id get to work and clock in than either bagging groceries or cleaning toilets and trash or maybe even getting carts, as the day progresses im doing random things but mainly bagging goods, i learned that kroger has a nice history and fair rules and a nice atmosphere to be at, nothing about this job was either hard or easy it had its moments on both sides but all in all it was a good job and i was good at it."
good,Kroger's was my first job and yes I liked it. It was very relaxing but the hours was not enough. The company gave good benefits as well and they have good team work.
good,"Kroger was a wonderful stepping stool in my career path, they helps mold and guide me through what a corporate company looks for in their employees. Learning leadership skills management skills and understanding the true meaning of building  a cooperative team environment  and business culture."
good,"I Spend Most Of My Day Doing Pricing. Hanging Tags, Making Signs, Changing Prices, Section Checks. I’ve Been Doing Pricing For About 5 Years Now & i Really Enjoy My Job."
good,"I worked at Kroger for almost 2 years. I started when i was 14 years old. I loved the co-workers i had at the time, they were the only thing left enjoyable about my job. Customers were rude to us, I never got a pay raise (unlike everyone else), and i barely was able to work due to the college aged kids who were coming back into town."
good,"great environment, updated pharmacy, fast paced but makes time go by faster. Sometimes no time to be able to take a break when not enough people on for the day. hardest part is balancing the workload when you are alone, best part is making people happy"
good,"i would typically arrive to my shift and go straight to a cashier spot and stand there scanning people out till i either got a break, lunch, or my shift ended. i learned the basics of customer service and how to use a register while working here. the management was nice but you didn't really see them a whole lot. i wouldn't really consider anything hard about the job unless you don't like standing. The most enjoyable part would definitely be meeting new people and making friends along the way."
good,"Decent work, fair amount of work force, fair share of work load, recent manager was great, hard working team, understanding management, wages could be increased a little"
good,"Opportunities for advancements, friendly co workers, helpful and understanding managers. Flexible hours, busy after work hours and busy on Sundays. Most customers are regulars and friendly."
good,The workplace culture was enjoyable. The benefits were great and everyone got along. Kroger was my first job as a teenager and taught me the meaning of responsibility and money. I would highly recommend any teenager who wants to learn responsibilities to pursue a job in the retail.
good,"Not too hard of a job. Easy being a cashier and compensation for that is average for the field. The pay for front end supervisors is pitiful and disgraceful for someone who is in charge over the most important part of each customers shopping trip. Generally an enjoyable job with great employees"
good,I was very busy everyday when working in all the locations I worked in this company.  I was really able to make a differance with my associates in cross traning.
good,Krogers was my first job. I really enjoyed working there and enjoy everyone I worked with. Though the paid wasn't great which is the reason why I left.
good,"The kroger company is a great place to work, always have the chance to move up the ranks. Ive learend a great deal and Im very greatful, my most enjoyable part of the day is greeting everyone as they prepir for there day."
good,"Consistent workflow, learned how to read prescriptions, management was stern but fair, hardest part of job was keeping up with workflow. The customers was what really made the position enjoyable"
good,A typical day was somewhat hectic with customers flowing in at a steady pace.I learned how to handle being in intense situations. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with my coworkers and the customers. I enjoy talking to people while I work. It makes the work day fly by.
good,my first job during high school. i bagged groceries and removed carts from parking lot. managers were great to work for and alowed for growth in the store and willing to work with you on specific needs
good,Typical work day is getting carts from parking lot and bagging grocery's for customers.Sometimes bring grocery's to car.I would a break for 15 minutes
good,"Great place to work. The atmosphere is wonderful. Employees are very friendly, but don't let them get under your skin. The customers are very nice. They're very knowledgeable of the item that are very particular about."
good,"I love working at kroger it was a good job with good people working there, they treat with respect and they make sure they work with u if u don't know what u are doin"
good,a typical day at work is flexible everyday of the week never busy or exhausted. I'm by myself all the time basically my own boss and make my own decisions very easy simple job.
good,"I had been with Kroger for near three years before I quit, I didn't feel I was making as much as I was worth. I knew  how to open and close produce, as well as the meat department and the registers. The entire three years I worked there, I went from making $7.25 per hour to $8.65. I felt like I was worth more."
good,"Kroger’s was my first job opportunity with a Fortune 500 company which I am grateful for. I acquired this position while still a high school student and it taught me a great deal of responsibility and how to balance life, school and career. Overall I enjoyed my work life, coworkers and management team."
good,"I enjoyed working there and was sorry to see my seasonal part time job end.  I attempted to transfer to a different job within the company but at that time, there were no openingns.  I check back periodically to touch base with the hiring manager to find out whether any suitable positions for me have come up.  I like the products they sell and the cleanliness of the store.  Most difficult part of the job was keeping up with the business flow, trying to manage clothing displays in multiple areas due to the holidays.  I enjoyed helping customers and ""shopping"" with the customer to find just the right item and maybe more of something not considered before. Usually added to the total merchandises sold.  I didn't expect to receive any compensation for adding to the bottom line.  I liked the team work attitudes and we pitched in and helped eachother in a crunch when one of us was falling behind.  I also had slow times when I worked by myself and I enjoyed getting everything looking presentable.  Hardest aspect of the job was bouncing between the dressing rooms and the individual apparel areas that needed attention.  We had communication devices for things like that and they helped tremendously."
good,Depending on what department you work in the job isn't too difficult. They can also be super flexible with scheduling since a lot of people work there
good,"a great company to work for, outstanding benefits. nice enough people, nice management. everybody worked together it was amazing team work. had lots of great sales."
good,"Benefits were unquestionably the best out there, also paid time off was adequate could have been better. The reality behind the amount of work needed it expected vs having adequate support staff on the clock was seriously lacking. I enjoyed my knowledge and experience gained, relationships built with my customers along with other staff outside of my department is what made my day to day exciting. To be able to help someone in anyway is humbling, to give a smile is to receive a smile."
good,nothing negative to say. everybody seems to be energetic and willing to work. the customers are very respectful and will remember your face. allows for time to have another job
good,"this is a excellent job but, it only pays 8.40 a hour, and long time chance to make liveable money. this is the only downfall. i cant make it on 8.40 per hour"
good,Coolest job to work at nice people great customers. I enjoyed the days off and the environment. The staff was nice and they helped me move up from bagger to cashier.
good,every store is different but mine was fast pace great atmosphere and they do make you join a union.you can cross train in different departments.  Always looking for people to join the staff
good,"Getting with the manager to see what needs to be done, go to the warehouse and see what needs to be stocked, assist customers. Management was easy to work with, the culture was easy to work with, noting was really hard, helping customers and getting a paycheck"
good,"Great job for small or long term goals, I personally got used to it in about 3 weeks. You push baskets, bag groceries, carry outs, and propane exchange. If you are not fit like I was, the job will get you fit. It's more cardio than anything else pushing baskets, but there are 30 minute rotations for every bagger. Except at closing, it will just be you but there are barely any customers so it won't matter."
good,"Everyone is fairly nice , and a great place for busy students to work and shop , also great for employee discounts and fuel points. Also it’s great family environment."
good,"Usually just come in and stock shelves, cleaning, and helping customers. Learned a lot about customer service. The management was good while i was there, and they had a great culture. Hardest part was accurate counts in inventory."
good,"A typical work day Fun and very talkative"
good,"Kroger is a fast paced place to work.  There seems to be a lot of turnover.  I learned so much during my time at Kroger.  Cashiering, bagging, customer service, management.  The workplace culture is stressful.  Crazy hours. The hardest part of the job is having a teenager at home and working 2nd shift hours.  2:30 to 11:00 pm 5 days a week.  And the stress level. I loved the interaction with the customers and most of the employees at Kroger."
good,"The employees and management were wonderful "
good,"Customers were very cooperative, appreciates lots Good environment with some  management issues. On the whole it was good but with very low income. Good team work."
good,This company is a good company to work for if you cannot find a job. They are always looking to hire new people and promote from within. It is fast paced and sometimes a challenge with difficult customers and co-workers. It have a union and competitive benefits and pay.
good,"Besides short lunch breaks .. your shift goes by really quick by the time you clock in you will already have work ready for you to do. Come to work on time and just do your job you will be fine. Management expect alot out of you but as long as you give it your all they wont bother you. Benefits are good only have to pay 20 dollars a month, and you also have a union for job security."
good,Love working there. It's Awesome.   The management is very nice and will help in anyway way.  Also the discount they have is good. I love the free samples.
good,I really enjoyed baking all the Breads and making the displays and decorating cakes for little kids and parents and working the cash register being around people I love it......
good,"In my time of serving this position, I have gained an understanding for the value in patience, and humbleness. Although I deeply enjoy customer service - I experienced events that I have never encountered throughout my life; ethnic remarks, and attempts from individuals to degrade my character - these moments were the most challenging. However, they are few, and I do not allow them to define my opinion. Kroger's value upon courteousness is genuine, and I would recommend it as one, of many, good businesses to support."
good,"Working at Krogers was a great step on my way into the adult world, krogers hires many young workers who are still in school or have just gotten out of school and prepares them for the real world."
good,I did love working at Kroger Pharmacy but I had to move to help my mother and they did not have any full time positions available for me to transfer to another Kroger store and those full time positions rarely come  up anyway. I feel that I was well liked by most everyone I worked with and enjoyed my co-workers and helped train many of the new employees that started work in the pharmacy. The hardest part of the job was keeping help and working every station by yourself with said lack of help. But the most enjoyable part of my job was getting to know my patients and helping them. I became very close with some of my patients and miss them dearly.
good,"If you want a decently relaxed job to start, any grocery store can accommodate you. Great benefits, big community, and great prices of food. It was the first time I got to feel connected to a community."
good,Good Summer Job or a transition Job between job searches-mostly just bagging and carts-management nice-changing hours every week is hard-good people to work with
good,Definitely not enough pay for the job I did. Managers were amazing. Easy to learn. Amazing people to work with and advancement opportunities. Benefits weren't great.
good,If you want to advance and show the ability and the want you can advance easily in this company. I was able to work to cross train in other departments as I see fit.
good,"Krogers was a fast pace job on the night crew in order to get the groceries put up before the sore opened the next morning, we had fun at times but mostly a lot of hard work."
good,"Checked out customers in a timely and efficient matter. Customer service help. Cover register for shift changes. Handled cash, checks, credit card, WIC and food stamps. Mindful of theft as a cashier."
good,"Unloading a truck, and stocking shelves making orders, I learn how important customer service is to each employee . The Customer make they checks not the owner and kroger made sure we knew that."
good,I loved working for Kroger! They gave me the opportunity to advance from grocery clerk to supervisor. I was able to manage a new department from startup. It wasn't always easy but that is partly why I enjoyed it so much.
good,"Through a typical day I would come in and check everything that needed to be stocked up for the night. Also, check and see what was left over from the morning crew to be finished or cleaned up. Me and the other workers would take care of the customers behind the clerk while also trying to keep anything that we see running low stocked up. We would have one person go out and stock all the meat, chicken, and fish that was out on wall and in the bunkers for the customers to grab. We also had to make sure that if there was a frozen truck delivery that it got pulled and put in its respective places by the end of the night. The workplace culture was very upbeat and enjoyable to be in even when it was busy, we all worked together to keep things moving and keep everyone in a happy upbeat mood. The most enjoyable part of the job was probably cleaning up at the end of the night because i always worked the 2-10 shift so after a while it became routine and we started to get faster and faster at it. While we still maintained the health code standards by the store."
good,"Working at smiths, time seems to go by really fast, I've learned great customer service at smiths, the management is awesome, standing up all day is the hardest part of the job, your legs and back get tired a lot. I am only leaving smith's to get my life on track and to pursue a career in health care, they have been really flexible with my school schedule and giving me the time off that I need for family events and vacations."
good,I worked there for six years and a lot of the employees I grew really close to. It was kinda like a second family to me. We all had to go through a lot of difficult customers and it was the employees that made all of them tolerable. Also the managers were really good they actually would promote the hard workers and treat them with respect. All in all it was a really good place to work at and a place that put customers first.
good,Wonderful company to work for and very positive benefits and salary. Workmates genuinely happy to be there stimulating a great culture to achieve professional goals.
good,I've learned most of my skills at the Kroger company. I enjoyed it. But mostly it has alot of dedicated and hard work. I had  a great experience while  working at Kroger's
good,"typical day it sitting at my desk signing people into the little clinic. management is great at my store, we get along very well."
good,A Typical day at work was me was coming in and then start help bagging or go on a register. and then i would clean the front end and the back before i left normally.
good,"This grocery store was so close to the beach and from the time the cashiers got on the registers came in first thng in the mornng, every register was lined halfway through the store until our shift end. Was not worth the small amount we were paid for such stress!"
good,The managers were always kind and willing to help if i had a question. I enjoyed working with others who helped eachother when needed. I enjoyed being able to assist customer with their shopping.
good,"I learned many things in my time with Kroger. It helped me with my people skills, answering phones, prompt problem solving with customers. I loved seeing my regular customers and assisting them with their needs when it came to missed products or price discrepancies between our systems and our price tags. A typical day included light cleaning in down time, answering phones, quickly solving discrepancies in prices, assisting with customers applying for rewards cards, renewing information for cards, dealing with customer returns. I have to say that the hardest part of my job was dealing with the angry/irate customers. I wanted to be able to assist them as best as possible and to resolve issues accordingly, but sometimes due to policies or their personal attitudes, there were times I was unable to assist them to their satisfaction or my own."
good,"Overall, the pay is good enough to overlook some of the not so great things. Kroger will hire you and let you know that they value their employees,  which is true, but when it comes down to it they value the dollar more. I worked for Fred Meyer specifically and from what I've heard that's the best store for both employees and customers. Employees are like one big family, including every department. It is a great company to work your way up in, you can start out pushing carts and end up store manager in a couple years which a lot of people do. There are some pretty strict policies that come from much higher up that each store must comply with and that can be frustrating. However one of the best things they offer is UNION membership. The UFCW21 in Seattle has done a great job protecting it's members and I know this from personal experience and other associates. So if your rights as a worker are ever overlooked, you won't have to deal with it alone."
good,Many career opportunities are possible especially with store experience.  Many employees have a long history working at Kroger and many employees are proud to work at Kroger.
good,"Great management, good work atmosphere.challenges include, staffing retention, on going training,maintaining inventory."
good,This was a really great starting job for high school. it was great for after school hours when I needed to make some money for college. I enjoyed the customer service aspect of this position a great deal.
good,"Started as a cashier, from there I went to a supervisor, making nightly deposits , keeping everyone busy and front end running smooth. Then the  point of sales came open, so I put in for that. I was responsible for signage for the ads/ price changes, when that was done I would start at the end of one aisle checking prices, making sure they were still in the system. Quite a challenge, a lot to do, but I liked it made my day go by. Our regular customer was the most enjoyable part of my day. Things did start slowing that's when I went to Des Moines stamp co."
good,fast paced always doing something. younger generation couldn`t keep up. great people great environment. great seeing repeat customers every day/week. chatting catching up. they also made a fub place to work.
good,"It was a fun and great learning experience kind of job for me.  I usually manning the meat counter to help customers if they had any questions or needed something from the counter-top area.  If it helps, know your types of meats and cuts."
good,It's a nice  company technology wise. There are using the latest technologies and making great progress in becoming an online retail store. The pay is good compared to Cincinnati market. You might have to face some tough days though
good,"It was a great experience. It provided me with social skills by talking with others also gave me a sense of time management. The opportunity of working there gave me can-do attitude or character from dealing with a problems, and situations but being positive about my ability allowed me to achieve sucess."
good,Kroger is a great place to work. They worked around my school so I could get my bachelors and then quickly offered me a chance to advance. The coworkers really make the job as well as our regular customers. A great family away from home.
good,"Great first job. Love the people I work with. Great sales, union rep. is amazing. Always a clean and safe place to work. Great management and great place to start."
good,"I went to work at Freddie's with no work experience, but they trained me well. Management was great, always very helpful and cooperative. Co-workers we're hard working and helpful as well."
good,"King soopers was a fun place to be. I took care of the stores business accounts, money ordering, and assisting customers with miss tendered transactions. I also had to inform the store manager on a daily basis the shortages the mistakes and the stores prior business."
good,The pay is great compare to similar company. Pharmacy workload is not bad at all compare to other retail pharmacies. Pharmacy manager and store managers are very supportive of the pharmacy
good,Hard working place but a good place to work they have good benefits and every one is nice to work with.  The manager is nice to work for and the job is not hard to preform.
good,"This job is composed of three stations, including a cashier and customer service station, a pharmaceutical counting and bottling station, and a station for entering prescription information which also involves answering phone calls, dealing with doctors and insurance, and customer service responsibilities.  Each station works heavily with computers, entering and verifying patient information. The environment is extremely fast paced and customer service based. I worked with a diverse group of people and customers, and was able to utilize my spanish speaking skills to help spanish speaking customers. Of course, the job could be stressful and customers could be demanding. Overall this environment taught me the importance of  positivity, teamwork, cooperation, and organization in the prospect of workplace productivity and customer satisfaction. I learned how to solve problems and remain positive in a stressful work environment to satisfy every customer and make sure the workflow remained productive, organized, and timely. I learned to work with coworkers and be assertive to assure each customer with the attention and care they need and ensure the workflow remained constant. The most rewarding part of this job was the connections I made with customers after helping resolve their concerns, and the trust and kindness that I received from both coworkers and customers in return for positivity and hard work."
good,"The pharmacy technicians had worked together for several years at that store and ran it well, for the most part."
good,"At Kroger I worked part time, about 20 hours a week, and they were generally pretty good about being flexible with schedules. They have great benefits if you stick with the job for a while, and corporate genuinely seems to care about their employees. The biggest problem I found was that it can be kid of hectic working at a store that is almost never closed. Other than that, it was a generally enjoyable experience and it's a great job for teens!"
good,Krogers is an amazing company in my experience. The management is very polite and work with you when there's a problem. The AP helps with everything managers can't. In my personal experience it has been amazing.
good,"Kroger was a great place to work in order to gain some job experience. Kroger also worked around my school schedule. However, the pay was not that great. I did 5 different jobs within the same week and only got paid $8/hr. I worked very hard and always came in when someone called out. Another thing I hated was that if you went over 40 hours a week you would get reprimanded."
good,"Being a grocery clerk was easy. The only downside is that you have to work night shift. A typical day at work goes from breaking down the truckload, stocking shelves, and then cleaning up. Management treats you fairly. You work well, they treat you well. You slack off, they get on you."
good,There are some pretty solid benefits and discounts for local businesses included on the HR webpage for employees. Only problem is that you have to be full time to receive such.
good,"Typically, everything was laid back at my job at Kroger. I'd get to work the night shift from 3 to 8 or 12 to 8. I'd work with my co-workers and supervisor to stock, wrap meat, handle customers. After everyone left, I'd clean the meat room and continue to stock things and help as many customers as possible."
good,There's always lots of things to keep you busy. Managers are down to earth and your schedule is very flexible. Exciting work environment with opportunity to advance
good,Typical day a Comerica was good. You always have different things you can lean. MANAGEMENT-Some good and not so good its all about respect. the hardest part of the job was lifting the bags of money and coins. The enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers love them to death.
good,"A typical day at work varies depending on the position I am scheduled for. I am trained as a cashier, self-checkout operator, and guest/customer services associate, and in money services. Through this experience I have learned how to react in a customer service setting. Usually, a customer will come to me when something has gone wrong. I listen to what they have to say and react with an appropriate action. I have learned how to operate money services such as cashing checks, loaning money to registers,dealing with big amounts of money, western union services, and money orders.The workplace culture is good. Everyone has their assigned duties to make the workplace flow successful.The most enjoyable part of the job is working in an environment where I can utilize my people skills. I enjoy helping people figure out what has gone wrong and helping them get the situation fixed."
good,Hated the upper management and the way they addressed issues. Great benefits.. Great pay.. They worked with my home life and all .. I miss my job i just had a few personal things come up
good,I worked from 10:30 to 7 in the morning stocking shelves overnight. I was all about being productive and finishing up my assigned aisles before my shift was up. My managers were cool and I can't really say there was a hard part to this job. I enjoyed working for Krogers.
good,I enjoy working at Krogers because I get to talk with people and ask them how there day is going and help they need it they have wonderful benefits like health insurance and dental and they have retirement benefits too and I recommend to work there but make sure you stay there for a while show them that they made the right choice to hire you
good,I personally worked here for almost two years. The only reason I let is because i went off to school and Lima does not have a Kroger. Management was always great and understanding.
good,Good place to work. Rapid advancement. Management listens and addresses questions and concerns effectively. They also show that they care and recognize hard work/ personal effort.
good,"Kroger is the workplace for those with any previous experience in the workforce, especially those with customer service. Most management is very friendly and helpful to those that are new or in need of help in the work environment."
good,"Great place for your first job! They are flexible and willing to work with your schedule. There is a lot of room to grow with the company. They offer benefits to all their employees, does not matter if you are full-time or not."
good,"Working in the bakery was exciting because there is so much to learn and to do. Plus, you work one on one with customers to design and create the perfect cakes for their special occasions."
good,I LOVED working at Kroger for over 20years... Ive met so many new people and friends threw the years and enjoyed every moment.... I would highly recommend for someone to work there....
good,"I would walk into work whenever I was scheduled and clock in. A day as a bagger was never quiet, there was always something to be done. It could have been assisting a customer find something to cleaning the bathrooms because it was your scheduled time. My bosses were hit and miss. For the most part, I had no problems with my supervisors, but there were times in which I would get frustrated with one in particular."
good,Working At Kroger Is Great Fun. You Definitely Have To Engage With Customers A lot. I enjoy it even though some times i have my days.
good,"A great place to work love the hours, overtime, on time advancements and promotions with seniority in place. The union kind of sucked dough but, overall a great place to work."
good,"The customers that I interact with on a daily basis are very nice. I enjoy working with my co-workers in the meat shop. The management at Kroger is a good bunch of people. You stay busy on a daily basis. There is a lot to do in a meat shop, but I enjoy it very much. When the holidays come around, we are very busy.  All in all, I like working there very much."
good,Kroger is a wonderful company to work for. The management field would be an ideal job for someone who has the ability to maneuver with a full schedule.
good,I loved working for this company. It's a very family and friendly workplace there's always someone there to help when needed
good,"From the moment you punch in you are bound to run into a manager that is ensuring the store is running smoothly. They check in periodically to see how you are doing, if you need help with anything and they try their best to get you help. The people working there are always friendly and make it a very relaxed environment for job that is normally somewhat stressful."
good,I have really enjoyed working at Kroger the last 3+ years! The company provides great benefits and helps serve the community in may ways.
good,"I had a great manager in the Produce section. A very deep wood southern man whose policy was ""If I am sweating a busting my butt, I expect you to be doing the same"". I apply that to my life more and more every day."
good,I worked a five day work week. I ordered supplies and stocked my own shelves. I won a cruise of the most sales in one year for the whole state. I learned organization skills and management skills.
good,"Working at Kroger typical day at work varies day by day."
good,"My first job was at Kroger; my job was to bag groceries , bring customers to their cars, and to do floor sweeps twice a day. The employees are very genuine and engage with you . Krogers management makes sure everyone is satisfied before you leave ."
good,"They're very flexible and the pay is okay. Everyone was great to be around, management was horrendous every three months we had a new manager . I still talk to all of my coworkers"
good,"The meat department at Kroger is an excellent job for someone who can deal with a colder environment, blood from the meats, and has good communication skills."
good,A typical day at my job is always filled with new experiences and challenges as I work on getting ads into production. My co-workers are always willing to help out. There's so much comradery between my peers it makes even the toughest day go smooth. One thing is for certain and that is there is never a dull moment in my role.
good,"Upbeat place, you learn how to handle money daily, co-workers make working at kroger fun, hardest part is having 3 managers asking you to do multiple things at a time,"
good,I was happy with this company for nearly the whole time I worked there. Great management! Not too great on hours but that's all grocery stores these days.
good,"I should have stayed, made the wrong decisions and now i'm paying the price. Good benefits, good people..mostly, and fair wages."
good,"Mariano's was an excellent first job. I had fun working there. It eased my nervousness about interacting with customers. I got my first taste ofbeing a cashier. Although the rush hours are exhausting, I think it provided some great experience."
good,Kroger works well with people in school and their busy schedules. The management team is diverse and understanding. Working at Kroger provides many in house opportunities to move up in the company.
good,"Kroger is an awesome company to work for. They are a union company and believe in taking care of their employees. However, the pay is a little too low for the distance that I have to travel. And you can easily get fired without warning for overtime. "
good,"They're really flexible with scheduling, just not so flexible with willingly giving people job advancement opportunities."
good,"making sure the customers are satisfied with trip before leaving, making sure all items are fully stocked and visiable making sure i always have a smile"
good,people at spherion were always there to help you get and find a job. they on top of there job duties i would highly reccommend people to go to this company if they are in need of work.
good,"I have loved my 5 years at Kroger. My job in the pharmacy was by no means easy, but great supervisors and other coworkers made it a lot better. The company clearly cares about their employees, and we often get little treats loaded to our Plus cards every once in a while."
good,Kroger was a great company to be employed with. I was able to advance in my career very quickly. They saw my drive as a family man and work ethic. They promoted me accordingly and it gave me a great start to a new life.
good,I was a Manager on the front end for 8 years. I was always treated with respect from upper management. I got along well with my Co-Workers and loved the customers and helping them in any way I could. I also Did the bookkeeping and hiring. Great Company to work for. Good benefits.
good,"I enjoyed my time working for Kroger. My only real and honest reason for leaving Kroger is because I have some expense that I need to attend to and my 12 hours a week were not going to be enough. Overall, if I could, I would have loved to stay."
good,I worked for the Kroger Company for 3 years. This company is a great place to advance. I was promoted three times while I worked there. I would of continued my journey if I hadn't relocated. Management will work with you and respect you as long as you give respect back.
good,secure job with great benefits. I was responsible for all refrigeration and HVAC equipment for 4 stores 8-4:30 daily and 15 stores on call/ after hrs 1 week a month
good,"Customer service oriented, giving direction to both front and back of the house, including received, training, inventorying. meal prep, both ready to go and immediate consumption."
good,"Typical day at work is to have everything done in a timely matter. I love my management but it stresses my body to work 10 plus hours everyday because there are not enough employees. Most of all, I love to ensure that the customers leave with satisfaction to repeat business."
good,"I love working at Krogers , its a blessing to brighten others day. But i would have to say the hardest part is when i cant help out the customers who need it, really hurts me. But overall Krogers is a great job!"
good,I really enjoyed working at Kroger no complaints really but the time goes really slow. The people are always nice and willing to help. Got a lot of good experience at Kroger.
good,"Exciting, fast paced environment, friendly service, teachable atmosphere, and best benefits ever. I worked for krogers as long as I could. If I had to go back to a company as a single parent, no responsibilities, and with flexible hours Kroger would be the one. When it came to servicing the customers Krogers was rated #1 in my book. My colleagues done as much as possible to bring a great shopping experience to everyone who entered in the stores. Although I was scheduled to work 20 hours per week I was always bringing home at least 40 hours per week. It was easy to learn different store departments, but hard to get a raise. The schedule is based off your availability, but you had to have a flexible schedule in order to climb far up the ladder. Most managers are power struck but if you done your job you almost never had to report to the manager's office. I started off as a cashier and worked every department including the gas station with the exception of the meat and seafood department. I had plenty of advancement and benefits but the pay rate almost never increased (.5 every 6 months). It always feel great to be a part of a company that really wants you, but when you have to leave because the pay doesn't increase; not the best feeling in the world. Especially when the new employers would come in making .5 cents less than you. I had fun working here at Kroger and Kroger  will give you a great benefit package and plenty of laughter, if you work there. Teenagers should apply to Krogers, there is a lifelong lesson working at Krogers and those whom have put in ten or more years can"
good,The company it self provides many benefits to their employers however the Kroger i was assigned to management that seemed not to communicate with each other. it wasn't uncommon to be assigned something that was contradictory to another's orders. This led to frustration among co-workers or generally slower production because of confusion.
good,"The average day at Kroger consists of sanitizing my work station, chopping a variety of fruit and vegetables, and rotation and stocking incoming product. Kroger is a bright vivacious job. I would say the hardest part is how quickly we have to restock due to our loyal customers."
good,Good work place with excellent support good rep and good workers..i have learned too keep your customer first..hardest part of the job was loosing good co-workers the most enjoyable about that job was the holiday openings.
good,Nice when everyone shows up to work always put the date on the older meat nice lady to work with have to watch co-workers when you have to put stock up by yourself when we all work together it's a great day.
good,"It may seem hard to most people but i enjoy working hard. I organized on a daily, my coworkers were always looking forward to me coming in because they new i would get the job done. The hardest experience was not having a single position, we were required to work every position in our department."
good,Great family work / life balance. My co-workers quickly became some of my best friends. I throughly enjoyed working for Kroger city market.
good,"Kroger is an excellent company to work for. They provide an attractive compensation package, despite the low wages. On a typical day I would finish breaking down the truck, stock the low items, trim veggies, stock more, help customers, clean up and go home. I worked with a great crew and the store management was excellent from the top down. I left for more money and a shorter drive, but I would go back in a heartbeat."
good,"Get to work, Stretch so you don't hurt yourself and go to work picking orders, cycle counting or cleaning up the warehouse..."
good,"I worked at two different Kroger stores, and at the second store I worked at, the employees were more connected with one another. I enjoyed the customer interaction, and most enjoyed my last position as a Floral Clerk. The hardest thing at Kroger was filling orders during holidays. I learned to set up displays, create floral arrangements, corsages, and maintain cut flowers and plants."
good,"I did enjoy every minute of my twelve years  working for this company, great and fun work environment, excellent training programs for new team leaders and managers and great to provide opportunities for employees"
good,This is a great place to work. Although the hours are long and you have to work every holidays. the benefits are good too. Management sets a lot of unrealistic department goals and dont give the enought time to train new people.
good,"In my brief time there, they provided me with adequate hours starting on day 1. Even in  instances where I screwed up on the job they were really caring and understanding. It was a group of some of the best people I have ever worked with."
good,i enjoy working with the people of Kroger but the pay isn't just worth the headache i was put through getting paid $200 a week to almost do management work kind works on you a bit but other than that the people are friendly and do their best to work with you
good,Overall a nice and steady work place to be in. If you enjoy talking to people you shouldn't have a problem at this job. Co-workers are very friendly.
good,"as an employee clocking in and getting ready, i usually involve my self with customers that is in need to help to any product to price, and help out to their car, having multiple task at the same time helped me kept kept focus while under stress, the management usually let us be independent most of the time with the customers and go backs, but the most difficult part of my job is the box crush at first being newly experience with it, without the boxes flipping out, i most like pushing the carts in as fast as i can with being safe"
good,Management could use some adjustments but it is a great place to work. Great staff and customers are amazing to be around. Wonderful experience all around.
good,"I loved working at krogers, its the employees were very unprofessional, they were rude to guest, always had an attitude if someone had a question and like to answer the phone."
good,"Working with this company was a breeze, standing there displaying main selling products were easy even an child can do it"
good,"would come in and go to back dock to pull shipment to the floor and when that was all done then went back to the floor and started stocking the shelves you were assigned. "
good,a typical day would mostly include stocking and interact with customers
good,"I started as a cashier and ended as a self checkout attendant. I was always very good at math so this job was very easy to adapt to and I enjoyed working here. My co-workers were easy to work with. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who are adamant about their demands. You have to keep a professional cool at all times. Everything else at my job was enjoyable, even working on some holidays."
good,"clock in and check with the manager to see what i would be doing that day. if you were new to the company than you would get bottle phone. i would face my isles, as people were messing up the hard work i already did, by the end of the day i ended up doing my isles at least two times, while getting calls from bottle phone every 5 minutes"
good,"Managers tend to be focused too much on numbers, and less on customer satisfaction and respecting the employees that work for them. But besides that small problem everything else, about this company outweighs the bad."
good,"Kroger is my first true job. There are no typical days because the crowds are always unpredictable. I have learned how to provide customer service, especially during the most stressful times of the day. Management is very reliable most of the time, but there have been times where they are nowhere to be found in the busiest time. Also, sometimes management doesn't schedule enough people and we become short staffed for about an hour or two. I get along with my co-workers as long as they do their job and provide great customer service to our customers.  The hardest part of the job is making sure that our customers are 100% happy with our store, management, and customer service.  The most enjoyable part is helping out with other co-workers to make the customer feel welcome, impressed and want to come back again."
good,Work was great for a first job honestly. Quickly advanced through the ranks up to the stores bookkeeper at 17 years old. Very fun and very good job for teaching responsibility. Great work environment!
good,It was a very good environment to work in and the people working there were friendly and helpful. Management good at giving direction to complete the task properly and giving advice to improve the job at hand.
good,"You get to work then you make you way to your station, then you do you job but mainly work with customers to answer questions and generally help them.  most of the job if it's not a heavy day is just standing there talking to friends or customers and making sure everything runs smoothly."
good,Good vibe great people. Will teach you along the way. Understanding management that will help you. Nothing really hard to do.
good,"All of the other employees are great to work with and management is good. I'ts very busy at the store i current work at so it keeps me on my toes which is great, I love a fast paced environment. Some not so very happy customers come in but as long as you know how to deal with the situation in the correct manner it should be alright."
good,Working for Krogers was Great. A wonderful place to interact with the community. Advancement in positions is quicker than most jobs and benefits are a plus.
good,"good company to work for. The union is strong, and the pay is well above average."
good,"I have three children and they were very flexible and understanding, they believe in a strong family foundation. They offer great benefits to their employees as well."
good,I get along with everyone I work with especially management of the store I work at. They are really good at making everyone feel like part of a team. My immediate supervisor in the meat department is also really good at working around school schedules and family functions. I really enjoy working here. My only problem with this job is that I don't make enough. If I could make more money I would stay with this company for life.
good,Kroger is a good place to learn how to run an effective business. We learn about the importance of putting the customer first. The managers have a great sense of humor and are very informative.
good,"Fullfilling work enviroment with great customers, very atentive management that will work with you, Pay rate is not up to par and Promotions are scarce."
good,"Overall, a great company to work for.  Worked nine years there at six different stores, being promoted twice.  Loved working with so many different kinds of people and getting to know our customers.  Learned Kronos Time & Attendance software and Microsoft Office.  Was in charge of scheduling and continued training.  I loved the impact I was able to have on the day-to-day culture of the stores I was assigned."
good,A typical day at work is always fast for me i concentrate on my goal and make sure i am doing my job correctly . Ive learned to listen more than working dealing with the public. Management is always at ease . My coworkers are my co workers they are very helpful and love working as a team. The hardest thing about working at krogers where having a set time to get done with things and its very challenging. The most enjoyable part is when u completed your task in a acceptable mount of time.
good,"Typical day at work would involve me meeting suppliers to discuss assortment selections that I will make.  I learn about my customers behavior through a data mining process based on the loyalty card our customers use. Kroger has excellent leadership, our company has posted 38 straight quarters of positive identical sales growth! I work with knowledgeable and honest people. The hardest part of my job is changing the culture and mind set of our division merchandisers in various Kroger Marketing Areas.  I really enjoy working with our associates and supplier community.  Building relationships with the different groups I work with."
good,a patient would come in and i will take to them until the nurse was ready and direct them to the back and when everything is done talk to the nurse to see if they need to make another appointment.
good,"Although I love working at Pick N' Save, I have found it very difficult to move up within the field. The managers and people I work with are amazing, however it is now time to expand my horizons and move up and challenge myself to new and better opportunities."
good,Learned a lot while working for this and other stores within the company.  Great people to work with made the low pay tolerable.
good,I loved working with people there. People would alwys say have you had a good day
good,Kroger is loyal to employees. This was a great job experience.
good,"I would go in and immediately start bagging groceries for the customers.  2-3 hours of my shift would be going out side to get carts from the parking lot.  During those hours, I would sweep the store, clean the bathrooms, and clean up any spills that happened."
good,"great job security, good pay, and good management. Did not like being a back-up checker."
good,"Enjoyed working for this company. Greeted customers,cashed checks, did refunds, Processed western union transactions. Management was iffy at best. Got along very well with my co-workers."
good,Kriogers was great with handling customers and employee issues. Management was loving to certain but over all very understanding. A typical day here at Krogers Was alway ready to work and satify customers need and leanding a hand to any person in need nomatter who the where.
good,"I was responsible for making sure that customers' waits in line to check out was kept to a minimum. It was a stressful job, but I loved doing it. I was responsible for the entire front-end. This included making sure that we had shopping carts at all times, making sure that the bathrooms were kept clean, handling customer complaints, scheduling all breaks and lunches for cashiers and baggers, etc. This job enabled me to have more interaction with the cashiers, baggers and customers and that was my favorite part of the job."
good,"a typical day at Kroger's is to go in and do the best I can to work as hard as I can and keep a smile on my face no matter what the day turns out to be . I can never learn enough about my job, there is always something there to learn different every day. the manager's are very reasonable  and respectful there to the employees the store manager is such a great hearted person. I get along very well with my co-workers . if I see some one having a bad day I always offer  to help them get through it by telling them to smile or cheer up. and sometimes I will help them with there job to make them change there whole attitude around, what ever it takes to see them smile. The hardest part of my job is pulling 2 trucks over from 1 side of the store to the dairy department, with a manual jack. The most enjoyable part of my job is to be able to greet all the customers and to help the elderly folks find what they are looking for as they seem lost and confused. I always ask them if they are finding everything ok are could I help them find something, it really makes my job an enjoyable day."
good,"this was the first job i ever had, i did enjoy going in and working with people i knew, meeting new people and helping people find what they are looking for. i loved going on my breaks and talking to my friends, going on carts was fun as well game me some time out side getting some fresh air. this place i did enjoy working at. one of the bests."
good,Kroger is a good Job to work at but not a good long trum job. It teach u about how to bill with the costumer and working hard tords your gouls .
good,"Kroger is an excellent place to work, with a competitive compensation scale and excellent benefits.  Management has an open door policy where you feel your opinions are valued.  The company offers many opportunities for learning and advancement ranging from company offered on line training to payments toward college.  Great work environment with co-workers who can operate individually, as well as working as a team."
good,"Normal day is putting new product on the shelf, rotating products, facing the product, looking for out dated, unloading truck, breaking down pallet of the product"
good,"As a manager for Ruler Foods you are required to work long hours with lots of heavy lifting.  A very strict sales per labor hour goal must be achieved at all times.  Very little help in the store.  I love my coworkers, it is like a small family.  The most enjoyable part of my job is making sure that my customers have an outstanding shopping experience."
good,Very great experience here. Learn quite a bit. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet the whole shift. We do about 100 prescriptions a day. Its not very busy. Theres a lot of regulars for patients and all very friendly.
good,"One thing about Kroger is that you can work whenever you are able to and go to school if you want. That's what they have done for me. They treat you like family and have different activities to do for the employees, like cookouts and incentives just for providing excellent service for the customers. The benefits are pretty good, as far as insurance goes, and you get 10% off the Kroger products. Every summer the company has a picnic at the Nashville Shores for the employees and their families."
good,"Typical workday was easy, great customers always appreciative. Learned a lot about the grocery industry. Management was great always willing to help you improve yourself. Co-workers helped made the job easy and fun. Really no hard aspects of the job."
good,as cashier I worked all shifts and completed all tasks with great joy. was starting to exspand my skills by working in floral deparment and service desk
good,Great place to work. Most of the people are friendly to work around
good,nice job managers was always on task with everything so we could do our job correctly
good,"Great environment, decent place to work. Great choice if you're looking for a job for the very first time"
good,"I was a cashier at Krogers. My day consisted of checking customers out, cleaning, and stocking. "
good,"Start the day be checking the schedule to see what is to be done each hour such as; cleaning, stocking, cart services.  While working on each task I will be called to the registers to replace damaged products and customer assistance."
good,I enjoy the people I enteract with at the Pharmacy. Always learning something new. 
good,"My day at work sometimes was busy, but the people were nice and my work times worked out with my schooling. My managers for the most part were respectful and knew what to do with their jobs. Some of my co workers did not work on their job, but majority did. The hardest part of the job were the customers that were hard to please. "
good,Drove a runner to pick product for Kroger grocery stores. Put them on pallets and took them to shipping.
good,I loved my job I was sad to see that it was moved to another state. The hours were great and they were always willing to work with my schedule. The hardest part was covering loads last min. The best part was when all the loads were covered and the loads ran smoothly.
good,The lively-hood of Kroger was always positive for the most part. Associates were filled with joy and so were the customers.
good,I held a variety of positions with Kroger however cahiering was the position most demanded of me from my managers. Whether I was doing drug inventory or supervising the floor an extra cahier would be needed due to customer traffic. My managers were always pushing me to improve and notified me of my progress and were friendly individuals. The customers that came through were always patient and I was able to work with them in a productive manner. The people I met was the best part of the job considering everyone had a team effort attitude to make sure we got the job done. The hardest part would have to be controlling customer traffic and making sure the waiting periods were kept short. I learned about customer service and improved my communication skills by learning how to engage people positively.
good,Working around people and assisting customers is something I have learned to enjoy. I have learned how to work around people that have different aspects in life. The hardest part when I first got hired two and a half years ago was working under pressure and for eight hours at a time. I have learned that if you enjoy your job than the time there does not matter compared to the opportunities of getting to meet different people each day. The only problem is it is a hour and a half away from school. I would transfer a Kroger in Bryan or College Station but I am used to working at a fast pace and I want something higher up to add to my resume for when I graduate Texas A&M.
good,Ralphs is a good job to have that allows stability as well as flexability. They have friendly mangaers and employees and it is a good enviornment to be in.
good,I always kept busy with bakery orders. I learned how to decorate cakes. The managers did not notice when a good job was performed. Co-workers were very nice. Hardest part of the job was not having enough hours to get everything done. Most enjoyable part was making the cakes.
good,"It was a cool place to start of working. It was a very relaxed environment, flexible hours, and worked around your school schedule."
good,"You welcome customers, bag their groceries, maintain a clean work place, I was also in a maitience role cleaning machinery, and help where ever needed. The management team is incredible with big hearts only flaw is compensation. To the actual company your a number not a person it is just like every large branch corporation raises are rare. after ninety days"
good,"You can't really expect a place like this who hires students that have no graduated high school yet to pay a whole lot, but their pay rate is reasonable. Their ability to give raises is really decent as well. Working here, I always felt as though my hard work, dedication, and customer service was properly acknowledge. You do not feel useless at Kroger and this has a lot to do with the management staff."
good,"It was grest working at Roundy's. We always had fresh fruit to eat in the office, The staff was pretty nice"
good,the most enjoyable part about this job is going on break when i want while working in the deli by myself
good,A typical day at work is I go in and prepare myself for work. I come in with a smile and serve my customer with the up most respect.
good,"The typical day was okay, because of the coworkers i had, but the company itself did not care about its workers very well, always changing people to different stores without their permission, forcing them to do that. Other else the coworkers made work fun."
good,I have been with Kroger for three years. My only complaints are the benefits and the ability to advance.
good,my work was not so fun because i started first before all my crew came in but learn alot from what done in the past
good,"Organizes and distributed work of his/her staff,set priorities and kept an overview of task to be accomplished in accordance with Store Manager.Managed recruits,on boards, train, develope succession planning for staff with partnership with the Store Manager.Assists the Store Manager in maintaining an overview of all Employee Realations responsibilities in the store to ensure a positive work environment."
good,I loved the people I worked with. My boss was very nice and helpful.
good,"Responsible for ensuring cash is correct at the end of the day, being available to handle any customer issue that arises, knowing my products, and where they are stored, greeting customers, ensuring my assigned area was clean, and processing customer refunds. I loved that it was always fast paste and time went by fast during my work hours. It was wonderful always meeting new people. The hardest part was having some angry customers. Customers are the number one priority at Kroger so I always wanted to see happy faces."
good,"Low pay, but very good place to work I love to deal with all kind of people, no matter what! anyways my store was good. But they need to pay more at least $2 + more. Cashier, clean store,organization. Great manager she was very flexible.Maybe someone was talking about you ....but for small thing, keep everything to your self, small place but watch ur back.....just do your job and let others do their jobs, If they dont want to do it ... just do yours. Again low pay...."
good,"I love this job, it just dont pay the bills. Everything is very easy! The hardest part of working here is tring to meet your numbers. We have a screen that tells us how many lines are open, how many should be open and how many in 30 minutes.. this was hard because we dont always have the help we need."
good,"I started as acashier at 15 yrs old and for my 16th birthday I was promoted to Customer Service booth. There I would handle customer returns, issues, car tags, western union, and also act as a supervisor from time to time. Very multi-task job, and great experience in for how the real workforce was."
good,Kroger is a very good place and the employees are a joy to be around
good,"A typical day consists of handling various meats and sheeses, tending to other customers, and dealing with other employees. I learned how to cut meat and cheese, how to handle different meats and cheses properly, in respect to temperatures, and what goes on in a bakery. Management is GREAT! Coworkers work great together; very smooth flow. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the low hours and small pay range. he most enjoyable part of the job was the atomosphere; I always felt wonderful walking into work."
good,Had a blast working here. It fitted my time with my school and job.
good,"I was with Smiths for over a year and a half and loved the job! great working environment, awesome people, and excellent opportunity to excell with the company. They quickly recognized my drive to get into a higher position and bumped me up to asst grocery manager. After a Wal-Mart went up across the street hrs plummeted and people were layed off. I was among those layed off and quickly found a replacement job."
good,"The work load is very tolerable, the environment provided by management and the company itself is also great, however, there is a lot of personal drama that takes place within the store and the Deli department itself. The best part of the job is helping people, whether we help them make their dinner or their lunches or help them try new things it's a fun experience."
good,This is a fun place to work. My managers are great and promote family time outside of work.
good,"Kroger is a well-organized employer seeking dominate the retail grocery scene in the US. Although there was the occasional corporate planning error, Kroger is extremely good at what it does and I enjoyed working for one of the best in the business. Unfortunately the work I did required that I work the graveyard shift for nine years."
good,"Overall, I would recommend Kroger as a good place to work. It offers great benefits, excellent job security, and I worked with a great team. The raises are minimal, but with a union contract, they're kind of bound there. If you stay with them, it will pay off though."
good,"My experience at Kroger has been worth every year I’ve been there I have learned how to stock shelves and received different trucks throughout the day. I’ve worked our back dock a few times, customers have grown to love and adore my personality. From the time I’ve started with the company I’ve seen how the company has made some changes that I felt weren’t for the benefit of the associates or customers but away to change what they wanted to change. Kroger offers great benefits."
good,"since I worked their a solid year I learned a lot when it comes to customer service, hard work, Goals and communication. A typically day of work would be saying hello to everyone, getting ready to work, punch in and start my shift. usually my shifts would be 5 or less hours since I was at high school. The management is better than I remembered was easy to talk to and understand. The hardest part of the job was going to school and go to work afterwards was hard for me to get my homework done and so on. but I enjoyed working their which it was my first job I ever gotten."
good,While working at Kroger I was able to move up the ladder to positions i was interested in. Management appreciate my hard work ethic and was always willing to help me advance.
good,"I usually worked the afternoon shifts closing until 10, when we had numerous people it was easier to work and less stressful since one person was able to clean everything and the other could help customers and when It would get busy we wouldnt leave all the customers waiting and getting frustrated. They were very respectful with availability and the workplace culture was very good I got along with everyone I tried to do so, the people there were the ones that made it part of the most enjoyable, I learned how to work with customers and how to stay calm as it would get very busy sometimes and some of my coworkers weren't that cooperative and some customers were difficult to work with."
good,I loved the job because I got to interact with a variety of people. Before I worked here I didn’t have many friends because I was new to the town but now I have some friends. :)
good,"As with all jobs there are great people to work with and not so great people to work with,  you just need to act accordingly with the situation at hand"
good,Kroger is a great company to work for. The benefits they provide are amazing. The are very flexible with my life schedule and the hours are great. All the new things that you can learn working for the company are endless.
good,"I strongly believe that your perception of you career is all relative to your past experience. Kroger is a much better overall experience than my past employers.  Providing fresh quality food to my neighbors is a purpose I can support. Providing for the less fortunate is another real culture approach that is more than just talk. I enjoy my work, and the personal fulfillment is different than any other cause I've been involved in"
good,Productve and interesting place to work. Always room for advancement. Excellent benefits. I always tried to keep up with the knowledge of the job that was assigned. Excelled in the promotions that the company was having. Always respected management and the knowledge that they taught me. I was always willing to learn something new.
good,Krogers is a good job to have as a first starting job . Its real easy and most of the jobs are real simple . They have a lot of opportunities to hand out & are very flexable .
good,"It was nice working there, usually I just bagged groceries and occasionally pushed carts. The management at the front desk was good. Note that you have to watch a bunch of videos and take tests on them before you actually start working."
good,"As a manager I enjoy leading by example to my staff to make a better team environment"
good,The everyday shift as a pharmacy technician is very stressful due to the many customers coming for medications. They usually have problems with timing and insurance which is hard to deal with sometimes.
good,Productive and respectable workplace. I learned to interact with customers a lot more and gain time management skills. There are times when customers are rude for no reason you caused and also customers who brighten up your day no matter what and how you were feeling that day. Very prospective place for advancement in different positions.
good,"Work was very interesting  we sold lots and had lots of traffic in store, my teammates/co workers were very work savy. I loved my managers. I lifted heavy boxes easily"
good,"The benefits are good, you get a week vacation after working for full time for a year, the pay isn't as good as others but it is very supportive, management is friendly and there to help and encourage staff."
good,"Great job to get you on your feet! Flexible scheduling, great coworkers, good place for someone in school. Was never concerned about being laid off or relocated. Had plenty of opportunities to transfer to other departments and learn valued skills."
good,"I’ve worked at Kroger Frys in AZ for twenty years. It’s been a great place for me! When starting out, you need to have completely  open availability in your schedule. This is probably the only drawback because wages don’t start out much above minimum. But the insurance is amazing, and incredibly low priced! I pay $60 a month for my whole family to be covered!!"
good,Supper friendly and kind to everyone who works there open about schedules and not an overly hard job just so what is expected of you and things can go by smoothly there are some times that it can be stressful when we’re super busy
good,"I would usually start my day off with stocking shelves with items like hair products, over the counter medicines, and cosmetics. Then after I was done, I would straighten up the shelves and make sure they were organized. I would also provide customer service by showing customers where items were in the store and answer their questions if they had any. Sometimes if the store was really busy they would call all cash register-trained employees to the front to help check customers out and help bag groceries."
good,"Kroger is a very wonderful place to work. They have great benefits, and they also pay great. By working at Kroger you will have a lot of opportunities to grow and become more."
good,"As a pharmacy technician, you will be expected to greet customers and fill their prescriptions. You will also be responsible for verifying the completeness and accuracy of the information provided."
good,I never had any issues with working at the store. I needed more opportunities to branch out as well as better pay. Only good thing was a weekly check.
good,The key to being happy working for Kroger is having a desire to provide excellent customer service. Manager's work as hard as employees and don't limit what work they will do to get the job done. They also treat u with respect and appreciation
good,"It's a nice place to start out at if you live close and don't mind the low pay, but the discounts and other related stuff might make up for it in ways"
good,"Most days were fairly busy and required a lot of energy and attention to detail. Met a lot of great people: customers and co-workers. Sometimes the position I worked was a little short staffed and required the workers there to put in extra effort in hours that sometimes became tiring. It could also be physically demanding at times. Otherwise, the job was mentally stimulating and taught a lot of great lessons and valuable skills."
good,"I loved working here, I was a butcher in the meat department and I would’ve stayed but I had better job opportunities, it is a great place to work though"
good,"Kroger is a great company to work for...."
good,"It was an enjoyable time working there, i enjoyed working with my team and it was a valuable time to learn and grow. I will never forget time time working for Ralphs and I hope to do so soon again"
good,My job at Kroger is a good job to have. I've learned how to bag groceries and exchange propane tanks. It is very lively there and everyone is happy to see me. The hours are flexible and they allow me to request days off.
good,"I was a college student at the time and worked at Kroger for  a little over a year. My time there was good, I liked my manager and the people I worked with. The job was not to hard and I gained friendships during my time there."
good,they were always really understanding with schedule changes. always a positive place to be at. have a good culture to work at. they always put the customer first
good,My time with the Kroger Company was fruitful and lent me many job experiences. I quickly became familiar with most aspects of the store as i moved departments to best fit the store. As such increased my skill set and capability to preform various task. my last manager seemed inexperienced and a bit overwhelmed. we did not ultimately get along well still a positive place and would recommend.
good,"My day began as baker I would come in an pull all the old product, then I would set up tables and proof new products for preparation to brought to the floor."
good,"Fun workplace fast pace, fun people to be around good management , nice boss, very helpful, make good money,competitive pay,weekly pay,given breaks on time"
good,It  will be alot better if they hire more people so half the things they want done can actually get done. the hardest part is we can fully do the required orders they want with the amount of staff we have
good,Although my time at Kroger wasn't as long as my previous jobs I will say my co workers made it feel like home. I had just moved to GA and they treated me amazing. The store was a little outdated but I do know a couple of months after I left they did undergo a remodel.
good,at the beginning we had free reign of the menu and cost was no issue.  Then we had to adhere to a pre determined recipes.  We would change up the menu items weekly for the day depending on who was working  open and close for that week.  Great benefits and the managers always checked in on you and what the company was doing and changes that were happening.  Of course the hardest part were the Hollidays and how busy they were and scheduling time off.
good,"It was a great experience, i was able to use my people skills, and showed efficiency in completing my given tasks, I was depended on and had a good team to work with."
good,Kroger is always eager to hire the most upbeat and work friendly people resulting in a balanced and happy work enviorment. It is a great place for people with little to no expirience working. Depending on how you perform at work kroger's is always eager to promote the hardest working employees to get you started on a potential career. They offer outstanding health benefits and workers compensation and many different levels of expirience ranging from your courtesy clerk up to a general manager. They offer a lot of room for you to grow and always keep you in par with meetings and conferences and promotions.
good,"A typical day was restocking, cleaning shelves, unloading product.  The management was approachable and well-received.  Compensation was a little low with few raises - at least for part time employees."
good,It's a great experience engaging with managers and customers. I really love engaging with other people that you may not know but best feeling is connect woth others.
good,"A typical day at work was very interesting.I got to converse with different personality of people and customers. I learned how to communicate with people effectively, and how to run different departments. Management was good at helping you achieve your highest goals. Work place culture was good,because co-workers were willing to help each other. The hardest part was when you tried to help someone and nothing you do appease them. The most enjoyable part was when customers smile and thank you for being so kind. Also,helping make their shopping experience pleasant."
good,In any position where you are in a small space with about a dozen other people you quickly learn to work together. Teamwork makes the dream work at Kroger.
good,"My job at Kroger was too simple for my taste. But the staff was fun and I enjoyed seeing them everyday. I have no complaints about the company, But I would not recommend working at a kroger store."
good,"Deciding to work for this company is the best choice I have made for my technical career thus far. I worked in a general office setting supporting technology, mostly proprietary software applications and systems. I learned a lot about how both the administrative and manufacturing sides collaborate to support the customer. The workplace culture is relaxed and there resources for learning on many levels. The hardest part of the job is always keeping up with the advancement in technology and systems. There is always something new so I never got bored. I enjoyed being part of such a large corporation that is well known in business and community support."
good,Very fast past. Must be able to learn quickly and pick up on things easily. The job requires you to study and take tests while working to get your ranking in the job higher.
good,Working in this grocery store is neither too fast paced or slow paced and provides great first work experience.  Being that it was a 24 hour store it was very easy to get extra hours when needed.  The work is not too exhausting.  Very friendly environment.
good,This was a high school job for me but I loved working for Kroger and being part of the union. It was a wonderful work experience working in the produce section and prepared me for my future jobs.
good,They are very lenient there and they work with your schedule very well. This is a great place for a first job. I suggest this job to high school students.
good,"It’s a real good job employees and customers are nice, and it was a very clean store. The pay was good and the environment was a positive environment to be in."
good,"My kroger experience consisted of friendly co-workers, great discounts, great ambiance. The hours were great, the pay was good, customers were also friendly."
good,One of the best places for a first job. You are better off there than fast food. Flexible scheduling for school events. Hours are reasonable and mostly consistent.
good,Was a place to grow. Was there a lil over a year. The training was exceptional. Having the experience I have w the grocery store business it was very easy to catch on.
good,"Kroger would be a wonderful job if its your first one. The hours you work could be flexible and the job becomes fun. However, to advance to other positions you need to be 18 years old and up."
good,Kroger is a very nice place to work for. Very friendly associates fun work environment. Good benefits. Good management. Always guaranteed a certain amount of hours. Very clean and neat store.
good,"I enjoyed working for Kroger’s when I was in high school, because of the great employees and managers. I used to couldn’t wait to get out of school early just to go to work."
good,"Kroger was a good place to work I did enjoy it and the people that I worked for and with were very pleasant and very helpful, a positive atmisphere. I left because I had an injury from an auto accident that hurt too much to continue, although they were very good about it."
good,"Exciting work environment, learn something new everyday, love working with my customers and keeping them satisfied. Employees are nice and a great team to work with."
good,The people were kind and welcoming and the work was challenging but not overly difficult. I enjoyed my time there before I moved onto college. I hope whoever has my spot now is enjoying it.
good,i was a supervisor so i had to do alot including managing others in my work field. Hardest part of the job was trying to keep an eye on everyone to work.
good,Kroger is a great company to work for i started as a cashier not knowing I would end up being s assistant customer service manager after 3 yrs. I enjoy working with people.
good,"A typical work day at Kroger can be busy. In my role as an Apparel associate  I could work in many departments that may need help..ex bagging, click list (e-commerce), dairy, grocery or Drug GM. This will give you the opportunity to learn what every department do."
good,"It was fun and never boring.  Overall, just a fun place to be. Management was good as well. I would have liked to advance my skills, but didn't work out."
good,"It's a great company to work at,and have a good  security job in the future for you and your family. you could work there for as  long as you need and have a great time working at Kroger Company."
good,"If you have a good manager, the work environment can be amazing. I loved knowing exactly what my hours were going to be every week and the discounts on things was an added bonus."
good,I love working for the place. It's very laid-back and nice setting. Only thing about the job is that you are well underpaid but it's so laid-back that it's just a great place to work.
good,"good communication between management"
good,"Kroger offers a balanced work environment with benefits and chances for promotion. I enjoy working in the Starbucks kiosk, making drinks for customers and just generally make customers happy."
good,Kroger is a great place to work lots of fun. Typical work day is 4 to 8 hours. Learned a whole new line of work at Kroger as I had never worked retail. I have had many different managers as they move them around a fair amount. They were all great.
good,"Overall  great  opportunity There’s no better place in retail to learn, grow and build a career than Kroger . Today’s cashiers will be tomorrow’s store or club managers. Today’s managers are tomorrow’s vice presidents. And tomorrow’s CEO will almost definitely come from inside our company. From our Home Office, to our stores, to our distribution centers and more, there’s virtually no limit to the ways you can grow with us."
good,Koger is a great place to work although the rate of pay needs to be revised. Our customers are wonderful and really make the job worthwhile and enjoyable.
good,"A typical day of work can be relaxing sometimes stressful. Often times it doesn't feel like you have enough time to do anything. Or enough people mainly when working the weekends. "
good,This was a temporary job for me I had just had a baby and needed to have some money coming in to help support her and take care of her.  I worked here until I found a new job.
good,"8-10 hrs a day studying sales trends  cost reductions  sales plans"
good,"I liked working there. It was very balanced. Good people. Wholesome. Happy people. Great products. Awesome Coworkers. Customers are chatty and happy. It wasn't to hard, pretty easy."
good,"The day here was fast paced and sometimes crazy and stressful. it would depend who was scheduled to work with you.  If i was scheduled with a good crew, the day was smooth and the day would go by fast because it was busy. If I was scheduled with the B team it would be a day filled trying to do 3 people's jobs in addition to my own. I loved that Fred Meyer carried everything and we would get additional discounts around the holidays especially from the jewelry department. The only thing I didn't care for was that it was difficult to fire some people who were incompetent or would frequently call in sick."
good,"Great work enviroment. I loved the staff. There was plenty of room for advancement. I was pregnant and part time, they worked with my avaliability. They are a unionized facility."
good,"Good co-workers, very diverse, nice managers, just that I guess in the location i am in, the profit was low, so raises were just annually. i was less motivated to work because of that."
good,There are many ways to learn new skills when working for Kroger stores. You'll never have a uneventful day at work. You'll have fun meeting and talking with your customers and co-workers.
good,"I worked at King Soopers Floral for almost two years. Wonderful co-workers, and decent pay at the time. Only time I had an issue was when my grandfather had passed and they did not let me get the time off to go to his funeral."
good,Be proactive don't wait for someone to tell you what to do. Hard workers usually get promoted pretty quickly.  Good customer service is a must in this industry.  The customer is who actually make your paycheck possible.
good,They treat employees well. Some managers are power hungry and control freaks. Most employees are fun to work with. Always laughing I loved talking to the customers
good,Work with different managers open a lot of different stores work my way up to manager having a lot of opportunities and then get rewards for winning competitions with different stores complete different challenges that manager will put and had the privilege of working with some of the best managers out there that taught me a lot
good,I like the company overall but the pay is too low and that is why everyone leaves after a couple months. Good for high school students wanting to earn a little bit of money while going to school.
good,I enjoyed working for Kroger and the people I worked with. The benefits and the pay was great they actually care about their employees I met a lot of great people there.
good,overall i do enjoy working for this company. They are very flexible with their scheduling and truly care about the employee. They try hard to make sure the employees are not over worked to insure that they can give their best effort while here. the only reason i will be leaving is so i can go back to school to pursue my zoology degree.
good,"Kroger is a great place to start working when you've just started entering the workforce after public schooling. I believe it is great for part-time employment however, full-time employment doesn't seem suitable for that type of work. Most typical work days include having to prep for the day ahead for customers that want our online grocery service. I've learned about the detrimental use of online retail and how associates are the main key for customers to improve relations and connections. Management within the company is very organized and professional which tells a lot about the meaning of Kroger's purpose in the retailing world. The overall workplace culture is friendly, tight-knitted, and team-based when we all work together we understand the task at hand. This makes working everyday easier within our department and makes the store worry-free. However, the most difficult part of the job is finding more hours and having enough staff to cover for shifts."
good,"Worked as a bagger in college. Roughly 3 days a week."
good,"a typical day is slicing meat for many customers"
good,This is the best retail job ever! Whether you're a teen or adult there are tons of opportunities within this company. Loved working here and made some life long friends while doing it!
good,"A typical day at work involves picking groceries for customers who shop with the online program Kroger has.  I have learned much about products within the store, and what type of products are commonly purchased by consumers.  The workplace culture is friendly and supportive.  The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the demand of the growing department, although not impossible.  The most enjoyable part of the job is selecting fresh produce."
good,I had a great exprience at kroger i have been working there for a minute. I have moved up very quick. I started as a cashier and move to customer service. I had some rough days dealing with customers but i was able to handle it.
good,"Always have worked with my schedule and gave me good hours. "
good,It can be very boring because you're in there alone for hours at a time ! We are not supposed to use cell phones or anything like that but like I said it's boring in there so what else is there to do ?? The customers act very slow and it can be very irritating but i do have to stay professional although I'm not sure how much sense it takes to pump gas
good,I love my job at Ruler Foods. I have held my cashier position since I was 16 years old . This company was my first and only job for 4 years. Just wish they would increase on pay !
good,good benefits they give good rises management not so good but co workers are nice. some rude customers good place to have on your resume they have good benfits
good,A typical day at work can be hard sometime. What I learned is that to teach teenagers to study hard in their future so they can find a better job than courtesy clerks. I say the managing job is ok. Because the store is always near and organize expect for the manager special isle. Everything is a mess. The hardest part of my job is pushing carts outside for 3 hours all by yourself when no one else is outside to help you or anybody else in the store. The most enjoyable part of the job is I got to talk to new people and meet some friendly cashiers and mangers.
good,"They are a great place to work, only downside is that if you come in with little to no experience they will only start you at minimum wage. Kroger is an ok place to start"
good,"Topical day at work is 8-9 hours on your feet, either stocking product, assisting customers, cashiering, or bagging. Workplace culture isn't great but for retail it's not bad. None of the work is hard, it's just high energy."
good,I have enjoyed working for the Kroger company since I began in September of 2014. They were very helpful in working with my limited availability while I was in college. Working for the company has been a great experience overall. I feel valued as an employee here.
good,I got to work at night so I either killed time watching a movie before hand or slept on up until it was time to go in. At work a various placings around the store offered many stocking demands as using pallets and carts was a must to perform around coworkers and customers. Shipments happen on a constant basis to grocery stores as their needs are a continual supply and demand with the orders going in during the day afternoon usually getting to the distribution center just in time to get picked and chosen and arriving at the store at nighttime. Management like to get to know who is working for them as it is their reputations too in many of the store situations. A store is usually both an up beat and relaxed environment and this case was no different with it's grand opening an extra stress factor. Delivering on time before the store opened as a dead line is seemingly the most difficult task to stocking as this becomes a game of time and proficiency. The employee discount is something to take advantage of as the assortment of different choices for lunch.
good,"Opportunity to multitask, Good teamwork. Good benefits and 401K. personal time off with pay. Lots of overtime. Safe working environment. close on all holidays."
good,"When I worked at Kroger My day was usually 8 hours, 4-5 days a week. When I walked in the door My supervisor would tell me what register to get on and to grab someone from another line and I would stay on that register for most of the day. Management at my store was nice. The hardest part of my job was seeing some people not be able to pay for all of their groceries. The most enjoyable part was working with my coworkers and having a customer leave with a smile."
good,the job was easy and manly consisted of unpacking boxes and restocking shelves. was a great job while I was going to college. usually have to work nights.
good,"the management and staff are all great. the customers are all great. they really take into count with your time and you get to pick your own hours and days off. sometimes it changes depending on what corporate wants but mostly you get the shift you want, and trade shift is super easy you fill out a form and take it to a manager and it gets approved almost every time."
good,My day begins with finding out what items are to be stocked on shelves and I am assigned that task until completed. I might also assist with keeping the aisles tidy and restocking shelves with groceries that need to be replaced. There have been times I would assist customers with locating items they need. I have learned how to be patient and customer service oriented. Management gives support where and when needed and will also assign task needed for completion. There is sometimes difficulty with co-workers when they have attitudes. The most enjoyable part is making customers smile and engaging in conversation with those customers.
good,"I loved working for Kroger. I had great co workers and work atmosphere. I learned a lot of things about money, retail, and the behind the scenes how a grocery store operates."
good,"A typical day at work as a cashier was providing quality service for our customers, going above and beyond to put them first. Closing shifts included cleaning duties and other tasks as assigned from shift leads. Management provided plenty of opportunities for  workers of any age to advance in their positions."
good,"Krogers has been a second home to me, great place to work especially in the pharmacy. People are friendly and very resourceful. Proud to have been a part of the Kroger family."
good,Sometimes we are short staff when it is real busy at times but can be manageable. I love working for this company because of the customers that come to shop in Kroger. I love helping the customers find more of what they need in the store. It's all about satisfying the customers. I love working in this environment because it is fun and you can enjoy every moment of it.
good,"In my opinion a typical work day at Kroger was never slow, you are always doing something which was one of my favorite things about going to work. I also like working with most of my co-workers. I learned good customer service and I also learned that even though they were my co-workers we were also family. In my opinion Kroger management was good  but also there was a lot of different mangers coming and going. The hardest part of the job was the amount of work Kroger expects courtesy clerks to do, what I mean is when we are told to get the carts, Kroger expects us to take 6 to 8 at a time and some of us can't physically do that. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers, I liked the interaction of being able to have conversations and get to know each person coming in and out of the store."
good,"I worked at Kroger for at least the minimal time for my union initiation to take place, and as far as I knew it never took place. The dues were being drawn out, even after my 90 day period where I was told we should have a meeting to talk about our advancement. I quit due to family and personal issues at the time, illness that was eventually taken care of after numerous visits I had to a doctor. My co-workers were pretty nice and helpful, I tried to go out of my way to do as much as I could to make everyone have an easier time."
good,"Daily I maintained various departments as a manager.  "
good,Work hard and they will place you wherever you want to go within the company. The CEO knows where to take the company and changes happen quickly. You have to be able to keep up with a complex organization with fluid responsibilities for some departments. Nice folks in store and in the office. Family environment. Great benefits. Need to give more attention to local associates and their community involvement.
good,"As produce clerk, you are non stop on your feet and assisting customers. Management makes clear what needs to be done, and allows you to work freely towards that goal."
good,"Just need to offer more hours after the holidays to their workers, and have meetings with their workers at least twice a year to listen to their needs and concerns not just with the union reps."
good,"Great company to work for. all about their employees. Great benefits, job security. Devoted to customers and helping the economy of every marketing area"
good,This was a very calming enviroment the customers enjoyed shopping here because it was a new store and they had so many things to choose from. I really enjoyed it there meeting new people.
good,"Fantastic management willing to work with you through many things. Good pay, could be better hours. Hardest part of my job standing on feet for long periods of time.The 4pm to 12 am is fun and joyable"
good,As a baker I work the 3rd shift from midnight - 8am so I am mostly by myself for the first 5-6hrs. We all do our part to complete our own task and also help the next person so he/she is ready for their shift. The customers are great and they love our bakery team because we continuously smile and provide great care and customer service to all customers.
good,"day at work was good,how to run a cash register and ring out,was good,my co-workers was fun to work with and be around,cart recovery,taking care of the plubic."
good,Kroger's has been such a huge impact on my me personally and professionally. Management wants everyone to do their part as a company and is willing to all that it takes to do so.
good,"Enjoyed working with my fellow employees. Management was great. Customers were polite, with a few bad apples every now and then."
good,"In my short time with Kroger before moving back to NY with my family I enjoyed my job at Kroger. the people are very caring and make you feel very welcome to be working with them, I enjoyed going into work everyday!!!"
good,"Working nights is pretty cool, you have to stay busy to stay awake. Management is awesome! Co-workers always check on you to make sure you are okay, very caring people."
good,"A typical day at work varied for me, when i was a baggier I bagged grocery's,took out trash,cleaned bathrooms and spills,when I was in general merchandise i stocked shelves,organized the products on the shelves,unloaded the products off the truck,and helped people over the phone and in store to find products in my department."
good,Wonderful fast paced working environment. Many of the customers are regulars and are very loyal. The friendly co-workers help the day fly by. Supervisors are not uptight they're very laid back and understanding.
good,"Kroger is a fantastic place to work for. They provide amazing healthcare options through their Union. They also had very upbeat and energetic employees to work around. I was with this company for four years but the one problem I continued to run into was the lack of fulfillment of promises. They promised me a Full Time position but after fighting for this for four years I grew weary of the run-around. So, I changed jobs.Also, another plus about Kroger is that they give you one week of paid time off after your first year employed there."
good,"Great company to work for, great compensation package, great benefits, great management and supervisors. great responce to customer concerns and employee suggestions"
good,"I miss working since its been a while that I stayed home. I miss everything, my co-workers the customers, even  though sometimes they are unpredictable. And I really love working, I mostly work 6 days a week or even 7 days in other branch of the company."
good,The employees are always encourage to work hard and develop meaningful relationships with each other. Management is very good at communicating praise and constructive criticism to employees.
good,I got to meet many and different people every passing day. I enjoyed very much working with customers. Its a good social job and a god way to be able to warm up to strangers. I learned a lot about food safety and working in a deli.
good,"The work environment is very welcoming and my co-workers help get tasks done in a timely manner. The hours are flexible and it is very easy to ask off when needed for family events, vacation, doctors appointments etc."
good,"Fast pace"
good,I loved the work environment and the people who would come threw the store. I have learned many social skills and how to assert myself in many situations.
good,"This store keeps you busy most of the shift.  Greet customers, scan merchandise, payment from customers is by credit card or cash, gift card.  Answer questions on where to find specific items.  Wait at end of isle to keep lines uncontested."
good,"A typical day included bagging groceries and gathering carts from the parking lot. Management and coworkers were enjoyable to work with. Everyone seemed like a ""family"". The hardest part is for sure all of the standing. It does take a huge toll on your back if you are not used to being up for so long. The most enjoyable part was nice conversations with the costumers and coworkers."
good,"The greatest thing I ever learned at Kroger was: you can go as far with Kroger as you want to go. It's as simple as that."
good,great company to work for if you want to be there. they weed out those who are just looking to collect a paycheck and dont show they want to help customers
good,"Friendly co-workers. Always willing to help and work as a team! Managers are nice, and care about their workers. The store is always kept clean."
good,great benefits! awesome team work!  a way to learn customer relations and also become a team leader. this job was my first customer service job
good,"As a Barista at the Starbucks kiosk located in Ralph's Grocery store, I learned how to prepare food/beverages in a timely manner, as well as multitask, problem solve, and clearly answer any of the customers' questions and concerns. I prepared coffee, teas, as well as cleaned and organized everything located in the kiosk. My co-workers were friendly, upbeat, and very assertive with the jobs assigned to us. The hardest part of the job was the down time we had in between customers, and most of the tasks for the day were already done and prepped for the next day. The most enjoyable part would be sampling new drinks and pastries out to customers, up-selling, and introducing our products, for them to come back and want more. The high satisfaction of our customers let me know that I accomplished both the goals of my co-workers and myself."
good,"Kroger is a great first job to have for students and part-time workers. It's a good entrance into customer service and working with the general public, and friendliness in management and employees seems to be a high priority for the company. "
good,"A typical day at Kroger for a cashier would be checking out customers in a fast and friendly way, maintaining a neat and professional workspace, greeting every customer that entered store, processing transactions. I learned that cashiering plays a very big part in customer service and how customers rate their experience. My co workers were very friendly and helped me in any way possible to achieve weekly goals. The hardest part of the job was knowing where everything in the store was. The most enjoyable part of the job was competing to keep a ring tender above 95 percent each week and earning a prize for being top performer."
good,My typical day at Kroger would be finding an available register and immediately bagging their groceries and helping them outside to their cars. My co-workers are very hardworking and responsible; all the work that needs to b done gets done in a reasonable time.
good,"The company is great to work for and has amazing employees but the sales goals are very high. If you haven't worked in sales or aren't good in sales, it is not the best place to work. But, overall, it is an amazing job and great advancement possibilities as the company is expanding rapidly."
good,"Working at Kroger was a good stepping stone to better opportunities with different companies that are higher up.  "
good,Kroger was the best job I've ever had. I work my way up from a bagger all way to customer service representative. I learned my customer service skills from Kroger. They have excellent training programs. My cowers were like family especially when you with them for at least 9 hours a day 5 days out of week. Management was firm but fair overall experience was great.
good,"Typical day at Kroger was operating a cash register, greeting and helping customers. I learned more about customer service and how to help customers and coworkers. The management team was great always seeking improvement and grade A customer service. the hardest part was sometimes dealing with rude and unhappy customers, the most enjoyable was the customer and the coworkers making everyday I work fun and enjoyable to be there."
good,A great company that invests generously in developing its associates. Associates never have to fight for job security. promoting from within is a priority.
good,"We are productive. the managers keep us happy at all time. They dont always make work work, They lets us have some fun time to time. They give us special lunches from time to time. A nice break room"
good,"I happened to work at a relatively small store, always heard there were things done differently depending on how big a store gets, larger company more hours and more departments (etc.). With a small store if any one calls off it can have a huge effect on job duties. Also with a smaller store you also get trained in multiple departments and I was constantly doing half shifts here and there between register and dairy etc. One shift I ran a total of four different departments. The union helps and hurts Kroger, if there is any problems they immediately help and try to fight for the workers but if you have great coworkers who try and help each other as much as possible and everyone works as a team there really is no need for the union other than they cannot simply fire you. The coworkers were amazing and helped to schedule work around my school and were very flexible. The management was dedicated and wanted nothing more than for the success of the store by helping other departments and trying to keep the workers as happy as possible, by setting hard but achievable goals and prizes for reaching those goals. Overall I learned a lot by working here and it has really helped my career."
good,I work with a diverse group of people handling freight. I work with miniunum supervision on a daily basis. I sometimes have to take lead when my manager and team leader are not around. When my coworkers are slacking I have to cover their end. The hardest part of my job is not knowing. Meeting goals is the best part
good,im happy with the benefits of working with this company there is always room for growth within the company the benefits are really nice love the insurance they train you thoroughly for everything and they compensate you for your time...its really nice that they care about your expenses
good,"Customer service is Kroger's #1 priority.  It is always busy, but can be fun sometimes. Friendly coworkers/ employees in all departments. Dealing with dificult situations during rush hour is the hardest part.  Your coworkers over time turning into family is the most enjoyable part. I've learned that with every situation requires a different approach because not all customers are the same.  Even though a situations' outcome varies, each customer must be given the same amount of respect regardless of the customer's demeanor."
good,"Kroger warehouse was a good job with good benefits, funny and great co-workers, lots of overtime with more volunteer overtime. nice atmosphere. had good team leaders management wasn't always good but got the job done most of the time. would love to go back to work there"
good,Enjoyed the family atmosphere. The company offers great benefits and the advancement opportunities are always available.
good,"I was fresh out of high school and it was a great place to earn a decent wage and have medical and for many years it was an enjoyable place to work, through the years there had been some rough patches the strike was very hard me and my husband are both in grocery business, and certain things change over a course of 20+ years, however I am very great full for what Ralphs has given me through the years."
good,"Making sure that I am doing the job that I'm scheduled to do for that day and get every task done, but making sure that everything is done correctly and even going over my work after I'm finished. Customer Service is always number one, I'm there to help my loyal customers so therefore I need to do 100% when helping those who ask for assistance, or even asking if they need help with anything, greeting a customer will get me a long way in helping to satisfy that customer to come back."
good,"overall Krogers is a good company to work for, easy to move up in the ranks as long as you work hard. The benefits are pretty nice, great starter job for high school er, and a good way to work up into management."
good,"A typical day would consist of bagging for customers, racking up carts that left outside by customers, make sure the restroom is clean, and help assist customers on questions or help on food items. I learned how to work in a team and accomplish monthly goals. My co-workers made my communication skills rise up. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking with the customers in a professional manner and making sure this is a place of family."
good,"Has outstanding P&L meeting with all department managers."
good,worked here for 3 years and never had problems with any employees or managers.
good,Fred Meyer has multiple ways to advance your career and the people that work there are amazing. Management is very caring and understanding to needs.
good,"A good place to work with many advancement opportunities. However, with advancement being so easy, often times people who are unfit to manage find their way to management ( lucky for me I got into a department with a really good manager). This was a problem in multiple departments of the store. Also, being retail, much of the job was pleasing corporates, which they generally wanted things done in a way that wasn't efficient."
good,"Cooking food, helping customers, making cookies and pastries. I learned how to fry chicken and make different types of food in a turbochef. Management and my coworkers are awesome, I miss them all. The hardest part was definitely getting up at 4 A.M in order to start with the opening responsibilities, as to where the most enjoyable part was getting to talk with the customers and build relationships with the regulars."
good,"Kroger is a good place to work. All fellow associates are very friendly and are willing to help whenever you are in need. The managers are very good, they understand the difficulties of the job. The hardest part of the job was to keep up with the customers and keep the department in good condition. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people that I worked with. They were always willing to help and treated me with respect."
good,"It is a good company. I have worked for 7 years. The Job is stable, and due attention is given to both costumers and employers. There is a welcoming atmosphere.  The only thing that is missing is full time opportunity for courtesy clerks."
good,"Working hand on hand with patients , third party adjustments, and medications within the pharmacy is very exciting about my position, Rotating around the pharmacy makes my time at the pharmacy enjoyable."
good,"A typical day at work involves myself bagging groceries for customers and asking them about their day, if they found what they were looking for, and if they need help to their car. I also help them on the floor if they are lost and aren't sure where a certain item is. I've learned that working in a team is very important to get everything done. It is important to stay on top of your task so that the store can succeed, not just one person. Management is great to work with, they are understanding of your needs and work with your schedule. They are flexible with hours and are willing to work with you if you have a problem getting to work or any sort of issue like that. They make you feel welcome at your store. The coworkers are also great, they are all friendly and try hard to accomplish everything they need to in their day. I think the hardest part of the job would be trying to provide the best possible customer service you could give. No matter how hard you try to be patient, calm and friendly, some customers do not want to work with you and insist on being resistant to your ideas or suggestions if we are not carrying a certain item they wanted or if their particular item has been damaged. The most enjoyable part of this job would be the interactions with the customers. I have some regular customers who I know by face and on a name basis because of the interactions that I have with them. It is rewarding to hear a customer say that they shop at your store just to see you and to talk to you personally."
good,Bagged groceries and brought in buggies. I learned more about my communication skills. Management was good. The hardest part was getting buggies in cold parts of the winter. The best part was seeing the same customers again.
good,"my days at work was always simple and easy... I enjoyed working with customers, I just wished the coworkers  were my interactive ."
good,There Would be days at work where i had a little problem outside of work and my co-wrkers always knew how to cheer me up as i did to them. The Managers were all professional. The most enjoyable part of the job was communicating with the customers. There was no hard part
good,This was a real family oriented work place. Everybody help everyone rather they where in your department or not.
good,"This was my first job. I actually really loved almost everything about working here other than how late they would have me working on a school night (back when i was in High School). My co-workers were great, my management was awesome. I loved helping customers when they needed me. I also liked how I wasn't stuck inside all day, but if I had to be inside I wouldn't mind. All around though, I liked it there."
good,"They were a great company to work for. Very family understanding. Most customers were thankful and happy, making you feel better about helping them."
good,"Nice work environment, supportive staff, and competitive salary."
good,"Union job, you have a chance to be a team member. They work best with your schedule and needs. When full time you receive insurance and security hours, meaning they can't be shorted."
good,"A typical day at work was either opening the Self Check Out counter or sometimes the Customer Service Desk. It could also be doing a mid-shift or a closing shift. Cashing shifts were schedualed also. Each day could be any combination of these or just one for the day."
good,This place was great! Everyone got the job done and everyone got along just fine!
good,"Well, the New Lexington Kroger is going down hill. They don't care who they hire anymore. Their are people who work there with bad hygiene and are very rude. They treat you like a dog. They didn't place me to become a cashier because of my height. Some of the managers are very disrespectful and don't care what you have to say."
good,"easy past learning exp."
good,"A typical day at work started with carrying out the proper protocol, which included: putting on a hairnet, washing my hands, putting on gloves, and checking for any mess and cleaning it. As a bakery clerk I was responsible for multiple jobs. Preparing pastries, stocking, keeping inventory, cleaning, and providing excellent customer service were my main priorities. My co-workers were very quick and efficient at their jobs. They were very friendly people. The hardest part of the job was time management. It was important to get everything on my list of duties done each day. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was decorating the cakes."
good,My manager allowed me to learn a lot in a very short time. Now I know enough to move to management positions
good,"A typical day at work involves the desire to help each customer have an enjoyable and fast shopping experience. My position normally entailed helping the customer complete their shopping experience."
good,Pick N Save is a very customer oriented workplace that prides itself on providing customers with the best service and shopping experience possible. It involves a lot of constant activity and interaction with customers and other employees. The company also takes great pride in making sure that the standards of the store are always up to par.
good,I have had the opportunity to advance and found a position that suits my expertise and capabilities. I find my current position enjoyable as that it is different each day and provides enough challenge to keep it from being boring. I have learned to adapt to different personalities and demonstrate leadership according to the needs of the business. I enjoy communicating with customers and being able to assist with filling special orders. The hardest part of my job is assisting the recruiting manager with staffing the store.  Overall I have enjoyed working for this company and appreciate the benefits and knowledge I have gained.
good,"Good management, learned a lot since it was my first job. Typical day at work for me was pulling the truck when i got into work at 6am had to break the truck down and put away product/ work product to the shelf."
good,"I was working overnight, it was mostly quiet and peaceful and i like how the managers had trust in me."
good,"Great company, decent pay, flexible schedule!!!!"
good,I've learned customer service and very important values in work and life that I can use to become a better person and employee.
good,"This job taught me quite a few things including that not everyone plays their part in completing a given objective.  Due to the common lack of support from fellow Courtesy Clerks, I learned to work much faster and much more efficiently than most.  Even though I had a few unreliable coworkers, there was always someone whom I could rely on to make sure at the end of the day, all my objectives were completed.  Even though the business was very fast paced, I found this rather enjoyable about the job and eventually I learned how to do almost every job in the store."
good,"A typical day on the job entails bagging groceries, helping customers find certain items, cleaning the store and restrooms, collecting buggies from the lot, and stocking the shelves. I learned how to multi-task as well as how to assist customers to the best of my ability. "
good,"Applied leadership skills and technical expertise to administer 24-hour worldwide response for Information System, including extensive problem solving.Supervised and coordinated activities of team of 20 personnel completing installation projects.Managed and coordinated installation and maintenance logic networks.Responsible for disassembling and preparing customized parts .Accountable for performing repair on modified devices.

good,"My job at picknsave was a very nice job,I loved meeting new people"
good,"A typical day at work would be checking a variety of customers out consistently. I've learned ways of making my job easier by learning how to check customers out fast. In example, instead of lifting heavy items out of the basket I've learned most codes to heavy items. Through out my almost 5 years in customer service I have always had a good relationship with my managers as long as I did what was expected of me on the job. My co-workers are easy to get along with because I am a out-going friendly person. One of the hardest parts about my job I have to learn to to adjust to different people no matter how good my day or their day is going a positive attitude must be held at all times. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to to work and live in an urban area which makes it easy for me to relate to my customers."
good,"A typical day at work in this pharmacy would be greeting costumers as they approach regardless of what other duties you were doing, pulling prescriptions, re-stocking prescriptions, attending to the drive-thru was challenging at first but eventually got easier to understand, had to use data entry to search customers and verify their medications, at times I would have to reconstitute medications before handing it to the patient. It was always steadily busy, some days more than others and i learned that I manage well under extremely stressful situations. The Pharmacists and Pharmacy techs were always very patient and super helpful towards me and the customers, i learned a few things from each person about how quickly you can a solution for a simple problem and the importance of knowing the entire surroundings in order to be fully efficient in the pharmacy."

good,"You learn how to cook eclectic types of chicken, to slice all the meat and cheese, to make 6 different salads, and to make many different sandwiches"
good,Checking the daily schedule to see what i had to do for today. Some days i would clean the bathrooms and go out and get carts. Other days i might be bagging and tending to customers. I learned its a good thing to get to work 30 min early. With management i learned to always remain respectful and never take it personal.My co workers i usually busy everyone trying to get there job for that day completed. The hardest part of the job is when the winter would hit and i would have to go out and get carts. The enjoyment of my job is seeing happy customers come and go.

good,"Work is sometimes always fun, and nice people to work with. I've learned a lot from the past 20 months working there. It can be stressfull working in the departments and a lot of responsibility.

good,Kroger is a company with great sales and customer service. Trained in multiple areas in the store while earning my way up into gourmet foods. With food safety and new ideas helped increase sales and customer interest. Staff provided great customer service and fresh quality foods. I enjoyed the years I've learned in food and recipes.
good,Great benefits if you can hold out a year to get hired on an regular employee.
good,"Overall, kroger is a fine place to work. They will usually work with you on working with other activities in a person life. The co-workers and managers are usually good to work with. The pay is on the low side."
good,"Its a very productive, fun place to work at. The pharmacy and meat dept staff that I have worked with over the years are some of the most determined and have a don't quit attitude. The management in the company is great. When ever I have had a issue with something they where always there to help me so that i could continue to progress within the company.

good,"The environment and people at Kroger were great, it was also competitive to see which cashier was the fastest. the only thing I did not like about working here at Kroger was standing in the same spot for hours"
good,"Great atmosphere and great company to work for. Benefits are great and easy to take time off if needed. My only negative review is sometimes having to abide by ""the customer is always right"" theory when sometimes the customers are very rude and take advantage of that saying. Also, management can be rude to their employees sometimes too. Having great coworkers makes the job experience better as well."
good,It was a fun workplace to me. Management was nice and fair and helped me learn new things about the store. The hardest part of my job was closing the deli after a busy day. But the co-workers made it far more enjoyable for me.

Sometimes you can have 20 trucks of boxed flowers moving through our warehouse and it takes every one to make sure it all gets put away before shipping comes in to assemble orders and ship it all out. It is also very cool inside the warehouse in order to keep the flowers at a proper temperature."

good,"A typical day at work would be I clock into the time clock. I would sign on to my assign register and greet customers. I scan each item in their shopping cart and take payments in the form of credit, debit, check, and or cash. I learned how to operate a cash register and how to deal with difficult customers. Management was awesome, they rewarded you for being a hard working employee. After months of working at Kroger I operated the u-scan machines and I also worked Saturday nights from midnight until 7am on Sunday morning changing the price tag on items in the store. The hardest part of the job was not being able to work full time hours The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people that came through my line."
good,"While working at Kroger, I gained a lot of knowledge and everyone was willing to help me learn new things. I also enjoyed the fact that I was able to reimbursed for my certification test once I passed. Overall, this company is great to work for!"

good,"Full time work as a cashier using electronic scanning & keying"

good,Days at work are pretty fast and easy. Managment is good. Co-workers are nice and fun to work with. Learning produce codes is about the hardest part about my job. The most enjoyable part about the job is you can be yourself.
good,"I come to work early on time and i love my work, its an environment where you continue to work from associates. customer satisfaction is number one and i put my department to number 3 out of 1,999 kroger stores in the all country, my inventory is always positive and my department the highest in sales as we developed strong team work. mechandising, shrink control and freshness on top of my priority."
good,"On a typical day at work I clock-in greet my neighboring Cashiers,  clean my register then or interact with my customer whichever comes first. I scan items while talking with talking.Follow company policies and and procedures at the time necessary until the end of my shift. I learnt to forget about myself and think more about others because at my job I am constantly thinking about the needs of customers which is amazing being it feels fulfilling to see someone smiling because of something I did. The management is good , All managers I have come to know are friendly, courteous, caring and very professional. My hardest point is when a problem arises that I know I cannot solve. My most enjoyable moment would be when I know that a customer is completely satisfied or I had a fun conversation with a customer."
good,"Customer service, handling cash, paperwork, inventory, stocking shelves, and putting up freight. I learned alot from management. Had alot of great co-workers. Hardest part of the job was not being able to always help everyone. The greatest part of the job was helping the customers and having them a repeat customer."
good,"I worked in the bakery department at Kroger.  I learned alot.  I learned customer service, how to bake many different types of cookies, and bread, and how to decorate all sorts of cakes!"
good,Average company to work for. Pay and benefits were good but the work schedule changes constantly and it's difficult to make plans
good,"Normally it was a very busy day at work, especially in the beginning of the months. I had to learn how to do various things, like WIC checks and working the cash registers, the management was very helpful and serious about customer service. Most of my co workers were very friendly and the hardest part of the job was the WIC checks but it becomes easier after you get experienced. The enjoyable part was meeting new people, and working with friendly customers"
good,"typically slow depending on the time of yr. "
good,Great company to work for. The comapny takes pride helping there employees get to the next level. Great place to work.
good,Getting close to the customers. Play as a team player. The hardest part of the job was completing a lot of tasks at once.
good,The customer is always right here. I learned great customer service skills with this company. The management was very nice and helped you out to the best of their ability. My co-workers were nice as well and were always there to meet a customers' need. The hardest part of my job was lifting heavy grocery bags and occasionally dealing with unsatisfied customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the customers smile and ensuring they got the assistance that they needed.
good,"Always working with customers, friendly staff, busy days mostly weekends, Really need to be patient when it comes to customers needs"
good,I worked for this company for 4 years and enjoyed it. The work days were not hard at all and you can learn almost every department in the store with less than a weeks training. The management was wonderful and same with the majority of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was when they pulled you from your department to help at the front when it was busy. This would be fine if this happened every now and then but when it happens every five minuets it gets a little annoying just because you can't finish your duties. Other than that Kroger is a wonderful place to work for and I enjoyed it very much.

good,"great job great people very challenge every day, very good managment group, like a family"
good,I worked as an assistant customer service manager. Did all the accounting and banking for the day. Supervised the cashiers as well as baggers. Made sure customers were satisfied when they needed assistance at the service desk. Great employees and staff. Lots of regulars customers.
good,There is no way that i can explain in words how much fun it was to work for the kroger company. Keep up the good work.
good,Typical day at work would be walking in and being greeted by co-workers and customers.
good,"My bosses and colleagues are great, technology is behind and slow back in the pharmacy and the customers in the Dallas area are terrible. Love the work environment and everyone in the pharmacy is friendly and we work as a team very well and very closely."
good,Kroger was a really nice job. I recently moved to another side of town and was not willing to let me get days off when i have doctors appointments out of town.
good,"nice people, flexible hours, bagged groceries, stocked shelves, retrieved carts, helped people to their car, pretty easy, laid back job liked the people there the best."
good,Everyone worked together and jepr a positive attitude regardless of the amount of tasks we had to complete before the days end. Always complimenting each other and maintaining a conformable work environment
good,"I walked away from this company twice. Both times because of unsanitary work ethics from Mngmt and co-workers. Overall, a person enjoy working in the Deli ⭐"
good,everyone is very friendly good place for a student in highschool allows a flexible schedule so the studebt can pay attention to what matters and still make money
good,"Kroger is great job I just had to leave due to personal and health reasons. I would go back to this job if I could ,but I feel that more hours could have been granted. some of the supervisors were rude at times and were not as helpful during my first day of training."
good,Inspected produce inbound loads usually about 25 in an 8 hour shift I learned the retail side of the produce business.  Management depends on the situation some favoritism
good,I would arrive at work and some days I worked as cashier or in Office doing Customer Service work. I enjoyed working with the public.  I enjoyed working the Customer Service position.
good,"This job goes by seniority. So, I didn't like the hours they gave me. Always had me closing. Only get two 15 min breaks. How can you eat on only a 15 min break?"
good,"great place to work, great pay and benefits, management tries to help people advance , a great first time job. opportunities for advancements, and great morale."
good,"Recommends"
good,Kroger is a great company that is willingly to support you has a team and push you to further your education. Kroger is motivational but you have to be around the right management team that will push you to where you can be successful in the field of kroger.
good,i enjoyed working at Kroger Company. it was a loving environment. i enjoyed meeting new people including staff and customers. i learned a lot of new thing in this area of work including great customer service.
good,"If you have never worked before Kroger is a great company to work for they will work with your school schedule, including your school activities.  If you are a little older and will be attending College you have the option to take a school leave of absence."
good,"Kroger was my first job. As far as first jobs go, it was decent. The employees and managers were friendly and welcoming. They made going to work very easy. Kroger allows growth in the company which is what I did, I went from a bagging clerk to a produce clerk, gaining more hours as well as a higher pay."
good,"This was my first job through the end of high school. It helped me develop teamwork, leadership, and good friendships. I enjoyed my job and the customers. I only left due to disagreements with management."
good,they was very understanding of when a problem came up a family emergency of if someone was sick. management was very nice and always helped with anything that we needed.
good,Typical work day was very exciting. You never know who is going to walk through your line. I have had the pleasure of meeting some of the University of Cincinnati basketball players working at Kroger's.
good,Kroger is a great company to work for especcialy at the HQ. They really are loyalt to their employees and I would highly reccommend Kroger to anyone looking for a job.
good,"Dropping market shares"
good,"I started at a young age in a farmers market in 2008 stayed until 2012 when they closed and than had transferred to the main store in Blandon working in the warehouse. Staff was wonderful as well as the customers, I was always on the go! I broke my foot in February of this year and was no longer able to do my job. They had to find a replacement for me. I am able to go back if they would ever have an opening, however something's would have to change drastically."
good,"My typical day at work is to report to my department manager to see how we did the previous day. Next, I do our deli to go bunker.Then, I do the sandwiches and take any orders that come through our kiosk machine and over the phone. Always make sure the customer is our numberb1. I learned to always make sure the customer is taken care of. My managers are always there if we have questions or concerns. The hardest part of the job is every day there are always something that comes a long. Most joy able about the job is you get to learn about products."
good,"Just started working here, While i have been here i have had noticed the co-workers and management are very easy to work with and motivating,"
good,This was my first job and i learned a lot. Management gives many learning and advancing opportunities. customers were always happy and employees got acknowledgement for doing a good job.
good,"- A typical day at work is to stay busy."
good,"Great staff, very organized, strong culture, structured staff, and benefits."
good,"A typical day working at kroger is based on bagging customers groceries and clearing parking lot. Working there i learned work in a timely manner and greet customers. The managers were very friendly, helpful, and respectful. My co-workers were kind and polite to everyone. The hardest part of my would be working the parking lot during the summer heat. The most enjoyable part of my job would be trying to keep up my bagging speed as the cashier slides me the items."
good,"I would greet customers, go-backs, stock items, help bag groceries, organize the carts."
good,"Greet customers entering establishments. Received payments by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits. Issued receipts, refunds, credits, or change due to customers. Maintain clean and orderly checkout areas."
good,"I Was Cashier Full Time , It Was Too Many  Favorism and my check was nothing but 50$ And their management suck and lazy the kroger on Braircliff rd and the worset store eve"
good,"Overall a good place to work for.  However, management was lacking in every aspect.  If management was on the same page as employees it would be so much better."
good,They don't really give raises reguardless of how hard you work. Depending on what location you are in the previous statement may vary. They work you until you can't work anymore.
good,I liked the job but I just rodent like the position I had. I wanted to be a cashier but I was young so I really didn't car they paid enough for me being a teen
good,"can not live off of pay what so ever. The workers in the bakery needs a raise and also, could use better management, and there is also no room to grow here."
good,i was making sandwich's and being a cashier and taking orders
good,They should give them tools on how to work with employees not tear down or make them feel uneasy coming to work and acquire the right help for each department.
good,It is a place that can be productive and challenging at times.  I started out enjoying the environment.  Now it is just a job.  Management can be better at managing.  I have learned to be motivated even in challenging times.
good,The workers weren’t too nice and they were rude. We got free food in the breakroom if you were fast enough you could get some. The store needed more lights in the parking lot. Bringing carts in was scary at night.
good,"Can be very stressful, very busy never really a down moment. Very task oriented and goal based, sometimes competitive, most of the employees are very great but management in and out of the pharmacy is very poor"
good,started working there as stocker  then went into  dairy position  filled milk shelves filled eggs and all dairy  products  also  filled frozen  shelves too  management was good  culture is also good hardest part of job trying to live  on less then  20  hours WEEK enjoyed working in dairy dept
good,"Not to challenging, no team players, co workers just there no put of effort to get job done"
good,"The pay was lousy, and so was the management. The room for advancement was not happening"
good,Kroger was great we were a family we looked out for one another. Then we got new management. 32 people quit within 2 weeks. I stayed as long as i could but I did not agree with what was going on.
good,Great pay but mangers fire you for no reason or if they dont like you they can fire you mangers dont help you if you get harrassed and store manger is sacasted.
good,It and nice place to work but wasnt getting enough hours and u cant get any overtime r nothing the hours r not good at all they dont reallygive u hours
good,"Average day at work was meager at best."
good,Kroger's does not treat their employees fairly at all. The management has their own little clicks at every store. If your not one in the click they treat you very badly
good,marianos is a very fun job depending on the location. You are surrounded by good peoplethat have very good attitudes. sometimes customers can be out of hand but its up to you to keep a positive mindset
good,"A typical day at work was to insecure the customer get what they need and working in a cleaning environment. Co-work was very nice, helpful and fun to be around. The hardest part of the job was the rude customers that came order from us."
good,I loved working there and with others as a team.  I enjoyed interacting with the customers and developed a relationship with some of them.  Due to the fact that I caught on quickly I was promoted from sacker to cashier.  I attended school and worked.
good,The hardest part about my job is when the customers are rude for no reason. Everyday i learn how to be more understanding and patient. my co- worker are mostly all nice and helpful. The things that i enjoy most are seeing customers over and over wacthing there kids get older the smiles on the customers face when you remember something about them.
good,"It's nice Co. they do treat there employees good, but I wouldn't say Union is , I feel they don't stand up for long term employees an we long time employees have paid way more than the average an I feel like they don't protect us, I know more than dozen people that agree.i am now retired an really hate to see what future holds for thrmcurrently"
good,Kroger is a fast paced work place. Lots of duties and chores as well as keeping up with all the customers drama and making sure their shopping experience is going well.
good,I would never know from week to week how many hours I would be working.  It was like an on call position.  There was no job security and that is something that I needed.
good,"Great place to work but i needed a full time job and benefits. "
good,"When i was working a Kroger, it was a fun job but, the management was not helpful in resolving problems that were brought up, and i was eventually unhappy with how i was being treated, and then decided to leave Kroger."
good,"the hardest part of my job is having to stay outside when its bitter cold,. the  best part of my job is knowing that at the end of the day is knowing that i did all i could to help that person to much sure that  they had everything they needed"
good,Overall the teamwork was well there. Just the head managers needed a little more work on how to maintain a strong team. Everyone at some points would do whatever they wished.
good,"Deli department is the worst. The management was horrible, they changed your schedule without your knowledge then call you when you don't show up saying we changed your shift we need you here in 10min."
good,Working at Krogers was a tough job I worked mostly every day of the week. I would come in afternoon and wouldn't leave until that night so about I got home I was exhausted.
good,Loved working here. The customers were great even though of course you have your rude customers but overall it was a great first job for me. Loved the environment.
good,"Kroger was my very first job.  I was hired at 15 years old as a bagger and was promoted within a year to a cashier.  I've learned so much as far as customer service is concerned and also have learned how to operate different machines while working at Kroger.  I've met the most amazing co-workers and Managers/Supervisors since I've been employed at Kroger.  Everyday is a challenge and you never know what you're walking into, but I take one step at a time and take on each day on the job with my head held high and always with a smile on my face. The most hardest part of my job is seeing others on the job not really GETTING THEIR JOB DONE, and the most enjoyable part of my job is making and seeing the customers happy and proud to shop in a store where their needs are always met."
good,"manager lacks people skills and respectful verbalization"
good,"baging, helping customers to their cars, putting things away"
good,"I liked the company I liked the management and the workplace was pleasant "
good,The customers were really the only positive thing about the job. The entire night shift crew was always angry. We were understaffed and often forced into overtime. Then yelled at for having to accrue overtime. The discounts only applied to kroger brands
good,"A really nice place to work for younger people who have a lot of energy such as myself. The pay is competitive and well deserved considering the amount of work, but Courtesy Clerks deserve a higher wage because back in 2016 they paid us dirt while cashiers, with the easiest job in the world, got paid way more.I learned how to quickly de-escalate situations with fiery customers on a daily basis, especially during the booming holiday season. The management is pretty good at my store, the only downfall is that they tend to bring new people in instead of promoting existing employees. The job itself is very easy, it's just that customers are extremely unpredictable making everyday a learning experience to say the least. The most enjoyable part of the job is the connection you build with the regular customers, it's like having an extended family."
good,"basic retail pharmacy responsibilities"
good,poor hours poor pay short break  management poor job work poor benefits poors the hardest of the job is getting the grocery in the right bag and bag it in right
good,"The company is great and they definitely know how to run a good business. However, the management that I had at my location was terrible. The management did not care for any of their employees and the hours were horrible."
good,"Ask me. I dislike working there, but not for the reasons you might think. I do not wish to post publicly my opinion of Kroger. While their business strategy is sound in regards to customer retention, they steal but incapable of adaptation on a day to day basis. Their business model is definitely not aimed at employee retention."
good,Kroger is an under paying company that expects people to take a family on $9.00 hr. They don't pay enough to take care of a single person. Raise the pay
good,I liked working here my manager was cool. It's gotten a little better since the store manager gone an probably some of the other co managers. Anyone will like it.
good,"For it being my first job as a 16 year old and staying with them for 6 years i defiantly learned a lot about people, and the real world from working here. Typical day was cleaning up recieving, unloading and loading trucks, checking in vendors, running the frozen department, and stocking. Never enough people around to help, always stressed and stayed late to get things done. Didnt pay enough. The few people i worked with became family too me other wise it was always drama!"
good,"If you were outside on lot not long ago they would send you back outside. Hardly any cart collectors would be outside getting carts, possibly only had one or two people out there when the lot would be filled with carts. Management doesn't keep an eye on breaks. Once I had got a shirt for a deal we were doing, I asked for a small size and they gave me a 3x when I asked for an xl my supervisor refused to give me the size I asked for."
good,"Good company to work for, workplace is enjoyable and I have learned a lot about reporting metrics and dealing with analytics. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people who work for the company."
good,The job overall was decent the customers were nice and multicultural. I learned how to maintain a positive attitude through negative situations. The management were lazy and did very little work the supervisors worked harder.
good,"Kroger is a great place to learn how to deal with the public, and management who stumbled in off the street. You will grow as a person, and learn how to deal with adversity. You will learn how to value yourself and how to manage peoples emotions. "
good,This is a job if you do not have bills to pay for nor a house to make payments on. They have a union so you do not get more than a nickel raise. You are expected to uphold their silly rules while paying little to nothing for the stress.
good,is a alright place to work when the management isn't tripping . its a fun work environment . ok benefits . i don't like the fact that's its only minimum wage though.
good,Very busy paced enviroment. loved my manager she was the best. some of the managers came and went inside . never got to know much about them. hardest part of the job. nothing really. co-workers came and went fast to. but the few who remained was great people and hard workers.
good,Typical day at kroger i would be on my feet for 8 hours and ring. I learned that each person has a specif need and want they expect you to fulfill. The management was very understanding of time needed off and sick days.  The hardest part of my job there was not advancing on my position.  The best part of working at kroger was my coworkers became family to me
good,"the people are great, ive learned great customer service and the employees are AMAZING. i enjoy every minute of my job"
good,The people that worked there overall were nice to me. Some were there just to pass the time especially students and did not care about the hours. My overall impression was there were always labor problems so in essence the hours were different every week
good,"Bag,stock, and clean the hardest part in the job is the weather outside."
good,Opening the coffee shop by 6:00 Am
good,Many things come to mind when i think about kroger. I enjoy shopping there its a wonderful experience for customers. Not a good place to work. Definitely needs to work on how they treat employees.
good,Good first job but like other places they have favoritism towards certain people. I have some customers that I like but most of them are hateful and have an air of entitlement.
good,"The pay here was pretty well and the job position I had was fun because it's something I like to do and have fun dealing with food anyway. However management here was absolutely horrendous. From the horrible attitudes to the snarky remarks it was not the place to be outside of the amazing everyday pay. However I did learn a lot and enjoyed the skills that I got to practice daily. Making tray and slicing food was a lot of fun, tiring, but a lot of fun."
good,Its a basic retail job of a bagger boy with a couple extra things you have to do. Not too hard and dont have to use your head too much because its just a dead end job.
good,"I guess i would recommend it to someone, but do not go for front end unless you can handle stress really well and being nagged at all the time. Try another part of the store, i was recommended to go to produce."
good,It’s a job with a lot of opportunities just not the best work life balance for a family. It was not the best culture but they were working on improving. Asks a lot of employees very demanding but decent pay and bonus.
good,Management does not do anything to deal with the issues pertaining to customer service and lets it fall on the pharmacy instead of dealing with the issue that the entire pharmacy has complained about numerous times.
good,"Pay is low. best suited for college student or high school student. Coworkers are mostly either older women, or students(college/high school). Not very cooperative with getting time off, doesnt follow your set availability, and managers are rude."
good,"Some of the management is good, some not so good.  Hours are not very flexible for some positions.  Hours are never the same as is usual for retail.  One perk is that there is usually something to snack on in the break room because it has to be pulled off the shelf because of the sell by date."
good,"clock in and work register "
good,Overall Kroger is a great company. I would recommend this job to others. The people are great and open to opinion. The hardest part of the job is getting the required numbers at the end of the week.
good,"It was a nice place to work regarding the job itself. Not asking you to do much at all and nice customers as well. Hours are flexible, in my experience I worked as many as they would give me."
good,"Inconsistant hours, schedule changed weekly and made it difficult to schedule other work and private time. Advancement was based on how available you were to come in on days off to cover for others. No lunches just a 10 minute or 15 minute break every 2 hours, even when scheduled to work 12 hour shifts."
good,I dont want to write a super long review & i dont see why i should have to what else should i say besides its very very very cold & they over worked us !n/a
good,"it was a good place to work , but i had issues with somebody who i worked with . and truly didnt like the way things were handled on a management level ."
good,I worked there when I was in high school and first year of college. It was a great experience for my first job. They were flexible with my school schedules and with my hours.
good,They didn't like me much after I quite working with they after I had my son I had to push cart all day without bagging and clean bathroom
good,"Typical work day is 12 to 14 hours."
good,Cant complain this job did exactly what it was suppose to do. working here a year taught me how much is overlooked when shopping and goes into running a business.
good,Kroger was a great experience of course I had bad days but overall the managers and co workers were great. Customers can be rude but you must ignore it. Breaks are only 15 mins which isn't fair
good,I loved the fast pace of customer service. I enjoy taking on extra duties and showing how well I am able to complete with little to no supervision.
good,. You didnt' have much room to advance at a job like this. Its rare to get a promotion here. Everyday was something new you have to know how to deal with customers in a friendly manner when working at a public place like this one.
good,You guys don't pay the people who work hard for you and prove they deserve it.
good,"Great company to work for, there are always people that are difficult. With this company like many others, if they would listen to their people they will grow."
good,enjoyable place to work.  the other employees were good to work with and we made a good team.
good,I loved working with the customers and building the trust that they come to expect from a sales associate. My only problem was trying to work with management and the Union to get what I needed to complete school. 
good,"Kroger, the 2nd largest grocery retailer was my home for 23 years. Starting as a bagger (right after my 16th birthday) I always wanted to work at a grocery store. Work was sometimes tedious, a lot of overtime with no compensation when you were in management, but I loved the company, had great coworkers who are still my friends, I loved working with customers, whether good or difficult ones, I was a good problem solver and always tried to make sure in any postion I was in, the customer was satisfied in the end"
good,"Overall, great company to work for. Am truly blessed to even be working. Having difficulties finding full time permanant employment."
good,The workplace was unorganized but professional their were certain things i wish I could change but other than those particular things it was very good.
good,A lot of the department management will work with your school schedule. I don't recommend having this as a career though. There is alot of room for advancement within the company.
good,Lack of pay was doing wayyyy to much work to not get paid double digits job was boring my team was lazy didn’t greet or enjoy working didn’t have the love u supposed to have when working so I left
good,i enjoyed working there i quit to go back to school and school did not work out working in the meat dept was a good position but the dept only has 3 employees and if you were not full time you have no benifits i
good,"Management jumped in and helped many times when cashiers were feeling overwhelmed. They listened to our comments and feedback. Training was easy, as was wine/alcohol training."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of checking people out and maintaining the cleanliness of the front end. I was able to learn how to operate in a fast-paced manner and how to deal with unkind people. The management at the time was somewhat cruel and unfair to their workers; however, this was not all of the management. The workplace culture was mostly upbeat and friendly. The hardest part of the job was having to multi-task when there was not a lot of people on the floor. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with my former co-workers and customers."
good,I was basically a cashier and my coworkers were wonderful to work with. The assistant managers were friendly and didn't mind answering questions if you had any.
good,Overall it is a great experience. I have been offered to perform multiple jobs during my years at Kroger. I feel it is a fair opportunity for advancement
good,"I was in several positions in my time with Kroger. although I handled each position with great work and results, I felt I wasn't rewarded as I should have been."
good,Great place to develop customer service skills. Co-workers are generally very nice and easy to work with. Fast paced environment to work in especially around the first of the month and weekends.
good,This is a great first or second Job but not to make a career out of it because we don’t get paid enough for that I always had a great time working here with all the people and didn’t have a problem with them
good,"okay company to work for "
good,I loved working as an employee of the Kroger company. Great experience. Lots of great customers as well and lots of things to do. You never have any down time.
good,"Kroger was a great place to work as far as the associates were concerned.  Management was difficult to work with, which is the norm at the company.  No work/life balance."
good,"Low pay only minimum wage and four to six hours given a day, management was not around much to ensure operations of click list department are run smoothly, which lead to problems and stress of the job."
good,"This job was okay, I would still recommend though. Although my rating is low, it is due to the management they had at the time (which now has been replace)"
good,in the deli I just cut meats and cheeses for people who ask for them some days I run the stock on the floor and other I am just in cooler all day putt
good,Love management and workers.. But hours your on call so u have to have your phone on you.. It's Union they go by sinority.. All contracts are diff.. Hard to get full time positions...
good,"I'd work at Kroger again, if I could, because I believe the problems I had at my past work place can only be classified as one that would differ through out all Krogers."
good,"A typical day at Krogers is signing into your register and waiting on customers to put their groceries on the belt and start checking them out."
good,"We done the same thing everyday, waited on customers we also done deli trays and sandwiches for parties. We learned new things and we also helped in other areas of the store, mainly in the bakery."
good,4-8 hours a day but you are off more than you work. Not everyone is friendly that you work with. But its a fun job if you llove interacting with people
good,"Kroger is a good company to work for. Good salaries and compensation. Dress code is simple. Work/life balance is difficult since an emergency can happen at any time at the stores, but overall is a good place to build a career."
good,I made more as an hourly associate.  It is hard to come to work as a leader when the hourly associates are making more than you.  Also benefits cost 4x's what they did when I was hourly.
good,I loved working at this job. I enjoyed the public and the personnel at the store. I always tried to brighten everyone's day. If you are in a pharmacy chances are you don't feel good or spending time waiting.
good,Did not work for this company very long. I did enjoy cashiering.  They did not give me a lot of hours.  The managers were very friendly. I enjoyed meeting new people.
good,"Kroger was a good place to work, though they paid minimum wage. Managers tend to promote the employees they are good friends with rather than the ones who are working hard and doing well. Best part: Family feel with most fellow employees which made it seem less like work and more like a fun place you get paid to go to and see your friends. Worst part: Low pay, not very flexible about if you can only work certain schedules or if you need off (unless they have enough time to put someone else in your time slot)."
good,I enjoyed working at Kroger's the staff and my co-workers where excellent people individually and collectively. I knew what my day to day task where and enjoyed creating food that the customer as well as the employees loved
good,i had fun working here made alot of friends and it was easy work just have to watch your back sometimes cus people well say anything and do what they want just to get you in trouble
good,"It is a good productive place to work and grow, they provide training and opportunities to further your career. The pay is very good giving that the work isn't easy but just takes some getting use to."
good,Lack of advancement opportunities. Favoritism is used to choose candidates to advance to supervisory positions and to give opportunities to participate in special projects.
good,Waiting on customers. How to ring items faster. All of my coworkers were great.They were always there if you needed help.
good,"Management was not the best, associates were very childish. I kept to myself and completed my everyday tasks with interruption."
good,A typical night at kroger would be long and it would seem like there was more work than could be completed in one 8 hour shift
good,Working for in this department teaches a lot of responsibility and creates an environment where you can always learn something new.
good,I did not like the work environment. However the pay was great and they require a lot of hours. Great place to work otherwise.
good,"A typical day at work for me was managing and controlling the front end operations, such as cashiers, accounting, and customer service."
good,Very relaxed environment . besides dealing with crazy customers a typical at work would be best described as relaxing.
good,its awesome other than you need to be perfect or close to before you get in trouble and get laid off because you aren't  learning as fast as a robot can.
good,Mangement was poor. Other coworkers were great and reliable.
good,On a typical day at work i would check out customers while maintaining friendly conversation. I learned a lot about how to have friendly conversation with people of all kinds of attitudes. I would say that the management system was a little poor but not that bad. As any other normal job some coworkers were friendly and some were not. The hardest part of the job was trying to satisfy every single customer. Something that I enjoyed most about this job was meeting different people.
good,it is a ok place to work as a firts job during high school but after its a pain in the butt.
good,we stocked at night for shelves in the store.  that was my primary job
good,It was defiantly a team. Was nice to work with people that all had the same goal.  
good,"a typical day at work basically includes just filling in for whoever doesn't come in or wanna work. co-workers are awesome, the hardest part of the job is the fact theres no hours."
good,"It was a great place to work, the empployees were very friendly, I learned alot during my time there."
good,"I would go to work, depending on if I had to open or not I would get everything in tact for the day. The management, for the most part, was organized and effective but often times unprofessional. Co-workers, as well could be unprofessional but was often team oriented, not too many problems occurred between the co-workers. There wasn't really anything hard about the job besides the customers at times. Everything that had to do with Starbucks was easy to me, I didn't really find anything challenging about the job. I enjoyed putting different types of ingredients together and watching them take various colors and shapes. I learned that there is a lot more to coffee then what meets the eye or the tongue."
good,Help custoomers find there needs. I learned some people are hard to deal with. Mangement fair. Co-workers fair. The hard was finding things. I enjoyed freedom to roam
good,"Managers were great to speak with about issues, love working in customer service, and loved makeing customers happy"
good,"its easy and laid back and everyone was so friendly, just didnt work that many hours"
good,"The positions offered at Kroger are excellent for teens to learn responsibility and real world skills. There is not much room to advancement or promotion. However, they do hire within for higher positions first."
good,the company gives more to the Hispanics seems as though they advance more which is not fair over the years I've seen employees who could not speak english more up and get fulltime positions and these employees got hired after me
good,working at kroger was awesome pushing carts was the hard part about the job especially during the summer time plus im very small so it was harder on me
good,The budget is 300 you will not get payed over 300. The managers there are so rude I don’t like working at the Kroger’s I work at now. But Kroger’s is a good company judging off of the good things I done heard.
good,Kroger was fine and busy and excited because I saw different people and had a chance to meet new people. So when I be myself some people help me get a gift card from my manager.
good,"Good company to work for. Management sucked, lack of communication. Only hire part time workers. Excellent benefits. Turnover rate is very high. Most high school kids and college students."
good,I was happy to work at Kroger but some managers used favoritism. I would like to have been trained more for the jobs I worked. I ended up having a few issues because of lack of training
good,"Kroger was a fun place to work, meeting new people and being around great coworkers. Low hours did not meet my need for income. Low loyalty to workers was very concerning."
good,"Over all good place to work, just pay a little more. Management is over all good just changes way to often. No continuity with management need more time at a location."
good,a challenging work environment but not really rewarding. the company structure is also not very clear. not entirely sure what an individual needs to do to move to the next level.
good,Working at Kroger was great. Got to meet so many different people. Coworkers treated customers as family. If I ever got a chance to work there again I would.
good,Kroger Marketplace in Carrollton Georgia is a great part-time job for anyone wanting to test the waters in today’s work force. I worked at Kroger throughout high school. They work with my school and sports schedules.
good,"I was a cashier."
good,This job really taught me a lot about organization and time management. I enjoyed being able to help customers based on the skills that I learned while working here.
good,Working at the Kroger company was a fun experience and the people that work there was easy going and very understand. I really enjoyed the environment as the workers were very friendly and really helped each other as well as the customers at the same time.
good,"Over all was a great place to work but just no advancement, managers were great the culture was fair the hardest part about my job was leaving because I really enjoyed working there but just was not making enough money"
good,Slow work and minimum wage did not make this job fun. I did not have any fun and it was not worth pushing carts all day in the sun for 7.25 an hour...
good,"I accumulated a great customer base. I love helping customers. I love to see the look on their faces when they receive the best service possible. It was never a boring day at Kroger, however, it is very difficult to make any money until you reach a certain level and position within the company."
good,it was a very fun place to work had long days often still was a good place to work at and get to .             ....................................................
good,i loved working at kroger even though i was only part time no matter how much i asked for full time i was paid very poorly even though i worked full time hours but i did love working there and made lots of friends there i still go back to visit all the time
good,I worked 3rd shift in bakery. It was hard work. But time went by fast.  Made donuts and baked breads. Put everything out when I was done with everything.
good,"It was a retail job so it was always something new to do. Very energetic. I enjoyed working at Kroger while I did. Sadly, school started back and I was working too far from home."
good,"It seems my department is very, very chaotic at best. There are too many managers all trying to get everything done with too few people. I am one of two night shift workers, but the managers seem to believe that we should be doing the work of 5-7 people. The shortage seems to have been going on for a long time (at least several months) and has therefore made me nervous about future expectations with the company. There are workers there who are not doing much, but I fear they are holding their jobs only because they are the only ones who are there to do them."
good,"its a great place to work, a little on the stressful side, not enough time in the day to complete certain task but try my best to finish my job before its time to leave."
good,"My experience with the Kroger company was great. My store management could of been better, but overall, I loved working here, it was my first job and I will never forget it. My boss was the nicest, and I've meet great people through this company."
good,The job was so easy. The hours five a.m. Would be fine if I worked longer than four hours. After my probation period they still could not work with me.
good,"I loved working in the kiosk. The only thing I disliked was the lack of management interaction. A typical day considered of making transactions and ensuring that all pumps worked accurately. I loved my co workers enjoyed seeing them everyday. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers who didn't understand the point system, but once explained in detail how everything works angry turned into satisfaction."
good,"My experience with Kroger's was great until all good managers left.  But, started as a sticker within three months I made mentor of the front end. Experienced a lot of changes."
good,"Quality Food Center thus not appreciation there employees. They only care about there bonus check. The manager are not good leads.  "
good,"I loved working at picknsave because the people and the work was honest, the only bad thing was that scheduling was very difficult with new managers every few months"
good,Fun & productive workplace.  I ran the cash register & returned stock to the shelves.  Most of the co-workers were fun to work with.
good,I had to train to run the cash register. I grabbed carts and cleaned the floors and shelves. The managers were nice and respectful.
good,"I like working there but when I transferred my pay was dropped a whole $2.50. I would be happier if they pay was more and I worked more hours in the week. Its only 25-28 hours a week. "
good,waking up  to prepare food for hundreds of customers is exhausting but I have  fun experiences and friendly coworkers with great food and atmosphere
good,It was fun at work everyday. I learned how to communicate well with others. My managers gave me a hard time and were very mean. I enjoyed my co workers I still have conversations with them today. The hardest part about my job was working outside pushing baskets in the sun. The most enjoyable part was we got a discount on our groceries.
good,"Long work day in the receiving area. I learned a lot while I was there."
good,"I have had a great career working for the Kroger Company for the past 38.  I have advanced my career from cashier to store manager and managed a large variety and size stores.  Working with the employees and customers has been the most rewarding part of the job.  But after 38 years I am fully vested in my pension, I have raised my family and now I am looking for a new adventure."
good,"Assist customers with there Meat and Cheese Choices."
good,it was great place to work I loved the other employees and my job. however some of the management in my opinion should not have been management
good,"Verify out of date meat in the sales case.  Slice meat as needed per customers request.  Assist manager in filling the floor if needed.  Bake limited bread and cookies as needed.  Assist customers at the hot lunch bar and the cold salad bar.  Prepare salads as needed for the cold salad bar.  "
good,"a typical day of work would be to clock in report to supervisor for assignment and get started untill my shift is over, what i learned at kroger is how to work a cash register, how to work in the deli along with dairy and drug gm. The management we had is one manager and two assistant managers the assistant managers where nice and understanding the actual manger was rude and unapprecitaed he never congratulated good work he always just wanted to constantly nag trying to create a bad day for the employees. My co workers i loved them we bonded and helped eachother out we even use to do things after work such as bowling and out to eat. The hardest part of working at kroger would be having to deal with the manager, The most enjoyable part of the job would be my coworkes and the little conversations with the customers."
good,"Cashier, cleaning, good customer service. bagging food and ect. change the pricing of items, pulling items from the back to the front for the customer. also willing to learn new things"
good,"good place to work, good friends and managers take care of the employees so they get fair benefits and give even schedules to every body according to your needs"
good,I liked the work here but not enough money or hours to live on. 
good,it is a good place to work if you dont need much money...it is hard to get on full time with benefits but they were good to me and i tried to be good to and for them
good,Never worked at a kroger before ive been trying to do a applications and stuff so i can see how it goes but i would love to try kroger and see who i meet
good,"I really enjoyed my coworkers as well as my superiors in this company. It was a more of a ""hold yourself accountable"" workplace but still had measures to maintain employee standards"
good,"Great management, flexible hours, I would highly recommend to any new employee. Staff members were upbeat, positive, and helpful in difficult situations."
good,They prioritize in feeding the human spirit! They give to local food banks which is a great benefit our our community. They offer equal opportunities!
good,"The managers are really nice. They take our opinions into consideration, and I really like that.Dont Mind Helping You Learn other Departments In The Store."
good,"The job itself was good. I had no real big complaints until the last 2 or 3 months or working there when our store managers had all been replaced, most of them with people straight from corporate who simply didn't care about the people inside of the building and strictly cared about the rules."
good,It was a great experience to expand my communication skills with adults and people of my community. I learned a lot about the work field and gained many life skills
good,The pay was good and the workers are nice and understanding. Doing school work and having the job at kroger was not a good mix. They are flexible with times.
good,Kroger is always perfect with flexible work and opportunities. I do recommend anyone to this company. Teams are very collaborative and excellent management.
good,"Cleaned glass surfaces, including windows and doors, removing fingerprints and smudges."
good,it’s very busy around the holidays and the employees are nice.  mangers are very friendly when you get to know them and will always be there to help you
good,The work at Kroger can be hard and over working an employees to their breaking point.  There are many cut throats and conspirators that want to set up people and get them into trouble or fired.  I do not recommend this company very highly.  It may be a good place to shop but working there drains a person down very quickly and the stress level is extremely high.
good,I was a bagger so I went to grab carts out everyday I used to bag people items helping them take it out to there cars making sure customers our okay with their day at the end of the day
good,I was working good with other people and getting treated respectfully and I like that about people and they showed me some respect .... when they told me to do something I will get up and do it cause I am respectful to others like their respectful to me
good,I loved waking up and working at Starbucks but there some challenges learning all the drinks and making sure they where made right and always had to write what the drink was and keep up and that was the most hardest part but other the than that  i loved working here
good,A very quiet workplace but everyone is very helpful and willing to shape you the ropes if needed  I enjoy this work place and am looking forward to going back
good,Kroger is a family friendly store and everyone is kind and helpful. I am a people and I love working with them. There is always something to do and someone to talk to.
good,"Kroger was very welcoming. During my short term there I learn quite a few things, I would definitely work for them again. They offered great benefits."
good,"I loved working for this store and if I could I would still be working there. Management was wonderful, they are experienced and know how to handle any situation. Other team member are always very friendly and overall a very homey place to work."
good,Im a cashier and I learn a lot that I didn’t know how to do a cashier how to welcome people when they walk in. The enjoyable part of the job is meat department
good,"It was a great experience working at Kroger. They are really a team , never felt left out , help ful . Pushing carts was trying at times but it gets easier."
good,"great place to work, great boss, great people, I would recommend it to anybody who has no skills and really needs the work, it is a great starting point if you want to get into the grocery business or retail"
good,I liked working at Kroger because it was a nice job for me back in high school it helped me pay all my seniors dues the staff was good there. I liked how the company works staff get along with each other just fine nice place to work
good,"i Am a hard worker. I can work alone or in groups, it just depends on the circumstances. I can be a leader or part of a team. I like having a steady tasks."
good,It was fun and the staff was nice and organized. The workplace was helpful to a lot of folks that where older so i liked that the staff and store did care for the people who shop there.
good,"Kroger has some of the most nicest, respectful and understanding employees & managers. Employees as well as managers ertainly will help you in need Good experience to be apart off."
good,I learned a lot of many useful skills during my time here at the meat department. I smelled like fish when I got home so that was a bit frustrating. I proceeded to be able to  eventually train new employees and helping them even though I was younger
good,What I had to do was bagg people groceries I also cleaned up stuff like messes an bathrooms an pushed carts I liked it there but I had to move an lost the job it's really good place to work at though.
good,I'd rather have a bad day at work than have a bad day at home on the couch doing nothing. Working hard and doing it with a positive mindset pays off. Thank you.
good,The universe is created by two bread monsters battling it out for world domination sadly humans came along devoured them and now we own the world how's that for a review.
good,Fun and productive work place. Staff is super nice and helpful and always willing to teach you when you are unsure of something. Would definitely recommend this place to someone.
good,Great work atmosphere. Friendly staff. Location was good. Each day was a learning experience. I was taught how to run numerous departments. As well as back office work.
good,"Kroger is a great place to start your first career, it pays pretty well and you learn some things on the way. I had a great time working for my employer."
good,"Good benefits. They do drug and background checks. I moved all over that place in all my years there. I highly recommend the job. After high school, I got my son hired. He loves it."
good,The work team at QFC Kroger Stores had been very helpful both in supporting other employees and teaching the skills I need to perform at my job as a cashier.
good,"Great people to work with. I highly recommend this company. It’s fun, work is almost never dull. Big store so there’s lots of excitement. Also pretty organized and well kept so even if you don’t work in a Certain department you still know how to help a customer easily find their items."
good,It was a good job for a beginner out of High School because you also get tips from different people and you walk a lot outside store inside store never stay in one place.
good,Was an great experience shortly due to family issues but they gave me a chance and I appreciate it they were an family oriented type business loved the time I spent there
good,i loved my job and the people i worked with. it was a great place to work and the management team was amazing! Only thing i did not like was working night shift being 9 months pregnant and not really being able to take much of a break.
good,"Working at Kroger was fine. I had to wear the same uniform everyday, deal with customers, and stock shelves, like many who work in retail. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great."
good,"-Swept the floor every hour."
good,Lots of opportunities to move up. Employees are welcoming and helpful. The Kroger brand products are good and easy to sell for this stable nationwide company.
good,Don’t be late. Wear your uniform that they give you. You can leave on break if you live close to the store. Do what you have to do and there won’t be any problems
good,it was good working there i will tell others to work for this company i am trying to get my daughter a job there now the work was easy for me because i been doing this kind of work my whole life
good,it was very easy work. i worked as a cashier and floral and also the sales floor. i loved the employees that i worked with and the regular customers that came in.
good,I work here and I love working here . The pay just isn't enough for me and children to live off of . Other then that I can see myself working for this company for years to come.
good,It was a good place to work. I received paid time off and they were understanding of my schedule and worked with me. Overall I recommend working at Kroger.
good,Everyone is friendly and helpful and they never leave anyone out. If you don't understand something they will explain it to you so that you do. And if anyone needs help they will help because it helps to move thing along.
good,I was a courtesy clerk at Kroger for about 11 months then I quit because I was working two jobs if the time and I felt that the supervisor was treating me unfairly
good,"Good work opportunities ,facilities of fast learning in different types and areas."
good,I learned alot of new things. How to handle upset customers. How to handle situations calmly & the right way. I learned that a work place is for everyone & All associates are a team!
good,It's a good place to work. My only problem was not getting consistent hours. I really enjoyed my time there. They are flexible when it comes to working around other commitments. I would not recommend the courtesy clerk position if you have issues with heavy lifting and cart collecting
good,Kroger puts their customer's first and it shows.  They take the time to listen to customer feedback and implement the correct changes to adapt to the evolving needs and wants of their shoppers.
good,There’s ways to grow in the company. My team at Kroger pharmacy was great. They helped me realize i belong in the pharmacy world and that i want to work on applying for pharmacy school. They’re flexible with hours too.
good,"it was a great experience. the people are very nice and friendly. the manager is especially nice. they train well, respect and don't rush you or feel un-welcomed."
good,Good place to work with friendly co-workers and management. Good benefits and relaxed environment. I loved working there.     I'd go back to work there
good,Very much enjoy working at Kroger. The people are outstanding and work well with management. Do the job learn as much as possible about the job and all will go well.
good,I like everyone over that place because they are as a family .They were respectful employees and I can’t forget my supervisor who was a gentleman and I really like to treat with him .
good,"I literally have been working for this job since I was in high school and all throughout college. It has most definitely taught me how to work independently but also work as a team, I have loved my first job! Super flexible, super understanding of students really weird schedules and my store 694 was just AWESOME!! :)"
good,"Great and friendly company to work for. Love the customers and other workers. If I wanted to stay in the grocery business, Kroger would've been highly recommended."
good,"A typical work day consisted of pushing carts, bagging groceries, and sweeping the store. It was slower paced with sweeping and cart pushing with faster paced bagging. I learned how to be faster and friendlier and more productive. The management made you feel welcome as a worker and as a customer. They made it feel less like work more like having fun while collecting a pay check. The workplace was clean and friendly, everyone had a smile and were willing to help their customers and coworkers. There was at least two daily meetings where management went over workers who were recognized by the customers for good service. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the carts. It was satisfying to work there and it was fun to help many customers. The competitive part of the work place made workers strive for improvement to get their rewards and recognition for their great work."
good,Kroger is a good working job and is very relaxed I would recommend anyone to work at Kroger’s it’s an fun environment to be around an enjoy working this is the best job
good,"i loved working here its family oriented they are very welcoming my department is clicklist and i love it,the only issue is they love cutting hours which i hate"
good,"Enjoyed the variety of tasks.  Allowed to work independently with minimal oversight,  Opportunities for advancement, tuition-reimbursement, excellent training."
good,"Overall I like the job because I like being a cashier of course but I did not get along with the manger to well but the work there is easy you do stock, retail, & you have to have good customer service"
good,"Fast-paced, smooth flowing workplace. Friendly environment with team building associates. Exceptional management that recognized hard work. Lovely place to work."
good,At any kroger stores there is always something to keep you busy. Even if it is just cleaning. Their is a lot of interaction with customers always be very professional even if you are having a bad day.
good,This job was very fast paced every order had to be done by a certain time . My Coworkers were fun to work with and you managers will also work with you.
good,I loved working at Kroger-Stores because all the employees was so nice & friendly. I liked working at self checkout because you had to do a lot of moving.
good,It's a job that is physical hard working heavy lifting n be bending but it pays well. U have friendly employees etc. Gotta be experienced operating a walkie rider pallet jack as well
good,The benefits are great. The atmosphere is fast paced only in an emergency. As long as your assigned stores are kept in good shape (and they do check that) it is a relaxed place to work.
good,"I would have never left if I had a choice, but family comes first. The people here are amazing and my manager was the coolest guy I have ever worked for. the pay is fair for the area and they work to help you move up."
good,"Very relaxed and supportive work environment. All the employees are friendly. Our store feels like one big family.  There is always a lot to do in the bakery, and I stay busy. Its basically the same general tasks each day. Lots of production, stocking, and cleaning. So long as you complete all your work, this job is great. Lots of room for advancement or cross-training. Pay based on experience, benefits for full-time, plenty of hours available. My only critique is that the schedule often changes because of call-outs."
good,I loved being a cake decorator at Kroger! I would recommend anyone to work at Kroger. They have great benefits. They give back to the community. Raise money for Charity's. They have great positive vibes. All in all its a fun great place to work.
good,"At Kroger I was a cashier most of the day , assisting customers with their daily coupons and scanning of groceries , also. Helping with any problem that was needed"
good,"If you've heard not had a good work environment before, be prepared to be happily promoted to one of the best places to work. The managers Kroger hires are the top Escalon of the business management field who genuine care about life at and outside of work for their employees. Online scheduling is very user friendly. The work load has clear expectations and a primarily people-centric environment. Working at Kroger was probably the best part-time experience I have ever had."
good,"Depending on the department you work in (I work in the pharmacy), it can generally get pretty busy during the weekdays and slower on weekends. The company provides a multitude of opportunities to further skills and improve every day work with things like surveys and classes. Management is friendly and professional, and as helpful as they can be. People are friends with each other in all departments, and there's not much drama."
good,"Professional telephone demeanor"
good,"Simply fantastic, everyone always treated me with respect and recognize employees' skill sets. Plenty of opportunity to advance and work hours if you want to (at least at my location)"
good,For stocking daily all depends on trucks coming in and how much stocking needs to be done that day. I have learned quite a bit while working there. The management is better than some stores and sometimes more than one manager on duty. The hardest part would have to be when holidays come and there is more than usual to do. The most enjoyable would have to be when people are willing to help you when needed.
good,great starting job to kickoff a young individuals life of responsibility and shows them how the working system works and prepares them for future employment
good,"My typical day at work was to gather carts and provide quality customer service"
good,A typical day consists of High paced work and when you are told to do something you do it as fast as well as efficiently. There are also plenty of ways to benefit everyone if you are also kind and well mannered.
good,One of my first real jobs. I really enjoyed the training and easy transition. I was also able to advance and grow quickly within the company and stayed loyal & committed all while balancing school and a second job.
good,"Kroger's workplace atmosphere is professional, but at the same time friendly and welcoming. The most stressful part of the job is just making sure you're doing your job right. It was an amazing first job experience."
good,"It was a fun place to work, to date it is the best job I have ever had.  The coworkers were friendly, and they didn't expect too much out of you for the pay.  It was a union job."
good,They could work on better pay. I enjoyed my job but the pay for what they had me doing wasn’t fair. I never got my raises that I was told I would be getting
good,it can be very stressful at times. There is always poor mangement in the deli area and to be honest we do most of the work the deli mangers only work when people higher or in the store
good,30+ years in retail and this company was great to work for and they treat their people professionally and give them the tools to be successful.  I was very happy with my time at Kroger
good,I loved working there as a cashier and talking to different people.  All coworkers were friendly its not gonna be a place you are going to make enough to pay all your bills so its really good for us students and retirees or people  who have a spouse making more money.
good,It was a great working experience. I enjoyed my time working at Kroger. My co-workers were enjoyable.  I was definitely happy to be there the time I was there.
good,Kroger is great to work for. They are good about working with your schedule. The work is not too demanding. Be prepared to stand on your feet for 6-9 hours.
good,"Helped people with seafood orders, cleaned area so food can be packaged and served, also unpacked seafood, and helped coworkers with task like cleaning the kitchen"
good,"From the customers to the managers, everyone was friendly and easy to get along with. There were times where the store would be slow-paced, but for the most part Kroger was a pretty busy place but fun at the same time."
good,"I only worked at Krogers for a short time.  I had to quit due to my husband became ill and I am his only care giver."
good,"I did not want to resign but did out of necessity.  Was not overly.fond of not being able to wait on customers on a regular basis, unless i was required to stay padt 8:00 Am."
good,"I have worked for the company for just under two years.  I was considered the store managers ""right hand man"" and am tasked with multiple jobs within the store. I have worked just about every department besides meat/seafood and service desk. I work very hard and feel that I will not have the opportunity for advancement. I am paid well below what I should be for the amount and type of work I do for the store.  I very very rarely have a call in and I am always on time. I do every task asked of me and do it in a timely and professional manor and feel unappreciated for what I do.  I have been trying to get into a lead position in a few departments and have been overlooked due to not wanting to be ""trained from scratch"".  I love the job I do and the hours allows me proper time with my family, however I feel that I am not being given the opportunity to utilize my full potential within the company."
good,"retail 101 focused on great customer service and in-stock for best shopping experinece, CEO didnt come up thru the ranks and was a college guru that thinks everything is his way,doesn't consider the workers point of view."
good,"punch in at the time clock by bio metrics"
good,Was a good place to work workers really were never on the same page in between shifts bur work still got done . Workers did come together to get job done for the customers.
good,"Processing payments, greeting and assisting customers, answering questions, selling products, and stocking shelves. supper fun to do when bored at home"
good,Its a good growing company. Each individual store is unique to the area in regards to the customers they serve and the type of co-workers you work with.
good,Great and exciting place to work.  They respect their employees and treat them fairly.  Thoroughly have enjoyed all of my time with this company.  I would stay with the company as long as the opportunity was still available in my current location.
good,Busy. A good position for a person who is able to be on their feet all day. Needs to like talking with people all day every day. Methodical. They push you to be constantly at your best
good,It was stressful sometimes. Sometimes the managers weren’t nice to the employees. There was a lot of underhanded things going on at Kroger with managers and some employees.
good,"I enjoyed the customer experience, bagging, helping people, and interacting with individuals. Pushing carts qas quite easy and did not cause much strain, all around good place."
good,My formal job gives me the opportunity to have a positive impact on people’s lives and make a difference every day. I go home and I know I made a real difference. I aspire to inspire people and I am actually doing this
good,"Procured grocery orders for 3 buyers. Make appointments for said buyers customer service. I enjoyed learning of new food products, my job was not physical it was more a learning job"
good,Fun and positive environment. Smiling is a must and it really improves the work environment and keeps things in a better light. It also eliminates and anger in the work environment and helps with better work flow.
good,"I worked in the store then was moved to the fuel center which I enjoyed very much.  The most enjoyable part of my job was assisting customers by taking their payment, helping with their credit card at pump, etc."

good,"Kroger was my first job so I can't compare it to too many other places. As a Courtesy Clerk, or more accurately a bagger, it wasn't too bad. It could be extremely boring and tedious at times due to the repetition of it. I spent most of my days trying to find things to keep my mind off of it, I was usually hoping for a spill or to bring in a couple carts. The thing that helped with the repetition and boredom was my co-workers. During my time as a courtesy clerk I have made friendships that have lasted longer than my time with Kroger. "

good,"My opinion of a typical day of work. Is coming into to work with a positive attitude, with a work ready attitude. Coming in ready to get the job done as you were hired to do and to make yourself, management, and customers happy! Working in retail/customer service, I learned that things are not always easy and no matter how hard it gets, to keep pushing and things will eventually get better because hard work pays off. I also learned when your job is done and you do everything your managers ask you do, it makes things much easier on you and also prove to them that you are dependable and a hardworker. I love working with people who has the same mind frame as me or better because together the job gets done. great minds think alike, when one coworker do they part, its easier on the other. The hardest part of working is not getting things done, it dissappointments me when I could do more to help the company and could've accomplished more, and that's why I come to work, work ready. The most enjoyable things is knowing you did all you could to help out the company and making, yourself, management and the customers proud."

Some good, some not good - remembering Mr. Mariano's way - our customers will always be number one - but I have always treated people like I want to be treated - so it comes very easy to me. A smile goes a long way. I have a great upper management and field team. Working with the young front end associates remind me that there is still good in the youth and much yet to be done. I only wish that I could make each and every customer one hundred percent satisfied - however that is truly out of my control and I understand that and I'm ok with that."
good,"This was my first job, so I don't really have anything bad to say.. I will say that they do hire with no experience."

Being able to recognize our regulars and have there order ready and just pick up right where we left off last visit. My co-workers were amazing we learned from one another and built a strong foundation with each other and with our customers. The hardest part of my job I must say is being the youngest assistant manager and having to manage employs older than me because at the time I had just started but I quickly gained there trust with my hard and dedicated work ethics. I can honestly say I truly  enjoyed every aspect of this job."
good,The most enjoyable part of working at Kroger is that the company is like a big family and so were the customers. The longer I worked there it seemed that the customers made my job more enjoyable by being able to help them.
good,Great team to work with and flexible hours concerning family.  Employee benefits result in savings for the pantry to gas in the car.
good,The pharmacists were truly willing to help people and they all worked well together.

good,"I was a cashier so a typical day for me was to clock in and get to my register until i left at the end of the day. I learned how to count drawers and to use a register. The management changed quite a bit while i worked fro Kroger so it was hard to get to know them very well. I did however enjoy most of our management. My co workers were people I went to school with so it was like working with my friends most of the time and it made the job more enjoyable. The hardest part of my job was trying to remember the sales and prices on many of our popular products so i could help customers quickly without having to call for price checks and assistance. I enjoyed getting to know customers here as well, given that the store was large i did not get to know them on a personal level as I did when I worked for Tractor Supply. It's always nice knowing you make such an impact during a 3 minute transaction that the customer wants to return to you every time they come to the store."

good,I have thought kroger was an excellent work experience.  If you were willing to put in the time and learn they were more than willing to accommodate your hours to the best of the ability that they could.  The discount was also nice for buying personal groceries as well as saving on gas money.  The negatives were not enough for me to not recommend the company to anyone who is looking to get their foot in the door in the retail industry

Far as if anyone had any problems, questions, or any concerns.  The meeting usually last for ten minutes, then I'll send them back to work until their shift is over.  Thru out the day I'm stocking product to the shelf, helping customers to find certain items in the store, and two hours before my shift is over I do a product order to full the space on the shelf and order any special items a customer wants me to order for them.  What I learned working at Kroger is there are good days and bad days.  Far as getting my work done before my shift ends is a good day for me, but when I'm not able to finish my work because of time then I have extra work for me to finish the next day, that's a bad day for me.  But I always make sure thru out the week I have more good then bad days.

I was an assistant manager, which required me to keep an eye on how much product we were ordering (to ensure sufficiency but not overstock). I helped cook food, make party trays, set up promotions and special events, delegate tasks to employees for efficiency, and above all, provide excellent customer service. The managers that I worked with were great. They all assisted me whenever I needed it, and helped shape my skills as management, The hardest thing, I would say, would be the holidays when everything was very busy. When there was a large crowd all wanting to be served at the same time, we would help entertain them as they wait, converse and get to know our customers. I believe they really appreciated that as well. I know, that I certainly did! Having our customers leaving happy that they received above and beyond service was a great and rewarding feeling."

I don't see much of my co-workers since I am usually gone before the rest of the bakery/deli associates arrive for work.

It is peaceful not to have to deal with people who have bad tempers or people who are unwilling to cooperate with you however I would much rather talk and see people than be alone at night.

good,"Work days included setting up the bakery area, taking count, removing out-dated product, arranging orders for the day, beginning production, taking new orders with attention to detail, inventory, ensuring proper seasonal and ""grab and go"" product availability, assisting in the deli, food safety protocols. I learned a lot about how Kroger operated as a company, the execution of the ideals was really dependent on the management though. Where managers were positive and motivated to keep employees happy as well as customers, the goals of employee advancement seemed well within reach. Where managers were not, employees were demotivated, unenthusiastic, and lacked any optimism. This seemed to exemplify the idea that leadership will determine the productivity and attitude of the employee."

good,"Kroger took me on as a pharmacy technician with no experience.  I have now worked for the company for over 6 years, and I feel its time to move on.  My next step in life is to work at a hospital.  "
good,I loved seeing my regular customers come in. I also enjoyed seeing what all people bought. The best part about being a cashier was trying to get the fastest time in scanning. 
good,"Since I've worked at Pick 'n Save for four years, I am trained in a handful of the departments. A typical day for me is usually at the service desk, however I may get swapped with a different employee to work in a different department. I may cover for an individual that is working in liquor inorder for them to take their break. During the day I'll deal with: lottery sales, returns to the store, count down drawers, give loans out to the cashiers if they need money in their drawer, answer any questions the customers may have, assist cashiers with any questions they may have and overall do my work with a smile on my face. My most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help people out and see them leave with a smile on their face. Whenever I see that, I know they're satisfied and happy with their experience. One of the hardest parts of my job is when I get customers that are difficult. Whether they think a cashier has an attitude with them, coupon problems, or any issues they may have while in the grocery store. When they approach me with an attitude it's my job to fix things so that they'll leave the store satisfied and wanting to come back. Sometimes customers attitudes can be over the top, but I deal with it by being extremely kind and assuring them that I'm there to help. The management at the company has always treated me extremely well. They've been flexible with my schedule, time off and helpful with any questions I may have. "
good,I enjoyed working the register. Had a wonderful work experience with them.
good,"Kroger is a great company to work for. We get customers from all different backgrounds, and I love that about my job. I get to interact with a lot of people and learn things about everyone's life. I love talking to the elderly customers because they are wise and very funny! The hardest part about my job is when someone doesn't seem very happy, but I like to try and cheer them up. The management team is very helpful and organized. "
good,I ran a register. The customers made my job. My co-workers were helpful.
good,helping customers..weighing meat.sanitation. Cleaning spills.greeting customers.
good,"Friendly Co-workers with a great opportunity to grow. A typical day at work is to work close with project managers on different stores planning for expansions, remodels, or new stores."
good,I had never been offered the opportunity to work with flowers.  I learned a lot just in the short time I was there.
good,I worked here as a customer service rep in the plant nursery providing interested customers with the information that they requested about various products.
good,working in the floral department was a good and challenging job 
good,As i spent most of my adult life in this company they taught me how to assert myself when working with customers. All the management is very knowledgeable in the grocery business.
good,I love working for Kroger.Its a great company to work for.Each day is filled with something new and exciting
good,I loved working here because not only was the customers friendly but so was the staff.Working there as the baker i felt needed and it was a great way to start off any work day.
good,"Fast pace, have to get products on the shelves for the day as fast a possible, employees began to quit so I had gotten thrown in a position that I was very unfamiliar with. Training was short and the manager did not seem to have time to help me. So my productivity went down. But aside from that the customer kept me with a smile."
good,"my first job in high school. an enjoyable place to work, advance and learn multiple skills."
good,pushed carts most of the time no real chance of advancement because all of my hard work went un-noticed due to the fact that I was rarely inside of the store and always outside of it pushing carts.
good,co-workers was nice and friendly the was pretty cool i learned all types of things 
good,"I had the opportunity to serve others with customer service every day, while also working as a team with other cashiers/supervisors."
good,"A typical day at work is fun and exciting. I learned that even though Kroger is a team it takes great individuals to make that team work. Management just does their job and you can't do nothing, but respect that. My co-workers are like my family if one person can't complete a task we ALL didn't complete it. The hardest part of the job is knowing that your team aren't doing the best that they can do so you end up doing more than expected of you. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing once I start working with a smile, I know I've made someones day just a little bit better."
good,"Working for fry's has been an awesome experience, I enjoy it, management is great and co-workers well they have their good and bad days. "
good,I had great pay here. People were amazing to work with and the hours were great.

good,The most enjoyable part of my job here was helping the customers with anything they needed help with.
good,"No two days are the same with the wide range of customers we have.I have learned a lot in the 8 1/2 years I have worked here.The managers and co-workers are great,we are like one big family. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers."
good,I learned many customer service skills over the past 9 years.
good,"My days at work are fast paced. I learn everyday, but it is things that are repeated continuously. I feel that the amount of pay I receive every week is not adequate and fair, for the amount of time, hard work and effort I put in, in the time that I am at work. I enjoy some of my co-workers, although I wish that some knew the definition of ""teamwork."""
good,"This job is an excellent one for transitioning students/young adults. It was a great starter job. It introduced me to the ""working life"". I enjoyed my coworkers and the managers were friendly most of the time."
good,This was a very diverse learning experience since graduating collage and travel upon graduating.
good,"This is what I did every day that I worked. I will start out waiting on Customers. Then I would clean and still wait on customers. What I learned about my job is that you had to do more then 1 thing at a time to get it all done. The management was great to work with.The co-workers was great to work with.The hardest part of the job was, when I got a list of stuff to do on top of what I already have to do before the end of my shift. Working with the best co-workers that helped each other get there stuff done."
good,Learned so much there the people just amazing to be arouned.
good,"I worked between 35-40 hours a week. I LOVED this job. The store was so busy all the time that i was busy all the time. I had great managers and co-workers, for the most part. It was hard sometimes because i worked with a lot of high schoolers and they were extrememly lazy so picking up their slack was not fun. I also liked this because i cant work somewhere that there is a lot of down time."
good,Got to meet alot of people while interacting with customers.
good,"well it was night shift and we used to get there before the store closes and we star bringing the grocery loads to the floor break them down ,spot them in the aisles and stock everything into the shelfs,clean and condition..management was ok.. my coworker where ok.the hardest part of the job was that they will keep you in one shift aslong as they want you wont change shift.easely.and the most enjoyable part of the job.. helping costumers to get what they need"
good,Very good place to start off your career. A lot of customer service experience involved with this job.
good,"My day on the job is to first punch in then we unload trucks full of groceries. Normally 4-5 people worked a night and it was always fast paced. My co-workers were very helpful. When i was new starting out, they showed me all the details on how to go really fast. Hardest part of the job was to stay going fast when you were tired. Enjoyable part was knowing my co-workers and I finished the job and stocked every grocery that was given to us."
good,A typical day at Kroger lasts 4-8 hours. There is constant movement and never a moment to be idle. I learned the trade of meat and seafood manager. Co-workers are good and most easy to work with. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with orders and monitoring shrink. The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to make customers happy and learn a trade.
good,"co workers were a blast to work with, customer interaction was great , always a fun day at work"
good,everyone is super nice and helpful with training and everything else.

good,really loved working here the manager are nice and understanding and the atmosphere is a nice place to work
good,"A typical work day starts with a smile and customer service, from there I clean my station and begin servicing customers with a speedy sufficient check out. On a daily basis, I learn more about the wants, needs, and value of the everyday consumer. I credit the management staff for the overall success of the store and my co-workers for there determination to get any and every task done. The hardest part about my job is directing people to registers when the store is over crowded, but what I enjoy most is the satisfaction of getting the job done."
good,"i work in a bakery. as a bakery associate i am responsible for making and packaging pies, cookies, bread, bagels, and cakes. in this job i have learned that making the extra effort in customer communication can make all the difference. the hardest part of the job, for me, is perfecting my writing on cakes. the most enjoyable part of my job is working with customers."
good,"Working there was wonder. pay was great, hours were amazing. Really miss it"
good,"I went to Kroger for a summer job and had a great experience as a cashier. They had a very nice group of people working there and the managers really helped me out when I was first getting started. A typical day was coming in and immediately getting on a register and checking out customers. You are expected to scan at a certain speed and to be polite to customers, which is easy as most of them are very nice. Front-end managers would help you if a customer had a complaint. The baggers and other cashiers were very friendly. The hardest part of the job can be standing for the entire duration. There are mats to help, but your feet can still hurt if you get 2 long shifts one day after the other. Although most customers are nice, you definitely are going to get some people who are unreasonable and unable to be pleased. The best part of the job is getting to know people over time. Eventually I had customers who would come to my line specifically just so we could talk while I was checking out their groceries. I would recommend this job to others."
good,I worked there as a tech . The shop management only wanted money they ripped customers of bye lying to them about what there car needed done to it
good,"I would scan grocerys, handle cash, clean register, and restock shelves. I learn how to deal with customers. My co-workers were awesome. I loved every moment working at Krogers."
good,They are reasonable with scheduling around my classes. My previous experiences are considered to determine the starting wage. My current wage is great for a part time job. The people I work with are very friendly. My manager is very reasonable and works hard to be fair with all employees.
good,their stafff gave me a chance to challenge myself at a position I knew nothing of and helped me every step of the way to better my job
good,"Structured,motivating team spirit, enjoyed working for this co. Overall, co worker were great!!!"
good,"Come in to things in order I learned how to run a cash register,do money orders,and coinstar,my boss was a great teacher and easy to talk to,my co-workers never made me feel like the new girl always willing to lend a hand,afraid I would mess up,meeting new people everyday and hearing my customers give me compliments daily"
good,fun job i love the people i worked with day goes smooth the hardest thing was stacking bins at night time. after a few days i was the best at it. management was great i learned how to clean and fix alot at kroger.
good,Part time job
good,this was a very good place to work at... there was a bunch of team work. the whole front desk was a big team and usually not just let one person fall
good,"I would clean bathrooms, bag groceries, do carry outs, face products, wash aisles down, and of course, help the customers in anyway possible. I really enjoyed working in a supermarket, it was very welcoming and for the most part, days of work would just fly by."
good,"A typical day at work, especially on football Sunday's were very fast paced. Customers would come in asking for several different types of lunch meats and cheese's in large amounts and I was able to get it done quickly and correctly. My co-workers were always there to help. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is that I was constantly doing something, I was never bored and it made the day enjoyable and go by fast.."

good,*Working at kroger is very hands on.
good,Kroger has very good benefits and Managers are very concerned for everyone's well being.
good,ok but management is not so good
good,"I was only here for a temporary assignment and I didnt want to leave, once my assignment was over i was asked to go online and fill out an application so that I could work there permenantly but I resigned de to pregnancy. I enjoyed working with my old co-workers, and the hardest part of the job was going home. I didnt want to leave. I enjoyed every task that was given."
good,"Good company to work for, organized an flexible. The hours are short but the customer base is well established."

good,Kroger is a good place to work for young and older adults. Hardest part of job was knowing were all the different food items are located in the store. Sometimes it would be very busy if other employees didn't show up to work.
good,"I learned a lot working as a Pharmacy Technician, my co- workers were friendly and everyone worked well together. The hardest part of being a Pharmacy Tech. was witnessing people who couldn't afford their Medications and therefore go without. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting customers."
good,My coworkers were great and I learned a lot about being in the bakery. I also applied my customer service skills as far as serving the customers and I picked up a skill as far as decorating cakes are concerned. My manager was also great to me. I learned a lot from him.
good,Krogers was the best job ever I learned alot of things in particular to do with retail.My co workers were the best always cheerful and happy which boost people spirits and energy.It wasnt an hard part for the job.The most enjoyable part of the job was being around the customers and coworkers they made my experience wih krogers worth while . Would I go back and work for them yes I would and I wouldnt have to think twice or hesitate about it
good,"I worked in the evenings/nights. I learned about various serices/duties that the store offered to be done. I wasn't a manager. My co-workers were pleasant, had a sense of humor, and were a joy to be around and talk to. Fuel center. The front desk-handling the various services that the store offered."
good,"A typical day at work would be to balance the registers, manage employee breaks, assign registers to employees, handle customer complaints as needed, perform Western Union transactions, fax paperwork to the corporate office, assist management when needed, cash checks, answer phones, close the store, and pull reports. I learned how to use needed programs, how to balance registers and safe, and how to fill out deposits. The management was great. They helped out the employees and are supportive. The most enjoyable part of the job was the learning experience and the great support of customers and co-workers"
good,Meet great people everyday. Mangement was good. Co workers were like family. Rude customers was the hardest part. I enjoyed building relationships with co workers and customers.

good,"I want to work here again. I enjoyed the work I did. U-scan was my favorite, but I wish I could have done more."
good,"I started working for Kroger when I was 16yrs old and I been there for about 5yrs. Working for such a major grocery store really developed some of the skills I can still remember today, and it also showed me how the retail world works as far as how a grocery store is ran. If it wasn't for me moving to Alabama, I would've become the youngest store manager in the company's history."
good,working at kroger gave me a great start leaning everything i needed to know at a young age to get me started in life a woderfull experiance to lead me to better and more experiance's in life they gave me the tools i needed kroger was a great place to work i rate this company a ten to work for.
good,Loved Working Here The Customers Are excellent And They All Remember Who You Are
good,"It's a experience that if you are looking to work, this OS the qk fast job to come aboard ... The pay is not that great, bit it helps pay the bills. Overall, its ok."

good,"Although the hiring process was a little long , once I got hired I enjoyed working there a lot , the mangers were all super cool and very nice, they cared so it showed"
good,Had a wonderful time working there very flexible and kind people. Very forgiving in issues that may occur and opportunity to branch out is possible which is nice.
good,kroger management has recently put a new management team in place and so far i am very happy with them.  Previous store manager was not effective at all and what i heard is previous manager was moved to different store due to union issues and lack of growth
good,I have learned a lot working at a grocery store. I liked working up front with the customers. I also enjoyed stocking the most and bagging that’s where I felt the most comfortable in my position
good,Working with Kroger was overall to me one of the best decisions I've ever made. I wish to have more opportunities to come about just like it again in the near future.
good,It's not that hard to work at Kroger. The culture there is really great. There's nothing hard about the job. Most enjoyable is meeting new people.. etc
good,"really good people and environment, very relaxed and understanding people to work for. they have a great crew and care for the community, very goal orient"
good,It was a great place the people management were very friendly and nice. I just didn’t feel protected there. Other than that it was a descent place to work at
good,I really enjoyed my time at krogers. we never had any down time always had stuff to do. they only thing I did not like was how management took care of employee problems. I also was harassed for a year and a half I was there until they fired the guy. but I wont put that on all krogers because I worked at a very small store and each store is ran differently
good,I enjoyed working at Krogers as an Pharmacy tech. The people was friendly my hours was flexible which I needed because I was still in school. Did have to go out for lunch because what you needed was there
good,The pay was great . They worked with your schedule. They don’t have a point system . You get discount on food and etc. They have a union you can join and it’s well worth it .
good,"Overall it is a good company. I got hired in Chicago, was there for 14 years before I moved to Ohio and transferred to Kroger which is the mother company."
good,"Kroger was a fast paced environment, where every team member worked together to get through the day and feel accomplished. Another big part of the job was satisfying customers needs and insuring they got what they needed."
good,"Dont leave much time for families was taken care of dad with dementia, and also a three-month-old wife was off on maternity leave. They did not have any understanding on why I was late"
good,"All aspects of job depend on what store you work at. If you are working in the pharmacy, I highly suggest asking a lot of questions about what is expected of you, because there is so much to do sometimes managers forget to list everything"
good,"Productive, laid back, but serious about our jobs. We were a family. Wore uniforms and hair nets. We had several departments, we had a snack, bread and bun, and cookie and cracker department. Our products were comparable with named brands, but cost less. It was the type of job to retire from, with it's great pay and benefits, and low stress."
good,Very laid back place to work and the people were very nice and fun to work with. They worked around my school schedule and cross trained me in many different departments.
good,"All jobs has its ups and downs. I really recommend this company it has great benefits, you meet nice people. The pay is nice you do have to join the Uion and dues come out you check weekly"
good,"Its a cool job but feel like it isn't for everybody. it has its days, but on the holidays they do feed you. this job she b for high schoolers, not if you really trying to get your life together, but overall its a good company to work for."
good,"I love working with Kroger, the customers were very nice and polite. I had no problems working there at all. I loved working with my co workers. We all got along very well and supervisors and managers. It is an fast paste work, which I do love to work steady. I like to work morning hours and evening and those hours were convenient for me to work. I could always put in the hours I needed each week to be able to go to doctors appointments. I enjoyed the working as a cashier and also as an supervisor. We would have to lift some heavy items, like, cases of water or sodas, but the most important thing of it all was meeting knew people and being able to help the elderly and the customers with any needs that  they may have. I would go out of my way to satisfy my customers!"
good,"decent first job , low hours weekly pay , teaches you how to work in teams , and how to get things done in a timely manner. Workers do take advantage of the union so thiers a lot of lazy people their as well."
good,"fast paced, some customers annoying, management can be unorganized sometimes. good pay for what you have to do. customers will complain  lot though which is frustrating"
good,not enough hrs to live off of. only get between 13 and 25. Cannot stay in a job for that many hrs. Got too many bills to pay and other departments are the same amount of hrs
good,Kroger is a good job for teens looking to start working early. The weekly pay is convenient. Hours are good if you show that you're serious about your work. Workers under the same work title are allowed to switch shifts if they are scheduled on an inconvenient day.
good,"I've worked for the company for quite a long time, and while I like it a lot and it offers a lot to me, it is pretty hard to advance further. I would personally like to climb the ladder, but if there's no spots available, they won't let you."
good,itt was a ok place to work I like my customers and my co workers and I like that we got pay every week and we get time off with pay....the customers where nice and friendly...and I only work on Mondays Tuesdays Wednesdays Thursday and Fridays ...I work no weekends .. and the store was nice and clean to work at and some of the mangers was nice to work with
good,Enjoyed my time at Kroger. Great fast paced work environment. Great 401k benefit's. Unionized also. Which was a big plus. Good opportunities for advancement.
good,loved seeing and meeting new people everyday. you meet all kinds of different people. staff and managers were friendly. made quiet a few friends.always passed out samples
good,"I worked alone in the fuel center, most of the time it was pretty slow with a lot of downtime to do the small tasks that were supposed to be done weekly. Being able to help the customers with questions and purchases was also enjoyable."
good,I love how the Kroger company offers the 401k plan to their employees! Also if you want to pick up hours if your lacking the company allows you to pick up hours!
good,You are allowed to do your job with little interference from management.  I was able to meet and help a variety of people and learned to deal with people from a variety of cultures.
good,"don't have much to say, I want to be with a company in which I can grown in. Kroger is a great company everyone here is like family I'm 22 years old I have a bright future and a lot of good new a head of me."
good,The employees are friendly and easy to work with. the management is knowledgeable and friendly. The deli is fast paced and busy with many things to do.I was never bored at work.
good,Kroger was a great start for me at 30 I would work at Kroger again it was relaxed and perfect until I wanted more like going to school but overall it's a good job
good,Kroger was a good place to work. I was expecting more hours than received. I would recommend this job   You do receive a discount on Kroger brand foods.
good,The pay is definitely not what it should be for this job. This job requires working in extreme cold and hot temperatures outside bringing in carts from the parking lot.
good,Kroger has great internal programs to promote high moral.  They train and provide support no matter the job title.  Benefits are good but the pay is lower than the local average.  I am a member of the safety team as well as the Our Promise team.  Kroger has periodic bbqs and employee appreciation events.  They have themed dress code days that are fun and help to build positive moral among the employees.  I am hoping to be promoted within the company but I am open to positions outside the company
good,I had less hours on a daily basis and It was nice understanding the culture of a grocery stores and how it's been operated. The management was Okay by dealing with workers
good,"schedule was not handled as well as it could have been, leaving us understaffed at times with the most activity, hours cut so break work not required or just not given"
good,I loved working there for the time being. there were many great people staff and great places to lean a shoulder on. I would recommend working at a frys as it has great people.
good,"I worked as a courtesy clerk the responsibly was to handle basket outside whether it was summer, rain, sleet or fall and bagging customer groceries. Proving customer with the best customer service and always being very friendly.  You were also in rotate with the next person it was also two or more people as a courtesy clerk everyday and when that was done you had to help the employees take left out items to there rightful aisles. The location that I worked at there were a lot of people who was not getting treated fare."
good,"Overall I think Kroger is a good place to work. There are lots of job opportunities. The work is interesting and rewarding. It is a lot of walking and standing- some heavy work. Uniform is required. If you can work nights and weekends, there are more hours available to work."
good,"I loved working for this company and fun doing it, I would say my only complaint was never having a life outside of working there. Again overall loved the people and the staff and do miss them all the time."
good,"Kroger is a good place to work at during your early work developmental stages. They teach good work ethic, responsibility and time management. My years spent at Kroger were educational and fun."
good,"I was able to maximize my skills and able to be extremely"
good,I loved it. I would love to get a job at Kroger again. I love the customers. I loved the smells in the store. I loved my bosses at both stores in both states I worked in.
good,overall great company. health insurance was awesome. pay was not that great. better pay would have been ideal. management stayed on top of the things in the store.
good,"Out of all work experience I have (not much, but still), Krogers is the best. Co workers are friendly most of the time, and the kind customers make up for the grumpy ones. The only thing I would change about Kroger's, is the pay and benefits."
good,"Working at kroger isnt bad.  I really like that they have a workers union, and that pay raises come every six months.  Additionally, you get paid weekly so less taxes are taken out."
good,"* Typical day was to retrieve schedule grocery, meat and produce orders,  Process and download the orders to the local warehouse for delivery to stores.  "
good,"This is a good company if you are in college or high school. You learn different things from customer service to how to work with people. Management is different from store to store, I have had some really good managers and really bad ones."
good,"The company is a great company to work for. "
good,"Enjoyed my coworkers and customers pretty productive. I liked the customers, lunches did fast, but I enjoyed coming to work. My managers always worked with me with my schedule."
good,"I loved the people i worked with, even from different departments, but the customers were too much sometimes. getting cussed out because we are out of your favorite meat or cheese is unacceptable. really put unnecessary stress on  everyone and the deli employees REALLY don't get paid enough for all the work they do."
good,Fast paced environment. Customer first atmosphere. Best part of job working with so many different people. I learned a lot concerning the operations of the company.
good,Did enjoy learning about the jewelry business but the summer I worked there the air conditioner quit so it was hard to look professional while sweating a lot. Was fun to sell engagement rings and pieces of jewelry that where going to be gifts.
good,This is a great company to work for but theres always something to do keep that in mind. there is a lot of opportunity to move up if you just go for it.
good,"real relaxed i just stocked and backup bagger, i had to quit suddenly and my manager was nice about it but the company took 3 months to send me my final check"
good,"I moved from courtesy clerk to produce clerk within a few months."
good,Working for Ruler Foods was an experience that I will never forget.  It allowed me to be up close and personal with the cusotmers.  I got to know them well while employed there and they felt like a family.
good,Kroger is a great company to work for as long as you have good management in your store.  I loved my job but unfortunately when you have a manager who believes years say it makes it hard for you to keep your job.
good,Awesome   place to work and chill easy to get along with people and wonderful customer service  and laid back  I cant say enough   all around great business
good,Kroger strives for the best customer experience with delivering the freshest products and friendliest experience for all customers. Great working environment but tends to lack on work life balance.
good,"I loved my job at Kroger, the people and customers were amazing. There are some great managers, and a terrible ones. The terrible ones, made me feel as if everything I did was wrong and wasn't good enough. They talked poorly of you behind your back and didn't communicate anything with you. Only walking around sulking and the energy soon shifted. I excelled at my job. I loved building my displays and was often praised for how well they were built. Eventually though, the negative energy from the management as well as trying to manage my personal life as a single parent, began to weigh on me. I was trying to be a million things to many people, and wasn't getting enough pay for the responsibilities I was given and expected. I couldn't manage my home life and I wasn't making money. I was close to a promotion that I worked hard for, and one bad day, prevented me from that, which had nothing to do the position I was applying for. Eventually all the stress and negative energy caused me to have a nervous breakdown. I took some time off and came back hoping things would be better after speaking to a doctor and trying out medication. When I came back, things were ok for a couple of days, but then went right back to the way they were. So I left, with no notice and not on the best of terms because of those managers whom made it difficult to work for. If I could go back and work in a different store or even a different department I would. I enjoyed my job there. But you shouldn't have to bring those sour apples home everyday in constant fear and worry that you're not good enough because other"
good,I loved working for Krogers! I only left working for them because I wanted to start my career of being a hairstylist. They taught me a lot about ensuring effective customer service and making sure to meet every customers needs. Thanks Krogers!
good,Working at Kroger was okay for a start but the pay is what really makes people want to leave. They start you off with 7.25 an hour and you don't get that many hours since they only give you about 12 to 20 hours a week. In order for you to really enjoy the benefits and pay of Kroger you have to be full time and your pay rate has to be above 8.00
good,Cool place to start  out working if you don't have prior job experience but once you get started to learn the ropes along the way. Everyone is nice and there to help you
good,"Amazing , I learned so many things on a everyday basis working at Pick n save. The people I worked with was amazing & they each had something to teach you."
good,I enjoyed my job very much. It was what i went to school for but then found out it only paid minimum wage.We had an unfortunate move otherwise I would still be enjoying my fellow associates and perhaps would have climbed up the ladder.
good,The job itself is relatively easy.  It is about store conditions and processes to achieve business results.  The most enjoyable part of the job is sharing success and developing people to achieve greater results.
good,"Company is great as for benefits and culture, it feels like family. "
good,Marianos is an excellent company to work for! I've been promoted three times in two years . I would recommend Marianos to anyone that is looking to grow with a company.
good,"Working in the pharmacy was both fun and a little difficult, but over time you get the hang of it. I loved the work environment, but i believe they need to bring up the pay rate. I learned about all the different medicines and believe that my experiences here will help me with my future career."
good,"Kroger was a very competitive and extremely busy job. Getting to work everyday and having my regular customers come in a and tell me jokes, or just make conversations about random things. I worked my way up to floor supervisor but the position was declined due to school not being balanced well"
good,Mostly the customers were great. Nice place to work overall. Hardest part was when customers came through the express lane with 300 items; taught me how to work through adversity.
good,"I really enjoyed my time working with this company. The job was simple and rewarding in addition to being fairly laid back. Members of management were generally very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately there are few opportunities for advancement within this company. I asked for a promotion multiple times and had one promised to me by management multiple times,only to not get the promotion. I would love to stay with this cimpany but unfortunately I need a higher paying job."
good,I cook food for the hot bar and soup bar. I also take orders for customers. Also I order supplies for the hot food department
good,I love meeting the customers. I love helping out the customers on finding what they are looking for.  It is a good place to work at it is good for a part time work.The coworkers are nice and helps you on anything on the cash registers
good,"its a pretty good company to work for, management could be better but all in all it's ok. Co-workers could be alot better. That's what make the job so difficult. Picking up someone else's slack. But that's a typical day at this particular Kroger unfornately"
good,It a good first job the only thing is u get no hours another good thing is that it has a union. It is a easy job that helps your customer skills.
good,"Kroger Somerset,Ky. was a very enjoyable place to work.The associates there were great to work with as well as the management team."
good,its very stressful. not a good friendly workplace feel. but the way they pay is crazy. the mangers will come and help only if you need help. they dont take time to teach you anything that you are suppost to be doing.
good,"Not much I can say not happy with union issues that hinder an employee from being compensated for their worth."
good,Kroger is an awesome company to work for. Unfortunately they have terrible pay for employees. They do not like giving raises to the hardworking employees. Favoritism plays a big role in employee compensation. They expect you to do more work then they pay you for.
good,"except for management changing constantly Kroger was a great enviroment to work for. The people were nice on a regular basis."
good,"Management & most customers here were excellent. It was a very fast paced job, which I didn't mind, but some customers could be unpleasant at times."
good,"great customers, the managers they good, youree drive store has an awesome produce department. the work is good just need more hours."
good,Good Place to work unless you're hired as seasonal. No job security in reality. Wish I had been able to stay at that company.
good,"Pays great, employees and management all get a long great and are very team oriented and understanding. Very rewarding."
good,I enjoy working there very much. The managers and supervisors are a joy to work with. I have learned a lot there and I am still learning more. I look foreword to going to work on Mondays!!!!
good,"Fill and refill prescriptions, input insurance information, run cash register, inventory, and put up stock.  I got along with management and my co-workers.  Hardest part was learning all the different insurances.  Most enjoyable part was knowing I helping people who were sick."
good,"Helping customers find merchandise when they need something, making sure they are taken care of at the registers in a timely manner."
good,i did not like the people i worked with and the baggers are used to do work that they don't want to hire another employee for.
good,This job was a good experience for me. It was the first real job I ever had. It taught me that working in a fast pace environment wasn't that bad. It actually helped my day go  by quicker. Working with industrial meat  slicers taught me standard safety guidelines. The only downside of my job as a deli clerk were the sometime  demanding nature of customers.
good,"My position within this company was exclusively involved with the Starbucks licensed café within the company. My knowledge is not specifically Kroger based, but upon observation, I can provide a little insight."
good,"I actually feel this as the best job I have had in my time of working , the are flexible and worked with my schedule even if it was last minute ... thanks Kroger"
good,Great enviroment for high school students and college to work. it helps you be more active with the community. i had the best co workers and we all worked as a team.
good,"I love Kroger but I am only part time and need more money. I love the team the worked it, help was never faraway. I would come in make sure my work space was clean. I made sure to give guest a speedy checkout and help them find tings in the store."
good,"Typical day some days slow some days fast."
good,"I enjoyed this job, It was a temporary position and I would like to contiune to work in this field."
good,"A day at work is never the same. My job consist of the same basic things every day,however they are never in the same order and there is always something new thrown in the middle. In management I have learned that you can never make everyone happy and you have to do what is best for the company and the current situation. I work with a lot of great people and they have become my friends. The hardest part about my job is when someone is hired and they do not want to work and you have to pick up their slack."
good,"Steady Fast place Business positive customer service."
good,"I was a bagger most of the time, so i had to stay focused because you had to know what you where putting in the bags, if the items where actually going to the person that was checking out. I had to jump from lane to lane when it go really busy, especially during holiday times."
good,Working at Kroger was a new experience. I worked in the meat department and the management of the store was organized and fair. My co-workers were also pleasant for the most part. The direct management in the department was not willing to teach skills necessary for job advancement and due to the involvement of employee unions I had to deal with a few lazy co-workers who often broke rules and left others with unecessary problems in their shifts. I did however enjoy the environment for the most part. Friendly co workers and management attempted to make a better working experience even around the issues with others.
good,"I do enjoy working at Kroger, even though, at times, it seems like the floor workers have more of a clue than management. The store I work at is going through a transition in management philosophy. Our management is transitioning from actively trying to grow the employee/management relations over to a performance bonus-driven culture. Meaning the management make most decisions based upon how it effects their quarterly bonuses."
good,good place to work when you are under 18 had to leave because I was moving to arizona
good,my day was running the register.  I learned that you need to be kind and patient even if you feel you are being pushed to the limit. Management is ok....they are understanding when you have concerns. My co-workers are good people.  they are willing to help you out. The hardest part of my job was dealing with frustrated customers if the issue is not resolved. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers....they are very understanding if you dont know how to do something. 
good,"At this Place I was the Nicest Guy, in there. I always, treated them fair, but they proceed to treat Me bad. One day I was just telling an employee a joke, and i said it very quiet, but didn't even say anything bad, and got fired for it. That's ridicolous lol."
good,I personally love working at the Kroger Pharmacy. I like the up beat tempo and I also like being a part of a team.
good,"Check customers groceries out, bag groceries and sometimes help a  customer out to their cars. How to be presentable to a customer basis and to be helpful to customers. Management was good and real understanding. co workers were good as well and real helpful to each other. Hardest part of the job was holiday time when the store got real busy. Most enjoyable was break time being that i work in a grocery store always something different to eat."
good,"The department heads were the best, they treated you like family"
good,"I really liked working here. I loved everyone and you always knew the customers as they came in shopping. I loved baking and making sure it was always fresh. My Manager was great, and made sure her employees were doing ok."
good,worked to fulfill customers needs. Co workers afraid of being replaced. Learned that the culture was forged on them against us.
good,"I've learned a lot in the last 7 years working at Kroger. A typical day at work is waiting on customers and keeping the cases stocked with fresh items. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with wonderful co-workers and working with the public. I basically continued to work at Kroger after college to pay for my student loans and monthly bills. I realize that it is time for me to pursue a career in my field of interest in Civil War History. I would like to become a tour guide at a State Park...preferably Bardstown, KY. I would be willing to relocate in order to do so."
good,I would work at night stocking shelves and accounted for all incoming vendors.The hard part was working graveyard.Great co-workers that moved fast.The good part was the people.
good,kroger is a very interesting job to have and they have very good benefits thhey have very hard working employees and managers
good,the was great but slow on advancement the wanted to switch to morning hours for the benefit of my family but it didn't work out.
good,"I was a cashier, I re-stocked shelves, I up sold Kroger Credit Cards. I could not have ever asked for better people to work with. I was only part time but it was a very easy laid back job, I wanted to be challenged, my managers were good people and work very hard to keep this company working.. It was a pleasure working here"
good,I loved working for kroger but the company is going in the wrong direction and its not for me. I want change and more experience room to grow. I wanna meet more people get more experience
good,Kroger has great benefits and the job itself can be easy but if management is not supportive nothing will go right .Overall great place to work and great pay
good,They  pay minimum their associate and too  many complained about the company. The job is only for younger or high school students and always  complained not enough hours.
good,I worked every day as hard as I could I gave it a 110 % ever day I could do every job that was given to me never missed a day I came in on my days off to work
good,"Kroger has been the most rewarding workplaces i have been able to work for and is more than happy to allow you to move locations, States, or shifts in order to help work around your life schedule."
good,There are so many different job titles and functions. Diversity exsists- which makes it easier to help understand peoples viewpoints on life as well as servicing them. The people are friendly and willing to help. Managers actually care and are easy to come and talk to.
good,"as this was the first job i had ever having, i was supersized on the amount of new things to learn each job-day! the few years working there has impacted my work skills still to this day and i am forever grateful!!!"
good,"This really does not apply to me.  Was an IT consultant, not an employee and it was not a store but IT department.  However, as a consultant the Kroger associates were good to work with and helpful."
good,"Kroger is a company that is all about uplifting and a positive experience for the employees and the customers. Kroger is company that you definitely advance in really fast, and also gain a lot of knowledge about the retail costumer service field."
good,When I lived in columbus I really enjoyed working there it was a friendly environment worked with a lot of young people it was fun I really liked the managers I learned a lot
good,There needs to be a Kroger in Oklahoma City! I loved working with the crew. Most of the bosses didn’t treat the employees like they didn’t  exist . Always had what you need and if not would help customers to find something similar to what they needed.
good,"Working with clothes everything has a place and a way to hang them up. First you want to color code everything and put smallest size to biggest size, then make sure long selves are with long selves and pants are with pants. etc."
good,"Management is good, supervising is not. Teams are good, some lack work ethic. Not much opportunities to move up unless you know people. Always have to work harder then the next person, they pick their favorites all the time."
good,"I would recommend working for the Kroger Company to anyone seeking a first job. As they are unionized, Kroger employees have a lot of benefits many other companies do not have, like a $9.00 starting minimum wage and a healthcare plan. You are guaranteed 12 hours a week and are limited to 40 unless you are higher managment. I enjoy the people I work with, but often I don't get to know them that well because they quit within a month or two of getting hired. Compared to other departments, the Front End at my store is very fast paced and is very stressful. The amount of physical and emotional labor you have to give leaves you exhausted even after a 4 hour shift. I do not know how to advance in my department and I know I would have to go above my supervisor's head to get transferred to a different department because she will not work with you to advance in other areas of the store."
good,"bagging clean spills clean bathroom gather carts"
good,The briarcliff location is the best. Everyone works together and not in competition with each other i give this kroger a 7 because the building is old. Once you get there is always an associate to greet you assist you no matter what department they're in.
good,I think it is a good job for someone who is just getting into the real world of having a real job. it teaches them responsibility lousy pay but they get paid every week so it's worth it.  the biggest problem is they don't keep steady store managers and the managers don't get to pick the stores they want to go to. sometimes it can be laid back other than that it's like any other job.
good,The Kroger in Westlake is a great place to work. Especially for young teenagers it being there first job. The management there is amazing. i am very close with all of the managers and they are very flexible and will work with you whether it’s your schedule or time off
good,Retail Pharmacy=Long hours on feet. It's hard to make patients understand why their meds aren't ready due to insurance/doctor delay. Can be Stressful.
good,They were short staffed so that sucked butts. I had to sprint everywhere just to feel like I was actually doing something. Trying to take a lunch break or s bathroom break was such a tough thing to do.
good,"Enjoyed working with customers   Doing many things in one day,  the same thing all day for the next  Management did their job     in largest department in the store"
good,As a cashier it was fun to help other's with bagging and helping customers with there grocery. Hardest part and challenging part is holiday season. With fast paste and lot of running around but I enjoyed it
good,"a typical day a Kroger's consisted of stocking shelves and politely directing customers to designated areas  "
good,Management will vary greatly depending on what shop you are at. Hours will vary for part timers without tenure. Will not higher for full time unless your posting requires it.
good,Going to work every day at kriger made me feel very good being able to interact with my customers trying to make their day or the other way around and I got along with all my coworkers so it was great
good,"I have nothing bad to say about Kroger, they have the lowest prices around on foods, or anything else they are higher.  I was a dairy clerk and I love my customers. You work with the union so that’s a plus"
good,"Pros: Great place to work. College scholarship opportunities. 401k retirement benefits plan. Flexible scheduling. "
good,Excellent team very corropitive with my confusing work schedule. Very nice customers and environment would recommend for any part time or full time employee
good,I enjoyed my job with Kroger however i would not work there past a college job as it just does not cut it for life quality. with the limited pay its hard to be able to afford things like traveling vacations.
good,You'll learn a lot while working at Kroger. You'll work with the public and learn how to problem solve within the job. Always work as a team. Learn to be a Floor Supervisor or a Customer Service Rep.
good,"This store was a nice and relaxed place of business that occasionally got very busy and stressful, especially around the holidays. The managers were very understanding and my coworkers were always pleasant."
good,My hours at Kroger where mainly 4pm - 11pm. I was also in high school at the time and I had to quit because my grades were dropping. Kroger is a great place to work if you can handle stressful situations.
good,This is a good starting job for a young individual looking for somewhere to start in the workplace.  The management was okay but I feel some managers were not fit to teach new employees.
good,"Working for Kroger's was fun i was stated out as a bagger, Sanitizer,to stocker ect every week i was promoted to a different position and a raise, i learn a lot i was good work help the elderly customers and customer service hosting and welcome people to Kroger's and made my store clean and mad cousmers happy helped training new employees i Love working and keeping postive mind having or giving ideas  for display love doing what i do all ways makeing good impressions to make story look it very best"
good,"Manage 6 to 10 employees on each shift. Complete a store opening/closing. Make schedules for all employees. Balance drawers and safes. Order money, lottery books, store supplies and merchandise. Complete weekly store inventory. Pass monthly store inspections. Handle customer complaints. Assist cashiers and baggers with fast and effective customer service."
good,The company is fine to work for but there are little areas to advance. The hours are never steady unless you are full time. It's a great start but not worth it long term.
good,It was cool to work here but at times the drama of the workers and customers would get to certain people who worked there and sometimes ruins the vibe but overall the job itself wasn't bad at all.
good,Very pleasant work environment in the deli department at Kroger. But management was not as work related as they pretend to be. Management needs better work ethics and guidelines to go by
good,"Not too bad of a place to work if you're in high school. Not a lot of hours if you're part time. The work itself is easy, just a lot of customer service."
good,I absolutely love all the people that I work with at Kroger everyone always had a smile on her face and was pleasant to work with the managers would come down of course they would give Reports on how we were doing Management was easy to work with very sweet and kind people
good,Good job to have while in high school or college. Not a job to have for an adult trying to provide for a family unless you are a supervisor or in management.
good,very fast pace with lots of interaction with the public. hours can be inconsistent but the pay is decent. very flexible schedule and management works with you the best they can.
good,I worked at Starbucks and learned to make the drinks. I delivered drinks and was in charge of cleaning the equipment and workplace. I handled the register. We had two different management types and that made it stressful at times. The hardest part was working a rush alone or with minimal staff. I really enjoyed talking with our regular customers while making their drinks.
good,Working at kroger gave me advantages not only for finantial but also for carreer andvancement. I definitly recommend working there. I also really appreciate the co workers.
good,Easy to clock in and  out with fingerprint energetic work pace. Meet new people everyday and build on relations. Growth within company is available based on ability to handle responsibilities given at hand.
good,Good company but inconsistent management and an increasing emphasis on metrics over people.in business you can't manage it if you cannot measure it. That being said Kroger has absolutely lost touch with the human aspects of the business. It's disconcerting.
good,"when i worked there the other staff members did not want to do their jobs, leaving others to pick up their slack. The few people that actually did their job made the work enjoyable for a time."
good,Kroger is not a job I will recommend to someone that really wants to make money . They do not pay you enough and do not give you enough hours. The people have great customer service skills
good,"Bagging, cart retrieval, and facing the store was what a work day consisted of. Saliva drug test, Nice management, and very flexible hours. Minors REQUIRED to take a 15 min break every 5 or so hours, very consistent."
good,Kroger altogether was not a bad job. It does become stressful when you have call offs or negative energy . When you have a positive team that all works together it creates a nice turn out .
good,Kroger wasn't a hard place to work at. The only thing that is not great is that you can move to different departments that acquire more work but don't get paid for it. The management is okay at best.
good,Kroger is a decent place to work the pay needs to be meyer but what can you expect when you work at a grocery store.younare able to advance up and become in a management.
good,"Kroger is a good place to work. It has given me skills to go forward in life. I have learned management skills and it has given me confidence to go forward in life. The people there are great and you get treated like family. I will always cherish my time there."
good,"The department I worked at was very friendly. The only problem I had with working there, is that I felt like I worked the hardest department and got paid the same as all the other starting departments, which was minimum wage."
good,"Kroger is a great place to work, but not the best if one is looking to advance in their life. Flexible hours, and there’s always opportunity to gain more hours if needed or the person wants more hours. Good benefits and a week paid vacation after a year of working for them."
good,"kroger used to be the best grocery store, we were alot more busy before all these new stores moved in. its cheap and i liked the products and we had alot of customers, loyal customers. i wish they were staying in north carolina."
good,"I loved working at the smaller store I worked at a small one and a bigger one. The small one was great about rewarding their employees when they deserved it, the larger one not so much but there was also 3x the employees"
good,"This was another position where I felt that I was an outsider looking in- I think that was due in part to having been a PT employee, but that never bothered me. Seeing the tight-knit group made me realize that I had made the right choice. hence, when I resigned, I wished to relinquish (if possible) the hours that I would be giving up to my coworkers. I did make friends while I was there."
good,"It was fun working in the office at Kroger. I took care of bills, money, and helped the shifts run smoothly. It was nice getting to meet lots of people and I absolutely recommend people working at kroger."
good,"Frys hires friendly people they want people to smile and always be in a good mood. Which I enjoyed I left due to the store manager he didn't seem to care abt the employees only what the customers says and if the customers didn't like someone he would go yell at that employee it just wasnt right for this job, he came from corporate office so it was pretty much a demotion and he wasn't happy abt it and just took it out on everyone else if i could go back I would but I'd be starting at the bottom again with min wage vs what I was making / what I would be making if I didn't leave"
good,"pick orders for people, and take them to their car.perform opening task. perform closing tasks. deal with customers one on one. Help put restock items back on shlves."
good,Probably no better or worse than anywhere else. Arlington Heights store is a great place to start out if you never did retail before. Good staff. I have found the staff to be hardworking & flexible. Good people to work with.
good,I loved everything about this job except for my immediate manager who was the main Pharmacist in the pharmacy. I also had to undergo an investigation because some of the techs decided to steal narcotics. Other than that it was really fun.
good,Great work place and recommend that people work there. The pay is okay and the benefits are great working at Kroger means you will get a 10% discount on just about anything in the store.
good,"My typical work day is anywhere from four to eight hours when I am able to interact with customers and fellow employees. The workplace is very friendly, and for the most part they can work around your schedule."
good,The union reps did not do anything to help me or any of my coworkers. I only saw the union rep twice in the six months I worked there. The management did a good job with working with your schedule.
good,Buen dinero con buenos incentivos. Muy seguro y buenos trainers
good,"I enjoy working here, and love the leadership and the culture. This company has been around for 130 years, and the systems are not great, leading to many manual processes for a $110B company."
good,really was a pretty place to work dint pay well but great people and a good work exsprience very good for starter very challenging and helped learn about customer service
good,management was great the first time I was there very  easy to work with  seemed family friendly. it became to corporate it was no longer abut smiles and having a good fun productive work day it became about the bottom line everyone was pushed to be nearly robotic. unless great changes was made I would not recommend going back. hard work was never acknowledged my immediate manager did no one outside my department took note of me despite my efforts. it was more who knows who kind of like promote your drinking buddy type. the business became cutthroat my last year in 2013. benefits was ok wish pay was more for a courtesy clerk who does a lot of the day to day and helps customers the most a good one anyway is severely undervalued and underpaid. this is my knowledge of the Lebanon store here in ohio the façade of family is put on when the day is busy I have seen management berate people in front of the whole store. that is highly unethical unproductive and unprofessional it is sad to see the store go from what it once was to what it is now. also the union is a joke they care not for the employees they are sell outs. seen people fired for miniscule things while others get away with everything .  this is my honest take on my time there from good to eh to ugly.
good,"Krogers is a good place to start off with. If its the job for you, you can advance in the job fairly quickly. Managers are leaders and help the employees go in the right direction"
good,"start up opening site, learned a lot about the grocery business, union environment, local owners, advance quickly within the operation. work with a lot of outside vendors."
good,Kroger was a good place to work for. I think had I stayed with the company longer than I may have gotten to move up in the company. I could't deal with the lack of hours and the fact the my manager had not real excuse for not scheduling me any hours.
good,I worked In the fuel center. Part time I was there  for a little over 2 years easiest job ever they let you sit down during your shift and tend to customers in the little booth. Customers were great my manager was awesome.. only thing and only reason why I quit is because I was considered as backup (assistant manager) but they didn't want to give me the pay. I'm doing everything a assistant manager was doing opening scheduling etc... Working 6 days bcuz we were short staffed only making 8.03/hr
good,Kroger take care of their employees and promotes within fairly. It is a great company to work for and I would highly recommend it for anyone who is looking for a place with fair work environment.
good,Good pay....paid vacation....medical and dental insurance.they have lots of managers and co managers some times they do not  always agree on what they want
good,"It is a very productive work place. There is spots for advancement, but they don't come often. So when they do you have to snatch them up. The work environment can be stressful, but you know you will never not be able to find a job."
good,"My Manager at the Floral Department was kind and very helpful. It was a fun place to work and it wasn't as stressful as it was or anything like that but it a good place to work for. I don't work there no more because I got pregnant. Sometimes it's slow but most times it gets busy specially with the holidays, birthdays, and graduations."
good,"I worked there and was told by a manager I would be making $1 more per hour after switching departments.  He relocated and I got 0.03 instead.  The managers are junk, most, they don't know how to do their jobs.  Was great to learn new skills.  Some people get their hours, some not at all. Good for a beginner job."
good,"Checked people out at the register. Management isn't always the best, but that's gonna be everywhere. You work your hardest anyway because it's your job. I've had a few really good managers at Kroger. The workplace is good, because of my coworkers. They make the day a lot better sometimes. And some of the customers make me smile. I've come to actually enjoy talking to some of them. However some customers really suck, because they just need to learn on how to properly talk to people."
good,"Kroger was my first job and I loved it. I had some difficulty at first due to the past CSM Supervisor but once she was relocated, I was able to flourish and move up. I started off as a bagger got moved up to cashier, then moved to customer service, floral, working on tags, and lastly I became a front end supervisor. I was with Kroger for about 3 years and I was forced to leave due to my school intership getting in the way with my job."
good,"good environment  friendly customers steady pace ,get responsible assist mangers and managers, customers are always right ... need positive people as well as friendly people."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at the pharmacy. Although I didn't work there very long, and I was only part time for the short time that I was there it was a good job to have in my opinion. The head pharmacist was easy to get along with, and worked with me on hours. My only reason for leaving is because I needed something with benifits and full time."
good,"I done customer service by greeting the customers at the frontend where register are located, I also rung customers merchandise up bag merchandise,help in the accounting office when balancing register for closing procedures."
good,I worked at Kroger Stores for my rotation as a pharmacy student. My preceptor did an excellent job in training me and in teaching me to become a competent pharmacy . I can not thank him and the company enough for giving me this opportunity.
good,"Kroger is a very good company, that has good management at the upper level , for example at the Divsional level they have the right ideas and vision for the customers and the employees, but at the store level there are many,many managment people that do not live or cannot live up to or execute on the Divisional Management and Company expectations at all."
good,"was not flexible with schedules, was not allowed to get all the days off asked for off, people were the best part of the job working with many great people. Learned a lot about customer service industry"
good,Kroger is a good work place. Benefits are great pay could be better. I enjoy working there because it is very calm and relaxed but you are able to accomplish a lot in a day. I would prefer to be more challenged then I am in my current position.
good,Excellent work choice loved it both times I worked there however sometimes the other staff are very much like kids and act some way that no one likes and leave you with work they don't finish which can be frustrating. Also it's hard to get on and request your hours but management messes them up everything until if you in school you fail your classes and you can not call out at all.
good,Kroger is a great place to work. It just take so long for you to become full time. You can grow fast within the company. Kroger has excellent benefits
good,"I absolutely loved my job, the people in general where amazing and the customers where great. only down side i can think of was their wasn't much room to advance in the store opportunity and such."
good,"This job is not for a person that has no self motivation. There is always something to attend to in the work place. Most of the time if you are not working the register you will be cleaning and organizing merch. In my case the mangers and long time employees were in a click, so they could sit around and talk to the customers for hours during their shifts and not be written up for it. Most often you could find them in the back office doing paperwork or outside smoking. Not very legit leadership skills. Aside from that, (which is strictly in my own experience) the job is fun. The regular customers always make your day better if you're feeling down. The hours are flexible and the health benefits are great too. Over all it's a good first job. Teaches you to be self sufficient in the work place, and you make some pretty cool friends."
good,"My coworkers I was hired with were very nice. The staff that was currently working there was not so nice and not willing to help you learn very much. I pretty much had to cling to a manager and learn from her or learn on my own. The hardest thing about working at that job was me basically having to do more to accommodate those that didn't work hard enough. It was a job to start me on my working oath but I doubt I would have saw much growth staying over time, Clearing the parking lot of baskets was probably the duty I enjoyed the most working there."
good,Getting back into the wok force after being a stay at home mom for many years this was a hard job and very fast paced.  I enjoyed working with my co-workers and Krogers customers.  My manager was very driven and very appreciative of hard workers. The hardest part of this job was being on my feet for up to 10 hours a day.
good,"Customer service "
good,"-typical day: Follows Agile process. Program in pairs"
good,This job is fast pace and fun working as a team at krogers will get you far in your  far in your career.  Managers are willing to help you get far in your career.
good,"Wonderful place to work at, management  was always willing to help if you were short handed. Always worked around your availability. Truthfuly one of the best company's i have worked for."
good,"I only worked for Kroger for a couple of weeks due to medical issues. I can't truely rate them fairly."
good,"Overall working for a Kroger company was a great experience. I learned many things such as management skills, how to train new employees, and how to efficiently solve any issues or concerns our customers had. The best part of working there was the employees and the job itself. The hardest part would have been working short staffed it was a challenge but it was not impossible to get the job done."
good,"Really enjoyed my job. Casual and fairly stress free. Ability to work with the team and have a schedule that was great. The difficulty was in the driving equipment. Lots and lots of breakdowns of vehicles, and unsafe conditions. Vehicle seat in one vehicle was not attached to the vehicle at all. Numerous malfunctions in vehicles- freezers not working, flat tires, oil leaks....the list goes on and on."
good,Very fun place to work Loved the customers Loved the different tasks that was required to do .The accounting aspect was fun and time consuming but fun place to work
good,I would recommend any employee to work with them.  They are a pleasant company with a very productiv and fun environment. Only regret I have is the manager I trained got the position I was going for.
good,"I get well my co. Work and manger I work good with another customer treat me good  "
good,"A typical day at work was fun and relaxed. I learned how to deal with all types of customers. The management was great, they helped with conflicts in scheduling as well as having a good time at work. The culture was really nice. The hardest part of my job was dealing with upset customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was making an impact on customers."
good,"Krogers is a good company to work for. If you have other things going on like school or children, they will definitely work with you. The pay isn't that good but I guess you have to be there long to actually make some good money but the environment is good. Management are a complete pain, they don't understand anything."
good,"The hours can be long unless you advise what you are available to work while in school. "
good,The Kroger that I worked at was in an extremely busy area and we had a large variety of customers.  There wasn't a real effort from the management to actually make the employees feel like a team so there was a disconnect between the different departments. There were times that it was difficult to get a manager to assist a customer when they had complaints.
good,"work was calm and relaxed a little too relaxed, the pay is horrible especially when you know you work for a fortune five hundred company that is well able and capable to pay more."
good,"I been at Kroger for 5years still as a cashier. I love the job that I do an enjoy working with customer. I also help with items on the shelf an bag grocery.  I am a hard working person,good team player,always on time. There is no hard job at Kroger."
good,I like the job as a whole. Good benefits and good perks. Wish there were more hours and the employees had a voice in more things that happened within the company.
good,Kroger's was a learning experience. I learned how to operate a cash register. A typical day at work was always busy. The hardest part was trying to make sure that my line never was to long and I had people waiting. The most enjoyable part of this job was making my busy day into a fun day.
good,"Kroger is a growing company. The people are willing to teach until you understand. The hardest part of the job was deciding if I wanted this to be my career. My typical day at work started with my clocking in and checking my store mail as well as my email. After, I was finish I would walk through my department and decided what needed to be done today as well as help stock the rest of the department. My fondest memory involves the people that I worked with."
good,it was a good temporary job. worked environment was great. people there were very friendly. i worked there at the smoothie bar as well. and i enjoyed a lot as it kept more busy than being a cashier.
good,I loved working for Kroger. The management and co workers I had was awesome. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. I had my loyal customer base after working there for a few months.
good,Yes I working there but I wish I could have gotten better hours. Sometimes this certain supervisor would have me pick up the dirty mats that were at registers. I did not appreciate doing that.
good,"Working for King Soopers was a fun job, started out as a courtesy clerk, went to cashier, then to bakery. Learned how to make bakery items and produce them at the correct times due. Worked alone most of the time."
good,"Worked in the field for harvest driving the tractor with the auger wagon on it."
good,"Kroger provides excellent safety, quality control and skills training.  I enjoyed customer interactions, sales of products represented.  Management is excellent."
good,Krogers can be difficult at times cause we're a union. You'll probably go 3-4 hours with out a break because the management is unorganized. The store is great place to shop.
good,"I loved working at Kroger! The employees were great and so were the customers. The hours were not the best, because they did not give many. Overall I don't have a complaint about Kroger."

good,working at kroger gave me a new look in family fun at work. The company has great benefits thats works for all types of family lifestyle.
good,"Kroger is a great company to work for, but they could stand to pay their employees more money. Really working at Kroger is not for people who have families and bills to pay, it is a job more so for high school students who need some pocket money."
good,Kroger is a friendly place to work. All employees work as a team. Management offer incentives for going above and beyond in customer care. Interactions with co workers and customers are typically a pleasurable experience. Management is helpful in everyday activities in the store as well as defusing difficult situations between co workers and customers.
good,"I loved Kroger. Everything, the employees, customers. Kroger is where you meet customer that become friends that you see sometimes everyday."
good,The first thing I would was clock in and then from there I would begen to bag. Then I would be sent outside to round up carts for customers to use while shopping.
good,"Working within Kroger marketplaces has provided me with many invaluable experiences and skills as I would communicate and interact with not only the majority of customers, but store management as well as store employees"
good,"RASC is a decent place to work, but at times there is an extremely heavy and stressful workload, particularly for Leads. Changes are sometimes made, departments downsized without proper planning and then the changes do not work as planned and they need to hire more people, thus creating more stress on Leads to train new hires."
good,"i had the greatest co workers. One bought me a bucket of chicken on my first day. I learned how work a cash register. a typical day at krogers in produce department, your basically your on boss days are mostly slow but great vibe"
good,My day at Kroger was amazing the people and the customers were sweet and kind! I learned so much about myself being a great co-worker and I also learned some social skills as well as being a good customer service rep.
good,"Kroger was my first job and I was taught the true definition of hard work. It was a lot of tough days and customers, but the best part was getting recognized for my efforts. That made me want to give it 110% every single day."
good,"a Little drama, but it is easily avoided. work availability matters here. great benefits no complaints. hardest part is pleasing the customer. great learning experience that is the most enjoyable part"
good,Great place to work and shop. Love the customers and the great leaders that work within the company. I really wish there was more of a work life balance other than that I love the company.
good,Very hard working place. Difficult managers to work under but understandable. Coworkers got along very well each work hard for each other.
good,"Cashier position, great when I was checking out customers but had to sit and wait during non-busy hours. The management was very nice and knew what they were doing."
good,Flexed scheduling was kind of hard with a new baby.  I enjoyed meeting new people. I enjoyed talking with my regular customers!

good,"Kroger is a good company to work for. They really do take care of their employees, benefits wise. "
good,I enjoy job though it is part time. I have gotten to know many customers. I have learned how to cut various types of meat and pork items. Most days I show up and either do markdowns or a case inventory. Sometimes I do both. The manager of the store is very nice man and always open to suggestions. Most of my co-workers are full time but always treat me with respect and kindness. Keeping the case stocked and full is sometimes difficult. I really enjoy dealing with customers I seem to always make them happy.
good,This was a job that require you to work together as a team. Management was a great help for workers that needed that guides. The co-workers were great and bring a lot of energy to the work field. Their was not a hard part of the job from my perspective. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customer.

good,"Kroger is a stable job where your efforts will be noticed, but it is difficult to move up because of the limited availability of job openings in the area."
good,I really enjoyed my time at Ralph's pharmacy due to the family culture that we built and nurtured during my time here. The managers were great and the pharmacists were the best I have ever had the privilege of knowing and working with. These people I worked with are some of my best friends to this day and I know that they will be in my life for years to come.
good,Very fun and new with nice associates and friendly customers that makes the day at work worthwhile. The hardest part of my job is telling a customer we don't have a product they are looking for but very good at suggesting something similar that they would love as much.

good,"On a typical day at work.. i clock in, go straight to the cash register and start to assist customers. I've learned so many things from being an employee of Kroger. I've learned the values of a work force and how everything i do reflects my reputation on a job site. I've also learned to appreciate my job, because somewhere else could be alot worse or i could be jobless. Most of my co-workers are great to work with, while others aren't. At times i feel that some employees get a way with anything and everything, which is completely unfair. The hardest part of my job is to not let my emotions show. At times it can be extremely hard to not show anger towards a customer that gets upset or tries to argue. The most enjoyable part of my job is having something to do everyday and beable to look forward to something."

I was able to learn new skills as well as apply previous job related skills and working at Kroger one definitely needs to have a high level of customer service skills as well as communication skills. Kroger was a diverse company.
good,"good working environment, respectful understanding mangers always willing to work with you, i always got good hours never had to worry about getting a slow weak and small paycheck,"

good,"I started working at Kroger the day Clickist was brought to the store. The setup for collecting groceries and delivering to customers was perfect and we would always get done early.

good,"dealing with customers was the best, I learned team work and dedication, how to make decisions that benefits others. the work place culture was  diverse so you learn to deal with different backgrounds , management looks easy but its not dealing with customers employees vendors and maintaining the store thats the hard part."
good,"Overall, the atmosphere at Kroger was welcoming and like coming home. You didn’t just had co-workers, we were a family. I miss my job. When you messed up on something they didn’t just write you up, they say you down and talked to you about it first and gave you a chance to fix it."
good,"I enjoyed working for Kroger, I just needed more hours and more money. I would love to go back someday when my car is paid off. If they'll take me. I really liked the people who I worked with."

good,"I worked here when I first turned 16. Was an easy job, all I did was gather carts from outside and bag groceries for customers when busy. You clean the bathrooms, and dust mop around the store. That's all you do as a Front-End Courtesy Clerk."
good,this is a great company to work for. the benefits are amazing and should always be considered when working for a company. I have been here for almost seven years and love it
good,"Great job for someone either out of high school or going to college."
good,Kroger is a good place to work with excellent benefits.  It is Union and therefore pay raises do not come that often.  There are alot of associates that have been there for 20 years.
good,It gets hectic at times but I love working at Kroger it’s not to bad where I work at gets hard and the lines get long because many people wants to pay there bills or do lottery
good,Management was friendly hardest part of the job was cleaning and stocking the store before it opened met a lot of friendly people workplace culture was diverse.

good,"Was a great place to work, even though at times co-workers would have attitude problems.  Other than that I would go back to working for them again.  Work hours were at times difficult to handle working back to backs and trying to still raise two children."

good,Had I gotten paid more and it was closer I would've stayed. Managers were great as well as employees. I always had a good time and was rarely stressed out. I didn't get a lot of free time but I think  that was due to staffing.
good,I worked with many great people at this company. Many friendship are to be made here and I loved every second of this job. The company was very friendly and professional.
good,"Its fun to work at, but I'm 6 months pregnant and I'm at a high risk at the moment so i quit/ they couldn't make me a cahier, because i was the senior bagger and they expected me to do things faster than what i normally do, and i couldn't take it anymore so i quit."

good,"Working here was the usual grocery experience. You usually stay somewhat busy during your entire shift, no matter you position, unless you are working a night shift. I found it hard to advance my role at the store, I worked for an entire year and only received a five cent pay increase. Management was okay, hard to find at times but overall decent."
good,A typical day was ok I would usually be bored by the second hour of the day. I learned how to use a cash register. Management was ok. The hardest part was dealing with some of the younger cashiers.
good,If you are looking for a company that takes care of it's part-time associates the Kroger Marketplace stores are the best places to work!  There is always the ability to advance as well.
good,I was able to expand on many customer service issues. I learned bakery as well as cash register and customer service. I had wonderful managers that were willing to encourage employees.
good,I enjoy communicating with customers and my co workers they was fun to be around over all being a bagger means we have to deal with being kart in the store and Texas has bipolar weather.
good,Overall the company is great to work for and I'm sure it varies by store but at my store management was horrible. They were too strict and they never allowed advancement unless you were one of the favorites.

good,"Working in a grocery store, you're able to meet many different people and learn how to build people skills and develop a solid work ethic. I believe it's a great 1st job for someone in high school if they're looking to get a taste of what real work can be like. It's also a good opportunity to learn how to multi-task. For myself personally, I enjoyed the company and the people, but $7.45/hr wasn't getting me where I was looking to go moving forward."
good,"A typical day at Pick N' Save would be interacting with customers scanning the items and placing them in the bag. I've learned that you have to make sure you don't spend to much time on one thing, The workplace culture was safe. The hardest part of the job was restocking and the most enjoyable part was interacting with others and conversing."
good,I worked for Roundy's just upon graduation. I made so many friends from all backgrounds. I enjoyed working at this place. It is pretty much a fast paced work environment and requires a lot of interactions with customers. Good palce to gain leadership and strong interpesonal skills.

good,"enjoyed new work experience and working with the company all of my coworkers where very helpful and friendly willing to share their experiences, wonderful job"
good,"Couldn't have asked for a better opportunity or team to work with. I learned a lot in a short amount of time, about myself, the company, and people in general."
good,"The last few months I was there. They change the employees work schedule and have the computer chose the work horks, which cut the hours dramatically."
good,Mariano's could be so much better if the company will get their managers together. Working at Mariano's you will have your days. some days it will be fine and other days it will be challenging.

good,"Great interacting with customers while cashing them out.. Loved helping costumers around the store, and loved the environment"
good,"The schedule is flexible, but there are few hours to work. The manager and assistant manager are very understanding and wonderful."
good,it's a nice place too work the people are nice so are coworkers but they have the customers always right thing even when they are wrong which in my opinion you can suck one I refuse to be talked to like a dog and then be punished for being talked to that way you may make my check possible but I found this job ill find another management needs to stand up for their employees every customer isn't a good one so don't treat them like gold and treat your employees the people who are here working their tails off keeping your business running don't treat them like crapbecause of a bad customer!
good,While working at Kroger's I learned how to balance school and a job. I realized the challenges that came with it however I managed it. I enjoyed the employees and supervisors that I worked with. There were times that the weather made my job a little more difficult however I managed to make sure that what was required and I asked of me got accomplished. I ended up learning the importance of excellent customer service and how valuable having good customer service skills are.

It was my first job I learned so many things such as learning how to have proper customer service and how to respect people. My co-workers were decent, it was a great place to work.

good,"I loved this job. A typical day was helping customers and stocking shelves of doing little tasks around the store.  I learned how to do returns, handle invoices, mark down items, and much more.  The only thing i had a problem with was the pay and not getting raises on time. The most enjoyable part of the job was being free and not having to be confined to one spot.  LOVED IT!!!!!!"
good,I had 13 stores under me that I supported all their computer needs. If it was on the network I was responsible for it. We changed out all the hubs and installed switches and color coded all cables. installed IDF boxes in all the stores with fiber. there were 9 of us so every 9 weeks you were on call.
good,"The Kroger company has a very family oriented feel to it: once you start employment, you become part of the team and their shared experiences help you grow and learn multiple positions. I started working in the Meat and Seafood department in October of 2015, with a completely open schedule, and learned the ropes for many opportunities within the field. I have been instructed how to work a morning shift with unloading the shipments and storing them appropriately, filling the service case with the different food we supply, and wrapping products to put out onto the main floor. I have also been instructed on evening shifts, how to clean and disassemble the service case, how to put the products away properly, and condition the entire department. "
good,"I was typically in a check lane interacting with customers that came through my lane. when I was at customer service I cashed checks, did money orders and so much more"

good,"During the day i expected to do carts for at least an hour, help more than 60+ people and to run and grab any item at least every other hour. I learned that patience is key to good customer service. And that it is okay to have friends in the work place. I learned that management is something that may not go in your favor and that's okay, they are running the business the best they can. My co-workers were amazing and always fun to come into work with. The hardest part of the job was doing carts in 113 degree weather. But the most enjoyable part was most definitely the people I got to see everyday."
good,"I didn't exactly agree with how things were run, but when you're and hourly employee, sometimes you just have to go along."

good,"A regular day at work i have to deal with complaints to why it's only one person controlling 6 registers, i have learned that i have a lot of patience and that i have the ability to fix things that i can control. Management is okay but when you complain because its a mess when you come on to your shift and they don't care its kinda irritating. To me there is no hard part of my job, the most enjoyable part of my job is to see someone walk in mad or angry and when they come to me to checkout they walk out with a smile. I love making people happy."
good,"I enjoyed making individuals day by bringing those at the back of the line to the front of the line when I had no one to check out in the express lane."
good,"Great employment for part time employees from my experience. Management easily identifies with employees as Most have worked every position in the store."
good,"The management is not very friendly and there's a ton of politics to deal with at any job as usual. However, there's a lot of people I've worked with that come from all points of life and it makes it so much more fun. Again you are constantly on your feet, working with your hands and you have to move fast, your thinking and improvisation skills have to be quick. Offer good customer service and don't let nasty customers get to you. The coworkers were awesome."

I was obligated to break down loads of product while using database systems to decide how much product to put out that will sale efficiently.  I was also responsible to take special orders for cakes, sandwiches, and party platters and making the orders on the days of the orders as well as every day production.  The hardest part of the job was to balance every tasks accordingly while helping customers and finishing every task in a timely fashion.  The most enjoyable part was the friendly and teamwork oriented co-workers and management. Since the job is so fast paced, the shift passes through relatively quickly."

good,A typical day consists of usually regular everyday customers and making sure they are satisfied with their Turkey Hill visit and get what they need quickly. The co-workers are great they make the busy days go by before you know it. The most enjoyable part is making the customers laugh and when they tell us we have made their day much better.
good,"There are just numerous opportunities and behaviors that need to change from the top down. "
good,"What I learned? I learned that everything can't go at your speed it have to go at the customer speed. Management? the management was not good, because they will put you on a job that you have never done before. Co Workers?  They were fun people to be around all day."

good,This company has exceptional benefits.  I love working for this company but unfortunately there just isn't the advancement opportunities I thought there would be.  There are a lot of politics involved in advancing.  They make it seem like anyone can do so but in reality they have picked who they want before the interviews ever occur.

good,"While working for the last 9 years at Kroger, I learned a great deal about what it means to give great customer service.  In fact, Kroger has spoiled me because I find myself comparing every store that I visit to Kroger.  I loved working for a company that focused on going above and beyond the call of duty to give customers that enjoyable shopping experience.  And just like any job, there were good days and bad days.  However, I would recommend this company to any person looking for a good company and great benefits."

good,"I loved working there till I had to choose between my health and having a job. I have had allergies my whole life and 2013 has been my worst of all time having them.

good,"Good place to work, a great learning experience, Just not enough hours"
good,"Had the job at the age of 16 so I worked around my school schedule. I was responsible for a department, where I take care of products coming in and out. Inventories and stocks.

This experience has allowed me to thrive at my future careers to come."

good,i worked there and i was talking to people that had been there for 10yrs and they were still part time and had never been offered full time. i asked management and they said that it takes at least 2-4yrs to be even considered full time. i found out about temp jobs and i gave a 2 weeks notice and left
good,Food 4 less was a good place to work- the members made the day fun and productive.

good,Kroger Company had the nicest employees. Yes you may work rotating shift and late nights but enjoying what you do means alot too. I still debate whether I made the right decision going back to college into another field. If they called me tomorrow I would consider going back.
good,"Its a great company to work for and recieving great discounts. However, with trying to pursue college not the job you want to work with pursuing education."
good,I really enjoyed working there for that fact that everyone was very outgoing. There were never any disagreements and if there were Management knew immediately and took care of it
good,I had a fantastic time working her almost all my employees were kind thoughtful helpful and you really learned how to talk to people and customers getting to learn your regulars ways of life and getting to understand how to manage others and helping when there was a problem. the only complaint i ever had was the lack of professionalism on managers and higher ups part. you had to beg for time off would get yelled at if i had made plans on my days off and wouldn't be told i had time approved off until the week of which you could ask months in advance and you are suppose to know if its approved or not no later then two weeks before which they never followed. accommodated by illegal scheduling where i would work from 2:15pm-11:15pm then the next day even though they knew it was illegal next morning 6:45am-3:45pm you have to have at least 8 hours in between shifts unless being paid overtime which i rarely was and i would get blamed for how they scheduled.just need better managers is all.
good,"Good for hard workers & self motivated person. Training related to practical work is not per standard. May be this is related to one location."
good,"1: Never a doll moment at Kroger "
good,"Employees are like family, definitely a job you can move up in. Mangment was always helpful an always encouraged me to keep going. I learned something new every."
good,"Can't have criminal background, or any type of pending charges. They wanted me to try to get this issue resolved an I told them that I wasn't able to until my next court date."
good,"I have been with Kroger for 16 years and enjoy working here, Kroger is a union job so I have great benefits and job security,  Kroger has a very diverse employee staff including the disabled,  I'm hard of hearing and has not been an impediment to my job function"
good,"I enjoyed every minute I worked there and Learned about the industry as a whole. It was my first job that trained me in every department, and kept me motivated to keep working harder."
good,Good experience. Had a great reputation and a very enjoyable place to work at overall. Management was la king heavily and was a reason for leaving the company.
good,No problems for me at the company. At my fulfillment center it’s really what you make it as far as the culture go. I’ve never had any problems with Management... I just wish the pay was a little more. Everything else is satisfactory
good,youll have lots of free time only working up to maybe 6 or 7 hours good management never had any problems working there some managers can be strict but overall good place for part time work
good,"It was a good way to earn some extra cash around the summer. Nice management, I was a cashier so there wasn’t too many problems staff was nice and it was fun meeting new customers daily."
good,"I clock in and walk to clicklist. I grab my hand held and I sign in. I fill my cart with six crates, and I go grab my item stickers. I stick the stickers on the crates, and walk through the shop whilst I pick up items that I need. I scan the items, and put them in the correct crates. When I finish picking up the items I bring them to the clicklist area and sort them. Sometimes I had to work in the back  moving pallets with the walk around lifts."
good,"a typical day at kroger I cleaned, stocked, rotated merchandise, backstock, running fast lane. I learned the Kroger procedure. the management was very good. for me, there was nothing hard about working at Kroger. the most enjoyable part about working at Kroger was the other employees and customers."
good,J love working there I just need someone to work with my home schedual more. I have four small children and prefer being off on the weekends with my children.
good,The management is nice and respectful and my coworkers are very helpful and easy to work with. Overall I would recommend Kroger to anyone. The atmosphere is great and everybody try’s to keep the store in good shape.
good,"Kroger is an amazing company to work for. The environment that you’re working in, makes you happy to be there. From the people you’re working with  to the customers that you soon come to know and recognize."
good,I first got the job because of one of my good friends that worked there and hearing about me loosing my previous job due to it shutting down. I loved the fact that I was able to move around constantly and talk to new customers almost daily and catch up with our recurring ones. It taught me a lot about being social and able to talk to any customer that needed help.
good,"In terms of job security, it's a great place w union protection. The crew is friendly and cohesive w and individualized but clear system of accomplishment. Pay is a bit low but regular raises are promised alongside a week of laid vacation after a year. Positions are very easy to learn and customers are polite and easy to work with."
good,"Kroger was a job that I worked immediately after high school. It was a homey environment and over time came to know everyone that would come through the store. It was important to be great in customer service. I enjoyed the work as I would love the fast paced work keeping up with helping customers get checked out, bagged, helped out if needed, and returning carts. I was a Cashier and Bagger so my responsibilities were focused on handling a register, helping customers, and routine chores."
good,I loved working for Kroger. I was blessed to work with some awesome people and developed on unstoppable crew in my unit.  We developed an environment where the customer was our supervisor.  We aimed to please and knew that they were the reason we were there.
good,"The managers are always kind and understanding. "
good,I loved working for kroger. They worked with me I wanted to back to school and do other stuff as well. Pay needs to be addressed they also are a union. But all in all good people and some good managers.
good,Job would have been better but it doesn’t pay you  enough for what is required of you to do.   They should also offer full time to a person who does at least 90 days
good,I love working at Kroger. The atmosphere is very family like. Contract updates don’t compensate people who have been there longer. Management has some issues for sure. Customers can be difficult but not too bad. The job itself isn’t bad and the pay is decent. The people you work with are amazing.
good,Management cares about their employees. They want the best for you. The hardest part of the job is dealing with several rude customers. Most enjoyable is being able to help others and help customers understand the sale.
good,"Kroger’s comes with very good benefits, but the management sucks so bad. They do not care about you at all, unless they are benefiting from it and that’s not right"
good,Had learned a lot while I was working there more than I i didn’t know Mostly communicating with costumers friendly manner greating them if anyone need help.
good,I absolutely loved my job. It was not my choice to leave. I wish I could have been given the opportunity to step down from my position. My 2 oldest boys also work for Kroger.
good,I was working in the kitchen. Working in the Kitching was not that bad at all I just wish I would've seen more of my manger involve. I did not meet my manger until me second month working for them.
good,"Everyone is willing to help"
good,"My typical day was getting everything ready for my team, start shopping for customers, and keeping my fellow employees updated with changes to the store. I also help try to help with keeping an Uplift attitude and reporting Uplift stories of our store to share with other Krogers in our district."
good,"Typically, the first step would be to clock in and then work the scheduled shift. On the job, there would be floor supervisors coordinating the front end. The work put in from employees from each division created a workplace culture."
good,I learned alot when it comes to stocking thanks to Kroger from rotating products to managing shipments to make sure that the product hit the store selves on time.
good,Pay was great especially along with employee discounts made shopping a breeze. Staff and customers were very friendly. I loved my time working there and would definitely do it again
good,"Working for Kroger was fairly stressful. I had different managers, those I liked more than others. It was a grocery store so I had my fair amount of rude customers but my biggest issue was working the night shift and I had no one up front with me so I had to deal with crazy customers alone."
good,"Honestly I got along well with almost all my coworkers, managers, and store managers. I was full time, guaranteed 40hrs, occasional overtime if necessary, and given a fixed schedule. The way raises were given definitely changed within the 3 years I was there. I was offered health insurance as well as dental and vision, but didn’t need it at the time. I was given opportunities to advance in the front office but didn’t feel the need to be in a position like that, though unofficially I knew how to do a decent amount of tasks up front."
good,"I worked there for four years, and it had its up and down moments. Averall I loved my job very much, and especially my customers. My customers were reason I hated to leave my job. I left because I was trying to finish my accounting degree, and at that time I was also doing an internship."
good,"Working at Kroger was very competitive and stressful but each and everyday I made sure I did what I was supposed to. I dealt with many challenges but succeeded in the end.Joining Kroger team I learned how to deal with my emotions in a work base while getting the job done. At Kroger I dealt with a lot of rude customer and employees but that never came between my professional work ethics. Overall the most enjoyable part about being a courtesy clerk was that, I was able to put a smile on every customer that I encounter with."
good,I enjoy working with Kroger just wish i got more hours kroger was helpful when needed and  they are caring and will help to keep every worker happy and try their best to fix a problem
good,"Everyone works well together we rotate every 2 hours which is nice no one person is stuck in the same spot all day. We work every other weekend , We try and take turns working holidays"
good,Its hard to get fired unless your managers dont like you we are union so its really hard to get fired it takes a special person and i mean special person to work for this company. Prepare to bust butt and hussle and if you cant hit the floor running and move quickly and not a quick learner this job is not for you. Do not apply if you are prone to getting sick easily have strokes or heart attacks or have aneurysms because this job will cause all that you will get sick from the stress.
good,Kroger is a wonderful work environment. My position as Prn Pharmacist does not have any security. I would not ever be interested in leaving my job if I had part time hours.
good,Krogers is a good place to work at and prefivdes good insercence. The company is a well runned place and the empoyee discount is s good help too. I like working there
good,"Typical work day consisted of maintaining a top notch clean store. Stocking, ordering, customer services and scheduling other associates.  Books and back stock and promotions currently being offered by Kroger."
good,The Kroger Company hired me for a long term (6+ month) temporary assignment as Remodel Security/loss prevention.My wage was high for the position I worked due largely to experience in the field. Paydays are weekly on thursday which was a nice change. The benefit system is a little difficult to understand but once you do it works well.
good,"come to work with a smile on my face, and greet all of my coworker until its time for me to clock in. management always roamed around making sure everyone is working. the hardest part of the job is working with only 4 people at work. the best moment is the holidays because they would always try to throw a party for every event."
good,I really don't complain to much I just make the best of all situations. I Mean YES customers complain but its OK I just try to be understanding and listen. I Love working with different people.
good,Kroger was there to get me on my feet when i had nothing.. i believe that Kroger is a good job for someone that has help. You cannot live on the pay alone..
good,They are a decent company but very greedy. When I had my baby they wound not give me any kind of financial help and it caused me to have to move. Nthey do have sweet people though.
good,My day would consist of interactions with the customers while doing my job. I would answer customers questions and direct customers to where to find certain items. I would hold a brief conversation with my regular customers as well as new customers. I learned how to be patient and sympathetic to each customers needs. The workplace was very comfortable for me. I really enjoy working for the Kroger Co. I grew a bond with my coworkers and that made it fun to work there. My job wasn't hard at all. I enjoyed every part of it for the time that I was employed there. I actually applied recently to work there again because I liked what I did so much. You're able to move up within the company and that's a plus for me.
good,It was my first job back in the work force after raising my 3 children... i enjoyed my job n the company... started off in the cleaning crew .. moved to grocery dept n back up cashier
good,"Friendly job that had agreeable hours, especially for a student. Management was kind and expected only friendly attitudes back. Promotion available for those who feel they are capable of managing the extra work and extra responsibilities."
good,"A typical day at Kroger was normal paced, unless it was before a holiday. Then it was fast paced. I learned how to help customer's who didn't understand how to use self check out. I also learned that sometimes no matter how nice and helpful you're trying to be, some customer's don't want to be bothered. The management for the Kroger I was employed at was not very helpful. They barely came down from their office to help if we were under staffed. They spread around personal information regarding applicant's drug test. When ever a situation accurred regaurding sexual harassment, they did little to nothing to resolve the situation. The hardest part of my job was being the person they relied on to do the tasks that everyone else refused to do. The most enjoyable part of of the job was interacting with the customer's and helping make their day a little easier and happier if I could."
good,"Nothing to review. Most the people at the work was fine, The place has since gone through updates and changes and there is a lot of items I cannot find."
good,"While I disliked the pay for the time I had been there, the management and co-workers were the best I met, Learned how to be more responsible and understand how to work in multi-tasking and on any hours I could be available."
good,"The deli workers were sorta like a second family to me and made working there so much better. "
good,Good company to work for! Pay is low for the amount of work that is done and the hours and days off are very inconsistent. Overall it’s a good company to work for to add to your resume.
good,"Cashier				   "
good,Kroger provided me with a great working experience. The only problem o had with Kroger was the schedule. At that time I had a young daughter whom I wanted to spend more time with at that age so I found a  fixed hour job. But I would go back to Kroger anyday.
good,The job is great you meet people everyday some are happy and some not. But you have to have a great attitude and a winning smile to make you day. I work in the deli it's hard work but when you working with a great crew and fabulous deli manger what can you ask for.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is that you work with everyone and no one is left out of anything. There are some difficult times that you have to bare, but for the most part you're never alone"
good,"During my year and a half at Kroger I enjoyed it wasnt to busy but enough to make the day go fast. Had nice coworkers and managers. I left Kroger because of a complication with vacation when they said it would be fine for me to go, then had the nerve to call me halfway through my vacation to ask if i was gonna be in the next day acting like they never knew about my time i needed off."
good,"It could be a tough retail Environment, depending upon the Store one was Assigned.  Anyone worth their Salary can succeed at Kroger with a lot of energy and Diligence.  Comply with every Policy and Process and you can be a success!"
good,The days here were great only if  I was able to work more and receive overtime it would have worked out perfectly. The management was great and the duties were very manageable.
good,Was a decent place to work for.Co workers were always friendly and help ya out when ya need it. Management was kinda meh but alright. The customers were always friendly and would not hurt anyone.
good,I worked for food 4 less for about a year an it is a fun please to work at has alot of good people but it can be sometimes tiring becuase of all the running around but a very good place .
good,Really hate I chose to leave may be 1 of the worst career decisions I ever made instead of working a little harder to make myself stand out in a world class environment I took an easier route to work for a smaller co. With a larger need for experience personal because of rapid expansion.
good,I gave Kroger a two week notice. I was still in high school and it just affected my school activities. No one would help with my hours and working around them.
good,It was a fun place to work. the employees were very nice and fun to work with.I had so many laughs and i enjoyed going in to work everyday. I was a good job for a college student to have.
good,"Good company to work for, frequently changes managers and associate managers which shakes things up but a good company to work for overall, the best part of the job is working with the customers"
good,I worked at a small Kroger so everyone knew everyone. It was hard work but the people were great. Pay was decent and so was the benefits. The only issue was if you were sick and called in they guilt ed you to come in. and like any family people butted heads but when it came to the tough stuff you knew they had your back.
good,I greatly enjoyed working here as a pharmacy intern. The work environment was very friendly and my pharmacist were knowledgeable and great mentors. All my staff were awesome people.
good,"The people are nice, and the work is never anything super hard. All around, I'd say it has great benefits, and decent pay. It's even pretty awesome that you get paid weekly."
good,there was no problem that appear to raise more concern about to loose my position asso...in the store there was just daily activities maybe for sometime individual can not be mindful..anything so appreciation is always..there..
good,Helping customers to find the products they are looking for and assisting them in any other way possible. Having a good and helpful management team helps the store run smoothly.
good,Kroger offers growth potential and an overwhelming opportunity for development as long as you don't allow your private life to interfere. My suggestions are to boost employee health and well being and encourage more intensified work life balance.
good,"It was an excellent job, lots of advancement opportunity, team building events with all the stores, and management was deeply involved with day to day opperation. Loved it."
good,"Kroger was a good company to work for, depending on the store you end up at. As with any business, each location has a different atmosphere. The first store I worked at was amazing, it was a small store and all of the management and employees were close, almost like family. We all looked out for and helped each other. When my store was closed due to the opening of the kroger marketplace, we all had to transfer to different stores. Most people went to the new store with hopes that we would be hired in full-time and we would have the most seniority. The management at that store was horrible. The front end manager didn't even know how to run a register. She refused to learn the names of the employees who transferred from the old store and would instead, just snap her fingers at you and point to where she wanted you to be. She told a fellow employee as well as myself that they didn't give to pick us so we would just have to deal with why we got. It was just a bad situation which caused alot of hard working and dedicated people to look for employment elsewhere."
good,Did not get a review got a job at a doctors office left before my 90 days the job was good I liked it helping customers and making things the pay needs to be better otherwise I liked working here
good,For the most part you are able to complete your job in a timely manner.  Good Environment to work in.  Everyone becomes family together.  A place to stay and work.
good,It is a good place to work if you work hard. The store I work at is really understanding when it comes to family emergencies. I like the face past environment. Need more room for advancement.
good,It was an easy job where everything was explained the way it should be done. If you can listen and follow directions then you can easily work for this company.
good,"Working for Roundy's is always something new.  Everyday there are new challenges to overcome with the merger of Kroger.  With Kroger now acquiring Roundy's, the future or Roundy's looks very promising."
good,Didn’t really like working at Kroger cause of the hours and the pay and the let me go over something that really didn’t consume me so no don’t like Kroger
good,fun work place I would love to go back. I really miss it. I would recommend this job for people who love to work and like the hours. the pay was great so were the people.
good,"Worked there for 4 years ,same shift. Hours began to decline if you were not available for any shift they wanted you on. My hours went from 40 hours a week down to 1 day a week. Was forced to leave because i needed full time"
good,"Kroger is a great work family to be a part of. Every day is pretty similar when it comes to job duties whether you're bagging groceries, checking out customers, or stocking shelves. The most difficult part is probably how repetitive it gets but the most enjoyable is having all of your coworkers there to back you up."
good,"Every job has its up and downs but you just have to work hard, do the job completely and correctly Would like to keep more on the shelf but I don't do the ordering. ."
good,"enjoyed itn and loved the employees very nice and most of the hiring managers were nice some were tough,, but i do miss it every day and i want to go back"
good,bagged groceries for customer and loaded into customers car if needed. took back items back to store sheves. retreived grocery buggies.swept and cleaned front entrances and bathrooms
good,"I had a great manager in the shrink department who let me have a flexible schedule for my growing family. However, opportunities to advance were limited."
good,"I like working fast passes job, but some jobs takes 7 days just get 40 hours I need more hours. I love working in a grocery store customer service. Need more hours"
good,super flexible scheduling especially for students. employee discount of 10% off all store brand items. easy to transfer in store to different departments or out of store to different store locations.
good,"As a cashier the work was Fast paced,  and friendly.  The flexible schedules worked well for me. "
good,"Very fast paced work, you never had a slow day.  Friendly employees who were helpful."
good,"Was only there a month an in that time i felt very appreciated, i enjoyed my job. The managers where very enthusiastic and they made me felt like i belonged to a real team."
good,"As in all retail stores, staffing is a huge issue. We are also a union store, and pay is NOT fair on any scale. "
good,Managers have been very supportive and allow you to work around your other job.  They allow you to be productive without micro managing.  They compliment you on your work and thank you all the time.  Pay is way too low compared to other related businesses.  I really enjoy the regular customers who always asking how you are.  The most unfortunate part about the culture is the lack of work ethic by the younger associates.
good,"learn how to slice meat and cheese and cook chicken "
good,"I am usually the 3rd shift which mean 6:30pm to 11:30pm but I would love overnight shift but I close up. I take out the trash, wipe down the fuel pumps, and lock up the merchandise when we close."
good,Kroger’s pay isn’t great. There are no benifits for a employee that has been there for a few years. The only way to get benefits is to full time. Unless you get lucky in the company most people spend more than 6 years before getting full time. However for a highschool or college student Kroger is really flexible with hours.
good,"Store is usually busy, "
good,Being a cashier at Dillons was my first job and I stuck with it throughout the end of my high school years and up until present. Team work and customer interaction are very important while working at this job. I loved working for the company! Overall a great experience!
good,"great place to work weather it is  your first job and your looking to get some experience or looking for a second job with a bit of flexibility,Kroger truly has some of the best people working in management"
good,"Very welcoming and willing to assist an individual in reaching goals if you are motivated. If you need more hours this would not be a place to consider; as hours are most likely going to be on a part time basis for a while, as a new employee"
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was the non-cashier role of stocking, unloading semi-trucks of their pallets of groceries, restocking shelves and dairy, helping customers find items and working with my fellow clerks."
good,"Job duties include stocking product, keeping up to date with freshness, making floral arrangements, filling out in person orders, phone orders and faxing delivery orders."
good,This company was pretty good to me. I had this job during my high school years. I learned how to keep things well organized around the store. I would recommend this job to students.
good,"I was working at Pick N Save for 5 years while going to college.  The hours were flexible and I was also able to change my schedule around to accommodate my school schedule.  It didn't pay a lot, but I was able to take care of my daughter while I was in school.  I left right after I graduated from college and I recommend any college student to work here."
good,"Liked working there, the leadership team was great. I was part-time and needed more hours, but received 20 or less hours per week. Not getting enough hours"
good,"It was a very straightforward job, but there was little to no room to move up in the company as a bagger. I tried to move departments and was denied. Also as a bagger/cart pusher your pay maxes out at $8.50/he while everyone else starts at $8.50/he with a $0.50/hr raise every six months."
good,"While I worked for the Kroger company, I was advanced pretty quickly, but had very little promise to advance again. The store supervisor was very proficient and kept the store afloat until last year. Most of the managers were approachable and very informative. Unfortunately, I had to deal with a manager that was rude about race, sexuality, and personal lives of her coworkers."
good,it a good place to work idk what happened but they wouldn't let me take the days I told them before I started working off and ended up fire me stupid reason but I was put on a do not hire list now I cant work there anymore its like they never even gave me a chance to redeem
good,"just fine i liked it and it was great, lots of time on your feet and lots of customer service. mostly good. i liked the people who worked there and the culture"
good,The customers and workers are always friendly. Everyone is helpful and they try to maintain a clean and family orientated environment. My favorite part of the job were definitely the customers they always treated with respect were loyal.
good,"The management is very supportive and helpful.  There is a relaxed work environment, and there is a team environment among the workers. I enjoy being able to communicate with the general public."
good,Kroger is an awesome place to work at and I would love to go back anytime. I'm currently reapplying for christmas so I can continue to futher my career up the ladder.
good,"For someone looking to make some extra money on the side, Kroger in an easy place to work. The work is menial and repetitive but not too stressful or physically demanding. Nice, easy part time job."
good,Lots of advancement opportunities . Has overall been a good company to work for. I do feel they have too many bosses in the company so the structure can be improved.
good,I enjoy working at kroger but it isnt really any teamwork there. They give you good benifits but you have to work there at least a year. Other than that its a good job
good,"I enjoyed the Store Clerk (data entry) position.  "
good,I didnt like  the  manger because she always had a  attitude all the  time. The hours  wasnt enough and I  only work three days out of a  week. I need  more hours.
good,I really enjoy working at Kroger and it think it has so much potential. I think that every company always has room for improvement and seeing them and being able to help out with that is an amazing experience.
good,Love working at my job very great service and nice people to work around I learned everything I need to know about working in deli workflace is fun and also alot busy
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was the people I had the pleasure of working with, also providing customer service to the clients who came to the mailroom"
good,"At the store in which I worked at it was a friendly place to be. But lately, the friendliest has left the store. The management air has changed , which filters down to the employees.   employees no longer care  as much as they were before."
good,"Great place to work, helpful co-workers and even the customers, breaks are given when appropriate. The managers are nice to approach and discuss anything."
good,i greeted each customer and help with assitance if needed i would ring up each item bag each item and check them out very fast pasted at times but it was very fun
good,"I have worked for Kroger at two different times. The second time was much better than the first, but Kroger is not the best place to work. If you are looking for a starter job, working for Kroger is a great experience. The Kroger I worked had many great people working there. I loved working with my coworkers. The management could have been better but over all Kroger is a great place to work if you are just starting out."
good,"flexible schedule, casual atmosphere, friendly coworkers and management and  friendly customers."
good,"Kroger helped me find my ideal job search. It is with people. Be it associates, or customers, I find pleasure in helping and assisting.. Another pleasure is seeing one of your hires being promoted."
good,"Kroger is a great company to start with. I never really used the benefits, considering i was there from 16-18 and was still on my parents' insurance plans! However, i like the fact that they do offer benefits and paid vacations. I always had great hours. However, i was quickly promoted as a supervisor/customer service and i did that for about 2 hours... I was still getting paid the same as a starting cashier so that's why i had to leave. Other than that, if you don't plan on moving up in the company, it is a great place to start with."
good,"overall good place to work , but although i was part time making minimum wage at the time i still had to be a union member and pay union dues even though i had next to no benefits from the union"
good,turnover from previous employ.   Start paperwork or run cash register clean as needed and stock when supply comes in .  Bank deposits and look for errors made by employees on other shifts if they are not found.  turnover to next emoployee
good,"When being in school is your first priority this is a great job.  Flexible hours is key with this company, that makes it easy if you attend school. I would recommend this company to anyone."
good,Working at Kroger taught replsponsibility at a young age. It also taught me to take pride in what I did as a job. Satisfaction of customers always came first and that was a very big deal
good,"It is a great work environment, hard to move up with the whole seniority thing. Starting at the bottom did not get good hours, what ever was left. Great benefits though."
good,Always busy! but gotta love it. i learned how to grow and figure out what to do in difficult situations. most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the people you see everyday
good,"It is a very fast-paced pharmacy. You learn something new almost every day, but the pharmacists are amazing. My pharmacy manager is very understanding and is willing to help with anything. Great learning opportunity for interns and students in pharmacy school."
good,Weekends get busy depending on the location of the store and how many other competitors are in the area as well. Fast pace environment when busy. Hardest part is when other associates aren't willing to do the work to be productive.
good,You really have to know how to balance your work and life. Hard work and dedication pay off that help you get promoted and noticed with in upper management
good,I like it so far. The people are great. The job itself is not difficult. Great for a starter job but I hear if you keep with the company it can really benefit you.
good,I believe this job is for starters. This was my very first job. I loved it. It's just so hard to move up and over those 3 years I knew i had enough talent to become something bigger. So I left this company and got a job as an assistant manager. If they really looked at how I worked and was a easy job to move up in. I would still be at kroger right now.
good,i really enjoyed working for a Kroger company such as Food 4 Less. You meet and greet lots of people. which helps you with you social skills. Great place to work.
good,During my time at Kroger I learned valuable people skills and how to work as a team. The employees and management staff were always pleasant and did they're best to satisfy the customer.
good,"Kroger is a usually busy store, so a typical day will leave you feeling tired. I have acquired customer service and communication skills while a Kroger. The most enjoyable part about the job are the friendly interactions you have with regular customers and employees."
good,I started at this store in high school and have been here for 8 years now. It's not a bad place to work but the pay for part time employees is terrible.
good,i liked working for kroger but unfortunately had to leave because i was moving to texas. i liked the environment with the customers and helping them find what they were looking for.
good,like most retail food stores it all depends on which department toy work in their are a lot of opportunities to move up and they pay very based on past work
good,"I enjoyed my time at Kroger as a cashier/customer service representative. Being that this was my first job, I learned a lot of great skills! I learned how to do inventory, how to be a shift leader, how to handle transactions and complete summaries, etc. The culture was nice, but the work ethic of the staff was mediocre. The hardest part was leaving because I enjoyed what I did, but the most enjoyable part was putting a smile on my customers' faces."
good,When working with medicine it's very important to take time to make sure everything is correct before submitting information. This job showed me a lot of patience and also improved my skills with paying close attention. I loved Kroger but I needed better pay.
good,"Although I worked at Kroger for a short time I enjoyed working closely with customers and had great relationships with my coworkers. Everyone in the Kroger family is just that, family."
good,"I love working with the public and working in a fast pacing job. The company is a great company to work for but I felt like if you give your all, you should be recognized."
good,Its a great place to learn how to build in fix stuff wen it tears up. But its a good job in good money.In then u get to get out in meet people in learn.
good,"A normal day of a Deli worker, usually is easy. Kroger makes its fun and easy. Always having something going on. They bring a smile to your face, makings working there  a pleasure."
good,Working at Kroger has given me various skills to apply for bigger and more opportunistic jobs. Kroger is a fast paced work environment with supportive management and a great place to work.
good,Enjoyed this job and coming into contact with various customers from near and far. I enjoyed running a cash register and bagging customers' groceries.
good,"My job requires a great deal of customer interaction. It can also be very fast paced depending on the day and time. You may have a lot to do in a short amount of time, but that makes for a great work day."
good,"When I worked at Kroger it was a fun time, the whole yearly work i did was good for my first job. I enjoyed it alot and if i ever go back home to indiana maybe i could work there again."
good,Kroger usually had nice people to work with and very nice people to work for. Management was always the best. The customers could test you sometimes though.
good,I would like to see more investment in employees growth. It seems that the company will pay more for an external employee than to promote internally. Overall good company.
good,"Working at Kroger was not always easy due to unexpected custumer rushes. I was required to bag for multiple cashiers and work at a high pace leavel. Custumers would require help and as where certain items are located. Management was great at their jobs and always asked employies how work could be easy, what resources where needed over others. Some of the hardships of working at Kroger was bagging at very high paces for long periods of time, retreiving carts in harsh conditions. Also while working with Kroger i built many friendships and bonds with my fellow employies and managers, even today i stay in contact."
good,I enjoyed my brief time with Kroger.  Management seemed to run a tight ship and being on the front lines of the store was a welcome challenge.
good,"The ability and accuracy to transcribe and fill of patient prescriptions, verifying patient information and insurance, along with professional customer service and"
good,"It was a good place to work.  From working there I did form alot of contacts and friendships that have lasted me.  That has been with both my co-workers and the management staff.  The con I had was that the pay was very small.  The good thing about Management is that they were willing to work with your schedule.  The hardest part of my job was to train new employees.  That was especially difficult being the Kroger has a high level of employee turnover.  I added to my computer skills through the use of the cash register and inventory analysis.  Those are very important skills at Kroger.  Also, I was known as the most timely employee and was often used as an example in attendance.  That is because many of my shifts began at 7:00 am."
good,kroger was a very good place to work always greeting the customer with a smile wether the cutomer is angry or not. always cheerful people. working the cash register was a good way to see all the inventory they had and to see different or even the same faces was delight working at a fast paced speed was always a very fun experience that not everybody had. was a very enjoyable experience.
good,I luv working there plus it also help me wjt HB different ethics and got a good inside in far as running my own business I enjoyed working there but wanted to try something new far as work
good,I enjoyed helping customer's with their shopping needs. Kroger was always flexible with my educational schedule and military service requirements. This was a good company to work for.
good,There is racial discrimination within krogers the pay is not enough nor are the benefits you are not considered full time no matter what .I feel that more equal opportunity and job positions should be offered to all and also wages should be raised
good,"great place to work 50 years ago"
good,Great place to work for very nice people very helpful staff they help me learn everything I needed to know to be my best at doing my job
good,I enjoy being a cashier and being able to interact with the customers on a daily basis. We have customers that shop at the store on a regular and they know me by name.
good,"Cashier, bagger, stocking, accounting, bookkeeping, sales • Data entry company information for corporate, scheduling, audits, deposits, and invoices • Answering multilines and transferring calls to correct department, addressed, research, and resolved customers issues • Supervised the front end department, by administering breaks and lunch for all employees • Assist the cashiers and customer service representatives with any managemen"
good,A great place if your hard working and just getting into retail. Everyone is very nice and helpful to get you on your way to becoming a good retail person. Allows you to have some freedom and has lots of opportunities to advance with in the store.
good,I quit working at Kroger because not only a courtesy clerk put there hands on me but also a supervisor. I reported both and yet not any actions or  consequence was brought upon them.
good,i love my jobs a day at work is to be nice and easy to work at a fast pace i like to keep busy i had great co-workers what else i love the work got time and a half on sundays that was nice i worked all sundays paid vacation and holiday pay
good,Working with customer service is what i love to do. Making sure that i can  make the time on ringing up your order and getting the lines down is what gave me a energy.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Kroger because I didn't only work at the Starbucks kiosk, I was able to branch out and work in and learn more about other departments"
good,"Great people, good culture, quality management. I would highly recommend this place. A good company and work culture with cool perks. This is the last sentence."

Excellent customer service, Communication Skills, Customer Focus, Handling Cash, Team Player, Retail, Leadership, Food Service, Team Leader, Placed new products in racks, Gathered and held shopping carts, Processed returned and scratched products."
good,"Has a Union which is unique in georgia, however they were very good to work for. Customer service goal was great and enjoyed the time I worked for them."
good,"I truthfull love my job, I love working with people and working in customer service. The only reason I am looking for something different is because the hours are not working with my kids/babysitters and daycares."
good,Sometimes you may get the opening and the night shift if you are the new guys but it gets better when you get more experience. You work a average of 4-5 days a week. Co workers were very helpful and management was helpful to a point. Hardest part was being able to held multiple jobs through the day.
good,"First working at Kroger was good until we started having a high turnover of employees, the way the front-end management talk to the employees is horrible."
good,Enjoy working at kroger.  Employees and management easy to get along with.  Everyone works together as a family to get the job done.
good,"I absolutely loved working at Kroger. We were allowed to read on our downtime. I greeted mostly regular customers almost every day. All of my bosses were great. They din't really even feel like bosses, more just like some other people who are here to get work done."
good,I worked there in high-school and i liked it as a first job it showed me organizational skills and how to work adequately in a timely manner
good,"Good atmosphere, get to meet and deal with a lot of people."
good,Everything was great. Did not like the pay or benefits. I loved my management. The store was nice and clean. Fuel center was nice. Whenever I needed time off they gave it to me
good,"Over all good company to work for.Daily task includes greet/meet customers,help their overall experience at Kroger be a good one."
good,I loved my time at kroger. I worked there my junior/senior year of high school and it gave me everything I needed. A great place to socialize with awesome coworkers and a little extra cash to spend. The pay wasn't amazing but I was in high school- i didn't need much.
good,"very nice coworkers and customers, very enjoyable place to work. I learned so much from all of the pharmacy staff, very fast paced work, with a lot of multi-tasking. Flexible scheduling and understanding management."
good,They tret you as if you are a child in ways of micro-managing. Operation manager would come in once a week just to belittle you in front of other associates and customers.
good,"Overall, Fred's is a great place to work because of the simple job requirements: As long as you do the work, there will always be a job for you. There wasn't a large amount of skills needed other than friendliness and charisma to help customers. If you ever needed more hours, you could get them. If you ever wanted to trade hours, you just needed someone to agree to trade with you. Things like this meant job security with a flexible schedule. My only complain is that sometimes I got too many hours."
good,While working at Kroger i noticed an involvement in the community that was always making a difference in progressing the company and the community itself.
good,They play favorite with hours. Most the managers act like they are 15. Gossip is really bad at most krogers. no one cleans. Nasty environment. they start you off at barley minimum wage.
good,"I loved working at Kroger just some bad managers. "
good,I learned alot with my 6 years of kroger. It is a fast paced environment where alot is expected of you. My days were never boring and the people always made it better!
good,Large facility with great professional growth. Operations run 24/7 to supply stores with product and consumables with efficiency and speed. The consumer is #1.
good,"Working for The Kroger Company was a great experience. The supervisors that I worked for were very insistent on Pharmacy Interns learning on the job. The amount of computer based learning was minimized, and the time on the floor was maximized. During my time, I was asked to help with other employees training, and to assist in selecting future hires. The flexibility given to us by regional management was incredible, we were empowered to make things right. If this meant price adjusting a medication for a customer that had experienced an error to compensate them, we did so. Most large companies are inflexible with expectations, such as flu shot expectations. At Kroger, we were given incentives, financially to increase the number dispensed, and if we shone at one area, that would be factored into the assessment of our store, and could negate lacking areas so that the store would be considered great overall."
good,"I've Been working here for almost 11 months and I have enjoyed my experience. with supportive employees ."
good,"A typical day at work was just slow and very long. I learned to better my communication skills and develop good relationships with employers."
good,"Very faced paced, flexible hours, friendly co-workers. I have gained more experience working with the public. Customer Service is priority."
good,"A typical day at work consisted on doing whatever the management team needed me to do that day. I usually worked on new hires and recruiting though I had to also help up front with registers, running floor, front office and any and all extra work the manager needed help with. Examples, some days i would help with sales, updating the morning paperwork, team huddles, and such. I also helped in any department that was short, or backed up. I helped with tags, labeling, stocking, floral arrangements , deli foods, etc. Wherever I  was needed that day and even finishing my job needs. The hardest part of my job would have to be handling the negativity i got from others above me in years with the company because i had moved up with the company pretty fast. & was put in supervised positions when needed. The most enjoyable part was helping others!!! Rather it be helping by giving someone a job opportunity, or ringing their groceries up, unloading their carts, or helping them out to their vehicle. I loved helping others!"
good,Kroger's had a very friendly work environment. Supervisors were always willing to help with projects. Coworkers always helped out when needed.
good,"There's great benefits and decent money to be made if you serve the time. It's nice being in the AC and heat."
good,A typical day is very very busy frying chicken and customer service and cleaning to regulation standards. I learned patient and how to do certain back-stocks. Management is very good and they are always on any pressing issues they are very hardworking and through.My coworkers all work as team and work very hard. Hardest part would be back to back customer orders.My customers are the best part of my job i love them all.
good,Kroger is a good and professional company. Good bosses and good coworkers. Bosses let you work without being overbearing.
good,Great job to learn about distribution and warehouse work but very labor intensive with long mandatory hours. Volcalect system is better then the voxlex system used in other warehouses. Warehouse is clean and management is good.
good,"It's All fast paced, once you look up from working your already half way through work, then once you go to lunch and look up again back at work your already off work."
good,Kroger was all about helping the customer's needs. When I wasn't helping customers I was stocking shelves and checking inventory. The management was amazing and I always felt like I belong there. I would have stayed if there was more money and better hours being offered
good,"I really liked this job. resetting was fun and it occupy my time. The "
good,"I was a curtesy clek at the company and in general we come in every clock in first; during our shifts we bag groceris, put carts into the store, sweep the floor and cleaning the bathroom if needed, and put back the iteams that wasn't pruchased if the customer did not want it; then we clock out. But for me, since was good at putting iteams back that wasn't purchased, that was my job when store closed for being 24 hours; so that was my special assignment working overnight, 5 days a week for 8 hours."
good,I have nothing but positive things to say about Marianos Fresh Market. It is a great company to work for and they have treated me with nothing but respect.
good,"A typical day at work for the Kroger company can go both ways. Either slow or busy, and It is frustrating because with the little benefits you require for the struggling job with coworkers that sometimes don't be productive as you do. I learned to handle the job by keeping your head up and putting a smile on your face. Most of the management are very great, and a couple of them not so much. Some of my coworkers are very welcoming and are happy with working and a couple are a little grumpy to work. My favorite part of the job is to get to kn ow my customers. Also represent the Kroger brand the right way. And yet, the hardest part of the job is working with your coworkers and working slow days."
good,"Typical day includes dealing with customers, filling prescriptions, and managing customer profiles. It is an excellent place to work"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of multiple tasks that were not physically or mentally difficult. The expected work load was quite manageable and supervisors expect employees to work hard but not break their backs. I left Roundy's a much better leader with significantly improved social skills.  The management was hands on and very understanding.  I never felt uncomfortable or over worked. Some temporary co-workers were kind of lazy, but overall the workforce was filled with polite, hard working individuals. The hardest part of my job was communicating with people that did not speak english, but it never caused any major problems.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the feeling of accomplishment when I left knowing our shift completed all of the work we were supposed to."
good,"Very friendly co-workers, management is very easy to talk to, in case of any problems occurring in your department. Flexible Scheduling available."
good,"I make routine temperature checks of coolers, stock shelves so there are no holes, load and unload trucks, and run the cash register with excellent customer service."
good,"Working with different project everyday small or big redesigns "
good,It all starts with being excited to go work. You get there and being greeted by fellow co-workers even customers. The relationships you build with the customers and the joy you get and give in helping the customer.
good,Great company to start with when you are young. I have grown a great deal with the training Kroger has provided me with is a great company to work for.
good,the people who work there are friendly and try to acheve the goal of coustmer first.
good,Very fast pace and enjoy working with the elderly on senior citizens day.  Most of the management is very good about seeing that you get your breaks and lunch.  All of the co-workers are great.  The hardest part of the job for me is if you constantly have heavy products to lift over the cash register to scan and reload.
good,"This was my first ""real"" job. I do not remember a lot except the people that I met as customers and co-workers were pleasant and kind."
good,"The hours vary from day to day and week to week, I've learned that the job needs able bodies and man power to stay running. My workplace and coworkers comes from all walks of life. The hardest part of my job is all the continuous lifting on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of my job is making a comfortable living for my family"
good,helped customers have a good shopping experience to find great food with great prices
good,A Typical Day At Work Varies From Day To Day Some Days Are Busy And Some Days Are Slow Overall Its A Great Work Environment
good,Great company from a culture perspective. VP's listen if you aren't whining but make valid points for improvement. Managers are pressured to deliver. Overall a really good company.
good,"I worked front end/cashier, learned a lot, management was good and fair, hardest part was remembering codes, the most enjoyable part was my coworkers."
good,Working with  the public is very exciting.  You learn something new everyday.  Great team to work with on a day to day basis.  Everyone one is friendly and helpful.
good,The only reason why I left oxford 412 store to go to hamilton 909 store was because of the management at oxford because it was not very good and the management treated their employees not very good. Not only that but because there was a open position full time in the customer service desk at hamilton and they wanted me their.
good,Everyday is a challenge..  It affords you the opportunity to meet and engage with customers.  It teaches you diversity and patience.  When you work in a high volume company you have to work with a conglomerate of personalities   I truly enjoy helping the Associates with their work related or personal issues.  Great companies can sometimes have misplaced employees.
good,A typical day at work was busy. I learned the every day common prescriptions and how to see what their value was. The coworkers worked at a steady pace. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the insurance not paying for the prescriptions.
good,"the most enjoyable art about the job was the customers. "
good,"A normal day was to clock in and look up/ask what was needed to be done. I enjoyed staying productive! My managers were fantastic as were my co-workers! I'd say the most difficult part of the job for me, was the physical work in pushing the carts. As for the most enjoyable part, I enjoyed interacting with the people and learning how to separate the foods."
good,The jobs are not hard to preform and the company dosen't ask too much of the workers. Very reasonable company to work for.
good,"a typical day was helping custmoers and bagging there groceries , i learned how to deal with all types of people. The management was okay because they showed me what was wrong and right along with my co-workers espicallly my older co - workers. The hardest part of the job was cleaning the bathrooms , the most enjoyable part of the job was getting tips from the customer who i helped."

good,Ringing groceries up and bagging customers items was a typical day. Co-workers helped out and were nice and caring and great managers.
good,Managers are smart and very well planned alot of team work and team approaches to our everyday work dealing with advertising and also communication with people  of all racis to all ages it's a place where you can b comfortable and feel good about working and helping others from birthday gifts and food to just everyday good high gene plus providing a safe place to shop and b around people who all take safety and respect very important.
good,kroger was my very first job and i completely love the experiences i gained and also the knowledge

good,"Assess  staff ( all scheduled in place),  do a store walk  of each department( making sure all needs are accomplished), meet with vendors,  send in daily report to district  manager, "
good,"I overlooked the diary department, the food organizing, and whenever the front checkers need help id be called. I was the fast bagger,checker in that store, and amazingingly it wasn't my department. When it came to difficult customers and special orders, I would get that handled and customer was always pleased."
good,"Marianos' Is one of the fastest growing businesses in Illinois Its only been open for three years and already has nearly twenty stores in the state. Its already helped put one of its main competitors out of business and is one of the most popular stores around. Its a great place to shop offering as much variety as whole foods without the steep prices. A typical day for me is an afternoon 3p to 10p working the juice bar its a job that is easy but very tedious as you are doing the same thing over and over with little variation. Ive learned patience and understanding for other workers who don't pick up the job as fast. I love the management as well as my coworkers and i get along with everyone very well."
good,"My days were long and my learning never ended. At home I spent several hours a day reading technical manuals, wiring diagrams etc. I had 20 stores that I was responsible for the maintenance from the; front doors, bakery ovens, proofers, deli-slicers, hydraulic card board bailers, powered pallet jacks and powder stock stackers to generators and plumbing."
good,this past year i have learned minor things at this job. i have learned to have good customer service skills. this job has taught me to have great cash handling skills also.this job has been very hectic at times because of the how the store is ran by management. but overall this job has been a great learning experience.
good,"Really going to miss this place.  Lots of great staff, fun atmosphere, great customers."
good,"Great place to work but the schedule was flex 40, not idea for families or planning events on weekdays. Compensation was great and the benefits showed how much the company cared for the people who help to make it what it is."
good,"I opened the seafood case, and very much enjoyed setting the case for the day"
good,"I bagged groceries and helped customers to their cars when they had big orders or needed help with them in general.  I learned a great deal in customer service and what hard work truly is.  Management was good.  They worked around my school schedule well.  My coworkers were all my age at the time and were all very nice people.  The hardest part was knowing what to do when we were not busy and caught up with all of our duties, which was not often..  The most enjoyable part of my job was talking to the people and making them laugh as I helped them to their cars."
good,"I love working for kroger,it was like a big family.They were very supportive of my personal problems."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of counting waiting prescriptions, assisting customers, answering phone calls from doctors and patients, faxing doctor's offices for approvals and refills for patients. The co- workers are very helpful and courteous to each and the pharmacist. Every one is treated with respect and generosity. Management was very biased, some co-workers were talked down upon more than others. Management styles of the job were very uncomfortable. The manager would not like any to talk if it was not referring to something they wanted to talk about, but the co-workers made the job much better."
good,"A typical day at Kroger involved cashiering, maybe having to go get carts, and interacting with the public."

good,I enjoyed working at Kroger for the time I was there.  Good working hours and convenient location.  Good working atmosphere.
good,"A typical day was work hard, stay busy, SMILE!!! I learned a lot in my first two months there considering I was cross trained in three departments though Produce was my main department. Management was good at teaching your skills, but hard to work with when it came to issues with other employees. The hardest part of the job was the workload and learning more than one department at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people, customer and co-workers alike. So many different personalities."
good,I enjoyed making people smile as they would come through my line to check out their groceries and the people I worked with were great and fun.
good,hardest part was graveyard but that wasn't too bad  easy job enjoyed what I was doing

good,"Helping customers. Bagging groceries. "
good,"typical day requires a lot of work and a lot of self-control, learned everything there is to know about grocery and retail as this was my first job, learned a lot of customer service here as well, co-workers are very well mannered however manager i had didn't care to much about the place, he no longer works there thanks to a customer, hardest part would be the cart gathering process, and the most enjoyable was seeing all the people leave my lane with a smile on their face"
good,"A typical day of work at Kroger for me would be stocking fresh produce, offloading the trucks, checking for out of date products, marking down items soon to be going out of date, cleaning organizing the produce cooler into sections for easy access. Cutting fruit to make fruit salads and fruit bowls, interacting and answering customer questions. Assisting customers who need help, running a cash register when help is needed also getting used carts from the parking lot. Maintaining a safe and productive work place. I learned how to be a team player, how to prep fresh produce for the sales floor, how to check for out of date materials , how to organize efficiently , how to assist customers with correct and informative information, how to run a register, count money for drops in the safe. I learned how to build team chemistry and to lead by example. At this particular job my co- workers all were team players and we helped each other to keep the store running as friendly, smoothly and efficiently as possible.There wasn't any hard parts to the job to me. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people everyday and the employess and management were a lot of fun."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of collecting buggies,greeting and assisting customers,bagging groceries,cleaning bathrooms, tacking out the trash,cleaning general work place.I learned the basic cleaning instructions, hard work for long hours, excellent customer service skills, cashier skills, some shipping and handling, stocking and i can work at a fast pace. Non management skills.I got along with all my coworkers well I am a friendly person, positive attitude,and not really a hard job to do.I really enjoyed interacting with customers."
good,"I love working at Kroger. They promote from within, have great benefits, decent pay. They also offer tuition reimbursement. Overall Kroger is a great company to work for."
good,"Amazing place to work, Good place for advancement, Friendly people on a daily basis and you get paid every week! three cheers for Krogers!"
good,"walk in attend to all costumers while handling cash,check,debt, and credit transactions"
good,All around loved it my managers wanted me to learn as much as i could so i can further myself in another field of by learning as much as i could while i was there
good,I enjoyed working at Krogers: it helped me to gain experience with customer service.
good,Enjoyed working with the public. Also worked in the bakery and was a cashier. Then went to the cash office learned to balance til draws.
good,Teaching the customers the fundamentals was awesome. Meeting new people.
good,Fun and exciting with some days being easy and others stressful but in the end a good place to work.
good,"this is a great place to work, it was my first job and it was a great experience. i would go back to the company in a heart beat. The people that worked there were very nice and very helpful. They were more like Family at times."
good,Fred Meyer was a learning experience. I finally found something that I was good at. They are good at promoting from within.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working at Kroger. It was refreshing to work for a company that was consistently giving back to the community.
good,Get to meet new people everyday working with customers. Being able to be held accountable for your work. Love the people I work with.
good,Lots of work
good,Great place to work.The hours are flexible. The pay is great and they treat you like family.
good,"My job duties at this company were simple, I assisted customers in locating and purchasing merchandise and managed money at cash register. I learned customers are always right even if you may think they aren't and if an argument seems to come about, do not disagree with the customer, have a manager come help solve the problem. My co-workers were nice people, they seemed to help me in every way possible. The hardest part of the job was putting back items that may melt while also assisting customers at the register because we were always very busy. The manager was nice and funny, helps the day go by faster when someone is making you smile. The most enjoyment I had at this employer was my involvement with the customers, they had some pretty interesting conversations."
good,"Working at Kroger has taught me so much, but most of all hard work ethic. A typical day at Kroger is a test. They test your work ethic more so than your knowledge. Most people at Kroger don't begin where they end up. I began as a bagger, and worked my way through produce, dairy, and eventually to the meat department. Management saw something good in me, and transferred me there. I began as a lunchmeat clerk, working nights and running and rotating lunchmeat. I was soon trained to cut meat, and began working different shifts. During this time, I had a negative head meat cutter that didn't see what Management saw in me, and he acted as such. But that didn't detour me, and I transferred to another store upon moving in a new apartment. At this new store, I was well-trained in cutting meat by several different Head Meat Cutters and Assistant Meat Cutters. After which, I trained to become a Seafood Manager. I was very successful at this for about three years, but I still trained in the meat shop when I finished my seafood work. After three years of being a Seafood Manager, I was again promoted to Assistant Meat Manager. I retained this position for about three years, and transferred stores. The last store I worked at, the seafood manager stepped down. I was more than able to fulfill his position, and still provide the meat department with assistance when I finished my seafood work. The most enjoyable part of this job, was getting to know your crew. I believe if you have harmony within your work crew, you will have harmony within your work. Our staff got along really well, and we laughed"
good,"Working at Kroger pharmacy on a typical day is very fast paced. We are number one in the mid-south region, which means that the company expects alot from us. Our customers are number one priority and we have to make sure that we meet company standards as far as keeping our areas clean and organized. We have to make sure that we follow through with patient requests to doctor offices and provide fast and quality service to our customers."
good,"I learn how to do presentation with the meat case and learned to slice and package, I learned to order and to stock, My main concern was Custormers orinated and the second was cleaning and keeping the department clean. each item cooked or cold had to have a ceratain temperature. I enjoy learning and working in the Deli. my one greatest achievment was working with someone that could go ahead and do their work with standing over them although there are times to help them.............I am very friendly and got along with everyone. that is what makes my day. I come to work knowing there may be a bad day . i leave the bad day at home and put a smile on my face and began. if someone comes in with a bad mood i have them smilin in no time and work related begans."
good,I use to hate the work and did not enjoy myself at all but working here really change me now Im a hard work and learned so much..
good,i leared how to enteract with people. i learned quality service. i was at my best with customer serice and communication skills. i also had a great time but could not maintain the job while in high school because of the distance.
good,"It was a friendly productive place to work.I enjoyed talking with customers,and constantly moving around."
good,If I hadn't relocated to another state I believe I would have been still working for KROGER.
good,"Like most jobs, it was a little difficult sometimes working the menial buzz day to day. However, there was almost always, at some point throughout the day, where either any one of my fellow employees or a customer would manage to make my day either exciting or actually enjoyable. Management was about a 50-50 split, because you had some that were good and some that were bad, but in either way they balanced each other out. The most enjoyable part of the job was the hardest part of the job, which was putting the customer first no matter what."
good,It was a great learning experience and opportunity to gain accreditable customer service and skills. Provided a wide spectrum of different cultures and people to work with and learn from. Management was caring and easy to communicate with while still providing a stern work environment. I enjoyed working with customers and getting to know every customer to help in customer satisfaction and appreciation.
good,"everybody on the night staff got along very well,hardest part was working on holidays but has to be done,"
good,"As a co-manager I was responsible for the direct supervision of over 100+ employees in a store with weekly sales of approximately $1m. In this constant changing environment I was able to develop my managing style and effective communication skills with not only employees, but customers as well.."
good,"It was a decent place to work. Management is friendly and atmosphere is pretty laid back. Although my job was not at the least easy, I enjoyed my coworkers very much and will miss them! I was attending school while working and they were very accommodating to my schedule."
good,Introduction into the working world of managment. Learned cashier skills and customer service.
good,"it was a job, i really didnt like some of the people there. Your co-worker can be rude at times."
good,"The Kroger Co. is one of the largest retail food companies in the United States as measured by total annual sales. We span many states with store formats that include grocery and multi-department stores, convenience stores and mall jewelry stores. We operate under nearly two dozen banners, all of which share the same belief in building strong local ties and brand loyalty with our customers."
good,i would say this company tries to keep its employees happy and its customers happier . management could use some improvements but overall its a fantastic place to work.
good,I really enjoyed working at kroger because my coworkers and manager were helpful and encouraged me to do more and the location was very convenient for me.
good,i loved working for Kroger . managment was questionalble but the staff around you and the environment was great . it was a happy friendly feeling just being there
good,All the employees at Kroger treat one another with respect and same is said about the managers as well. The location is accessible and the hours that they give me are fair. Everything in management seems to be well organized and overall I like working there.
good,Kroger is a good corporate citizen and a well-run business.  I am pleased with their training and management supervision and the job itself.   I wish I had discovered retail floor work at Kroger in my early 20s.  The benefits are quite good too.  And my co-workers are nice to work with.
good,"You will work, but you will learn, too.  Management works with you to help you have a schedule that works well for you and family, helpful, supportive, fun and loyal."
good,"Management is different at every store, but for the stores I worked at they help you succeed and teach you skills. Difficult to promote, I only recently promoted last few months within my 3 years of working, and it was because of a change of store."
good,"Kroger offers a lot of benefits to full-time employees, but most of those are not available to part-time workers. The company really emphasizes customer relations, and it is a great place to get experience working in customer service."
good,The last time I checked they put a bin in the back by the garbage. Not where I would’ve put it. But I understand they’re just doing their best. Much appreciated. Always check the expiration date before anyone puts in or takes anything out!
good,"I worked at Mariano's for almost a year, it was great experiences. I had some drama with co-workers but it all got figured out. I enjoyed the benefits, and the management. I left because I was moving out of state."
good,"Working as a barista was great overall. The staff was amazing, leads demanded a heathy, drama free work space. The store manager’s handled everything as professional as possible. Lastly all employees around the store are generally nice n always have a smile"
good,"Good company to work for, good benefits, every day you learn something new. Many associates complain about long hours of working, but retail is likes this."
good,Kroger is a great company to work for. I developed professionally and personally by being an employee of a Kroger banner.  In my opinion one of the best companies to work for in the United States.
good,"I learned a lot of time-management, interpersonal and communication skills in my three years of working here. I loved the workplace culture and made lots of friends while employed here. The worst part of the job is how often managers change stores and that Kroger is part of a union so you could not just go ask for a raise. The best part about working there was the friends I made and the flexibility I had with my schedule."
good,Liked the job and all yet I never got full time and little pay tips were good at times during holiday I would go back if higher pay and gave me full time with benefits
good,If you are willing to put in the work this company will have your back. They will work with you as long as you are a hard worker. Show up every day and apply yourself and you will go places!
good,I loved working at kroger I wish I could have my job back. The employees are like family but you always got that one that starts stuff but other than that kroger was a wonderful place to work
good,It could be stressful if there's not enough people to work when there's a lot of orders and customers are picking up order.  When there's nothing to do it could get pretty boring.
good,"The benefits are excellent, better than most you get at other jobs. Health benefits are huge for me, and kroger has given me the best to work with so far. The staff is usually very polite and fun to work with as well as get along with."
good,I learned working at Kroger that I have to remain patience. Also if you really want something you have to work harder than everyone else around even if the opportunity you are looking for is not coming your way.  Also always remain calm and show your a great leader
good,"Excellent team work"
good,A good company that cares. Advancements are there. Poor management in south end Kroger. Employees are great. They offer free meals so that's a plus. Give it a shot
good,Overall great experience. Highly recommend. Have worked from hourly to management. Work can be challenging and requires individuals that are up to the challenge.
good,Lots of helpful co workers. Management are understanding and generally care about their employees. Flexi le shifts to fit almost anyone's life.  Good work environment and friendly customers.
good,"Challenging and rewarding. Good possibility for advancing.  Must be able to adapt to change, and execute new programs efficiently.  Good Customer skills are crucial."
good,It’s a great place to work really. The people I work with are nice. It’s always busy. Just wish the  Corporation would quit changing so many things somethings are just best left the way they were.
good,"I started as an assistant manager/pharmacist, sharing duties with the PIC."
good,"This was by first job when I was 17 years old. I started as a bagger and worked my way up until eventually working as a supervisor and then to a pharmacy technician. The job was great for a young kid, but also offered many benefits to someone that was wanting to stay with this company."
good,"Enjoyed Kroger emincly. Retired in 2013 Started out as a meat clerk, 2 years I was meat manager @ Middletown market place. I would return and probably will, getting bored after 6 years of retirement"
good,"A typical day can be pretty busy. "
good,"As a workplace, Kroger is a fun and supportive environment and a great job for someone starting out. Definitely has taught me many of the skills I needed to found a healthy and productive work life. I am provided lots of opportunities to learn and grow and the benefits have been superb. "
good,It wasn't really a hard job. You deal with the typical thing in retail. The hardest part was probably the angry unsatisfied customers you have to deal with but overall it was a good job.
good,Job was a great place to work at only reason I stopped working at Kroger is because I moved from Kokomo other than that I would’ve still been working there
good,Overall a very good place to work. If one seeks advancement the culture allows this to happen. Growth in the company is available also. Also good place to be for students and retirees.
good,"Working at Kroger was a fantastic experience that taught me how jobs in the real world worked.  I was required to be on time, do my job well, and have great customer service, all skills that will help me in the future."
good,"I worked in the garden center so i mainly watered plants, forklift soil when it needed to be purchased, and helped switch old dead flowers with new ones."
good,"My managers were super flexible with my hours and worked around all of my extra curriculars. The benefits are not good, at least for a part time cashier, but the pay was decent and I loved all of my managers."
good,"I've been thrilled with the amount of autonomy and leadership Kroger has provided to me.  In talking to other project managers, they felt the same way.  Kroger entrusts significant responsibility to PMs."
good,"I have been a customer of"
good,"Good place to work, good management, nice benefits. They were very fast paced to deal efficiently in the high demands of their guests needs. Kroger's is a union company so they did extra union dues from paychecks."
good,great first job for teensagers. wouldnt suggest working there unless ur in school or something. its a great fisrt job but only pays low. unless you're there forever you wont make any money realls
good,I loved this job and the people I meet working here. But they do need upgrades to deli & bakery equipment (really the whole store). The pay was not so good for the amount of hours that were being given.
good,I have crossed trained in a few positions here at the Vinton store. I have a pretty decent supervisor and some of the employees are good. I am excited to start my new position in pharmacy soon!
good,"All employees are hard working, helpful and friendly. The managers on this store however are less than enthusiastic about helping or talking to their employees. As a bakery clerk I did all jobs in the bakery except the morning bake. Heavy lifting in needed to do an opening shift and a lot of memorizing prices and dates. Cake decorating was the best part of the job because i got to use my degree and my artistic mind. Overall the job itself is manageable and coworkers made it enjoyable."
good,My over all review was fine at Kroger’s it was a nice environment to work at I actually like it a lot besides they were slacking on the hours so I just decided to leave.
good,I really enjoy all the discounts that come with being a Kroger employee. It has really helped save me a lot on groceries and miscellaneous items. My co workers are great as well.
good,I love my job. I have been with Kroger for 10 years now and continue to learn new things daily. Kroger is all about being friendly and fresh. I pride myself on providing my customers with the very best.
good,Good to work at the store but pay suck good friend and company other then that would not recommend it to anyone most people thier are lazie and rude and gossip to much and you have to work. Standing up no sits only 15min brakes
good,"If you like talking with people this is a great place. If the management is good, then you will grow positively as a sales professional. It is competitive because there is commission and goals to meet but that doesn't mean the co workers are not nice nor supportive."
good,"I was in the deli and it was always pretty busy, learned about meats and chesses.  Management was very good and equal to everyone.  The hardest part of a deli server was remembering all the meats and cheeses."
good,I enjoyed working for Kroger and despite poor management here and there I had an overall enjoyable work experience and the company seemed to be improving as time went on
good,"Made sure product was available in freezer. Took cookie or pies out of freezer, baked, and packaged for customers. Made sure ovens were properly kept clean and temperatures were correct."
good,I had good day at work each days I work  I learn how bag up groceries put up stock and  work in deli  the management was so nice to me the worker was nice and sweet
good,"Great work place ."
good,"management worked with you on your hours, if you needed time off that was usually not a problem, management was good to all the employees, when something needed to be done they would ask nicely to be done, everyone got along and worked productively."
good,It's w very physical demanding job. Lots of lifting and moving. Good money when youre broke. Do your job and get out. They serve good food on Thanksgiving.
good,I loved working for Kroger and just a great place to work and the managers I worked with was a great group also they were always willing to help with anything you needed
good,At the Kroger work place you just have to be friendly and always have a smile in your face. If you want to call off ask some of your coworkers if they can take your shift before you call off
good,Kroger was a great place to work for I have to learn so many stairs with Kroger I work with money how to work produce the process of breaking down the pallets learned to get along with other associates learn to handle customers in a nice peaceful it teach for a wonderful company to work for
good,I liked working at Kroger because it's like having another family outside of your home . Everyone is friendly and helpful and the work experience is great
good,"Working at Kroger was easy going until i started my freshman year in college, they would schedule me for work when i had class. gave them my class schedule and everything ."
good,"It was a good job see a lot of familiars in the area. When i worked there i was too young to take on any other role that is why i chose to leave, pushing carts was not for me."
good,My time with this company has been incredible. Although each store is quite different so I can only speak for the inner city stores. They tend to be more family oriented and loving to one another. We have less employees than the market place stores so that may be the reason. I totally recommend them as a place of work for any walk of life.
good,"I honestly enjoyed every moment working for the Kroger Co. from the time I clocked in , to the time I clocked out , I loved every second of being there. Kroger was like my second home."
good,Great and friendly worker environment and above average work place stress during rush hours. Average scheduling and planning of shifts to appropriately provide adequate experience.
good,"Kroger is a great place to work if you are in college, they worked well with me. I was able to go to school during the day and when I got out of class I worked 4 hours 4 times a week. They are a great place to work if your in college."
good,"A typical day was sometimes early, and i would organize my area and get my station ready to help customers. I learned a lot about how to carry myself around customers and how to greet people and help with a positive outlook on every situation.Management was alright but i didn't appreciate some of y managers attitude but again, i always try to look on the bright side.The hardest part, i would say there wasn't anything i couldn't do but probably the pushing carts was most difficult. And i enjoyed helping people and being around good coworkers and in a safe environment."
good,"Great place to work, friendly environment, clean store, management is good too. The most enjoyable part of the day is meeting new people, and attending work activities"
good,"I met some some nice people, and learned many new skills; cash handling, communication, organization, fast paced working, etc. The schedules were consistent and well balanced. Some times management was hard to get in touch with because of their hours."
good,"I loved working for the Kroger company. I never would have left if I could have found 1 in Leominster, Ma. to transfer to. I had no problems with the job."
good,theemployees were nice they were mature and well mannered the management teamwere respectful of everyones needs and were supportive of my personal needs.
good,"Tasks are expected to be done quickly and properly, while providing the best possible help tot he customer. Kroger is a great place to work, with many opportunities to grow and expand."
good,It was a very fun place to work at. You make very close friends that you work with. Very relaxed place and the environment felt very comforting to feel like you fit there
good,"Depending on where they needed me, it could be hectic. Dairy was a huge challenge consistently. Order times, dates rotation, cleanliness, customer service."
good,"Days began with surveying the produce sections, seeing what needs to be refilled, followed by going to the freezer, and grabbing what was necessary. This would lead into creating fruit bowls for purchase and display. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the interactions with the customers."
good,I worked in the deli and bakery and I enjoyed it. I liked putting things in the display. Making and bagging the breads. Pricing items and doing inventory. My co-workers were enjoyable.
good,The krogers that i had worked for was excellent with their management skills. Loved the people and the job. Interacting with the people there sometimes would make my day. I would give anything to go back there and work for krogers again.
good,"I love stocking pay was good. but I had a hard time getting back to work, so I had to find something better. so I went to Walmart. but they pay well. I would love to go back"
good,It was a fun job to do but it was kind of stressful at the same time. A lot of people depended on u to do things that wasn’t even in you job description but it was definitely a good experience.
good,"Kroger's was one of the best jobs, I loved the people they were very welcoming and understanding, the manger's really worked with my schedule when I was in school. The only bad thing was the pay sucked tho I'd had experience."
good,This was my very first job so I'd say it prepared me a lot for the real world. It wasn't as intense as the waitressing positions I've held but I definitely benefit from the lessons I learned like how important time management is and having a strong work ethic.
good,"A typical day at Kroger can be an emotional roller coaster at times.  What I mean is that there is never a dull moment when it comes to customers.  At Kroger you learn great customer care skills and sales skills.   Working at Kroger you have to be good with change.  Change happens all the time regarding customers wants and needs, store changes, product changes etc.  "
good,"I had to leave due to personal issues, but it was a great job to work for. I would recommend. Great staff, wonderful hospitality co-workers, it also was right by my house which is perfect for me."
good,Working at Kroger was a good experience for me because it was a good environment for me to further build and smooth my customer service experience....
good,always something different to do and learn the management team is always willing lend a helping hand if you have any kind of problem personal or work related.
good,"Kroger is a strong and competitive company with an eye always focused on the future.  They have competitive benefits, but wages tend to be below the industry average.  Their focus on products and quality is top notch."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Kroger it was one of the best companies i worked for. Great team, awesome learning experience and great managers overall."
good,A lot of different jobs you will have inside the company. Pays well and have a very good group of people in charge. Although you sometimes work in cold conditions it is a great job.
good,"I left my position when the corporate office cut the hours in my department. Our local store was a good place to work, but the hours I had left little time for family in the evenings."
good,It was a job I liked but the pay was absolutely horrible I couldn't and didn't have enough every week to pay my bills and rent or buy what I needed for my kids.
good,"I worked for Kroger for over 37 years. I would not have retired except I became disabled. After over 37 years of walking  and standing on those concrete floors, I have the feet of a 100 year old man."
good,Kroger is an ok place to work as a part time job if you need extra money ! I wouldn't really recommend it cause the pay is just minimum wage and not the best but overall it's a great place and the environment is enjoyable .
good,"This job helped me learn a lot of responsibility when I was in high school, fair pay and good hours. I would recommend this job to anyone wanting a reliable job and good workplace."
good,"Working for Krogers was a great learning experience, and that learning experience equiped me to a lot of things. I was taught, and self taught on how to work with money etc. Interacting with customers was a must, and just to see smile upon their faces made my day. I also made it clear that I would like to volunteer for any work that would allow me to get more positions. When you are a customer please believe that when you are at Kroger they will assist you with the amazing service with a complementary smile."
good,the only thing i didnt like was they knew my situation and knew what was going on in my life and didnt honor a doctors note stating i was at the hospital with my mom and was terminated for being at the hospital with my mother people i worked with were great
good,Overall great company just depends on who you work with daily. Would recommend as a great starter job quick to advance towards the top but kinda stalls out really before the REALLY good positions.
good,"Often felt stressed but usually always got the job done, when it wasn't there wasn't ever too much backlash. I learned how to deal with upset customers, and work in a fast pace. The management was usually always on point. The hardest part of the job was just keeping priorities straight when people would ask for many different things from you. Most enjoyable was probably the breaks or sweeping"
good,Ordeal Marshalling and Selectors is a very fast pace job. I enjoy my job but I am wanting a full time position. I would definitely recommend this job to people.
good,Just that more hours was needed. Ilove working there i just didnt make enough money to support my family if i would have more hours i believe i would had made a career out of it
good,This job is what you make it. All stores are union and you joining the union is optional. If you work hard and arw dedicated to your job it will be given back to you.
good,"Kroger is fast paced, everyday you clock-in the employee should be ready to run around like a chicken with its head cut off. However when those slow days come you greatly appreciate the break and time on your hands to complete other task. Working for Kroger has taught me that customer service is key to a customer spending their money with the company, and if your not a people person truly, Kroger isn't for you."
good,"Very good company, time off is hard to come across. Tried to axel in my department which I was putting in the work and told I was possibly going to get the position and hired someone else with fewer qualifications."
good,employees walking off when store is busy no holiday pay until you worked a complete year must wear jeans if working inside even if its hot uniform included
good,Employees care about you and try to make the day go by quick and have a good time while on shift. Can get very hectic with many customers and only few courtesy clerks and cashiers. Difficult getting carts when very hot. All around decent job and great people and customers.
good,Great company to work for. No fixed hours but great culture. Some employees have been their their entire work lives. Great for people in school. Overall very good.
good,"I enjoyed this job, really love the union. Pharmacy staff gets a raise every 6 months, i was fortunate enough to have good coworkers. I also love the hours."
good,"Working at Kroger was rewarding and had a great employee atmosphere.  Demanding work, but rewarding to accomplish tasks and make customers happy.  Great experience"
good,"Hours were being cut for pharmacists and technicians, demand was the same and made for a stressful work day."
good,The people I work with is amazing at their job and with bing very personable. The manager made sure that he would work with schooling and other jobs which was nice.
good,Everybody do everything on their own except for when they want you to go on break. They don’t give enough hours to the clertsy clerks. They only worked me on the weekends.
good,"Kroger is a layed back job also.  I love making the customers happy.  All the time I was working there I was a cashier then a supervisior over the cashiers, also I worked the deli and customer service.  Kroger is more like one big family working together thats what I liked."
good,The store I worked at was awesome. The staff was great and always ready to jump in if you needed help. Management was great as well. Training was good but be ready for a long 10 days.
good,"The department I worked under in Kroger, clicklist, was a great department. The employees were friendly and helped me when I first started. Overall, the environment is very welcoming and the employees are quite productive. If there were ever any issues, they would be resolved quickly. Lastly, the management at Kroger is experienced and considerate of your ""outside of work"" life, meaning scheduling is fair and evenly distributed throughout the employees."
good,"I really enjoy stocking at Kroger. They give you decent hours to do your job and make it a comfortable, appreciative environment for their associates."
good,"Kroger was a place that appreciated my work ethic, they tried to provide me as many hours as they were able to.  I felt appreciated for the work that I did for the company"
good,"I had a blast working here, it was my very first job when i was in high school. my family and i lived right down the road from the store i worked in so we visited it a lot before i began working there. it was a natural choice for me being so close and not having a license just yet. its a great starting job or an after retirement job."
good,"I love my Kroger, and my co-workers. I have been there for 6 years almost, and I highly enjoy the fast-paced environment. The work is work however, I highly enjoy helping customers find what they need and recommend products when asked for my opinion. I stock the health and beauty, over the counter, candy, baby, candles, and hardware. This means that we're very fast-paced and oriented on finishing the shipments and getting the products on the shelf so they can be sold. I also help build displays and condition the shelves so they are clean and organized."
good,Productive and balanced work place the fun part is when you don't have to deal with customers and that you don't have to deal with your boss or bosses.
good,"I loved the coworkers, the customers."
good,"When I  worked here I felt welcomed and didn't feel like i had push myself as hard as I did at my other job            "
good,"Usually have 170- 200 new prescriptions and another 100 or so refills to process. Oversee the technicians to make sure they stay on top of their responsibilities so that we don't fall behind. In addition to providing health care screenings, immunizations, MTMs, CMRs and counseling to patients. Also make sure that all laws and regulations are followed by everyone in the pharmacy. Maintain low inventory without running out of medications. Prioritize what needs to be done and complete all tasks by the end of the day."
good,"the hardest part of working at Kroger would have to be the customers, you might come across some very rude people that might rub you the wrong way, you'll have to learn how to ignore them and continue your job ."
good,Kroger helped me earn experience for a customer service and cash handling. I earned great experience working for the company. I made sure to keep inventory to meet needs.
good,great place to work for for college students and well neat. people act like family their and always helping out when or not needed to help. enjoyed working for them
good,"It was a great job and experience. A great company to work for with good benefits, weekends off and the pay is good. I would recommend this company to anybody looking for a company to grow with"
good,"Working at Kroger was great experience for me throughout the number of I worked their.In 1986 I started out as a stocker ,got to learn the whole business, became dairy manager and for there grocery manager within about 6 years."
good,I punched in at 10:30 and started conditioning (organizing) my assigned shelves until the trucks rolled in. I then took the stock that was to go on my shelves and made them look full.
good,always plenty of work. job was different every day. good exercise. lots of interaction with customers good for people that do not like the same thing every day.
good,I started working at Kroger in high school to earn some extra cash and loved it. Started out as a bagger but became a cashier after a couple months. Would recommend this company to anyone
good,I loved my job at Kroger. I loved the environment. I loved the customers. I loved that its was never a dull moment in my eyes. I enjoyed being a cashier and seeing different faces everyday.
good,"Meeting and greeting customers, answering health care and prescription questions. Inputting prescription information from Doctors offices and insurance companies. Job was very fast paced, I multi tasked daily, I learned so much about medication dosage and side effects of different medications. The hardest part of my job is when the customer would come to pickup their medication that the Doctors office didn't call in. The most enjoyable part of my job was the ability to learn about the pharmacy side of health care."
good,This is a place where advancement can happen very fast if you show the effort to work for it. Within 6 months I was an assistant manager before I ultimately was chosen for a career job elsewhere.
good,"It depends on the store. My store is very busy and we work with less help. So is hard getting other stuffs done. The schedule is like any other retail pharmacy stores, very tight."
good,I worked at Kroger for 2 and half years while attending the University of Cincinnati. I learned a lot while working there. The most important was working for the people. The management team also was great they were always there when you needed to talk.
good,With so many avenues and outlets the potential for moving up in this company are endless.  Benefits are great.  Hours can be tough as it is a retail enviroment.
good,Working here on 3rd shift was relaxed and simple. Mainly cleaning and restocking the store while taking care of customers. I'd recommend this job to anyone in school.
good,The hardest part of the job is managing your numbers and making sales even on slow days. The management has changed so very much that it is hard to follow all the new rules in place. I learned a lot about diamonds and jewelry. A typical day is fairly easy. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping others find happiness especially when getting ready to propose!
good,"I came in on the night shift and stocked shelves and  ran register , as far as management  I was not found of  I thought they were not really aware of  the problem before they a addressed it. I liked working with the crew and fast pace."
good,"A great place to work not only as a starting point for teenagers, but if committed a great place to advance quickly. By the time I wasn't even 3 years in I was already an assistant department head. It taught me great customer service skills, and how to work with accounting."
good,I like the management team they just had a store manager change not to long ago so i dont kniw what this new store manager is like so but other than that i love working at kroger
good,"a typical day was stocking shelves, and checking customers out at the check out. management was great, she was very flexible with my school schedule and work schedule. the most enjoyable place to work, I enjoy working with the public. if I didn't move from Kentucky back to Illinois, I would still be there."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job would be seeing the faces of repeat customers and knowing that you and your company has a satisfied customer. The hardest part of the job would be the work schedule. Work life balance is very important.
good,Awesome staff that try and help you through out the days. Very understanding with home life. Store director is amazing and always on the floor working along side you in every position you can think of. He is always around.
good,On a typical day at work is fast pace and busy. The workplace culture is not discrimination. The harder part of the job for me is adjusting to the different types of culture and language.
good,It's a grocery store. I was a cashier. It's a good job just kind of boring for me. Definitely a great job for someone who loves standing still. For hours...
good,"The people I worked will were fun and kept the day from dragging on slow days. Customers were, most of the time, friendly though there were those few that made you want to rip your hair out. I loved working with co-workers."
good,"Kroger is a great company for long term employment. The Managers are held to a high standard and motivating."
good,"I enjoyed working with the people that I did each day. We are a family, I hope that I expan family to work with now that I have completed my degree in college."

good,"The Kroger job was a good job I made a good living working for the Kroger Company. And it would be a great starter job for the young people today, and make a career if like the grocery buis."
good,I will admit to having a lot of fun at this job. They appreciated my hard work. Which in turn made me move up faster. I was fuel lead manager. But because there was manager in my title i couldn't still get my benefits with the union. But other than that i could get overtime as much as i wanted.
good,most of my time at Kroger I would close from 2pm -10pm  and sometimes I would do day shifts from 9am- 5pm what I learned at Kroger was how to be a produce sales clerk as well as working in the floral department and I learned how to stock produce and keeping house clean and to check prices and reduce prices using a scanner and I learned customer interaction as I was there within my 4 year the management was really good all of store manager where always on the front end greeting customer and working a cash register or walking around and asking all the worker how is the department looking so they where very active the the hardest part of the job was just getting my 40 hours granted I would get between 20-30 hours a week but around holidays you are gone get your 40 hours
good,"Krogers is such a nice job everyone is friendly. it's not a hard job at all just got to be responsible about everything you need to do each, and everyday."

good,"Loved my job with Kroger Specialty Pharmacy.  Supported Accounting and Information Technology.  Unfortunately, the company has decided to move the Accounting department to Florida and therefore, my main responsibilities would be moving as well.  My last day with the company was Nov. 3, 2017 with a severance package."
good,"I have been working less than 1 year at Kroger and not eligible for some compensations or raises.  The work is fast paced, I enjoy helping the customers.  The one compensation for all employees is the discounts on Kroger products.  I always shop there.  I have learned a lot about meats and cheeses and food preparation.  It is a good place to work"
good,"Kroger is a great place to work when you are surrounded by a great team. The pharmacy I worked at was a great learning opportunity. The hardest part of the job was having the lack of good management. Overall, I would recommended employment here."
good,"Best job I've had. Loved working here, management was great, I got it work all the hours I wanted then some. Had to fly to Illinois for my grandfather's funeral & they were totally good with it. Willing to re-hire me when I got back, because I had to be gone for three weeks. Unfortunately I ended up moving back permanently but I still stay in touch with the whole store."
good,"fast paced"

good,This is a very easy job. Do have to work with customers at times.Stores are the busiest. Great for part time or full time. This job is also good for retirees.
good,"It's been a while since I worked there, but it's was always relaxed, there was always something to do, friendly co-workers and management was always willing to work with me on my hours. Mostly I worked 3rds as I was raising 2 young kids. I wish the pay had been better but I was only a grocery clerk. All in all, I do suggest this as a great job to get you through school or if you want a few years work under your belt. They do provide great benefits if your a full-time employee."
good,Kroger was a great learning experience.  Good pay and benefits were decent.  I would work there again if the opportunity came about.  Decent hours and good location.
good,"Thanks for the opportunity to change careers and succeed! I loved the challenge, my coworkers, my clients, and my manager! Would have loved to have spent more years there, but the offer to retire was too good to pass up."
good,Typical day saw the normal slow and busy times of a grocery store. The other clerks and cashiers were really nice and I enjoyed my time. The hardest part was being outside in the AZ summer bringing in hot carts.
good,Its a great place.to work. Just not enough hours or pay . Inrely on my income to suuport.my family and this rate of pay is very hard to do so. For a student its perfect. Having 3 children at home iam having a hard time getting bills paid and keeping groceries in the house. I enjoy.my job and the people are great. But hours have been cut recently and ita not enough for my family.
good,great people great environment management over shifts was actually pretty good and fair to the associates! Not much for advancement but always a positive place to work with people and helping customers in the grocery shopping when they cant find a particular item they want or need!
good,"was a really nice place to work and advance. learned new skills in deli, decorating cakes and customer care. Managment was very dedicated to making sure things ran smooth but also worked with employees."
good,"Easy money, well paid and a very close job. Most  neighborhoods  have them so there are very close to home. Very good pay for a 15 year old. Very good hours for a 15 year old."
good,"Kroger is very focused on its costumers, willing to make young teens some money to  bag and take peoples groceries from the store to their car. This is clearly a company who cares about its costumers"
good,"part time position, Assisted customers on Meat Seafood selection. Stocked shelves and did general sales ."
good,I really like the vibe kroger distribution center at Delaware they had going on but they sometimes asked you to stay working at least one more unpaid hour
good,"This is my favorite job so far and a lot of people are nice, especially management, but the person over Clicklist is not very nice and if they don't like you they will send you to another department."
good,"Fair pay, great management, fun work environment, nice co-workers, discount is awesome. If you like to stay busy then this is the place for you to work at."
good,Enjoyed working at Krogers for the simple fact I am a people person but I didn't make enough money to support the bills. Great place for school students
good,"A typical day at work i would bag groceries and collect carts.What i learned is how to properly bag groceries. The management was very polite and helpful. The workplace culture was fast paced. The hardest part of my job was collecting the carts. The most enjoyable part of my job was my co workers, they were very helpful and patient."

good,"a great place to work at great managers, process, co workers, and customers, employee treatment was fair benefits, hours and pay really fair for the work"
good,"The management in the store was fantastic, the customers were great, benefits were good. The wages could have been better considering how much cross training I went through and how many departments besides my own they had me working in.  I did cake decorating, floral, deli, I basically helped pretty much every department. There was a lot of options for sideways movement but not a lot in the way of upwards available. That particular store the department managers had been very well established for many years. Any promotion opportunities would have meant changing stores and I was very happy with that one in particular."
good,my very first job. i enjoyed this job and recommend it to anyone who does not have any work experience. it is fairly easy to get in and once you are in it is easy to move up within the company. hours are acceptable and pay is good as well.
good,"High associate engagement and appreciation for the contributions of associates. Good benefits including, medical, dental, vision, 401k contributions and more. some may plateau with few options for growth. However, If you are looking for a workplace of world class standards and staying power, this is the one. Many associates retire here with 40+ years with the company."
good,It is a nice company to work for. I been working for their company for 4 years. Very nice ppl. With in the four years of being with this company I've learned a lot from them and I also had the opportunity to grow with the company

good,Kroger was a great company to work for however i left the company because i needed a job closermto home. The management team was great and the store manager was absolutely wonderful to his associates.
good,"Starting as a courtesy clerk it's a good learning experience for a first job in terms of getting used to light physical labor. Kroger is a family like business that makes you feel very welcome from the start, That being said if you strive to be hard worker more and more responsibilities fall entirely on you."
good,"Kroger company is ideal workplace for kids first job,  retirement, part time job,  steady work environment, single mothers, or married mother. I loved working here."

good,I've worked for Kroger for a little over a year. It was a lot of fun the manager and associates are awesome. It gets really busy and you have to be a hard worker and smart to survive.
good,moved to a bigger city different types of people and a new store to learn! really enjoyed decorating and learning new ways to do my job. work culture was great had really good people to work with. hardest part was making sure if i had allot of decorated cake orders for the day and time frame on getting them done.
good,We should have better break rooms with more computers and better wifi for students that work in the company and they should give employee free game tickets for any California sports team.
good,"Great place to work, on the job training.  Great staff helpful, tuition reimbursement, paid time off, 401k, stock options, union and nonunion.  Discounts on Kroger items"
good,I really enjoyed my job and helping customers out. You meet different people everyday. Management was pretty good. Never had any issues. I was part of the union that was the best part of the job. You got raises every 6 months.

good,You were not micro managed. You were able to do a routine and get familiar with customers. You really focused on customer service. The other employees and managers made it feel friendly and nice to come to work. There were many times to come together and do events and learn about each other.
good,"Receive in produce off trucks,stock produce,keep full make sure there is nothing bad on the shelves and coolers,learned all about produce,management was great to work for like a family atmosphere "
good,"Krogers is a good store it self. I happened to really enjoy when I worked there the only thing was that it wasn't working with my school schedule. also when I was there the fuel clerks at the time had a hard time getting along they played the blame game on each other, they didn't do their work chores it would be left for the next person to take care of the mess. The hardest part was the money drops and the fuel deliveries."
good,"My job was exciting, I enjoyed working with the customer and suggesting different foods to try.  I learned a lot about seafoods, how to weight it, store it, etc.  The hardest part was lifting and the easier part was taking different people everyday."
good,I enjoy working here as a supervisor more than I did a cashier. I left because they only paid 7.90 while I was in a supervisor position doing management things.
good,"They are a great company to work for, it's just not my kind of work that I'm looking to do at the moment anymore. I had this one bad experience with a customer that just made me decide to go elsewhere"
good,Retail means retail hours and low pay.  The job is nice enough and it's wonderful meeting people but working evenings and weekends your whole life is not a good family choice.
good,The store in franklin off 99 is one that I would tell people about the people there are friendly will make you smile even if you had a bad day that store is number one in my book
good,Very friendly helpful employees when you need help with anything I can say theirs always somebody there to help​... Work environment stay clean never dirty everybody always have something to do

good,I have made some life long friends while working for this company. Workplace was very productive and very team oriented. I learned new skills that I can use in my everyday life.
good,I worked for roundys through a temp agency (qps). But I really enjoyed working in that environment with nice people who we're concerned about my job as well as I was. The people we're as one.  Everyone helped everyone and I think that's the reason why I loved working for roundys.  It was fun and enjoyable.
good,I loved working here. The management were very helpful in teaching me about this job and the ins and outs of how everything worked. i do feel like i learned a lot about customer service and baking skills while working here.
good,"I find everyone friendly and helpful"
good,"Lots of teamwork and diversity here. Love working with people and care about giving quality service? Then this is the place for you, I really enjoy the job but with the arthritis in my back standing for eight hours is really hard for me."
good,It's easy and good money. You get benefits good hours. If you are willing to work nights it's even better and they pay you what you're worth. Good company
good,"Bagging groceries, scanning groceries, returning merchandise to the floor, retrieving buggies from lot, assisting customers with groceries, cleaning. Hardest part is long hours standing."
good,"I love my job and the people I work with, probably best job I have ever had. Within 90 days (give or take a few days) I was training people on the self checkout area and being sent to train in Howell on the new systems we were getting. I earned the title of ""uscan champion"" which I shared with one other coworker. Together we taught most of the cashiers how the new system works. This company gives chances to advance in your career within the Kroger store."
good,"Every day was something new. I was always learning. I liked working with all my co-workers and they kept me from being bored while working. Of course, we had those peak times when we got really busy, but everyone worked together to get all of the customers checked out in a timely manner."
good,"Prepared, cut and sold cheese throughout the day. Helped customers with meal options for their families. I did inventory once a month to keep track of sales for the product."

good,"A typical day at Kroger had a few rushes and steady flow of customers in our down time.  I learned better people skills and how to deal with unhappy customers in a polite way.  Most of the employees got along even though there is a wide age range.  Depending on the shift there was also a fairly good communication between management and employees.  The hardest part of the job was the hours not being consistent, The most enjoyable part was being with people who cared about their jobs."
good,"A typical day at work is good, meeting new people and getting to know familiar faces which also the most enjoyable part of then day for me. I learned how to be a front end lead supervisor. Management was new as everyone was learning about each other. The culture of the workplace was a fun environment, but hardest part of the job was working overtime and only getting 10 minute breaks."
good,"I found this job to be very interesting. The training was fast paced. I had to think on my feet, which I enjoyed. I worked hard and was rewarded with a promotion to manager of my department, which was the fuel center. The most challenging part of the Job was trying to to keep a good motivated staff for minimum wages."
good,"I enjoyed working with krogers it was an great experience, This was my first job i was with the company for 2 years into it was time for me to go to school at Wright State University, The average day at krogers was great i loved going to work meeting new people everyday working as an cashier i met a lot of new and different personalities everyday and thats what i enjoyed"
good,I loved my job here it was amazing management was awesome they worked around my school schedule and made sure I had enough time to do all my work and would even make sure I got off a little early on weekends so I could still presume somewhat of a social life.
good,The stores are run well and efficient because of data driven Project Mercury = happy customers = equals happy employees. The corporate culture is working at the bottom level.

good,"I love my job. Just  needs better pay for positions and needs better advancement opportunities. Management is pretty good about working with the employees, but employees need to have a better thinking when it comes to working with each other."
good,I'm either on a check lane or on self-checkout on my days I work. Some days are busy and some days are slow depending on when the ad comes out or if its holiday season. The managers are all nice and help when needed. I've learned to have patience when it comes to certain customers and explaining things to them. I've learned to communicate to customers better and helping them out when they need it. My favorite part of the job though is my co-workers.
good,Excellent people and great atmosphere. I have gained a great deal of respect for my coworkers and customers. Great supervisors and management
good,Walked up and down the aisle making sure that the meat was always stocked and also interacting with customers from when I got into work to when I got off.
good,i loved working there very friendly place to work at. I got to learn different things like stocking and customer service and even in the deli department.
good,"I worked third shift after another job, and it was a nice job.  Management was hard working and willing work with your own availability to work.  The hardest part was there is was a lot of down time on third shift and because I was the cashier that means no leaving the front area to help stock or clean."
good,"A day at work was busy but at the end of the day you felt like you had accomplished lots of tasks for associates and customers. I love retail, because I like to help people."

good,"I felt that the work was reasonable, and it seamed like there was room for advancement. I say that with most of my managers where former clerks, and at my level when starting there careers  at Kroger. It also felt like Management cared about the workers there."
good,"nice job to work for while I attended a university. never had issues at all, the company was understanding of my school schedule."
good,"Very impressed with the entire management team from the store manager on down to department managers. All very professional, great demeanors, and fair & flexible. Left only for medical reasons that no longer allow me to perform the job, otherwise I would still be there. Enjoyed the job. Co-workers were all great also. Good overall workplace morale which is huge these days! Never dreaded working there. Take care of your feet & wear real good shoes with support & inserts though."
good,"The management was actually really polite and professional. Asked you to do things instead of just barking orders at you and commanding. Everyone working in the Kroger store did their absolute best to make it a fun and cheerful work environment while also keeping it professional and efficient in serving the customers and resolving any issues that might arise. There were not really any hard parts to the job besides, of course, being new and having to get used to everything and the work flow. The most enjoyable part is working with all of the good employees and regular customers."
good,I was very satisfied when I was working there. My co-workers were very friendly. I learned that you should talk to every customer when they come through your lines and that you should make sure you count your register every time before work.
good,"Great place to work an grow as an individual, as well as being able to rise through the company. The weekends are usually super busy. An a typical day for me is coming in cutting the service case an the counter. Helping customer's to pick the right type of meat. As well as stocking the counter."
good,"My customers are top notch. The reason I get up go is because of my customers. The middle managers are very nice to work for, and easy going."

The company hosts many events that not only boost moral, but proceeds go to the cultural crew or charity. I highly enjoyed my time working here during high school and college."
good,"Spend most of the day helping people get gas and purchase cigarettes restocking cigarettes, cleaning gas pumps."
good,Working for this company has been an enjoyable experience. during my time there I have learned many things as well as leadership skills. I would recommend  Kroger for anyone who appreciates wonderful service.

good,Work with me on school an helped me when i had troubles financially.  Lovely place to work and good people who work there and they are very helpful.

I learned how to speak with and deal with all types of customers problems and quickly find solutions.Management were flexible with hours and easy to get along with.Co-workers were all very helpful with daily task and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the weather outside packing groceries into customers cars.The most enjoyable part was speaking to all different types of people and having them say they were happy with the service I performed for them.
good,Clean friendly and helpfull. Kroger is a stable company with great oppertunities fun people and and great shoppers that are awsome.
good,It was an awesome place to work at plus you got to meet new people everyday. You grew accustomed to your daily job duties and got to make friendships with co workers. I would give the company Kroger 5 stars any day.
good,Kroger was a very well managed company that offered great opportunities for me to improve and show myself different management ways.
good,"A fun environment to work in. A big ladder to climb if you have the patience. A Union to make sure you get your breaks and good benefits, but the process for getting a new contract signed every three years is extraneous. Get full-time ASAP"
good,Great company to work for with great support from the management team and departments managers to ensure each and every customer is satisfied with the shopping experience.  This is done by providing a clean shopping environment and fresh product on display for sale. Opportunity for growth and awesome benefits.
good,"Fun work place with supportive coworkers. Learned a lot in just the four months I have worked there. The pay rate can be better, that's the only con."
good,"҉	Costing and matching products and services  "
good,I like the company and the workers. The customers for the most part are friendly as well. The job itself is pretty easy. I learned everything within one to two days.
good,Kroger was a great Job to work at. I learned how to work the cash register and how to meet and greet customers. My co-workers were fun to be around. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers that had a whole bunch of coupons.
good,"The store would get very busy at certain times of the day, making it hard to complete certain tasks, but once you had people trained in multiple departments it helped get people out of the door quicker."
good,Wonderful place to work very outgoing people family type of environment very understanding bosses and supervisor coworkers and all
good,My returning customers who look forward in coming in and talking with me. Associating with my co-workers on a daily basis
good,"Check for any new merchandising updates, then get new freight out on the floor. Find and fill spots with back stock. All the while, cashiering when needed and customer service being top priority."
good,"I worked both days and afternoon shift. If I came in on days I had to set the case, which means I had to give to fish a ice bath and then put them nicely in the seafood case. then I would need to package some fish for the self-serve case, all while I was taking care of customers. If I worked an afternoon shift I would continue where the day shift left off and then two hours before going home I would pull all the fish out case and pack it in tubs and cover it with ice .The hardest part of the job was putting my hands down in ice water ton give the fish a bath, even though I had gloves on my hands still got very cold. Another hard job was putting live lobsters into the steamer, this wasn't physical hard but mentally hard knowing that I was putting a live creature to death. the best part of my job was during the holidays when a customer wanted a special made shrimp tray made and I was allowed to make it and to see how delighted they were with it."
good,"Prepare arrangements, count the money drawers, give out loans, help customers check out. I also took orders and gave refunds. I loved the customers, not the employees."
good,"Working for the Kroger Company can be a wonderful experience, but it depends what your job is. Working in the Fuel Center was probably my least favorite position. A typically day was good with minimal rude customers. Management is helpful when it comes to certain things, but I suggest going straight to the Union. The hardest part is being on a set schedule because they will reduce your hours and the most enjoyable part for me was my coworkers. I worked there from 2011 to 2013 and then I returned in 2015. I only worked one month because I wasn't getting my breaks and lunches in the Fuel Center so I decided to quit"
good,"My day starts first thing in the morning with writing the produce order for the next day, that means ordering all of the produce that the department will sell. Then I have to stock the floor, and cut fresh fruit and get fresh vegetables out. After that have to make sure that the shelves stay stocked, I have to build displays all while having a smile on my face. My job has helped me learn proper stress management, and how to react under pressure. It has also helped me diffuse arguments, I love my co-workers and have made some lasting friendships at Kroger."

I learned from this position how to work efficiently and quickly in a fast paced environment. My co-workers and I worked as a team. We all got along greatly and kept a sense of humor when things got hectic, and never lost sight of the goal to provide excellent customer service. At times the fast pace of the job, especially during cold and flu season, could be challenging, but it was always worth the hard work to see the happy faces of the people we helped feel better."

I've always been open to hearing people's opinions and trying new ways to accomplish tasks to eventually make my job easier and be more efficient at it. The management varies from person to person. There were times were I was faced with professional differences but I knew that it was just that and like me, other people have reasons they do things so I was very good at not letting that get in the way of how I preformed at work. The most enjoyable part of working there was definitely the customers. I absolutely love helping others and making their day a little better by being very personal with them and helping them find exactly what they need."

Lastly you must write menus which the executive chef will review."
good,It is easy to work with and work for. The hours I work are 12:30-9 and it’s hard because my fiancé works nights and I only see our daughter in the morning. The drive is hard to do at times. But the job and coworkers are fun and I enjoy working with them

good,"A typical day at work consist of walking the store and seeing the conditions in which it is, following by addressing the important needs such as out of stocks or minor cleaning and having a fresh apearance to the customer, followed by writing orders and providing customer assistance throughout the shift. I learned many things through my Kroger career, such as being a leader to basic operations and guidelines to follow companies expectations and standards. Management is very helpful and always work as a team to make everyones Job easier. Id say the hardest part of the job is improvising on days where there are call ins and products unavailable for the customers. But the most enjoyable part of my workday is providing the best customer service I can to the customers, as little as having a small conversation with hem to going above and beyond to help them find their shopping needs."
good,"A typical day at work revolves around working in your respected department and interacting with customers and their needs. I learned in the positions I held appropriate customer service standards and the correct way to handle escalated situations. Management is very up front and friendly, and walk-ins with managements regarding issues are welcome as well. The workplace can be hectic during the holidays, but usually both the customers and your coworkers are friendly and willing to help you and make you feel good. The hardest part of the job is handling escalated situations with unruly customers; however, the ost enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the store's ""regulars"" and having a blast chatting with them as you help with with their shopping and checking out."
good,"This is a great company to work for, great benefits and if you are at a good store- your coworkers become like your second family. It is a little hard to request certain days off unless you have high seniority, but if you have good management and are a good employee, they will work with you."
good,I was a part time worker there. Compensation was average according to the job requirements. Fun to work there and management was friendly. The people i worked with were easy to get along with and fun to be around. Management had a good training session.
good,Great place to work if you can handle customer service. I enjoyed it there alot! It is union friendly.. Had to keep area clean. some stocking involved. All and all a great place to work.
good,Fast pace enviroment. The surrondings are constantly changeing through out the time. Lively and friendly they are caring for the customers. Every one trys to treat each other as on big happy family.
good,I enjoyed being a cashier at Kroger. I enjoyed my coworkers and talking to the customers. If needed I was also a bagger and retrieved carts for the customers.
good,"I really did enjoy my job at Kroger my co workers were awesome, the management was amazing, the hours were flexible, it was a busy fast paced environment"
good,"While this maybe a individual experience, I worked with great people. Sometimes I would go to other pharmacies and it would just make me sad to see that people didn't have the same experiences as me."
good,The job helped me gain skills for advancement. I was able to be promoted to HR manager after the expierence and skills learned and gained after being hired.
good,it was a good company and there is room for as much growth as the employee wants. i started at minimum wage rose quickly to a decent salary. The company tries to give back to other organizations and their employees as well.
good,"I currently work here, and the time I have spent here is nice! if youre looking for a company to work for and advance in, then this is the company for you! They give out hours based on what you need, and what the company needs from you! Its face paced and there is always something to do!"
good,"Greatly enjoyed working there. It was a physically demanding job but made one feel needed. Stressful around the holidays but as a stocker you are unlikely to deal with as many customers. Ability to play ""Tetris"" with the goods on the backstock cart almost necessary for the aisle I worked."
good,I worked in the meat department where there were plenty of hours and enough work so your shift flies by. i would've stayed but the management gets shifted from store to store and they make their own policies.
good,"Great workplace , however I wish i could be closer to home. Fantastic people. Flexible hours. Great management team. Everyone is on time. Communication is a big factor which is k ey to running a pharmacy which is pristine here. Overall great place."
good,"Kroger’s overall was a great place to work at, pretty good management with very nice employees and customers. I enjoyed my experience at Kroger and learned a lot."
good,The employees there are very friendly and very helpful. Good working environment. I enjoy the customers there. Always kind people.Pretty easy job too.
good,"As the Department Manager my days vary depending on if call offs or not."
good,"Cutting hrs- so hire freeze currently"
good,A typical day at Kroger consisted of maintaining the cashier area clean and helping costumers checkout. I learned a lot of patience and also helped build my character. The hardest part is bagging items by yourself on a busy day but in the end it's very rewarding to see costumers leave with a smile on their face.
good,"Overall I enjoyed working for Kroger. I really liked my coworkers.  Some of the management was good. It has fantastic benefits,  scheduling can usually be worked out if you need time for a doctor's appointment or something else.  If you aren't afraid of hard work and you make yourself available for projects you will be known as a team player."
good,There are lovely customers that are local that you get to see everyday. The management is great and schedules and conflicts are easily worked out and flexible.
good,"Kroger, was a very beneficial learning experience. The atmosphere was fun, friendly, and caring but also very professional. I really enjoyed my time working there."
good,"Very friendly, just not enough hours. Management ran well, diverse, no issues except the fact that minors are only allowed five hours a day. Would recommend to adults."
good,I t hink they need to pay more for the work we do. We are the lowest paid at the distributions center. We are point of contact for product  to be loaded to all krogers stores.
good,Worked with a great team and staff was always willing to help and assist other staff to become more educated or just to help with other techniques. Great place.
good,Front end  is a basic job and a entry level position. If you are younger than 18 yrs old there is no room for advancement or raises. This was something I didn't not like. But overall this is good company with awesome benefits.
good,I learned to observe by watching and listening. Management take stealing very seriously a few days out of the week it was slower and some days were high peak.
good,"I loved to have worked with the community and getting the opportunity to grow and learn. I stated off as a bagger, pushed carts in the rain and snow. But, the people I worked with helped me and encouraged me to do my best. At the end of my experience, I got the opportunity to lead and teach what I've learned."
good,"An average work day consisted of bagging groceries, organizing carts, and customer assistance. I learned how to adapt my work to the needs of customers and desire of the management. The management is solid. Very good with their employees and personable. The hardest part of the job was the weather when you had to bring in carts and do trash duty. The best part of the job was the interaction with people and always having something to do. They are also very generous with the break schedule."
good,I moved around a lot at Kroger. I was able to expand my work experience by working in the different departments. Everyone is helpful and nice and will make sure that you know what you are doing.
good,"I love the fast paced and the friendly people of some of the employees...but other employees. Most of the ones I met there in the short time of working complained about their job, however it made me wonder why then they have been there for 10 plus or 20 plus years???....so it could not of been that bad for them??. I felt that Krogers stood by their employees in that respect, no matter what the employee was going threw Krogers always kept their job for them. As many find with their health sometimes or some un-foreseen circumstance may keep them from their job at times without letting them go. So I did not understand why the ones that had been there for a long while complained. Never from management they were always nice and friendly and enjoyed their job. However, for me I never would of left, I just was working two jobs to try to get a full time hours at full time pay. Trying to afford the cost of living on my own. I still dont understand why we always had to pay so much for the union either per paycheck, where does that money go?  To ensure you keep your job at Krogers?"
good,I loved this job. Getting to know the customers and working with co-workers. This was a pretty fun job at times. But other times it was difficult. A lot of angry customers sometimes. But it was really great when the customers would know your name and get to know you. You really get to know your customers which is nice
good,"Show up at requested time."
good,my typical at Kroger consist of coming in on time and getting straight to work in the deli department. i loved assisting customers and laughing and having fun while being a hard worker.
good,"Great pay , lots of Benefits and perks. Flexible shifts .  Great place to work if you’re still in school .  Great health insurance benefits   For full-time and part-time associates ."
good,It's a good place to work. Make a lot of friends. Good working flexible hours. I enjoyed working there. I hope and wish I could get a job again at Kroger's.
good,"Everyday I looked forward to going to work. Working at Kroger I met amazing loving people who were there for me always. My produce manager was amazing and very supportive, always encouraging to do your best work. My produce team was fun to be around and they were very hard workers, me only being 17 I was amazed by there hard work and dedication to the job. Which made me love working there more. Customers could be rude sometimes but its your job to put a smile on no matter how rude and help them out. The store managers were positive and good to be around, almost always making me have a smile on my face. I also enjoyed that I was put in different departments when it needed help, I was considered a produce clerk but on my off days I would come in, when asked, and help other departments. I love exploring opportunities at Kroger and really enjoyed the work experience. Also pay starts around $8 but it advances."
good,I enjoyed everything about Kroger. They are a good company to work for. the flexible schedule is wonderful. They have amazing people to work with. the benefits are good. The pay is a little low.
good,So far krogers working environment has been a favorite job of mine. I've enjoyed the laid back feel. I do wish it was a bit more fast paced. I would love to have other responsibilities to help m0keep me busy.
good,"The management is great here. It’s not a stressful work environment and at one time when the quality and effort of my work declined due to some personal issues distracting me, they seemed to care. I’d recommend this place. Definitely a good starting job."
good,It's a great was to gain customer service experience. If you work there you get an employee discocunt and a raise every six months. Plenty of opportunities to advance.
good,"responsible for the process safety management of the refrigeration, boiler, pneumatic, and glycol systems. Kroger is very safety oriented and stives to be the best support to our customers."
good,"With the right management, Kroger can be a very good place to work.  Unfortunately I did not have the right management, for me to flourish with the company."
good,"I enjoyed working here at Kroger especially with all the amazing associates and managers. It felt like a huge family. I learned many things while working there as a cashier and then becoming a front end supervisor. One thing I hated was the pay, $9 an hour was not the ideal pay for this kind of job, especially as a front end supervisor. I loved coming into work with all these amazing people who treated me as one of their own. Yeah, there are times where things get hectic but isn't that the same for everyone else."
good,"I worked in the fuel center. So I made sure the pumps where running okay. Trash was taken care of, window cleaner was filled. Cigarettes had to be counted every night, made that money was correctly was dropped and had the right amount at the end."
good,Learned how to be a good employee and have patience. Hardest part of the job is when customers complain about an item not being in stock and having coupons.
good,If they paid more I wouldn't be looking. However Great people are not going to pay the bills... This Kroger's has a well balanced management team... They make it fun to come to work
good,"Great company to work for. Lot of employee benefits. Flexible scheduling, promote from within, good management communication. Some work can be very demanding and stressful."
good,Working at Krogers teach you a lot and if you have good communication skills with your managers they will work with you to fix your problems and make work more comfortable for you.
good,I liked working there prior but was just placed in the wrong department.  I really enjoyed working in the fuel center.  I had previously worked at a fuel center.
good,good work place . worked with people that are life-long friends now. learned a variety of skills. good opportunity to grow and advance in company. overall good work place.
good,"As a cashier, a typical work day included bagging groceries, scanning groceries and taking payment for them.  The management there was very nice.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude people."
good,"A typical work day at Kroger back in the meat and seafood department would be running carts , putting the meat supplies into the fridges , cleaning the saw room and watching over the service counter.I learned alot at Kroger, i learned better communication skills, teamwork skills, how to great a customer the appropriate way and how not to. Management is good, the managers their  take some time out and try to get to know the employees there."
good,I loved working at Kroger. I'm not sure if it was because it was my first job and I was 15 years old or if it was genuinely at great place to work. The management was always easy to talk to and helped me balance work and school.
good,LOVED being able to advance and be cross-trained. 
good,"Kroger is a great Company To Work because of the their amazing insurance but most managers are awful and will not work with your availability, and expect you to do a lot of work that takes at least 2 people"
good,i enjoyed my time with Kroger stores.  i only left because i was going off the college out town. The workday was steady and the management team was very approachable and willing to assist whenever i was unsure about something or just needed to ask questions.
good,"My experience with this company was absolutely great. The people I worked with on daily business were awesome. Customers came to be great friends. I basically worked 3-11 shifts but they knew that I was available for longer shifts and other shifts when needed. I helped in other departments such as the bakery and deli when needed. I was selected by management to over see training for the pilot program called Scan, Bag and Go. I wish that this company was in Florida."
good,"I enjoyed working at Kroger, the managers was to unfocus but in all they did what their job wanted. I like working with people so at times thing got busy but we all worked together as a team and that made the difference."
good,"Employees greet each other with genuine feelings. When I arrive, I replenish all supplies needed in the dept."
good,Love the culture and the way that the company caters to the everyday lives of regular people. Love the atmosphere and the quality of work displayed by all associates and management.
good,"Kroger was my first job, it was a great first experience learning how to work with customers as well as coworkers. I recommend it to those who are looking for their first job."
good,"Work was fast paced, very consistent. We had an excellent competitive and friendly team. Management butted heads with each other but the regular staff all worked together and got along. Most enjoyable part of the job was working competitively as a team."
good,It is a very fast place environment more on Sundays after church and holidays. This job defiantly teaches you a lot about multitasking. They will call you up front a lot if you work in the back as drug gm clerk. I learned a lot about how planograms work and to use my imagination a lot more. I loved getting everything ready for the holidays and seeing all the other customers shopping. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fast pace environment along with working all the employees everyone worked together and were very helpful when help was needed. Of course every work place has their own employees that aren't very helpful and stay to themselves. I loved my managers they were very understanding and would let me work more hours if needed.
good,"It was a good place to work and I learned a lot about my profession and how to do it. I am a pharmacist, by the way. The only downside was that it did not do well in notifying me that I had no job after graduation from an intern."
good,"Worked in the morning time opened customer service. Took care of customers with there bills, checks, money orders, lottery, western union, etc great place."
good,"On a normal day you would clock in and then go relieve someone for a break then when they got back you would work at your station for a few hours then someone would come and relieve you. I usually worked the uscan, I really enjoyed it. I would greet customers and wait on them."
good,"If you are hard working and reliable and pick up all the hours you can, you can make a career out of Kroger. The top out rate is pretty good, the vacation time builds up quickly. It is a union company."
good,A typical day at work would be that everyone would speak when you walk in the door.  I have learned that you can grow a lot in the company.  The management was great and they treated the staff nice.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the workers.
good,"I worked for Kroger for 11 years! Like any other job, it had its stressful times, but it was a great place to work! I personally enjoyed the ""one on one"" contact that I had on a daily basis with the customer, and I also enjoyed working with a great staff there as well!"
good,Typically it's a great place to work.  Customers can define your work day in some cases.  Co-workers are friendly and very helpful.  Kroger is very good with working with high school students.
good,To receive truck with product for the store and keep up the bill so that they would get pay. Learn how to keep the bills for the store and make sure that all the product was in good condition for the store. Make sure the vendor was not taking anything out of the store that was not theirs. Management was good at time it was ready who was the manager. The hardest part of the job was to make sure the vendors was on time and make sure that you had enough product for the shelves. Enjoyable part of the day is when we all work together as a team.
good,When I worked at Kroger I liked it. The employees are so helpful and friendly. At the time I worked there the store manager was not very helpful and left early after arriving late. This cause the store to not run as smoothly when a customer asked for a manager.
good,I wish Kroger would get rid of the union. Its not helpful for hard working employees trying to move up th ladder. I find it useless. I as well find it hard to move up as my disability should not be a factor in that decision.
good,"Wonderful company to work for, endless opportunities to earn overtime hours, great management, and the customers are always super pleasant to work with as long as you have a positive attitude and smile on your face."
good,"Great work environment, informative, fun but professional, competitive and a great opportunity to advance your career. Friendly and positive environment."
good,Basically if you can handle the swapping of positions and the rush of making sure that every customer is left satisfied then taking a job at Kroger's or Ralphs should be easy enough to handle.
good,Working for kroger has  amazing benefits and pay overall...cant complain it has been very good company the pay is good..they have great healthcare and dental
good,I enjoyed working at Kroger’s. If I can go back and work there I would. The employees where cool to be around. At times we would have fun but she know when to work and when to play...
good,I enjoyed the interaction with individual customers as I unloaded their groceries for them. It was one-on-one and I made friends with some. The customers gave me great reviews and that made me take pride in my job.
good,I liked working here.  I like working with the public.  The management was friendly and caring.  Training and mentor-ship was supported at all times.  Very helpful.
good,Was great place to work and wonderful management at this store. Would work for this company again and really liked the products. The discounts on Kroger products was very cost effective
good,Kroger has a great staff who create a satisfying and productive work environment. Casual normal paced environment but always on your feet. Helpful and friendly staff throughout entire store.
good,I worked at Kroger part-time in high school so I can have my own money for school activities and snacks for practice. My manager was very understanding when I needed time off to study or for a band event.
good,"We worked at night, and we worked hard to get the trucks put up, I had one side of the store by my self, but got the job done, and help the other associate if he or she needs help."
good,"A typical day at work looks like: being on a register or being on self-checkout. "
good,"I learned a lot about bringing in orders and managing other employees. "
good,Uplifting mentality all the way from corporate. Positive and encouraging. Only con is it takes forever to get full time and benefits but once you do the benefits are great.
good,"Great people to work with. Different ages and race. Different personalities, but never an issue on my part. If given the opportunity to return, with more hours and an increase in pay by a few cents, I would most definitely return. I loved everyone I came across. Built great relationships in and out of work."
good,"loved working at fry's, they hired me on the spot, and gave great hours. all the employees were friendly, it was like a big family! they didn't pay over minimum wage, however the workload wasn't extreme so it worked out great."
good,Loved working here started in the deli and made my way to a drug gm assistant manager position which was hard work lots of heavy freight but the pay and hours were totally worth it
good,working at kroger was fun at first because i was the new hire. But as time went on i saw that working there on the weekends and occasional weekdays was not going to help me get over my anxiety. I needed a job that would give me more than 12-15 hour weeks so than i can actually be face to face with customers.
good,It is a fast paced grocery store. Very clean and have many career options available for young high school age kids and college kids. The advancement is not too hard to achieve but long hours if you are going for management positions.  Nice people to work with and to work for.
good,The like to be tough on you at first but not overly. They like to see you reach high goals and push yourself to bigger and higher things. Not all Krogers are like this the one Phoenix AZ was amazing the ones in Kansas not so much they have a high turner over rate if you dont work in an A store you wont enjoy it so much.
good,I was getting almost 40 hours a week and then they had to hire another person dropped my hours change managers on a monthly basis so I never knew what manager I was working with I was in the fuel center and never got a break unless there is another person working with me which was it very often
good,"I enjoyed working with the customers, because I got to know many of them.  It was very relaxing to sit in the booth and wait for customers to buy gasoline, cigarettes, and tobacco."
good,I have learned a lot of things with Kroger. The people here are great! Everyone is kind and the customers love coming to the store. Kroger has made great changes over the past few months on prices to try and attract more people to shop.
good,I really liked this job because it allowed me to go to my other job. I really worked hard. It's fast paced. The ability to work on your knees. Then you must be very very very strong.
good,"Kroger Technology was my introduction to the enterprise level of software and web development, and the corporate realm. While I had a rocky first few days, I strived to become better and develop myself to be on par with one of my peers, who quickly became my mentor. Mentorship and career advancement are driving forces at Kroger."
good,Kroger is an incredible corporation to work for.They morale boost constantly and take pride in their workers. The ever changing food habits of the customer keeps the job fun and full of new product.
good,typically busy after 5 very busy on holidays
good,"A typical day of work is rarely stressful unless it's really busy, the manager and employees are kind, and it's fun to make friends there. It's cool to become familiar with all the parts of the store and get insight into how these stores function."
good,My department worked with non for profit organizations that orchestrated gift card programs for their community so they could earn money. My department phased out and about a 3rd of the company was sent to Ohio where the corporate office was located.
good,great place to work 4 10 hour work week people are friendly easy to deal with management various job you can choose from flexible work secudule you get a work out
good,"Ralphs Warehouse was a great place to work for and would love to get back into Cold Distribution again, i learned everything i could there , from Forman to forklift operator, had the most amazing experience working there"
good,I love working at Kroger and meeting/working with new people daily. Kroger though unlike any other job can be stressful. Management changes often which is somewhat difficult but adjustments are made quickly sometime for the better.
good,Kroger is a great company to work for!  Highly developed systems and workflow to promote safe practices.  Dedicated to providing the best pharmacy services.
good,"I work in the Pharmacy, they have been really good with working around my school hours and needing time off. They are nice people to work with, I feel like a family here."
good,"Kroger was a great place to work! most of the staff were very friendly and helpful, though there were a few that were not productive and only wanted to gossip, but there are always people like that in the workforce. Even when there are few customers there is always something for workers to be doing so there was never a dull or idle moment!"
good,I love interacting on a daily basis with customers. There is nothing more rewarding than being the reason someone smiled that day. I love spending time with the people in my community.
good,"Working at Kroger has been a great experience, meeting and greeting with customers while I check customers out at register daily. Assisting customers to find items throughout store is  my main concern."
good,"I really enjoyed my time with the kroger company, tools I learned was how to use the taliazon. among frying and using the slicers. Management was great."
good,Clicklist was my kroger job and it was fun and new to me. it had plenty of stressful moments but it was fun with the right co-workers. i think reassuring and getting the job done is the top priorities in this job and should be if it plans to keep customers
good,"I believe the old adage you get out what you put in. If you don't take care of your job then your manager won't take care of you, simple. I did what was expected of me and more and the management let me know how much they appreciated it with more job freedom and responsibility and learning, and I stepped up to the plate and showed them that I was able to learn new technology and take on more responsibility. Kroger was the first employer I have ever had that gave me that kind of chance to grow and learn and love my job."
good,Working for Krogers  is fun in my opinion. It's very relaxed and easy going and you get a break every two hours of your shift. The only down part of it is that they're not good at scheduling you around your other obligations.
good,i really enjoyed at kroger the staff i worked with were really nice they helped me in anyway i needed help rather it be me being sick and them help me stock or helping me in where things go they teach you how to stock the shelves
good,"I work the stock off the trucks, put up the stock, help the guest with questions.  Make sure guest find what they are looking for.  Work the forklift to move stock around the back dock area."
good,We were busy but efficient and worked hard as a team.  It was a high volume busy store and we were very busy.  It was well managed and reasonable expectations.
good,"A typical work day at The Kroger CO., as a courtesy clerk would be bagging customers groceries, and collecting grocery carts from indoors, and outdoors. The hardest part about working at Kroger as a courtesy clerk would be going to get grocery carts in ANY weather conditions: rain, snow, hail, ice."
good,I loved my cashier position at pick n save.  I scanned the groceries and other items it was easy and i am a very outgoing person so I love working with the public.  I became very ill and had emergency surgery.  It broke my heart to have to leave.  I probably could get rehired but I need a job with benefits and a little more money for my 5 year old son and I.
good,Awesome customer service an training. I have learned how to manage my time with multiple customer service and food service while multitasking with each day. sometimes not good managing but I loved working here an helping people. If you have a complaint you have to report it to the union instead of the managers. other then that its a great opportunity experience.
good,I liked krogers a lot our department was like a family it was and quick learning process fun people to work with good hours and we got paid every week
good,Kroger is a great place to work as a side job or when you're just starting out. The place is friendly and nice to first-timers. The management is different from store to store
good,Kroger made me a responsible when adult. I started there in high school and I stayed there til about midway through college. It wasn't the best paying jobs but it was more about learning how to handle a job and working with others.
good,I go into work everyday prepared to handle western unions and returns. I've learned a lot over my three years there especially going in so young. I have actually been introduced to the management relief program so it is very easy to move up.
good,I learned a lot about the work field from Kroger. That was an experience i'll never forget. It taught me about the world and how people can be towards you.
good,"a typical day at work was bagging grocery's, bringing in carts, cleaning bathrooms,taking out trash, and zoning. the hardest part of the job was bringing in carts"
good,"I liked the people i worked with but some of the managers left a lot to be desired. Great benefits for a part time job. 401k, insurance. Would recommend it to people looking for part time work."
good,"The shift is me clocking in and going to a register, stay on the register for 4 hours as i transfer to the self-checkout fir 4 more hours to complete my shift."
good,"This company was a very well balanced company, mainly a grocery store chain that branches out into jewelry.I guess that didn’t work so they pulled out of the mall I worked in."
good,"Stock shelves, clean aisles, bagged groceries for customers and helped them when needed. Great management team with great people to work with. I really enjoyed working there."
good,"Kroger was a good place to work. I recommend this job for someone who likes to meet new people and interact with others.This is a good first or second job, also the pay is good and the benefits were also. I would work for this company for as long as I could and possibly retire from here if they had stores all over the country."
good,Kroger is a great place for a high school student who is looking for his first job and to keep a small amount of money in his/her pocket. The people are very friendly.
good,This was a great first job while in high school. The management was great and always worked with my schedule in school. I enjoyed helping customers.  The hardest part was learning to inventory.
good,"work 10 hour days sometimes 12"
good,"working for the kroger corporate office was the best job i had in my young adult life. they paid well, showed so much employee appreciation, gave paid time off, sick days, vacation days. they offered 401k. they were just awesome"
good,"Fairly decent place to work, good benefits, decent pay.  The challenge is in the leadership culture - it lacks consistency.  Promotions are not consistent and opportunities are limited."
good,"Help Customers"
good,"Kroger is great company to work at. It provides great benefits and perks for their employees. Management is very kind and considerate"
good,It has been one of the best companies by far that I've worked for. I enjoy working for Kroger and the employees that you work with become like family.
good,"Its a great first job for people still attending school. They have flexible hours so your able to work out your schedule and still be able to be on top of your school work. Everyone has a positive attitude, team work and willing to help others. Great work environment and the opportunity to move up in the work place."
good,getting to work with people and have a face place is a good thing if you like being on you feet and putting things up over all is a good place to work nice and clean with friendly people
good,"It's a great job that can help you break the ice into starting your working life. It will train you about responsibility, patience and many other attributes. Working with the people honestly makes you immune to a lot of hardships in the future. I love and miss it."
good,"The life at Kroger is quite ordinary. It is very fast paced and you have to definitely know where to be and what to do or you will drown. Otherwise, it is a great place to start."
good,"Responsible for providing support to the grocery, dairy, frozen and beer/wine departments. Essential Job Functions. Provide a high level of prompt and friendly customer service. Receives product deliveries, ensuring order and invoice accuracy."
good,"I really enjoyed working there. I enjoyed communicating with customers and helping them. The management was very good, they were respectful and understanding."
good,"From the very beginning I received full job training and positive comments. There was a lot of coworker support."
good,I would recommend working at Krogers because of the benefits you'd recieve if full-time. I'm not a big fan of the fact you barely can recieve overtime.
good,Very easy to move up if you show the initiative. Everyone seems to enjoy working there even though the majority of them were just part time. The management is very understanding and helpful. But you get the occasional customer that is having a bad day which is not to fun to deal with. But since everyone was apart of a union some people got away with slacking off and not doing their part.
good,"Although the grocery retail business is a hectic place to work, I've grown tremendously in the company.  A typical day at the store is taking care of the daily operations, entering fuel surveys twice daily.  Handling all new-hire paperwork (i.e. I-9, work experience, drug testing, and mailing packets, scanning all data and filing).  Keep 3 calendars for managers' conference calls, meetings, etc.   Assisting all associates with questions and needs, as well as the Managers. The hardest part of the job is needing more hours in the day to complete the tasks required; as a rule, eight hours is not enough hours in the day to complete all tasks.   The most enjoyable part of the job are the customers and the associates.  I work with a great group of people at all three stores."
good,Everyone was friendly to each other and would work together to get things done. Also the Managers would work with you on your schedules if your child was sick or you just needed a personal day they will work with you to see what they could do to help.
good,I loved working there. Nice environment. Gets busy during the holidays. Working there was a nice experience. Taught me to have great customer service and be a people person.
good,"I love my job in Conyers. I typically work there on Saturdays and I love my people. The pharmacists are all my good friends, and the manager, Bill, is amazing. They all work incredibly hard, and I have learned so much from them."
good,I worked for this company for over a year and really enjoyed my time there everyone is close and works together just to make the coustmers happy which is number one goal
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was looking for to Tuesdays nights into Wednesday mornings and Sundays. "
good,"It's been a long time since I worked here.  The job was stressfull."
good,The staff there turns into your family. You become close to them and the shifts go by faster. Learn the basics of customer service and how to interact and deal with people's issues and attitudes in a professional manner.
good,"Krogers is a fun, fast, and friendly work place. But it can be stressful when it comes to working with people who doesn't want to work. Some of the customers are amazing, and some can be a pain."
good,A typical day at Kroger was slow and then picked up at certain times of the day. I learned a lot while being there like cashing coinstars and how to use a check if that is how they were paying for their groceries. Management was nice to everyone there especially the customers. The workplace culture was fun to learn like how other people got along with one another and how we interacted with the employees and the customers. The hardest part of the job was having to bag the customers groceries if they had a big order and no bagger available to help you out. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet new people like the customers and employees.
good,Kroger's a very laid back environment but you have to cash people out in a timely manner .You have to always smile and greet customers .Most of the customers are very nice.
good,It's a great part time job.   Good people to work with everyday.   I have worked for other retail stores and this is very good.   You make the most of the job with your attitude and effort.
good,I liked working at Kroger. I didnt have any problems at all. They were good at working with schedules and if you needed more hours you would get the options to go to another store. My department manager just made if very easy and great to work for her.
good,I'll have a say Kroger was my favorite job. We got paid every week and I had a chance to meet amazing people there. You didn't have to worry about anyone standing over you. The managers were pretty awesome as well. There was a lot of teamwork involved.
good,This job treated me well. There were some personal issues i had but none that would change my mind about this job being a good job. they work well with school schedules and any other schedules you may have.
good,"My main responsibilities each day, was to look for shoplifters.  I learned that the job was fun, but I wasn't being challenged.  I wanted to be able to do more investigative work, but there was never an opportunity for that.  We were basically self managed unless we had an issue that required a supervisor.   The company had a friendly workplace culture.  The hardest part of the job was not having the ability to investigate more internal theft.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a partner and working at different locations in the Nashville area."
good,Easygoing and very customer friendly. Customers are the number one priority. Management can be a little better such as attitude.Its well organize and steady pace
good,I loved the fast paced environment and the interaction I had with customers. I also enjoyed being able to go outside and in a sense relax getting carts. I also enjoy the multi tasking the job required.
good,The staff and customers are great. The work was enjoyable. Management was fair and understanding when handling disciplinary measures. Policies were followed especially since Kroger was a Union company.
good,"Going into my work day at Kroger was always fast pace. There was always something to do the entire shift. I didnt learn much being that I was only a curtesy clerk. Management at Kroger was very nice, and motivational. The workplace was extremely nice. The hardest part about the job was taking in the carts. The most enjoyable part was just being an associate in general. 10/10 recommendation from me."
good,Kroger is a place for a start up career. I recommend kroger to anyone who has the desire to start a career. At kroger there is friendly atmosphere of work experience.
good,my day would usually go by fast because of how busy it can get. Loved every single day working there. The management was great. Hardest part of my job having to be at 3 places at a time cause everyone wanted me to do a replacement or push carts or be at the register ect.. I honestly enjoyed every second i was there loved working with my food 4 less family and helping out customers i am extremely people friendly! regardless of how rude customers would get.
good,"Working at Fred Meyer was a lot of busy work. I never had time to think about my personal life during work so it was a good way of forgetting my every day life.  There were bad customers, but that's every where, as long as you knew when to call a supervisor for help. The  advancement was easy as long as you looked for it and talked to your management."
good,"Room for advancement."
good,"i loved it but not what i wanna do."
good,"The environment was great and my coworkers and managers were very sweet. I learned how to deal with difficult customers, and master my communication skills."
good,"Same as any job I guess once you've been there for 15 years. Love my customers and patients, co-workers come and go, supervisors come and go also. Always the same motivation to get me through the day - make one customer have a better day than they were having when they came in Kroger."
good,"Kroger was a family oriented, customer friendly place to work. The support for the pharmacist is good and they provide more tech hours for pharmacists"
good,"no complaints. very good job to have. only reason i left is because of the military. Can make a career.... good discounts, on everything. Never fell behind always being pushed to succeed"
good,"Good place to work, room for advancement if you are interested & aren't afraid to try something different. Hours may vary depending on what job you have & what you want to work towards. Nice benefits & nice people."

good,"I absolutely loved my job at Kroger. They provide awesome benefits,  including decent health insurance. They are very flexible with your schedule,  and it didn't take long to get a full-time position."
good,"Read paper with tasks to do that day, finish them."
good,Working at Kroger was a great experience. No matter your position at the store you get the chance to learn and do every aspect of the store. I personally enjoyed working at Kroger. The pay could be better for the amount of work you do but depending on what your looking for it can work for you.
good,A typical day goes by interacting with a lot of great people. Great job for college students due to flexible hours. Learned a lot about management. Job required a lot of walking as you are helping newcomers at job so wear something you are comfortable with
good,"I have enjoyed myself working in customer service for Kroger. I handled returns, customer complaints, western unions, and managing the front end of the store. There are great benefits and great pay raises over time. You can be moved to different departments and they will work with you. I have had great managers and always a great experience working there. I had to leave to go to college, but I will always remember the great experience I've had."
good,"This was a very demanding job with long work hours, short turn around periods, and often long work commutes. I learned valuable customer service skills, and the ability to think quickly on my feet. The hardest part of the job was the goal of providing the customer with the best possible shopping experience consistently from open until close; although, that was the ultimate goal daily. The customers and the associates were the best part of working there. I met some great people and forever friends."
good,Great company to work for good hours and good people and a pleasant work environment I would definitely recommend the Kroger company to anyone. I was sad to leave but had to quit to take care of my parents full time
good,"Every employee is happy and friendly and treats each other like they are family. It is enjoyable environment to not only work in, but ultimately be a part of."
good,"Typical day: complete customer service, stay positive."
good,"my typical day starts out with cleaning up after the shift before me, then preparing for my shift to start by getting food ready to be cooked or helping the customers at the counter."
good,I enjoyed working for this company. In my position I developed in my team building experience and learned how to lead a team and the management  staff allowed me the ability to grow without micromanaging.
good,"Great place to work, but the drive was a bit too far for me.  The management was awesome too!  The warehouse is very cold, so be prepared to ware warm clothing."
good,"Very fun and relaxed environment. Management always happy and having fun with us, very good culture and team spirit. Benefits were great, pay was good. Enjoyed my time there very much."
good,"A typical day is busy and fast pace.  I continually add to my skills by training in different areas. Every employee has a different back ground and it is fun and very enjoyable to learn about each person.  The hardest part of the job is time management, but it comes in time. Each day you improve and learn a better and faster method."
good,Very busy always moving management was always on hand to help out. Employees were always nice fun environment. Steady schedule. Meeting people from everywhere around the world.
good,I love working at Kroger. I learned a lot from that experience. The manager love me she said son ain't nobody ever worked here and had to jobs. Kroger is a good place and it's steady work. I love steady work makes time go bye.
good,"Working in the pharmacy call center was a fast paced environment. You answer calls from pharmacy customers. Training is extensive, pay is decent, benefits are good."
good,Overall a great company. Includes endless benefits with a very flexible schedule. This job would be perfect for someone who is looking for a first job because their very specific about stuff and will guide you throughout the process.
good,Kroger is a great company to work for. my typical day at work is very stressful. Kroger is very busy all the time especially on Tuesdays (senior discount)
good,positive and friendly environment. working here has been a great experience though it has its up and downs like any other work.the people are great and they do well with working around your schedules. theirs always something to do or someone to help
good,Great experience learning how to make sure you help customers at all times learn how to weigh certain items and how to wrap it properly and make sure customers are always satisfied
good,A really good job but I don't think you get paid enough for what you do and what you deal with at times. I would of loved to stay if I would of gotten better pay for what I was doing.
good,Working here was interesting because they gave me a lot of room to do what I wanted. They gave me a few requirements (text fonts and graphic colors) but it was really me on my own and I loved it. I was able to get a lot of good stuff without the stress of having to make sure I shoot every single thing. They trusted in my skills and loved the finished projects.
good,At the end of the day kroger is a nice place to work. The hours are sometimes b.s. but if you need that check then suck it up and work. The people are friendly and you can learn alot. The only problem is trying to transfer from one location to another.
good,i had to quit at fry's because i injured my self on the job and i couldn't receive light duty work. they had an awesome work environment. and great pay.
good,"The support inclusion, diversity, management friendly, lunch and breaks on time. Paid weekly. They train you the proper way so that you know your job."
good,"I love working at kroger. Management is supportive, it is easy to move up the later, however, unless you've been working there for years or you are full time, the pay is not that great."
good,Managers are friendly both to the employees and customers. Employees are friendly too. Their produce are always fresh and of good quality. The pay is quite low
good,"I enjoyed being a seasonal employee at Kroger Corporate in Atlanta, GA.  The environment was never stressful, and the management seem to really care about their employees.  The big bonus was getting free samples of food and other products that Kroger was introducing in their stores.  Unfortunately, the corporate office had to cut some positions."
good,"It is a great starting out in life job with hard-working coworkers, and great management.  They help you when you have a particular issue that needs to be solved."
good,Great people to work with. just pay not good. Great place to work for. Overall i recommend for second job. Can have fun while working. laid back place to work. great benefits and cheap. just wouldn't let you get full time
good,Loved working for Smiths. Great company and great people working there. Only bad thing I can remember is too many hours and not enough time to spend with my young family.
good,"I worked here while in high school, it was not to bad. I done a bit of everything from running the cash register to stocking some departments. It was not a bad experience though sometimes I would get calls while in class asking me to come in to work. I wish they would have cooperated more with my schooling schedule. I made friends while working there though! Raises were not so great. All in all, it was an alright experience."
good,"The job had pretty good benefits but the pay wasn't good whatsoever until I started doing payroll. Working just as a cashier was nice because I got to meet many different people within the day and it was about speed, customer service and so much more."
good,"Pick n Save was my first job, I learned how to handle money, cashier, bag groceries and face the store. I only worked about 5 hour days and 20-25 hour weeks. i enjoyed the management and meeting new customers."
good,I have learned so much working for this company. I had every opportunity to advance in this company and i took every one of them... I love working for Kroger but i'm finding it so difficult to transfer to my new location.
good,"Overall good company to work with. Provided work life balance. Got to work with different kind of people and different work flow models like waterfall, agile etc. Necessary training was provided. Very friendly staff and nice work place"
good,I liked kroger because they had a very flexible work schedule and would work with you. The mangers where nice and would help you with any task you don't know about.
good,"I loved it,it Was nice . People were nice and clean it was a good environment the pay was well I work my way from the bottom to the top everyone like my work I like my work to satisfactory in my work my floors was raided a number 5 out of Wonderful everyone was satisfied wish I could get back into that line of work again I respected the people around me and they respected me ."
good,"a fair company to work for.  They have a good work life balance.  management supports their teams incapacity to full fill job requirements.  "
good,Kroger was my first job and I really enjoyed it. The management really cared about the customers as well as the employees. When i was first hired i was a bag boy by the time i left i was a cashier.
good,"This was an amazing job. It offers decent pay, pretty good benefits, pretty good chances at advancement. The hours are good, and schedules are pretty flexible. Most of the people i worked with were amazing as well. My only problem with the job were that there were too many bosses to report to, and they never seemed to be on the same page. Other than that, it was a great job."
good,Great benefits and security with the organization.  Only downfall is always working weekends and holidays.  This becomes very difficult to miss out on family time.
good,I belive that pick n save is a place where you can have expand your experience to be stronger in your work i became ill so my i didnt stay very long however it had its cons and pros like another job.
good,.Enjoyed the customers. I was a cashier. Management was good.. Checked out customers. It was a good place to work people were nice.
good,They make sure you get your work breaks and are very understanding if you have to call in or swap days with other employees.
good,Everything is truly great about Mariano's the customers the management co-workers Accentra. Everyone's great everyone's friendly. Truly the only thing that made me leave was the work-life balance some weeks I was doing 80 to 90 hours a week during the day as well as over night. the WELL over work you.
good,"Great work place, Flexible hours, friendly Coworkers and will help you gain a lot of experiences. Easy to adapt to busy place."
good,"The Typical day at work was one a person couldn't complain, The people were nice and the work was fulfilling. I learned great customer service and money handling and money responsibility. Management were always fare and only wanted what was expected. The workplace culture was always welcoming and fun. The hardest part of the job was being overwhelmed with customers with not much help but I always got the job done and the best part of the job was being able to put in a good days work."
good,This place gave me an opportunity for work when I was in highschool and gave me several job promotions. I started as a bagger and soon got a job promotion to customer service and then to a manager of the Nature's Market section.
good,Job made me happy to come to work because I was able to get in a routine and know what I needed to do each shift. I enjoyed the beginning of the shift because I would get the feel for what was to be done for the day.
good,I enjoyed working and been a happy customer at Kroger's if I could get rehired I would do it again. The management and the Kroger team itself was very wonderful caring people and loving.
good,I started on the floor learned all jobs then got the appertaining to become a supervisor I ran the night shift 4 department shipping receiving produce and fozen and dry food department
good,"A typical day at work would be bagging groceries, and going outside and pushing carts. What I learned from working at Kroger is that you and your cashier need to be on the same page at all times to complete a customers check out. Management is good. The workplace culture is upbeat, and nice. The hardest part of the job for me was bagging groceries fast enough. The most enjoyable part was pushing carts, or working with people I liked."
good,Kroger was and is a great company. It was a good start for me after finishing school. The company and people are very welcoming but I wanted something more.
good,The staff is almost pretty chill and very understanding. They provide great hands on training. I like this place because i feels like a grocery store and not a big town corporate place to shop. Every department is clean and well taken care of
good,My very first taste of the workforce and how to carry myself as a responsible adult. Kroger was a great family environment.
good,"Enjoyable employees, friendly & courtesy. Hardest part is trying to go fast on the register. You may get 50 coupons from one customer."
good,"I type prescriptions, answer phones, fill prescriptions, and help with any general questions the customer may ask. I ring customers out at the register. I've learned to always be patient no matter what the circumstance may be. Management is so awesome in the pharmacy, and so helpful. I enjoy working with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is when someone don't show up to work and you have to do everything, but there's nothing like having a good working crew that works together to get things accomplished. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you know your customers by their name that make them feel so special."
good,"Work is very enjoyable at Kroger due to the casual conversations you have each day with customers as well as other co-workers. Co-workers will usually make or break this job for you, as you interact with them often and they will usually make you look forward to going to work if they're friendly. You typically do the same thing each day with a little variety every now and again."
good,I have no complaints about working there it was fun. The people there were really kind and flexible. There was never any bad experiences with Kroger for me.
good,"Love when the kids want to help out I enjoy there company."
good,"Kroger is awesome, so let me tell you the only drawback right from the start: the pay sucks. That's the only bad thing about working at Kroger. After union dues and taxes, I ended up making between $5.50 and $6.50 per hour, and I wasn't even making minimum wage! However, the manager at my Kroger was a great guy who was very active throughout the store. He knew every employee by name and was very kind. My co-workers in my department (Drug/GM) were great people, and so were the ones in other departments. I could sit here and talk all day about the great experience that I had there. The community was really what stood out to me. Everyone treated me like a friend, whether or not we actually knew each other. I would highly suggest working here."
good,A fun workplace where you meet new people every day and enjoy the company of fellow co-workers. The hardest part of the job is when customers want to heat up food and it is against store policy.
good,Great people and fast working environment.  Work days are counting money and taking orders and smileing all day. You get breaks and lunches.
good,It was always fun working here at Kroger. We would always have competitions to see who could get the highest ring tender score each week. I usually won and i coached others on how to improve their scores.
good,"I get everything done the mangers are very sweet, my co workers and I always work together to get the job done. The hardest part of this job is being in the freezer finding meat. The most think I like about this job is I love talking to the customers because they are nice most of the time if you be nice to them."
good,Taking calls from customers to place orders for clothing. Calls would either come in via Redline call from store or directly from customers number. Helped trouble shoot problems with internet when customers were placing orders.
good,My favorite job I have ever had! I made so many wonderful friends for life and actually looked forward to coming to work. The management was pretty good. I really loved being able to help people as much as possible and this is a great job for a teen just starting out to advance if they are hard working.
good,"I really enjoy working at Kroger it was enjoyable. I love working with co-workers, sometimes my job could be difficult when everyone didn't play as a team"
good,Total warehouse of shipping and receiving with a lot of fun associates to work with.  It is rewarding and uplifting.  I enjoy being hands on and in the warehouse with the employees.
good,I met a lot of good people at this grocery store. My second job I learned a lot of different things about food. Also met a co worker who introduced me to even better opportunities.
good,"Work was fair but, there was no room to grow with the company and sonority polices mad it hard to make set schedule which is necessary for my home life."
good,"I never had a problem with Kroger. Management was helpful, but attitudes changed when Corporate would visit the store. There were many obstacles for advancement, though it was possible for literally anyone to obtain a management position after a time. Good insurance and benefits. This company was amazing to work for, but, with rising costs of living, I had to seek other employment."
good,Liked the discounts and the employee discount. I liked my boss had no trouble with anyone. Liked the people I worked with also liked to stock.
good,"You come in make sure your work area is clean and make sure you enough cash in the register drawer, you stand at the end of your aisle until someone is ready to check out. If there are not enough baggers to help carry out customers groceries and if you are not busy then you can sometimes help carry out groceries to the customers cars. I learned how to work and talk to customers. I also learned how to be responsible for the money that was in register drawer. Management was pretty good. As long as you did your job then they pretty much didn't bother you. The co-workers I had working at Kroger were very interesting since there were a few that were from different countries and I got to learn a lot about their home countries and what brought them to the U.S. Trying to make sure people didn't try to steal items from the store and watch out for people would try and use a stolen credit card. I just enjoyed enter acting with the people whether they be the customers or my co-workers and knowing that I did my best at my job at the end of the day."
good,Love working and learning new experience and skills people are great friendly to each other and also arent afraid to help each other out
good,"I worked in the floral department and love everyday of work. It's a very busy spot, well at least my store was. We averaged at least $8,500 in sales on a basic week. I learned lots of leadership responsibilities and had the pleasure of joining head department meetings an regional floral  meetings."
good,It was great moving customers  in and out of stores in a fast pace environment  ...also  making our customers  happy  was our  main focus
good,I enjoy working with my co-workers in providing nothing but the best customer service experience possible for the guests. And going out of my way to make sure things smoothly.
good,"Good job culture, but pay is not competitive enough. Keeps you busy and management listens.  Coworkers are awesome, but experience varies by location."
good,"Although I haven't been working in this store for a very long time.  I enjoy working at this location. "
good,"a typical day at work was never the same, you never knew how the day was going to plan out.  You never knew if you were going to be fully staffed or not.  I learned how to be the boss and take actions in my own hands and to do what i thought was right at the right time.  The management was always kind and helpful. Co-workers were easy to work with and was never really a problem.  Hardest part of the job was making sure everyone was doing what they are suppose to do."
good,Nice people to work with. The customers were usually nice but a few were like sour apples. I learned how to deal with the sour apple customers.
good,Kroger is a great company to work for if you are looking for either part-time work or full-time work. They enjoy advancing people who earn it and will work with you to earn it.
good,Learned a lot about fashion and even leadership. Ii had a wonderful team lead and manager both were very hands on and you could tell they cared about their employees and their customers
good,"I was only an intern at Ecolab, but I enjoyed it.  If you work for the company the Benefits are amazing.  While I worked there a man retired form the line at the factory.  He was making more money in retirement than when he was employed there."
good,I absolutely adore my customers. They make my day worth wild. Knowing i made their day with a simple hello or smile gives me a sense of accomplishment.
good,The work is not hard the only reason I am looking for another job is because this is night shift. I prefer to work either first or second shift. I am also looking for a better paying job.
good,"Nice atmosphere to work in, all managers and office workers are really caring for their employees. I really like meeting new customers and meeting their needs and quick check out. The pay and hours worked could be better."
good,Kroger is a great place to work. Co workers and employees are very friendly. Everyone works as a team to get the job done. All the managers make it a point to know every employee and makes sure every work day goes smooth.
good,I loved working for Kroger. It was a perfect pace for me and I liked the customer service interaction. Working for Kroger for a total of 4 years has taught me a lot about how to work with people and general customer service. I've never had problems with management or co-workers.
good,Overall Operating procedures of the dairy department.Fully stocked and displayed  Frozen stock and also focus on replenishing product that is located in the refrigerated sections of the store
good,Great place to work. Great place to shop. The most enjoyable part for me is to see my employees happy every week. I enjoy every aspect of Kroger.
good,Steadily paced work enviornment with many different work areas. Management and co-workers were easy to work with and always there to help you when needed.
good,"Customer satisfaction."
good,"It's a very easy-going type of job. There's a lot of standing around waiting for customers, but I did learn a lot. Smile, communicate, and to go above and beyond no matter how small the job is. Of course I learned basic cashier responsibilities also. Management was great and did their jobs very well and by the book. My co-workers were a very diverse set of people that I was able to work as a team with and made work enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was memorizing where things were in the store to help customers. The most enjoyable part was working in an enthusiastic work environment. Previous jobs I have had weren't so ready to set goals and accomplish them. I loved having my managers encourage me to go the distance, instead of just running the store."
good,"Though at times hectic, I learned almost everything I know about amazing customer service, team work, and critical problem-solving, and leadership skills, while working at Kroger."
good,"I'd return to the retail floor with Kroger, and I did... repeatedly.  A wide range of customer needs allows one to have the diversity of interaction to make a business interesting and always changing."
good,"I can't say enough great things about Kroger, the union as well as all other infrastructure departments and personnel."
good,Management works with employees to accommodate busy lifestyles when making schedules! Recognizes team effort with rewards. Management also coaches members to cultivate personal and career growth.
good,Kroger has been one of the best employers I have ever worked for. They care about their associates and provide one of the best benefit packages available. Senior management cares about its people and works to provide a safe working environment. Mid-level leadership is power hungry and not as motivated to take care of their team as the senior managers. There is room to improve in the area's of work/life balance and employee stress. Overall an excellent employer.
good,"Ths was my frist job and I really enjoyed working here. The managers trusted me to handel their peresious customers, profit and products. For me this job was pretty easy since guinean customer service comes natural for me. I enjoyed working closely with the public. I was even promoted to night shift attendent. This was the first time I was trusted to work independently."
good,"This company has many transferable skills and enjoyable environment. pay rates could be better, but as a start up job this is perfect!"
good,"Friendly busy work environment. "
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was the people I was able to work with each day and solving problems for customers. Management, however, seemed out of touch with workers efficiency and how to run the departments smoothly."
good,"also liked getting to know regular customers,who came in all the time,out of the 9yrs.i was there i called out sick twice,i came in alot on my days off quite a bit also,as my store director always could count on me to come in,when he was short handed."
good,i liked the job overall just the management is not so good in general. and the co workers looked out for one another and helped each other
good,I love working for Smiths.  It is a very nice place to work and to make friends with the customers. Fun work place with a very supportive manager.  I really enjoy working for smiths but I would rather try to make more money.  I am a very good worker and I love people.
good,"On any given day, we started out with a team meeting(all depts.). Then we would share this info with our own dept.. Every dept made sure their section was Key-Retailing ready. "
good,"A typical day at work requires a lot of physical work lifting heavy objects, stocking product, and applying excellent customer service. management is very friendly as well as the co-workers."
good,"When I clock in, I get straight to work. I either bag groceries or put items back on the shelf. I learned how to be patient with people and work a cash register even though i'm not a cashier. Management is friendly and knows what they are doing. Some of my supervisors were not friendly and didn't know how to do their job. The hardest part of the job is dealing with an angry customer. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking to customers making them smile and being able to help them and keep them satisfied."
good,"A typical day at work is very hectic. As an order picker, you would four 10 hour shifts which are very busy. The perishable side of the DC alone moves over 300,000 cases every day. I have learned a list of valuable skills such as: self-motivation, time management and team building. I have also learned warehouse based skills such as proper stacking procedures."

I learned that a gas station is a very fast business. You will see a lot of customers come and go and you need to be able to keep up with the pace. The managment were not very helpful at times and left me to deal with complicated situations by myself and the coworkers were very helpful and hard working.

The most enjoyable part of my job is being around people i enjoy working with as well as fulfilling the needs and wants of customers and patients."

My co-workers were very helpful and nice, but also helped you to be independent in the job. The hardest part of the job wasn't the work, it was not knowing when you were going to get off. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work independently, at your own pace, driving the pallet jack."

Even sometime they have you do two of those at a time. I learned about how to give great customer service and how to work as a team. The managers are easy to get along with. My past coworker were a blast to work with and made the job even better to be work at. The hardest part of the job would have been upset customers. The most enjoyable part of the jobs was working with my coworkers. And also the customers that would become a regulars in the store. So overall I enjoyed the job."

good,Great place to work. Great co-workers. Great leaders and managers. Little to no ability to move forward quickly due to it being a Union run facility.
good,"The reason I love to work at my Kroger is because of the people there. Some have worked there for so long, that to imagine them gone just feels like you're missing a part of the department. The hardest part is the always changing schedule One week you're on mornings, then the next you're working till close. The management team is great, sometimes you might have a problem with one but it's usually just because they are busy not because they are ignoring you."

good,"The daily work of a Staff or Floating Pharmacist with Kroger involved reviewing the preverification and verification screens for accuracy and appropriate drug therapy from scanned written, e-scribed, transferred , faxed and phoned prescriptions. There was also the various aspects of obtaining insurance claim approval for non-covered medication and prior authorization from doctors offices. A large part of this is handled by the techs with help from us. The only drug orders we are responsible for were C II's (narcotics). Occasionally we would review a computer regenerated order to update shorted or patient specific drugs. You would always support the work of the technicians because the work flow was dependent on them. you also acted as a leader of the work flow because the final product was dependent on you. The hardest part of the job is remembering to be empathetic to the needs of the customer during the highest volume periods. The most enjoyable part of the job was counseling the patient on their medication questions and resolving any insurance claims issues. Management was for the most part supportive,fair,and inventive in their problem solving."

good,"Kroger is really a great place for really energetic people. It's extremely fast paced (right up my alley) & the people are awesome. The only issue I had with it was that they didn't work as a family, at least not where I worked, it was each department to themselves and throw whomever under the bus to make them look angelic. The pay was terrible & the hours flip-flopped too much. I loved my co-workers though. I loved the vibe. I miss it terribly, sometimes."

good,"Working at Kroger was very much an enjoyable experience. Upper management and the ""higher ups"" of the company genuinely seemed to care about the well being and happiness of their employees, while still ensuring excellent customer service. The hardest part of the job was the irregular hours, but that was expected as a part time job from me, so it didn't bother me too much. The most enjoyable part was definitely my coworkers and activities put together by the company. "
good,"Well working at Krogers was a fun experience. I worked overnight with 5 other guys. We worked after the store closed so there was no one in our way and we were not in anyone elses way either. We mainly did stocking. My co-workers were fun to work with, even when someone was feeling to great. The hardest part of the job was when someone didnt show up to work, that means we had to work harder. The most enjoyable part of the job was going home."
good,Great management that truly care about all their employees. Always room for advancement. Great chance to meet new people.
good,We serve customers and direct them to where they need to go. We have parties to recognize employees for a job well done. They also recognize graduates from high school and College. This is a grat place to work and I like the people. The management team works well with each employee and is there if one needs them. The hardest prt of the job is the cleaning and making sure everything is done. The most enjoyable part of the job is the employees and the customers.

good,kroger was a great experince for me to get better understanding of customer service skills also unvestory skills.
good,"As a company, Kroger is a great place to be. Decent pay, great benefits(at Least in the pharmacy department). Fun crew to work with. Enough hours given so as not to have to work short handed."
good,The company seems to really care about it's employees. We receive gifts when our safety record reaches certain milestones. Managers are great! The training was a little lacking but they are currently working to improve it.
good,"The Kroger Company stand by it's values. A very uplifting company to work for. Acknowledging not only the needs of the customer, but also it's employees and the community."
good,My first job out high school started at 8.15 an hr not many job advances given after 2 years I got a 10 cent raise hrs were flexible team work and great employee benefits
good,Do your best that you can do at the job you are on. Follow the directions of management. Ask for help when you are not sure what the management person says needs done.
good,"I learned multi-tasking,customer service,physical labor,time management, friendly service,social skills and working as a team.  Hardest part of the job is standing on your feet for several hours."
good,This was my best experience with work. I had a lot of team members who had my back and I had there’s. Management was amazing and never slacking. I recommend this job place to a lot of people who need a job.
good,The customers are really nice and you have coworkers and managers who are very nice and caring the company does lots of fun stuff and also has good benefits
good,Wonderful training program. Everything is pretty much on the computer and you get a schedule of the 90 day training schedule. You can work on the job And complete the assignments after.
good,The thing that not many people understand is that Kroger is a very fast paced environment. You will have to learn how to work in it’s very busy environment if you hope to be a great asset. Every position is important even though some might not think so. But a bad thing about Kroger is that they value some positions more than others which is unfair to the other peers working hard.
good,"I had the pleasure of working at Kroger for my first job experience, while there I have learned good communication skills, organization, and time management."
good,"One of the best jobs I've ever had, although pay is lacking. My current manager is the best I've ever had, and I've had a lot of experience in shipping, distribution, warehouse, and supply chain. "
good,"Easy, fun and relaxed the job was exciting an different everyday so it never felt boring or a routine to clock in every night, the people are very fun to work alongside as well."
good,"I enjoyed working at Kroger’s for a year while attending school ,now that I have graduated and it’s time for me to MoveOn and get a full-time job with a career and learning new skills."
good,"It is a great place to work. I love most of my coworkers! The job can be very stressful, but yet rewarding. However, Kroger’s technicians are definitely under paid."
good,"Kroger is a great place to work. It was a professional work environment and I learned many different aspects of the business.  I was responsible for taking and filling orders then delivering to the customer. I worked at the register and helped bag groceries. I helped stock shelves. I greeted customers and I cleaned bathrooms if needed. The hardest part of the job was not knowing what position I would be working from day to day or being pulled from one job to do another. Overall, working at Kroger was a learning experience and a fun place to work."
good,"Loved working there just had some family issues that caused me to move back home to Gulfport,Ms. But a great place to work flexible hours holiday pay. Awesome benefits. Very clean and sanitized."
good,When I was there it was an enjoyable time to work.  You meet a lot of interesting people.  You can become quite close with them.  It is hard work also.
good,What I found is that if u got to work with it on your mind I come to make people's day when I get their my my minds made to smile talke to scan and see if anyone needs help. In a way treat people how I would like to be treated when I go shopping or out eat.
good,Good place to work if you are a stocker not working front end.management is good on the highway 72 Kroger. A lot of walking but I  didn't mind. Treated right but take my advice and don't work outside your pay grade bc upper management will pill things on you.
good,"Kroger is a fine company to work for. Competent management, helpful customers. Good benefits and pay with plenty of the little things for associate appreciation to brighten up the time spent there further"
good,I work as a department head. This job has gotten too overwhelming with all the constant changes. Management has no clue how to manage anymore they are so scared about losing their jobs that they have all department heads and other employees stressed out. They complain about how we aren't doing enough when we are doing our best. They are very strict on over time but will waste time to head to morning huddles
good,"Great job to work for. Management was very good. Over whelming environment at times, but that is very typical with a retail pharmacy that has quite a good reputation."
good,"On a typical day, usually about 4pm is when its starts to get busy. Overall the managers we're great, it was just one manager in particular that I had an issue with. The hardest part of the job is when you get a rude customer and you have to resolve their complaint. The most enjoyable part of the job is when it gets really busy and i have to work fast. Its enjoyable because as I'm constantly busy, time goes alot faster."
good,Secure place to work as a pharmacy tech. Great benefits with the company. Great grocery store with competitive pricing. The company now offers corporate positions.
good,"Great co workers and great environment,  always felt comfortable and relaxed walking into work and loved working in the starbucks kiosk,  always had fun"
good,It was a really good environment to work in. Everyone was very helpful and truly cared about each other and the customers as well. Management tried their hardest to be very flexible and work with your schedule
good,"There are always students and retirees working here, and it's about what you'd expect of a cashier position. Nice honest work that's not too stressful."
good,I had an awesome experience working for Kroger Pharmacy. I worked while attending pharmacy school and I was able to balance the workload with school work.
good,As a cashier i was given a good experience to work in public. The day to day work truly teaches you a little bit about account and money management understanding.
good,Kroger is a great company. They have awesome Benefits & acknowledge great work.  They most definitely work around your school schedule if you’re a cheerleader or in any other activities l.
good,I enojyed my time at kroger it was a great job did what i was told and never complained i was always on time and gave 110 percent the people wher friendly and liked the customers
good,"Working at Kroger or in this case frys can be a lifetime job. The benefits are good, workers are great, and over all jobs opportunities are limitless. At times expect leaving, many store or salary mangers ask associates to go up the management ladder or do something else. Its a nice place to work. But at times seniority is a thing i dislike about. But its s good job and can make things great."
good,"I took the job because I wanted to work in a grocery store, also I enjoy baking...it relaxes me. I wanted to be a stocker so I can get some exercise while I work. I also wanted to be a cashier because I like to interact with people. So I think since I was away from the work environment for a while the bakery section was good fit. I got my exercise stocking bakery section shelves, and I interacted with coworkers and some customers."
good,Do your work and stay out the way you’ll be good. Mostly nice employees and managers. Nice and clean work environment. Temperatures can be a little low so long sleeves is a option.
good,"The culture had Kroger was amazing. You make life long friends there, the people that work there are wonderful. You get to see a lot of customers that become regulars there. Overall, it was one of my favorite places to work at."
good,Love working there.  It has a lot of benefits where I didn't have at Wall's IGA.  The worst part was the young guys wanted you to do all the work and they just stood idly by.  But the good part was the supervisor would see them and make them help me.  The managers are real nice people who run it.  They try to equal the work load out to all employees.  Not just one.  I like that.  The most enjoyable part was to meet New people when I waited on customers.  A lot of them would be regulars and come back.
good,"I worked in various positions for many years. I only left because of a generous severance package. Sometimes it was stressful, but when working for a great manager who can support and mentor it was a great place to work. A lot of good people who know their stuff"
good,"Quite yet relaxing job   "
good,The other employees were easy to get along with and excepted mistakes as I learned. Training went as fast or slow as needed. I was supported and questions were encouraged. Discipline was constructive and collaborative.
good,"Overall a great company I’ve worked in several different states and also moved up in positions "
good,work and life balance is awesome! pay and benefits is good. not much of work dramas and if you like working on your own and do your thing go home after this is the place for you.
good,"The benefits for working here were extremely good."
good,"My job at Kroger was a great first job experience. Most of the customers were very kind, as was the managers. My managers cared about their employees and did the best they could to help those of us with issues. It was typically very busy, and there was almost always something to do. The hardest part of the job was cart retrieval on a very busy day. It was hard to keep the lobby stocked when you couldn't even find a cart outside."
good,Managers can be quite harsh but then there are some nice problem is many are always coming and going after a few months. Coworkers are always nice and helpful especially when there’s a new person.
good,"How to handle the money.."
good,Kroger in Belpre Ohio has the best staff and managers. They provide a friendly and minimal stress work environment.  Management is more than willing to help with any situations that occur.
good,"The productivity was very good for the most part, but management was not so we'll maintained there. Everyone I worked with was really nice and worked well."
good,"Dillons Warehouse is a great place to work for anyone willing to work hard. Its pretty fast paced, literally moving all day moving boxes. The pay is great, including the new incentive pay system they just started at our warehouse, after probation (90 days) Your wage is $17.51/Hr as long as you're meeting standards. Overtime is paid daily rather than after 40 hours. It's unionized so youre guaranteed the full 40 every week. Benefits are great and job security is great!"
good,"Its an okay store. Its got a great dairy and produce section. The beer and wine sections are good. The managers are bad and the pay is bad"
good,Working for Kroger was honestly the best place that I have ever worked at and I was 3rd generation to work at Kroger so I kind of in a way had a back door advantage but I knew better then to use it.
good,For a minimum wage job that was only supposed to be temporary I ended up loving it. The employees are friendly and management treats you like a long time friend. The hours are flexible and if you feel like you’re not getting enough hours in one department you can switch to a different department.
good,"Although i do love my job, we could have more dedicated employees who do their own fair share of the work. I highly recommend a career with Kroger, as there are many chances for advancement if you are willing to put in the hard work and dedication,  I look forward to seeing where this road will take me."
good,"I loved working at Kroger, the environment was always positive. The only reason I left was the pay was not comparable to other local jobs and not enough for the cost of living."
good,A typical day at work would include daily trucks and counting inventory. The management was very helpful and would always work with me and my schedule from my other job.
good,typically work 8 hour shifts. Learn about the everyday business life within the company. Management can either be really nice or really horrible. Hardest part of the job is staying on your feet for long periods of time. I often walk 8-10 miles per 8 hr shift. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people.
good,In store management has always had a sense of caring and compassion for employees. They do a lot of good for their community and take many hours out of the work week to find time for fundraisers and spending time with the community. Pay could definitely be a bit more competitive.
good,"Kroger has its perks, the jobs are simple and you are assigned to one work area and that is where you stay. everyone there comes together as a team to strive and make it a great shopping experience"
good,Much room for an individual to grow and improve skills in a workplace designed to provide the most for both customer and employee. I miss working there.
good,"Having worked at Kroger for over a year, I have honestly fallen in love with my job. The workers of Kroger are very close together, I have several of my co-workers and Disregarding the staff, who I can be myself around, my customers are amazing."
good,"Kroger is a good company to work for. No matter what branch of theirs, the work place is decent, training is great. You have to be willing to go with the flow to get anywhere."
good,I like working here. The management is great. Most of the employees are nice. Some areas of the store have opportunities to move up. I started out as a part time cashier and am now a assistant customer service manager. The more effort you’re willing to do gives them reason to give you more hours.
good,"Good place for quick money. They pay weekly. Nice people and friendly environment. I mean, I don't know what else you guys want me to say. If you're that curious, apply for yourselves."
good,"A typical day at work would included smiling faces, good conversations and fast check outs. Management insures team work at its finest. Every day is a another opportunity to learn something new. ie departments"
good,"Kroger is a great company to advance in, they have good benefits and management was easygoing. Would recommend to anyone looking to work in the customer service business."
good,everyone is really nice but their is no communication with any of the departments. they keep the store extremely clean and everyone tries to be happy.
good,Working at a supermarket gave me great experience in retail and customer service. The environment was great and I was able to gain lots of experience thru getting promoted to different areas of the super market.
good,"For the first few months that I worked at Kroger, I had really bad hours per week. They over hired baggers and I had on a weekly basis for a few weeks only 4 hours per week. I eventually went to Trent the HR manager and told him about the problem. I was moved over to Deli and was getting 30 hours a week and had good co-workers."
good,"loved the job, "
good,"Overall I really enjoyed working in the location."
good,I just like to work there because people there are sweet and the manager is very helpful and caring and I just need a job that will fit me the best and not hard for me
good,"walked store, had morning meeting with the departments. check on stock levels, left list with employees , with the goals for the day and week. Made sure all advertising item were on display for customer to buy"
good,"Its a great place to work. My co workers, supervisors, and Manager were great to work with. I love working where I spend money anyway. I shop at Kroger."
good,Working in the deli at Fry's was a good experience. Met lots of great co workers and made friends with a lot of the customers. It was a great time slicing meat and cheese and offering samples to customers.
good,"Competitive environment with great pay and good benefits. Would recommend to a friend.  Requirements: Hard working, Physically fit, show up to work every day and respect the managers"
good,Working here was a great experience; Always something to do. Interacting with everyone all day helped build the necessary skills I needed improvement on.
good,"This was actually the first real job that I enjoyed. I liked the people, and atmosphere. I looked forward to going to work every day. The benefits and discounts where a good catch. I learned how to put my authority to good use and had fun learning the new ""scan, bag, go"". Hardest part for me was a disgruntled customer. The most enjoyable part was making sure my cashiers had their breaks. Plus rush peaks where a little demanding and crazy."
good,They treat you with respect. They answer all your questions. And they don't judge. The managers and other employees are very hard working and will always understand your questions and take the time to help you better understand.
good,"Working at Kroger was an great experience. I met many people. I assisted customers daily, stood at my register for long period of time. My favorite while working there was the special events, it help me bring out my crafts."
good,Kroger was my first job and the place where I learned to be a good worker. I was granted two awards during my work term that was geared toward my year of working there and being a hard worker. The management and staff set a family atmosphere making it a comfortable environment to work. The job was easy overall despite when baggers had to collect cart in the winter but my team worked together to get thee job done.
good,"A typical day is no typical day at all. If you're looking for a typical day, distribution centers aren't the job for you (at least not at Roundy's DC). At all times you must be ready to move quickly, lift properly, and stay safe all the while you're completing 1 or 2, 0-7 ft.  pallets on a heavy duty power worker. Not to mention you must do this in a very timely manner. Is it challenging? Absolutely, but it's also very far impossible. Yes it will challenge you physically and mentally, but what I have learned is if you follow the instructions given to you by the training team, you'll gradually become better and better until you're finally accomplishing every task that's given to you. With management that's always around the corner willing to help, nothing will ever seem impossible again if you're willing to get through the toughest part of the job which is staying strong mentally. Once you have done this, it becomes very enjoyable to challenge yourself or to even challenge others to compete scores, times, and percentages. With friendly and competitive co-workers, you're almost always looking forward to new days and new challenges."
good,"i honestly enjoy working at Kroger it was a great first job.  their was some easy days and some days were harder then usual, the manager was nice and always keeping a smile on your face, and there was some that was bosses too."
good,Management at this store is easy going and easy to talk to if and when there is a problem.  They follow though on things and that is important.  I have worked both inside the store and at the fuel station.  I like my job and look forward to working.
good,"Kroger is a Union store and the Union works for the employee, if you joined the union, they fought for top pay, job advancement and family life. Kroger made sure that both part-time and full-time had benefits. Overall great place to work for, however not all of the managers are that great."
good,"I started this job at 16 and it has changed my life ever since. I went from bagger, to cashier, to Front-end manager. I still have ties with Kroger and have a family from there."
good,I worked as the overnight stocker for the graveyard shift it was an easy job you could do just about anything you cared to do from listen to music while working to getting everything done as a group or doing each aisle individually.
good,Within my time working at Kroger made me mature with older people. Even when I was working in high school I still managed to get through school and work.
good,I have worked for many Pharmacies in my 20 year career but must say that Kroger was by far the greatest company I have ever worked for because they take great care of their employees. The benefits are fantastic and they go above and beyond to make sure their employees get what they need to have a comfortable work environment.
good,"I enjoyed working for this company, was hired as a night stocker, was then promoted to associate manager then to grocery manager.  Was unfortunate that I had to leave, but I loved to Oklahoma to be closer to my son and my family."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers, they have provided me with a family atmosphere. Working for  has given me the opportunity to provide for my family, fair wages, outstanding benefits. operating a 24 hour store was the toughest part, being a single mother and trying to cover when someone called in."
good,"Not hard work, great pay, way to many hours. This is a great place to work if you like to work 12 hour shifts. Job is very easy and the pay is really great."
good,The Kroger company is Deffintly a place to work if you're looking for either a job or a career. The company policies are fair for both thier employees and its customers.
good,"Very competitive and fast paced at times and slow paced too. The atmosphere was fun, hard working and labor intensive. I would love to work at Ralphs again when Ralphs is available to hire me again. My manager was very lenient with me and helped me when times were rough. I am grateful for my learning experiences with Ralphs and I am willing to learn again what has changed and what remains the same!"
good,This is a great company to work for. There are many opportunities to advance within the company and the compensation/benefits are phenomenal. Highly recommended.
good,Kroger's is amazing! I felt like I worked with family that wanted to see me succeed! Majority of my manager experience came from Kroger. Allowing me to apply for jobs I wasn't paper educationally qualified for.
good,"Great place to work, had great benefits for people with diabetes. Dont all ways believe in what they say about the unions.  If you take care of people and train them they will take care of yo."
good,"Good benefits union job. Difficult to get compared to other customer service jobs. Easy to keep. Laid back, managers only ask for what is fair. Do your job and you wont have a problem."
good,"Busy the day went fast, learned about pharmacy process, every one worked together well. managment was available when needing help , hardest part was lifting totes they were heavy, working as a team completing the job"
good,Being a customer service representative at Kroger was my favorite job ever. The customers and staff were both great. My job duties were fast paced and quick.
good,I had tons of fun working there and I would recommend it to anyone. I had a lot of good memories there and I hope to be there again one day. I gain a ton of experience too.
good,Like to deal with customers.. Help them to find what they want want and sell them more with the lower prices.. Made a lot of friends of customers who came back
good,Kroger is great for all the employees that love to talk to people and help them. benefits are great if you shop there and the co workers are nice. You will be taught great customer service techniques and will learn how to do your specific job extremely well.
good,Everyone at Kroger staff was very nice and patient. Walking into work was always a good thing and it felt good to be there. I had a lot to learn but never felt like I was rushed to. I felt like I was always supported by my coworkers.
good,Great job if you stay long enough to get full time. Pay raises twice a year unless you reach top pay then you only get pay raises once a year. Just have to stay there long enough to get your full-time status.
good,"I liked Krogers , it's good pay if you make full time . Most managers help you advance . The benefits were very good . As a whole the work culture was very enjoyable ."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Kroger. It was my first job when I moved to Tennessee and I loved the environment inside. We were like a family, including the guest that came in to shop. I built a lot of lasting friendships with people at that store. I worked there for a year, I started off as a bagger and when I left, I was supervising and working the guest service desk."
good,Great atmosphere with lots of opportunities to advance. Training was always given when needed. Lots of positivity and good vibes. Overall my favorite place I have ever worked.
good,"I worked here a couple times! Would definitely go back and work here again. I left due to loving to a different state that didn’t have this company. They were amazing with there employees making sure we all had a great work experience. Very kind caring, helpful people."
good,"As a part-timer we start our days restocking the shelves from the nightly deliveries. We then restock our meat and seafood service cases, cutting steaks, making burgers, seasoning chicken or seafood. Followed by servicing customers until preparing to close down at 8pm. We would then grind fresh beef, disassemble and clean the grinder and any knives or bowls used. Then clean and sanitize the floors of the cutting room and cooler. Next, we would package and price the service case beef and restock on the shelves for the following day. Lastly we would clean and sanitize the service cases and floors."
good,I enjoyed working for my supervisors however needed to hold employees responsible for not completing jobs required was educational and was taught to do other jobs
good,I actually hate that I got fired to be honest. I didn't know I was fired until they didn't put me on the schedule. I was shocked because I was a hard worker but I guess they were just randomly firing people.
good,"I'm able to go to work with each passing day and be happy on the way to work. I genuinely enjoy what I do. I enjoy working with the customers and management. I only wish that the pay was more, because it would be very difficult to sustain a reasonable living on my own with the amount of hours I work and the pay rate."
good,"This job is a great part time job, flexible hours, great pay wage, and great management and co-workers. This job gives you different tasks to complete to stay busy."
good,"learned office etiquette interviewing skills choosing the right employee for the right job. "
good,"The job overall is very fun, although at times business may increase. You meet fun people who are fun to work around and everyone is positive. Kroger has great benefits, whether you’re young or old."
good,"Overall things functioned smoothly, hectic/chaotic on some days but still functional. The staff is well trained and provide quality customer service. Great store."
good,"I would recommend this job for anyone with a desire to meet the needs of others, even if those needs seem mundane. The job can be draining at times, but rewarding."
good,I enjoyed working at Krogers.  Meeting new people and learning the everyday customers by name was excellent. I hate the Krogers in Clarksdale closed down.
good,-Good management
good,"I enjoy working with my customers. Some I have got to know on a first name basis. The workplace culture is the hardest. I am working with all age groups. That is challenging at times, but I am able to improve my skills everyday. I have enjoy working with my team, we have all grown close. Management always encourages employees to go the extra mile for customers if able to."
good,"A very great place to work at,"
good,"I managed up to 35 employees, help train them, made schedules, did  weekly and daily reports, attended board meeting with the heads of each departments and other managers. Also had conference calls and trainings."
good,"The workplace culture is excellent and I would take a job back at Kroger. Moreover, I had a nice time working at the store on University Drive. Thus, I feel if you show good customer service one will have a pleasurable time at Kroger."
good,My manager was super nice they made me feel comfortable and they were supportive about my pregnancy. We all worked as a team I enjoyed everyday I had to work.
good,A typical day here is typically slow with burst of customers at certain times. Memorizing the aisles and products are key to have upper hand on co-workers because you get to advance more as you learn the steps. The management here is overall pretty good with your occasional manager who doesn't do much. Many people here are friendly and easy to work with.
good,I love kroger and the employees but management could do better asssisting the needs of their employees. I feel they need to listen more and make you feel like you were heard and what you said was important.
good,"acting as an Assistant manager at kroger there was never a typical day.I had typical work duties such as inventory,cleaning,stock,ordering,paper work,training.The most enjoyable part of this job I would say were my co-workers and customers."
good,"on a typical day at work, I would clock in and go to my register where I would assist customers during their check-out. I rang up the items and bagged them properly. Along side being a cashier, sometimes I helped restock items and assist customers on finding items"
good,"Great co workers, great manager now, fast paced and you must keep your time low on check out, you get a raise after your 90 day probation, good enough pay for someone in school but not if your trying to support a family."
good,"Since I have been working for Kroger, it is been okay and I wish I was paid more because I believe I want to be paid for what I worth. I have 10 years experience in Customer Service and willing to learn to advance myself within the company. The managers I work for are okay but few of them need to learn to be sympathetic and learn to listen to customers' or employees' concerns, issues, and suggestions in order solve them. I want to be in a positive and upbeat environment without the drama and BS. Overall, Kroger is a great place to work because I loved to be around people, socialize with people, and help people with their daily needs and concerns. I even love to keep my customers smiling and making sure their day is grand."
good,"Courteous Clerk"
good,I really enjoyed working for Kroger. It was a great company with great benefits. The work environment was fun and fast paced and the customers were nice.
good,"Retail is hard work and you are always in demand to give good customer service."
good,"While I worked for the company, I shared my station with six others, including my manager, whom all worked very smoothly together and made people feel appreciated and gave them what they where looking for."
good,"I worked overnight, so there is something different when you have that kind of shift. You miss a lot during daylight hours. The overall job was good and I enjoyed it."
good,"Over saw the day to day operations, worked with my management team, worked with my associates, reviewed OT, wages, communicated with department heads, dealt with urgent issues, worked with my store to have a positive foot print within the community and Customer Service."
good,Kroger was a great first job to start working at for future customer service roles. It taught you maturity in the work place and how to handle customers upfront.
good,The only problem I have is I don’t get 40hrs a week. On my days off it’s hard to plan anything just Incase they call me in to cover a shift. I love the employees they are very nice people.
good,"I started my day at 3:00 a.m. I ended my day at 11:00 a.m. or 12:00 p.m. This gave me the full day to care for private tasks, and be there to supervise my young teens after school. I loved coming into work when the store was closed so I could get into my ""zone"". "
good,"From going to a warehouse to this job, it was much easier and a lot more laid back, as a night stocker I only worked with a handful of people (on a busy night it was 10). It is very enjoyable."
good,I really enjoyed working for Fred Meyer Jewelers in the Kroger company. I loved being the manager and taking giving the best Customer Service. I will miss it greatly!
good,"Kroger is a great family oriented place to work, or at least the one i worked at is. Everyone works as a team and has a great time working.  Management could use a little work, but overall great experience."
good,"Kroger is a great place to work in my opinion, everyone there is friendly to each other and the job isn't even hard, although the Kroger that i work at is one of the busiest Kroger's in middle Georgia"
good,I think this is a nice and calm place to work its not fast pace you can work without people watching you like a hawk . the customers are nice and so are the managers
good,"Typical Day: Clock in and become the best customer service rep you can be! Help keep the pharmacy stocked and the customers happy."
good,It is a good place to make money. You can work the hours you want after you do the% required by them. work is strong but everything is mental .. the only bad thing that is not there for accidents. but good work and good companions who help you
good,"Great career, but not much work life balance. Shifts vary weekly, must work all holidays, and weekends. Pay is good, and lots of opportunity for growth."
good,": A typical day at work generally starts off meeting with our manager for assigned task and duties. Our associates meet back up with our managers for an status update after our break or lunch until its time to close out."
good,"Everyday was great.  The other employees were very friendly and I was able to create relations with them quickly.  The work was simple and I enjoyed coming to work everyday.  Management always looked at me as a great worker.  There were no hard parts to the job, everything I did there was fair."
good,"Work can be fun because you have the option to undergo department changes if they need, changing up what becomes repetitive to something a little different for chances to learn more about different stores areas of interest. Benefits are great, pay is not, work isn't fast paced on a regular basis but some days are, the management seems to have a solid head on their shoulders, they are fun loving,silly, goofy and inspire confidence, good work flow, collaboration, and advancement in the work place."
good,"I loved working at Kroger in college. I was a pharmacy tech for 1 and 1/2 years and an intern for about one month. The pay was kind of low, but I was only there for the experience. The pharmacy was always adequately staffed, I always got a lunch, and the working environment was not very stressful. Sure, there was some days that were miserable but that happens in retail pharmacy. I left because I had to relocate for pharmacy school. I wish I could have stayed hired on with them. Overall, great company and job."
good,"As long as you did your job and did it well, you were fine.  The problem was having to pick up lazy peoples’ slack.  I enjoyed working at Kroger in Avon.  I always felt appreciated by management."

The managment was so great and as long as i did my job and worked hard they were always flexible were they could be with my ideas and request. The hardest part my my job was balancing work and personal life. the job as a whole was enjoyable to me.

good,Great vertically integrated organization and fun people to work with. Very good corporate support with clear facility objectives and team work. Kroger invested in the long term rather than driving out costs with short term results and jeopardizing long term stability.
good,"A typical day at work consists of preparing customers' online orders ,ensuring that all groceries are correct, making price adjustments, delegating targets to team members  , answering phones , and filing paper work .Although this is a very fast pace position, all  orders must be prepared by specific time frame in order to fulfill customers satisfaction."
good,"be at the store bright and early getting food ready for the deli, make signs and assist customers."
good,"The management didn't make sure there were enough people in the store which caused a lot of chaos for the lower ranked workers. There was a lack of communication amongst management and department managers. However, management never treated you as if you were below them and would even work along side you if need be. There were always opportunities to advance if desired. They work with you on your hours and give you the days you need off. "
good,I learned how to properly bag food. I learned how to lift heavy things. I learned how to move fast and where each item should go in the cart based on breakable it not.
good,"Since I worked at night stocking shelves, the atmosphere was pretty slow. There wasn't a lot of people in the store around my shift time so I was able to fly threw my work, which was mostly shelving back stock, and placing new products and items on shelves."

good,Fun place to work at. the different departments leaves countless opportunities for those that want to work there and maybe even move up in the company
good,Always greeting customers and helping to locate products for them. Always talked to the store Manager to inform him of any front end issues. kept the door alarm monitored and enty clean.
good,A typical day at work involved re-stocking apparel on shelves or racks and assisting customers. The hardest part of the job was standing on my feet for 8 hours.  The most enjoyable part of the job was finding what a customer wanted and seeing them leave satisfied.
good,"Worked at times as a cashier, partially as a customer service clerk, then back in the accounting office working with all the cash, lottery tickets, etc.  "
good,A very fun place to work. Every day was different. I enjoyed being able to work at my own pace. I learned a lot. I came across several different windows 7 errors that I hadn't experienced before.
good,I have worked in about three different positions and shifts and this company and all of them are great. This is a wonderful environment and I would be happy to work for their store again.
good,"At kroger, you typically go straight to work. When you are not cashiering you are waiting outside your lane to greet customers and show you are available. I definitely am grateful for the skills I learned in handling money and problem-solving. The management is good as long as you are respectful. I would say the hardest part of the job is when it is slow. I think the most enjoyable part of the jib is interacting with customers. You are allowed to talk with your co-workers as long as you never have your conversation distract you from customers and their needs."
good,"One of the better places I've worked, everyone's really nice and helpful and are all about helping you move toward and succeed you won't get that from alot of jobs."
good,"is usually doing cashier or bagging .... "

good,Kroger in greenfield is a good place to work.  I really regretted having to leave.  Easy advancement.  Hardest part of the job was standing for 8 hours
good,"It was a great first job, hours are manageable i learned very important life skills there, coworkers were very helpful and nice. The management was more than wiling to work with you and help. The hardest part was where when there was a lot of customers or we were low on carts."
good,"Kroger workers was a family also, they were outgoing and respectful to one another. The energy they would bring to the table is what I would recommend to run a Grocery store."
good,I enjoyed workin with all my employees always had a great time some days were harder than others but always got through them... working in customer service was my favorite place!!
good,"a typical day at work would be providing great customer service, taking and preparing orders for customers. I learned to work under pressure and management was understanding. The culture was fun and enjoyable with friendly co workers and customers. The hardest part of the job was not being able to provide satisfaction for customers when we were out of certain products they wanted. The most enjoyable part of the job was feeling good about yourself when you did the right thing for the customers."
good,"I really liked working for Kroger Company, Management promised me full time and never got it. I would like to work for them again, just having a hard time getting in. I guess it just depends on the store it's self. I've been a long time customer for over 25 years."

good,Very organized and structured place of business with great perks and benefits. Great employees.Great management. Great place to shop with great prices and great deals.
good,While working at Kroger I learned a lot of different things I never knew or had experienced before. I enjoyed my experience being a part of the team I wouldn't trade it.
good,I loved working here and I am sad that I had to leave since we needed to move. The company was fair and the co workers were kind. The work pace was fast and you were never bored.
good,I learned great customer service skills & how to make sure I am always providing excellent customer service. Co workers were excellent & I enjoyed working there.
good,"I love working here, the insurance and benefits are great. We had a good amount of management come and go frequently. Job security was always decent and seniority helped to my advantage. The only disadvantage is that pay raises are only .5 every 6 months. The people I worked with were always nice and cared about other employees.  I also receive bonus checks which is a great perk."
good,"As a courtesy clerk for Kroger you greet customers, bag groceries, and reload carts in the lobby. The work environment is friendly, fast-paced, and organized. The hardest part of the job is bringing in a large load of carts and getting carts in the rain or sometimes even the snow. The most enjoyable part would be the friendly coworkers/management."
good,I love working for Kroger and recamand it as a good first job for teens and high school students and a good place to work while in college if your a people person
good,"I loved my time at Pick n Save, work was always enjoyable and the environment along with my fellow employees was always amazing. Management was awesome and always willing to help employees with any problems they would face or with any questions they would have. I would easily recommend this job to anyone!"
good,I loved working at Krogers. I wish the one I worked at didn't have to close. Everyone worked well together and earned pretty decent hours. I believe this is a good first job especially if you are I'm school or have another job.
good,I learned so much from this job i even learned how to order an became the supervisor... I learned how to bake cookies and bread i made donuts i even cooked from time to time to be honest i learned everything i could in the Deli and Bakery all the way down to cakes
good,"The hardest part of the job that I was assigned to was the customers. They also were the best part of the job. You always had your regular customers who know you by name and ask how you are doing and also make you laugh. On the other hand some of the customers were very rude and only thought what we did was ""put pills in a bottle"". However, it was still a great place to learn new things and also work with amazing people that you could actually call friends."
good,"schedules are not flexible, work in crowded work space. lack of communication between management and team members. work hours are not standard week to week"
good,"very nice place, up and down on hours, management is nice vcanbe very shady. love the atmosphere, very clean nice, customers friendly do what you need to do"

good,"At work I greet patients, give them medicine, deal with insurance claim handling, fill prescriptions, handle patient and doctors phone calls and refer them to the pharmacist if needed. After learning everyday tasks the job became very easy over time. In the beginning it was hard to handle insurance related issues."
good,"while working as a Starbuck's barista or Kroger deli clerk you will be expected to work with a team and also by yourself. Make sure you are able to multitask and follow through completely on any assigned task. The managers at Kroger are caring and responsive to your questions and concerns. while working there I never encountered a vindictive or cruel supervisor. Customer service and completing all the assigned workload is sometimes very difficult. the hardest part of Starbucks was to be by yourself for a whole shift with a line of at least thirty people all wanting their drinks in a timely manner. you had to make all the drinks, do dishes, and replenish stock by yourself. In the deli, at Kroger, the hardest part was balancing multitasking, customer service, and completing all your assigned chores on time as well as well restock your stations and sanitize and clean everything."
good,Nice place to work but the pay is very pow unless you get promoted. Getting promoted takes a long time. They also do not like giving people full time.

good,"very productive work place with wonderful hard working people, its a place you can also meet new people and advance in. I feel pizza hut has great management."
good,"Fred Meyer is a wonderful company to work for.  Training, advancement, benefits are all good.  As part of Kroger, it leaves something to be desired.  Management is more concerned with the dollar than the customer."
good,"Great place to get foot in the door and learn valuable skills for management positions. The biggest opportunity at Kroger would be work life balance. If you're into retail hours, Kroger is the best place for you!"
good,The people I worked with were very uplifting and fun. Nothing was hard about the job at all. I learned how to deal with different attitudes and how to be a leader. The management was good but could have been way better.
good,The short time I was there they were a family oriented company and the manager knew who I was by first name and always spoke. The fellow associates were friendly and welcoming as well.
good,"Kroger is a company i would'nt mind working for, they treat the workers with respect and all they hours you need they will provide, YAY GOOO KROGER!!!!"
good,It's a good place to start as a first job. Yeah pay could be better. But as long as you have a great team things can get done in a productive manner. Its also a good experience to put on your resume.
good,It was a great initial job experience is a diverse work force in a vast supermarket with varying diverse production of department goods combined into one company providing excellent standards in all aspects of management and consumerism.Extremely sanitized and safe/friendly product sales of brand named and imported items with a superior standard in quality and freshness.
good,"Kroger clicklist is a high fast paced department where you have to be able to select multiple orders at once and have the order ready in time. At times you are in close quarters with your associates and can be stressful on the busiest days. However, the best part of the job is seeing the customer is fully satisfied with their order and how fast they receive their order. It is our job to have their order out to them at curb-side six minutes or less. The hardest part of the job is finding substitutions for items the customer ordered. As selectors we are not sure of what allergies the consumer may have, tastes, nor if they like off brand items."
good,"At Fred Meyers I was pushed too use my excellent customer service qualities every day. Being a Front-End Cashier, it was important that the customer was satisfied when finished shopping at my store. Sometimes problems would persist such as a customer not finding the product they were looking for, but all employees were empowered to make sure they got a good substitute or discount. Its a great company too work for, heck I did for three years!"
good,This job required alot as a micro manager.  I was in charge of giving breaks to employees and changing out cash give change and placing money in safe at the end of every shift ... I was also in charge of firing or writing one uo for the behavior in which was not suitable for the job in which they had.
good,I had a great experience working at Kroger. I learned how to scan people grocery items at a faster pace which was one of the best things that I enjoyed about my job. The hardest part was learning the codes to key in for different items when they don't ring up. The workplace was very nice and well manner. The managers were also professional and hard working people.
good,The biggest part about Kroger Deli is there is a lot of customers. It is pretty easy if you have another person to help with slicing but if its just you it can get lonely and stressful if its busy. It's also good when it comes to closing.
good,The environment was great. Fellow co workers were nice. Everyone helped each other. Management was pretty good. Good part time job for students who are in school or looking to just make some money for yourself.
good,I worked there when I was in High school. It taught me a lot about time management. Organization. Fast paced. The work place culture was fun and enjoyable.

good,This was my first job I worked here for seven years. The supervisors worked with you hands on and provided you quickly with feedback on good job and work that needs improvement. I learned many skills here that I have applied throughout my law school career.
good,I enjoy working for the design team at corporate Kroger print hub in Denver. There are a lot of great people working together for a common goal. The pay and benefits are good and the office is comfortable.
good,"I was in charge of setting breaks and lunches for the whole front end, also helped in their fuel center. I helped cashiers with any problems during checkout. Managers could of been more hands on, but it was a great work environment. The hardest part of my job was watching other employees working very hard but never getting recognized but the store managers. The best part was when I could show baggers and cashier's faster was to get customers through the line and still engaging with the customers. Paying a compliment when an employee does a great job goes a long way, they also worked better because they felt good about themselves and their job."
good,Its nice cause people are cool. short breaks suck tho. but overall cool place.good food. good enviorment. you work 5 hour shidts. 15 min breaks. I learned how to keep a positive attitude.
good,"A typical day at work includes bagging groceries and interacting with many customers. Majority of the customers were the nicest people who would shop at Kroger often. Working here I learned that you can make someone day just by being kind. There were many times I would make someones day just by being nice to them and showing them that they are welcomed at Kroger. The management was awesome, they all worked with my school schedule being that there was so much going on in school. I did a great job balancing everything that was going on around me. The workplace culture was very diverse. There were all type of people and the managers and employees were different. The hardest part of the job is getting the carts from outside. The carts were heavy for myself and the weather would change often. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the elderly people out to their cars. These people were the most kind. My favorite part about helping them out to their cars are the smiles I see on their faces when I am done. That is what made my day."
good,"I love my co-workers. It's a small store, so everybody knows everybody, including the customers. You'll meet a lot of interesting characters, but I wouldn't trade my experience here for anything. I've learned a lot more lessons in customer care here, than I think I would in a bigger city or store. However, it definitely has its challenges, just like any job, so be prepared to dig in your heels!"
good,"Kroger was my first job. They are very flexible with your schedule and the more seniority you gain the more you will get to choose your schedule. Management is super fun and nice, they know when to be serious and when to be playful and they are always encouraging employees to be the best they can be. They are understanding and take action if you have an interest in moving up with the company. For your first month, another employee will train you on everything you need to know and after that they will help and assist you with any questions. Everyone there soon becomes a family and it made it very hard for me to leave this job when I moved or else I would've still been with Kroger. You gain experience in customer service and make good relationships with loyal customers. The focus of this job is to acknowledge, assist and appreciate and the tasks are simple to pick up. I recommend this job to anyone who has never had a job, is elderly looking for a job after retirement or just wants a steady side job."
good,"I worked out of a kiosk in Kroger stores and it was a really enjoyable position. I was an amenity for the guests and I constantly felt appreciated. We definitely had to make ourselves known at first, but after a while we were really popular and the job became very fast paced and exciting. Definitely stressful but the people around you are there to build you up (:"

good,"I love the Kroger Co. It is a great place to work, with endless options and great customs. I learned how to advance within the company, and how to carry myself in a prideful manner. Management is always great, with people oriented concern, and genuine love for the company. My coworkers have always been great, and all people, coworkers and customers alike, were always the best part of the job. I was challenged in many aspects to think outside the box, and problem solve for the customer's best interest."
good,"The Kroger Company has a great benefits package. It offers health care, and vision insurance. Its a great company to work for as long as the store manager and managers treat all their employees the same"

good,"Kroger has been a great company to work. I've worked in a very busy store.We do about 1500-2000 prescription per day. My typical day at work would be to do everything in the pharmacy that an intern is supposed to do, like data entry, taking calls from doctor's office, insurance companies, patients call and so on. Also help patient with any issues with their insurance issues.I did lot of register pick up, where i got opportunity to counsel patient on their medications and answer their questions, if they had any. Immunizing patient has been a big goal at Kroger. In flu season there would be days where we give 30-40 shots a day. MTM and CMR has been a big focus and have actively participated in it."
good,"decorating cakes and doing cake orders for customers and baking pies, cookies and putting product on the floor for customers to buy"
good,"The hardest part of my job is to make everyone happy"

good,This company has a easy environment to adapt to. Kroger is great for skill development among both young and old. There is also very excellent management and coworker relationship.
good,"A typical day at work is fun but a lot of work. I've learned that, even while having fun, you've got to get work done as well. Management is awesome there. They make sure work is being done. My co-workers are amazing. We're one big family there. The hardest part of my job is pushing carts back into the store, because you've got to try and get as many in as you can for costumers to have carts as they come in. The most enjoyable part of my job is bagging costumers groceries, because you meet new people and get to have conversations with them."
good,"Very efficient in dividing tasks between all the workers. I enjoy interaction with customers and pack groceries based on what they need me to do. If I am handling a large order I offer to help them outside to their cars and unload their groceries for them. I have learned to be patient and listen to the customer, paying attention to their needs. The management makes sure everyone has something to do and that everyone stays on task. The people I work with are very professional and a joy to work beside.

good,productive and fun place to work. But like most work places they have their pros and cons. I have stuck around the company because of the great benefits and the associates.
good,"It was so much fun learning a new trade in decorating and baking. I have an interest in creating beautiful cakes for customers and I practice how to do this with the supervision of the decorator. I preformed well enough I was sent to classes at other locations to advance my skills. I think the hardest part was closing your area when you still have customers coming in, normally this is close to rush hour time and not being having enough co-workers until shift change."
good,"While working at Kroger, I was placed in the floral department. It was a very fun place to work. I got to experience preparing for weddings and baby showers. I learned how to make many different pieces of floral art, from arrangements to bouquets. My manager was very friendly and my co-workers were always easy to get along with. Learning how to make arrangements to a customer's satisfaction was the hardest, but also the most enjoyable part of the job."

good,"At Kroger, we would help out customers and made sure they had the best experience possible in finding the items they needed and had a fast and very friendly check out. I learned that to have a good job, you have to put the customers first and help them in any way possible and do it with pleasure. The management and co-workers were great because we all knew how to get along while still keeping the relationship professional. However, the hardest part of my job was not always getting a good amount of hours per week and he most enjoyable part was getting to know the customers and having them trust us in what we were selling them."
good,Working for Kroger was great. The supervisors were great. They want people who will be able to work all hours. The insurance is good. You will be able to advance.

good,"Fred Meyer Jewelers is all about customer interaction and building relationships. Being located at the Kroger Marketplaces gives employees the chance to see our customers weekly. I have worked in multiple locations and at each one, employees are welcoming and helpful. The company makes a great effort to educate and trains its employees to make them the best salesperson they can be. Being part of the Kroger Company, you have access to great health benefits. The hours are very reasonable for a retail schedule."
good,A typiccal day of work was very busy it was a supermarket. I learned how to manage the front in and service desk while driving team work through other employess. My co-workers were very friendly and fun but sometimes we bump headeds when orders were giving. The hardest part was givivng bad employee upddates to upper management. Working together as a team and helping people.
good,"With this company, I have learn to pull 48 ft stepdeck and rgn."

good,"Co workers and managers are very helpful and very supportive for someone like me who is first time to live here in the US.  They are very patient in training me on what i need to know. Overall, i have a positive experience and a lot of learnings which makes me even more persistent to learn more"
good,"Co-workers will help out with any situation you may have. Upper management will try to work around your schedule when needed. I loved working for Kroger, because of the customers that would come in. They would always try to come through my line. I would remember all the regulars and talk to them every chance i got. I tried to make the experience at the check out line more enjoyable than just buying groceries."
good,Kroger treats all employees with respect. I enjoy working with the Pharmacist that is very knowledgeable and competent. No complaints with upper management or co-workers.

good,I was given many opportunities for advancement. Benefits were great
good,"Running shifts "
good,"I have worked here for five years throughout many of the Ralphs stores in southern california.  Whenever I worked there I would stock shelves push shopping carts bag groceries and sweep the floor.  When a a year ago after being promoted to the Deli I had learned to fry chicken and prepare sandwhiches, salads and fruit platters. Throughout my years with the company I've had great managers got along with my co workers, it is an overall great place to work.  However, when I had been employed with Ralphs  I had tried to advance within the company.  Doing so, I've encountered managers who would tell I would be ""Director of The Store"".  ""Manager"" .  and even tell me that ""I am going to run the store""  So there had been a lot of empty promises for myself and many other hardworkers througout the company.  The job is actually a bit easier to work at than my current one but doesn't pay as much as it should.  Everything about the job was enjoyable though, from slicing meat, preparing food even helping out at the meat department once in a while."
good,This job is a great one the hours are perfect for a person with a family and the pay is good. everyone comes together when it gets tough in there and it all works.

good,"Loved working with my co workers they were very nice and respectable, fun and caring always willing to help and/or get the job done."
good,"Fred Meyers is a family orientated work place and there is opportunity to advance with job positions and wages. This is a company that a person can retire from. I learned with them the importance of customer service and doing your best to satisfy the customer. Management has a job to do and they are good at jumping in and helping when needed and also at mentoring employees. My most difficult part of my time at Fred Meyers was learning their hand help system. With so many employees at Fred Meyers you are always meeting  some one new. The employee lounge is nice in the fact of having a tv, tables to gather around lockers to use and a place to socialize on breaks."
good,"A work day consists of me cashiering customers in a timely manner. I have learned that the elderly are lonely and some come shopping just for a conversation or a friendly smile. "
good,"Excellent place to work."
good,Balanced the registers daily and managed the staffs with breaks and lunches. Also worked customer service and floor support
good,"As you can see from my resume, I was previously in the grocery business for many years.  I started a a sacker/packer, and went on to various positions.  I enjoyed the aspect of the job and helping customers and the management."
good,"Stocking, scheduling, customer service overall great place to work"
good,associates were very nice when I was asking any question on where a certain item was.
good,When coming into work of course we had kids steeling out of the store. I had to patrol the parking lot because there were reports of burglary. After every activity that occurred I had to do an activity report summarizing what had happened.
good,"I loved this job, one of the best companies to work for. Everyone there made you feel like you were important."
good,"A typical day for Kwik Shop is interacting with the customers all day and making sure that everything is kept stocked and your customers can come in get what they need and be out of the store within 5-10 minutes. Everyday you can learn something new if a problem arises. I'm part of the management team so I try my best to interact with all co-workers and make sure that everything is running smoothly. The hardest part of the job is probably remembering to stay patient with an impatient customer, but I haven't ever really found it that difficult. The most enjoyable part of my job is recurring customers, because that means that we are doing something right to keep them coming back to our store."
good,"Cooking"
good,"My typical day at work was as simple as the description. Everybody that worked there was like a cheerful family that made you smile with a simple joke or gesture. The managers were all professional and good people to talk to in terms of job related issues rather it be for the good or bad. The most enjoyable part of my job, honestly, was seeing and assisting the elderly and making them feel welcomed and important."
good,"Handled day to day replenishment for Produce, Bakery, Deli, Fresh Meat, Processed Meat, and Grocery."
good,Really like the small area I worked at. The manager was really nice and friendly. only thing is if you are part-time you don't qualify for insurance.
good,"Great company to work for, great benefits and opportunities for advancement within the company"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me waiting on customers in the deli department as a deli clerk. I would operate  slicers, fryers, ovens, and a rotisserie. At any given time during my shift I could be waiting on customers by slicing their meats and cheeses, packaging up a rotisserie chicken, frying them chicken, or serving them food from our hot table, sanitizing the slicers or taking and logging the food temperatures as per the Health Department. At the end of the day, I would clean the equipment such as the rotisserie and slicers. I would filter, clean, and if necessary I would change the oil in the fryers. I would clean the department by sweeping and mopping the floors and doing the dishes from our hot table."
good,I enjoyed my position with Kroger due to the awesome people that I would meet as they would be leaving the store! I really enjoyed being able to make all of my customers leave with a smile on their faces!
good,"I have been there for 4 years. Very productive. I work at a first of the month store meaning we are a very busy store beginning and end of the month. Benefits for part timers are just as great for full timers, besides healthcare and dental. Job security is great because we are in a union. Management are fun and friendly people and you build a great relationship with them. I don't really think there is a hard part to the job. Co-workers are all pretty great we all get along for the most part. Enjoyable part of the job is that we get to interact with the customers on a personal level especially because we are face to face."
good,"The company was great, and the co workers were great. Loved all of my customers and my managers were very laid back, very friendly. The typical day at kroger was just getting customers in and out of the store in a timely manner. what i did learn was how to balance school and work, and that i was also always on call to go to work, because we were a very big store and a lot of people would go during rush hour. I really did enjoy my job, and the people there, it was like a big family."
good,"A typical day at Pick N' Save was always busy. I would produce specific items and price them to be sold in the store. I created vegetables trays, fruit cups, custom personal salads, watermelon qauters, etc. This job also required knowledge of knife handling skills, and presentation was key. I produced the salad bar daily, making special dips, salsa's, and desserts as well as 20 other condiments."
good,"A typical day of work at Kroger involves assisting customers through helping them find items in the store, making sure they are quickly checking out, and answering any general questions they may have.  I must also continually make sure the store looks clean and presentable along with making sure my co-workers get their breaks and lunches on time when I am the front end supervisor.  "
good,Was hired through temporary job service company. Amazingly they kept  me as long they did. Learned  a lot about how HONDA made their crankshafts for their cars. Had A forklift license which was pretty cool.
good,Learning every aspect of all the jobs is a must incase someone doesn't show for work you can fill in.  I liked working there and meeting all the faces that came through.  I did have a good variety of work to do so didn't get bored.
good,Its a great company and always room for advancement but just the pay needs to be more.
good,"Always a fun place to be, and getting to talk with the customers, and helping with their needs."

We even spent time outside of the work environment for some recreational activities; like bowling and softball."
good,"My experience at Kroger was very rewarding. I learned a great deal about professionalism and leadership during my time here. I worked with and for a team of amazing individuals who were dedicated to our company's mission and value statement, stakeholders, customers, and employees."
good,Working at Kroger pharmacy was a fast paced job with lots of multi-tasking!
good,Working at Kroger was a win win you could go to work upset and everybody would just make u smile soon as they see you it was very fun working there I enjoyed seeing and working and spending time with everyone. I learned in my few months working there no matter what you are doing always do your best even if you don't finish u have to strive and work hard and do as much work as u can possible. As far as management the managers kept the store running nice if they asked me to do something I did it they were very good people they walked the store making sure everything was in order they also helped customers them selves they didn't treat us no different then them .As for my coworkers everybody was nice everybody knew each other they were all hard workers like I said you couldn't not walk in that store upset and not smile because they will make u smile. The job really wasn't hard at all just sometimes we had huge truck loads for the dairy section and I had to keep a steady pace but other then that it was easy. The most enjoyable part of the job was just waking up and going to work to see all of my coworkers we were all like family.
good,"Very energetic workplace. learned how to manage money , and merchandise."
good,"A typical day was hard work ,fast pace, and pretty fun.Management is pretty cool if you get to know them co workers were nice.Hardest part of the job is working in the freezer.The best part is payday."
good,a typical day at work would be working in the office accepting bill payment and making returns etc.
good,The location and the are hours are fine. I don't like the way that  management (over-night supervisor) treated their co-workers.
good,"Kroger's has taught me a lot of things. I remembered like it was yesterday when i first started and didn't know what i was suppose to be doing, and one of the manager's got me situated; i knew from there what to do. Kroger's has great customer service and very reliable employees. I get better and better at What i do. The hardest part of my job is when they have to send you on the parking lot to get baskets rain, sleet, or snow. The most enjoyable part of the job is i get to see and converse with a lot of people."
good,"A great place to work! flexible with hours, respectful to all races, religions. Great people!"
good,"Depending on location it could be a hectic or slow day at work. Most of the associates are nice and helpful while some aren't and are rude, this is true to anywhere you go to so it isn't much different. Hardest part of the job is keeping cool and not getting stressed out, again this you come across any job. Most enjoyable part is when you know you outdid yourself and pulled through and achieved greatness. You learn a lot from everyone that helps you, coworkers and management are there to help so don't hesitate to ask. The pay is kind of lacking for the job but as I said every place is different. Management also depends on how crazy it is and how they are personally, this you'll find out as you work with them. Your enjoyment in employment is based off of what you push yourself to be so overall, it's a great place to start."
good,Fast paced and always on your toes but have the privilege to work with great people and help customers.
good,loved working with them great people! and i did what ever thay wanted me to do i was a great worker. made good friends to working there
good,customers were great and assisting them with their purchases was always fun. i stocked and cleaned as well as cashiering and making coffee and food for the customers.
good,"As a deli clerk was a tough but fun job. I seemed to be working with the most interesting people there. they were really easy to get along with and liked to help out. I would say the hardest part of the job was when there was a shortage of a certain kind of meat because of a fire in their factory, this caused people to sometimes become irate, i would try my best to console the irate customers and usually i did a very good job at this."
good,had me as a store clerk that involved being somewhere different everyday and really enjoyed all my co-workers

good,"I worked for Kroger for several years as a means to pay my way through college. I cannot speak for every store but my store in particular was given a fantastic staff of mangers (most of whom went on to higher positions before I left) and was kept in good running condition. I was trained in numerous areas, stocking dairy and grocery, bagging and carts, cashiering, help desk and even a little accounting. "
good,Kroger Pharmacy was an excellent job and a great experience.  It was a very productive work environment. A typical work day was handling customers prescriptions.

good,"A typical day in the pharmacy would consist of receiving, data entering and filling prescriptions.  I learned all I know of pharmacy from the pharmacists here.  Management is wonderful and I loved my co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was not having sufficient hours assigned to adequately cover all shifts. I most enjoyed the friendly customers and co-workers at our store."
good,"I go to work with my polo shirt and lift the boxes assigned to me for the day. Part of the job was to lift the boxes and place them on carts of which we brought across the produce floors. We would then open up the boxes and place the fruits or vegetables in the designated aisles. The oldest fruits and vegetables were placed in the front so they would be sold before the newer produce."

I manage 7 other employees and I also make there schedule a long with mine. I stock the inside of the kiosk center and I also order supplies-(oil, transmission fluid etc.) The hardest part of the job is making sure I don't make a mistake and to be the best Lead/Manager I can be. I love my job because I get to interact with a lot of different people. Sometimes people aren't feeling good but just speaking to someone brightens there day. I see it everyday when I tell people to have a nice day."

good,"Using a headset and an electric pallet jack, you build a store's pallet by going through aisles and picking specific pieces to fill the order, shrink wrap the pallet and bring it to a staging area. This job is very tedious. Every box must be placed with care, due to you building a 7 foot tall pallet and riding around with it. I enjoyed the freedom you get. And the attention to small detail."

good,Fun place to work at. You work with a ton of great people and everyone there is nice. I really liked working here and enjoyed the benefits they provided.

good,"A typical day at kroger is busy yet satisfying, more than that its a great learning opportunity to understand and identify ways of business behavior as well as dealing with everyday customers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the difficult people that walk in every day, you always have to know what to say and how to say it so that you dont offend or disrespect people in any way. The most enjoyable part I would have to say is being able to make a customers day with just a smile or just as simple asking them how they are and if the service they've acquired was efficient and helpful"
good,i always did what my scheduled work day was. mostly jus at the register checking customers out.

good,"At kroger it was always something different. Greeting a customer with a friendly smile, or just providing great customer service skills was a typical day at work. Either the customer would greet back with the same action or sometimes they can be not such a happy customer. I didn't let that effect my day or work. I had fun helping people and just providing excellent customer service skills."
good,Love the work the place. Very active on the job and plenty things to do. Customers are always interesting to talk to. Co-Workers are enjoyable to work with.
good,Stay busy a lot of work to do. you are never just standing around.
good,"A typical day at work consists of greeting customers that enter the store helping them find products and engaging in cash, debit/credit and check transactions. I learned that in order to succeed in retail you have to have a positive attitude and remember that customers come first. Mangers such as front end and General managers are very helpful and work with all your needs. I would have to say the hardest part of the job would have be keeping your cool even with the most rude and disrespectful customers. And the most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers they help and support anything that is difficult with the job."

good,"My day starts with pulling 20-30 whole chickens out of the roaster. I bag and tag them in a timely manner. Then I have to set up 30-35 whole birds and put them in the roaster. Next I move on to taking out the dinner from the oven, and then I put food in pans. I set them in the hot case. I get baked chicken ready and put it in the oven and fry 48 pieces of chicken. After all that 2 hours have probally gone by, and then it is time for a break. When I come back, I have whole birds coming out again, along with baked and fried chicken. The people i would with are really fun. The most enjoyable part is when the manager is working and she helps in the back."

The management was awesome the entire three years I worked there. The coworkers are friendly and inclusive and I felt a real family vibe during my time there. I wouldn't take up any management positions as they put a lot of somewhat unfair pressure on their managers. Being an employee for Kroger is great and worth your time to pursue."

good,"Hours are great , management is awesome , a really nice work environment , you would really have a fun time working for Kroger , they will work around your schedule"
good,Had days when you had to clean or bag or push carts. Very simple the management was on point really and I liked banging out of everything. And that’s pretty much it.
good,"A typical day included serving customers & maintaining the work environment. I learned a reasonable amount of skills by working in most the different departments. Everything from social skills to cooking and cleaning. Even almost like office skills; answering phones and placing orders & using various tech. The store management for the first several years i was there was excellent! The store manager had worked their his entire career; from the bottom all the way to the top. He was beyond friend, helpful & empathetic. The department management was very good as well. She mirrored a lot of his quality's. After the store manager left they were in constant turn around of store managers which was problematic for the store. The workplace culture was very friendly and enjoyable until they switched management. The hardest part of the job was working with mostly elderly coworkers. The most enjoyable part of the job was its simplicity."

good,I highly suggest working for Kroger especially if you’re currently in school studying in business the company offers tuition reimbursement. The company also offers flexible work hours
good,However certain locations are very overwhelming due to the customer always right policy. Our store is under staffed in the front end. Customer service works the hardest. We have to do many jobs at once. ITS BERY STRESSFUL!
good,"It is good for side money or part time work. The pay is not the best, but you are not being asked to perform the duties of a rocket scientist either. You are paid what you should be. The staff was great and the store always nice to shop at."
good,I enjoy working in this retail setting as it lends itself to customer interaction. I have learned a lot since this is my first experience in retail. Everyone has been super helpful while I learn the ropes.
good,"The benefits of the union affliation alone make the job worth while. I loved my coworkers and most of the management staff. My only issue the whole time i worked there was when the GM threatened my job because u has sat down for a minute. I was 6 months pregnant, high risk, and my blood sugar had dropped. He had planned on firing me, the union rep within the store saved mymy job."
good,this place was messed up in all different ways when I worked there but they have gotten a lot better. I miss working here sometimes. it was a great environment with friendly people.

good,I learned alot working at Kroger. How to deal with stressful situations and also how to communicate with others. It was a great job for me to start off with as a 16 year old.
good,"A typical day at work almost always goes smoothly, but like any job, there are issues that arise and have to be dealt with in a professional manner. Working with the Kroger Company since age 15, while working my way up to be a CPhT, taught me just about everything I know about customer service, money management, and time management. "

good,Great people great management. Paid overtime for holidays and Sundays. Paid weekly. I really enjoyed working for Kroger. I was a barista for the Starbucks.
good,Great place to receive managerial skills. You can advance up pretty fast . They will work with your schedule if your attending school. Benefits are good. Hourly pay sucks
good,"I like working at Kroger's as a full-time Produce clerk my 16 years have been good overall. Yes, there was a lot of tough times at the Atlanta store in which I occupies but we was able to see things thru. Management is okay, but they seem to change yearly at the store I'm at due to excessive overtime, high theft, and inventory coming back bad. The best thing about the job is helping customers find their items and putting a smile on their faces."
good,"A typical work day for me consist of helping customers on deli case such as slicing lunch meat, fulfilling party tray orders or helping out in our bistro as cashier."
good,Krogers is a very great place to work at.  If you invest years to work at krogers they have great benefits and etc to offer you. I worked around great employees and management. Recommended!!
good,The hours and pay were decent. Retail healthcare is just not the area I prefer to work in. Too much pressure every time you open the door to see the next patient when you have likely not yet had the opportunity to complete the previous patient’s visit. I also did not like all the antibiotics patients demanded.
good,"Management was fairly consistent and not condescending, directives from the top were carried out in a timely manner, hours were flexible, the majority of co workers across the store were helpful and friendly"
good,"Learned much here, fun and helpful crew. Truly a great work experience to begin with.Good management and promotions. Decent Pay, worked with you. 10/10 would recommend."

good,"like to work this kind of environment"
good,"Show up, do your work and you'll have a job for life. Join the union - the job protection and benefits they give are important.  You can have fun at work and if you excel at your position, advancement is possible."
good,i need a job to pay  off my phone before the end of this mouth i have a phone for ten years i like to have fun and hang out with my friends on the week ends.
good,"A typical day consists of me being on time and being organized. As long as you follow through with the task you're given you won't have an issues with management. Sometimes the network can be slow when performing job duties and some programs are a little outdated. I do get stressed some days because my job is demanding at times, but dont let that hinder you. The culture is like any other workplace, we are very diverse and inclusive. The company has great benefits. Depending on certain job assignments the pay needs to be comparable to other job markets and its not."
good,"On a typical day, I was maintaining a regular cash register. This means greeting customers, making sure they found everything okay, answer any questions they may have had, and just ensuring the quality of customer service. I learned that attitude is everything in this profession.Management was good. They worked with me when I was going through my first surgery. The hardest part of the job was standing for the entire shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know my co-workers."
good,"A typical day involved clocking in, getting all of your required equipment, getting an order, and going out and shopping that order as quickly as possible, returning to the back room, placing the different parts of the order in the correct areas (fridge, ambient, freezer), and then repeating the process until you went to lunch, took a break, or went home. you would also need to be prepared to deliver an order to a customer's car if needed."
good,"Fast paced , expect your numbers to improve every week while on your probationary period. "
good,Days were very consistent so you knew what to expect.  Learned a lot about customer service.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers.  Most enjoyable part of the job is that it lends itself to being able to talk with co workers.
good,Kroger is a great place to work. They encourage employees to push themselves to learn new aspects of their jobs.  They provide good benefits and fair wages.
good,"The work was alright but at times it was bad, however  the people there made my experience completely bearable. I couldn't think of a time where one of my co-workers wouldn't be smiling with each other. It was fantastic. I haven't learned all that much because everything was to my expectation, but it did give me experience on how a job functions and what not. The only hard part of the job was doing work I wasn't trained for, it was annoying to say the least but I still managed to succeed on completing my tasks nonetheless. Again the most enjoyable bit of my job were the people, it kinda baffles me that some people can be so happy in a job that doesn't pay to much for work that handles with 'people'. Overall It was great to work with cool people and work in a nice environment."
good,"Greeting customers with a smile"
good,"I worked at Kroger from when I was 15 to when I was 17 and I loved the entire experience. My mom forced me to work there at 15 so I could realize what it means to appreciate money, and even though I didn’t like the idea of getting a job, I absolutely loved this job. I made so many amazing friendships, while also getting the pay I deserved and the hours I wanted. The job made it enjoyable to go to because the employees I worked with made it fun especially during the holidays. I did eventually leave the job due to my lack in schoolwork because of the amount of hours I worked. I recommend Kroger to anyone because it builds character."
good,A typical day at work was fun. What I learned was the manager are very nice and kind to their customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers.

I learned how to get well with others. management show me allot , they where good people. the work place was In a good community. the hardest part of the job was collecting shopping carts. an put them up in the hot and cold weather. the most enjoyable part was meeting people. and gaining long lasting friendships."

good,A typical day working at Kroger involved reviewing customers orders and then grabbing a trolley to put their groceries in. Most days in Clicklist were decently busy and all of my coworkers definitely worked their hardest. I learned that you have to keep a positive attitude even when customers are being rude towards you.
good,The management was good and it kept me busy and work with others. I loved making people laugh and make new friends to work with. I got paid enough. The hard job was trying to locate everything in the store.

good,I have worked at Kroger for 8 months. A typical day as a cashier is I enjoy waiting on customers and have learned to deal with the public. Have no problems with the management. It is a good place to work. I guess the hardest part of the job to me is lifting the heavy containers when checking someone out. The most enjoyable part is I like to meet different people.
good,I love this company. In the change from family owned to corporate it has been difficult but worth the work. There is significant room for advancement if you are willing to go the extra mile.
good,"Working for Kroger was probably one of my best work experiences.  The work environment as a whole was wonderful, and very rewarding . It helped me shape into a hard working employee."
good,"Being with Krogers now over 7 months, I can honestly say. it's a very beneficial place to work. It's stressful at points and you work long hours. the pay is worth it. the longer you work, the more you make."
good,I really like working for Kroger it was not stressful as most places. The management was great the time that I worked there. I just wished at the time that it would have paid better.
good,"If you are willing to work, they will give you as many hours as possible. They are also extremely flexible and it’s easy to move up if you work hard. It’s a great environment and customer service is amazing, our people work so hard to make the customers happy."
good,Unload carts and scan products and coupons and help bag groceries that the customer has purchased. Being on your feet for the entire shift whether it is 4-8 hour shift. you did receive a 15 minute break for working 4-6 hours and a 30 minute break 6.25-8 hour shift.
good,"Great benefits like store discounts and insurance , but the pay is very low and the raises are smaller. I received a nickle raise after one year and excellent reviews"
good,"I loved my job at both locations I worked at. The management was exceptional, as was the training. Certifications were easy to obtain. There was no downside until I was injured at home and was unable to work without taking 2 extra 15minute breaks off my foot (that I had broken). Because of this I was unable to return to work as my job would not allow the additional accommodation which I did not think was too much to ask."
good,I was a longtime resident in the neighborhood.  I had quite a few regulars come thru my lines.  I knew everyone.  It was a great fun job.  I miss the folks I became friends with..
good,Loved working for Kroger. Superiors were great and fellow employees very friendly. Love talking with customers and helping them in a very friendly manner
good,"I loved working at Kroger! I love all my co workers! I also loved my management! We got health insurance for cheap and all paid vacations and a food discount! Having a discount on grocery’s was a big help! I left because of money, just wasn’t getting paid enough and they wouldn’t let any over time. They did give you a raise every 6 months but it was 5 cents. That was kinda dirty. They gave you a lot in  benefits and discounts so I kinda understood about the pay. I do miss my Kroger store, if only I made a couple dollars more an hour"
good,"A good place to work. get holidays, overtime, time off. Good benefits."
good,"great place to work as a High School student, vey fast pace and adventurous interaction with customers always nice, management is great and understanding"

good,"Working at Kroger is a great first time job. Helps you maintain a good speed and boosts your communication skills . Working in a big environment making sure customers get what they needed in the right place , making their visit wonderful."
good,"A typical day at work depends on your departments, but Kroger stores always had all types of people, making the job exciting and fun to be around. Everyone had their own goals for the day, but it was consistent and something to always keep you on your feet. Hardest part of my job is keeping up with demand, but I always got the job done, no matter cold or hot. The management depends on the stores because each store had different managers. But at my old store, the managers were never afraid to help out other departments."
good,Good work place. Friendly managers for the most part. It’s laid back. The pay isn’t all to great. You are part of the union after 60 days. You get a week paid vacation after 1 year.
good,I learned a lot while working for this company. I was able to work on different projects everyday. I learned how to keep keep track of inventory and set automatic ordering when an items balance got low. I also had the opportunity to learn marketing procedures by building displays with new merchandise.I also had great benefits.
good,Kroger was a great job that opened up many possibilities for me. They helped during and after Hurricane Harvey. E-Commerce supervisor was incredibly flexible with any schedule and was very accommodating to everyone. On the busy and stressful days we could always work together as coworkers to enjoy the most out of it while working as hard as possible. I enjoyed the experience I was able to get through Kroger.
good,"A typical day at work is greeting and assisting customers throughout the store helping them find their particular item they're looking for. We also keep store clean, help with bagging groceries, and make sure carts are stacked properly inside for our customers to use."
good,I worked in the pharmacy and I loved it there. Everyone was really friendly and you got to know the people you worked with. Sometimes you would have to deal with rude customers.
good,I started out as a bagger and worked my way up to cashier. I enjoyed my job. My job consited of Greeting and Helping customers and ringing up their orders.
good,"I didn't work at Kroger's long , but while I did they treated me fairly , although I was pregnant at the time . They even told me if my job were to get too difficult I could be a cashier ."
good,Loved my job. Always friendly workers and customers. I enjoyed learning a lot of new things. Always had enough help to meet deadlines. Definitely a great job.
good,"Great place to learn to work in the front end being a Cashier was fun for 8 years. Choose to leave . "
good,This is probably the best company that i've ever worked for. The opportunity for growth was above expected. The president of the company truly cared about the employees. The working conditions were above satisfactory. The chance for advancement was above what was expected.
good,"Great place to work for, love the customers coming ina Nd our the store. Customer service is a great place to work behind just with the helping with customers more and interacting with them as well."
good,Easy day at work. Stock clean and done. The pace is fairly slow and the coworkers are nice and friendly. The pay was ok but the early morning shift was hard for me to get use to.
good,"Getting everything organized and ready for the morning shift preparing the display case for the customers, "
good,"One work place, so many different departments. I loved that I can cross train into different departments so I alway have hours and I can build my resume too. Not everyone is perfect, I had a couple different horrible/""red"" managers but I was able to move to different stores where I recieved great feedback and coaching to help me be a successful employee. Great benefits and great pay."
good,the time i spent at krogers made me grow as a person over all. i was a leader and a mentor i had the chance to be a part of something that was great. the work could be a little stressful but i wanted to do it so it came to me easy.
good,"On any given day it was a very busy store where I work at."
good,I enjoyed working there. Good benefits but you have to be there 9 months if part time and 3 months of full time. The managers were great. Good hours and great people to work with
good,"Greeted customers, asked for their Kroger rewards card and any coupons, scanned groceries and bagged as I was going. Finished bagging and put purchase in their cart, took payment in whichever source they gave me and either gave change or just receipt if paying with card. Always watching for under the cart purchases and not to miss them. Going to next customer over and over again from start of shift to end. This was store closest to the beach and was always very busy."
good,This is an amazing company through and through yes every company has their downfalls I'm not saying that Kroger does not but the kind of people that they hired the management teams that work with Kroger and all of the people that they bring in whether it's for a department or for front end are amazing and quick learning and they all learn to love their job
good,I think that the Kroger company is a good place to work and is convenient for people that has good customer service skills and being able to tell customers where certain products are at on the aisle.
good,I think kroger has great benefits and the union is awesome.some many perks for employees and there families.getting paid weekly is great and so are the benefits.
good,"Kroger is a great store to work at if you are a high school student or an retiree. Working there is amazing and its always smooth but there will be times when it gets busy. Its so much to learn and adventure. I think being a cashier is the easiest position and also the best if you are a customer friendly type person. The hardest part of working at Kroger in my opinion is scan-rite. Everything else is fun, fast paced, and friendly vibes. I would recommend this job to anyone who is trying to make some quick money."
good,"Easy work, fun and productive. Easy to stay busy and be a star worker. The union is great and the customers are friendly. I couldn’t live off the pay but great retirement job!"
good,"Hi, I enjoyed working at Kroger's, I was there a year I retired from there cause it was time to move on to a job that I could move around instead of standing in one place for 8 hours. The managers are nice as well as the employees."
good,"counting out medications and verifying patients info, answering phone calls, customers service and checking inventory. the management there care about the workers and listen to what the  employees say, if you are struggling with anything they go out of their way to help."
good,Kroger was an awesome place to work. I would have never left had they offered me full time employment. But to obtain it was very difficult because I worked two jobs. But other than that I loved the company.
good,"I enjoyed working for Kroger, they were very good to their employees and they offered great benefits. They were also willing to work around an employees school schedule."
good,"A good place to work if you are looking for benefits and job security. "
good,Sometimes work day gets boring but i still i enjoy the time working for Kroger. I would necessarily recommend college or high school students to work for kroger but thats a great start to get introduced into the workplace.
good,"I have been employed at Kroger for six years, it was my first job I love it, however I’m in need of something that pays a little more. I’m need of something more stable."
good,I have  been with the company for 15 years. I have learned a lot. I enjoy working overnight it works with my family. I recommend you work overnight shift.
good,Everyone was very friendly and customer oriented. I loved working with the management team.  The workload was not hard at all.  The hours were perfect for me as well.
good,"i worked in the fuel center so i worked alone alot. i had access to the safe, ran my own reports, counted and deposited my own money, customer service, cleaned pumps and changed trash. i also cashiered. i was well liked at kroger by all the crew and management team. i was very flexible and worked my hours all over the place."

good,Kroger was one the best jobs I had. It taught to me become more responsible and reliable. I was offered many opportunities to build a career. I managed money mostly.
good,"The job had a fair share of ups and downs, although it was more downs than ups most of the time. I was getting minimal to no hours of work. My schedule would change constantly, and I was only getting $7.30 an hour, not to mention the fact I was working a second job at the time. New management would come in and request we do a specific job a new way when there was no reason to change how we were doing said job."
good,Just want to move to a different state. Wanting to try something new for a long time and just desired to give it a shot. I also have grocery manager experience.
good,"This company has groomed be to be the professional manager I am today.  I have learned to execute great customer service, hire qualified candidates, train and develop associates, and solve problems.  I have also advertised promotional sales, increased sales, and reduced shrink within the company."
good,"I;M sure I could've advance there if some of management wasn't there, some employee was very pleasant people, most customers was pleasant also, all in all it was a wonderful experience."

good,Kroger's was my very first job. It was relaxed environment. I bagged groceries and pushed carts. Perfect job for high school student. I would recommend it for any teen!
good,"I loved my job, fellow associates and my supervisors. I learned all aspects of the floral business. Kroger does weddings, funerals, proms, and much more.

good,Would definitely go black to work for them !! Great place to work with lots of opportunity to advance !! They give raises annually and offer the union protection
good,I enjoyed working there as a teenager. It was a great experience and an easy way to earn some money. Bagging groceries was my main task. Getting shopping carts from outside was not fun though
good,"I have no problem with Kroger, I would just like to start working full time. Kroger's staff and management where hard working and friendly to everyone in my eyes."
good,I had spent 12 years in pharmaceutical sales and this was an opportunity that allowed me to return to pharma. I didn't feel there was an opportunity for me to grow and advance within Kroger's Pharmacy
good,"Check in with management, Go to my assigned register, Greet customers have conversations as I ring them up, Clean my station, if my shift ain`t over ill help other coworkers"
good,I loved working for Krogers it was an amazing place to learn and grow as a interim manager. I enjoyed my time at krogers and I grew quickly at  the job as management in training I found they were fair and treated their employees fairly.
good,I appreciated everything they did for me. I wouldn't be where I am to day without them and hope to be back with them eventually. They are top notch in my book.
good,Not much to say besides the fact you meet a lot of different cultures and race people. Plenty of food options when you go on break. You actually get a 30 minute break.
good,I work fo Kroger at this present time. I was fulltime but i am dropping down to Part time. I love my job at Kroger but the pay isn't all that great so I'm looking for another Part time job. The benefits are extremely great.
good,"Kroger is a awesome company to work for however, in the pharmacy there is little room for advancement and a lot to do for such little pay. Kroger does give you opportunities for raises. Overall despite the low pay Kroger is a awesome place to work."
good,Kroger was an enjoyable place to work and had lots of benefits and many hard working challenges. There were amazing customers and excellent management who took care of everything and made sure everything was in order.
good,"Extremely busy.  I was CSM there.  Had a good working relationship with all my fellow employees. The hours were very long and hard on me, and I was needing to not work the physical aspect of this job that was required.  I was looking to work and use my brain and be off on weekends."
good,typical day included collecting carts and bagging groceries. most days went by quickly and the pay was good. management was very helpful and supportive.

good,"Kroger is great to work for. Management is excellent. Willing to work with your schedule. "
good,"Had a lot of fun with the Kroger company as a job & I would say; from them, I have learned the most useful and effective standards for custom service!"
good,The technology area is actually exciting at Kroger right now.  The Grocery business has low margins and is very competitive.  Kroger is using technology to give themselves the edge in this space.
good,"Great company to work for. Loved all the customers I came to meet, and get to know. Basicly I cleaned the restrooms when needed, baged grocerys and brought in carts when needed"
good,Best Company I have ever worked for . If you have any young adults or know any I prefer you all to recommend Kroger as a job option to them. This is one of the best companies and they’ll work with you.
good,"need to be independent and hard worker.Minimal amount of supervision and training, you need to be self motivated and also be able to take on tasks on your own. Not enough time to focus on customer service seems like frequently understaffed. I enjoyed the busy work day and guest service."
good,"This was my first job when I turned 15, they were very nice and communicative. They trained me very well. It was a great place to work for a first timer"
good,"Although I left Kroger to relocate, it was a great company to work for being in the union is PLUS. Its easy to move up in the company if that is what you are searching for"
good,The workers are all friendly and always willing to help you or any customer. Hardest part of the job was just learning the produce numbers after that everything was a breeze.
good,"Krogers has and will always hold a special place in my heart. I have meet some really great people there and made a lot of great memories working there. They offer flexiable hours, great benefits, and a fun environment."
good,"I learned how to be a leader."
good,I didn't really think being a stocker would be a good job but here I am wrong. It wasn't to bad. It was fairly easy. It just depended on the day and how big of a shipment you had. I always got my work done in time and before anyone else was done. Hard work pays off .
good,Worked at Kroger for 36 years. Great place to work. Started as a bagger while in college and retired as a Store Manager. Many positions and life experiences acquired during my tenure with Kroger.
good,Working at Kroger was probably the best job I could have had. I worked with the company for four years. Leaving Kroger was the worst mistake I've made.
good,"i liked my experience working at kroger pharmacy. its faced paced most of the time and when its not there is always some sort of project or task to do to keep the pharmacy running. it does require lots of patient interaction obviously so be prepared to handle people of all types of moods, mostly mildly sick but still polite"
good,Kroger is a family friendly Grocery store that is very flexible it is also a job that you can branch off and begin and build a career with Kroger is a wonderful place to work

good,"I enjoyed my time with Kroger,they were very accomodating to me as a single mother,I had many job responsibilities there, It was a fun clean atmosphere."
good,i loved working here with great people. The mangers were always there to try and help you through hard tasks or just to guide you until you completed your task
good,"I worked through the night as part of the night crew, then I switched to the daytime crew and was put in to the maintenance crew which was great and you can always a coworker to change shifts with you"
good,Kroger's is a great place to work for but they are not good with treating their employees with respect and care. for a while I enjoyed working for kwik shop but it wasn't fair for them to let me go because I help customers out in the best way for the company and krogers is a company that loves there customers . I couldn't understand that part but oh well
good,"Works in a retail store environment majority of the time."
good,Typical day at Krogers would be coming in and clocking in and going straight to my station. Standing in the aisle greeting customers and checking people out.
good,"A typical day involved multiple meetings as well as internal email"
good,There is a lot of stuffs to learn from our jobs. We meet  so many different people and get to learn lot of new things. I've learned so many things while working at Kroger for example got better at communication with people.Learned how to keep up with multitasking. We all have bad and good experiences at work.
good,Loved my time there; they operate with excellence and and do it with a smile. The most enjoyable part about working there is interacting with the customers and working with the team. :)

good,"A typical shift was fast paced, customer engaging, and fun. The management was understanding, helpful to the staff, but could always improve on their communication skills. The environment was very friendly, open, and welcoming. The hardest part of the job sometimes was defeating boredom on slow days. My coworkers made work the most enjoyable."
good,"Kroger is a good company to work for, but advancement is difficult at the retail level. Promotions aren't assigned by merit, but rather by length of time worked."
good,Nice place to work. Management team is very helpful. There are advancement opportunities. School tuition aid is available. The produce department is always active.
good,Overall. I love my position in Krogers pharmacy as a Pharmacy technician .  There's nothing more rewarding than seeing the patients happy with the service they received.

good,"It's a great atmosphere, the work challenges you and makes you feel rewarded when completed. The staff is great and management was just as great. Having the option of a union is amazing as well."
good,working  at bakers shoe store i learned so much from opening and closing procedures to making sure all task get done a timely manner.It was a super fast paced environment and i absolutely loved it
good,"i learned leadership and good communication skills, time management, customer-comes-first mentality, very friendly but work oriented, a typical day at work might include an unsatisfied customer and we as kroger employees do whatever it takes to make the customer happy and make the situation right"
good,Kroger is an excellent company but is very hard on your body. There is a toll that working 12 hours a day on your feet at least 90% of your time. Time off is difficult to take.
good,Nice atmosphere. I really enjoyed this job. You came in on your shift and helped people with their prescription needs. I stayed busy from the time a arrived at work till it was time to go home. I like staying busy. The hardest part of the job was when you talked to someone who could not afford their medicine. The management was great.The most enjoyable part of the job was when you could find coupons online to help those who needed it. To see someone receive their medication that they need to stay alive. Their was nothing bad I can say about it.
good,"A typical day at work was very busy as a Lead Customer Service Manager. Many tasks involved including running the front end, directing customers to shorter lines and taking care of breaks and lunches."
good,"Kroger is a great company to work for. Retail does require long hours at times and weekends and holidays."
good,"The culture is always positive, friendly, and family oriented. Worked with them before the military as well as while I went to college afterwards. Highly recommend this company and any Kroger Brand company to future employees."

good,"worked at Kroger over 13 years until mgmnt changed."
good,"The hardest part of the job is there is no set hours, and each day there is something different. I loved working at Kroger but I kept getting promised advancement but they were followed through with."
good,"A typical day at work would be clocking in, locking my belongings in my assigned locker in the break room, picking up the till from customer service desk, and starting my job. "
good,"Loved the working environment! I worked for PLM, a merchandising subcontractor for Kroger. I liked working independently. I also liked moving around, and not sitting behind a desk."
good,I would work here again no questions asked working here was my first job and it showed me how to become a adult this job has a lot to offer and a lot of great people
good,Paid weekly with a laid back enviroment. I went from courtesy Clerk to deli Clerk in a matter of a couple months. Great people and great environment. Would definitely work there again.
good,Great place to work in a friendly environment. They give regular pay raises and plenty of hours. The policies are fair and everyone is treated equally with respect.
good,"Started at Kroger five years ago, fantastic first job. Coworkers and management made being a courtesy clerk an exceptional working experience. Its always rewarding to see a customer's smiling face that you've grown to know for years. I've met so many people, customers and associates, that I talk to daily. As I got older, my supervisors trained me to work all sorts of positions on the front end and the Fuel Center. I could do any task on the front end, and every one of them helped me grasp an even better idea of being able to practice better customer service. It's very hard to have a bad day when your associates and customers are always so enjoyable to be around. It was all about feeding the human spirit, and that was something I can get behind."
good,"This was a different experience,  although there were some unpleasant experiences with customers you always had fellow associates to turn to for guidance and advice"
good,they care about not just there customers but there employees as well. best job i ever had except for the minimum wage. at least iwas able to work overtime to get my money together.
good,"I love Kroger, I absolutely do. It's just Kroger keeps cutting peoples hours, yet they keep hiring more, and more people. It's really hard to get full time there, and you have to make a living. You can't really make a living working at Kroger unless you're a manager or you get full time. You have to average 36 hours for 36 weeks. People have been there for years and every time they almost get to there 36 week mark they cut hours. But I've learned a lot while working there. There is rude customers, and nice customers. You just have to deal with it, and help them in every way possible."
good,"I have enjoyed working here,  but the hours fluctuate so much & you cannot support a family with 20 hours one week & 40 the next! Management is wonderful & very helpful!"
good,I know the benefits and the company are great I should've chose to work in a different dept than the one I chose. It just wasn't a good fit for me. The most enjoyable part was the people I got to work with.
good,"Kroger is a very fun place to work for, friendly, great benefits, flexiable with your schedueling. Good on hours. Managment is helpful in time of need. Very loving place to be."
good,working well with others. A typical day would consist of scanning and tagging to inventory for store system. Also unloading trucks with merchandise to be put out on the shelves for sales.
good,"I'd go in and always have a great group of people to work with. We were understaffed at times and I had to go above and beyond my personal work requirements to make up for others absence at times."
good,My personal experience Kroger is a very good company to work for you get great benefits and the people are amazing to work with it can be tough at times but you'll get through it
good,This is a great place to start off in the working world they will teach you everything you need to know so there's no confusion when you start your job the customers are usually makes your job a whole lot better and management is good they help out when there's a busy day at work the hard part about being a cashier would be standing in that one spot all day but the most enjoyable would be Talking to all the great customers
good,"I really enjoy working for Kroger over the years and I am forever grateful for the opportunity to work for such a great company. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great place to work. I've been both full and part time during my career and I must admit, there were some times when it became a challenge. During those times, is where I gained the strength with unity concept and the management team were there to support the crew all the way. I'd give Kroger two thumbs ups on being, in my eyes, one of America's best places to work."
good,This is a good job also I was around a friendly environment but I couldn't balance this job between school because of the location and during I ddnt know much about relocation
good,"My day was fair and didn't get hectic until closing. my coworker are amazing. it is a great place to work, I get double fuel point and 10% full purchase."
good,"Great place to work. I have learned the meaning of teamwork. Rewarding exp such as good benefits, gracious vacation time and paid time off. Managers very attentive to employee needs. Hardest part of job learning to work all departments with different hours and days but worth every hour for the experience that I have gained"
good,Great group of people to work with.  Love my job there.  Very busy every day with recruiting people.  I enjoy my daily job functions.  Everyone there is wonderful to work with.
good,Great place to work in depending on management.  Most likely be prepared to bounce around departments if you want hours unless you get lucky and actually are full time.
good,"I had a great time working at Wireless. The environment was relaxed yet productive. "
good,"not to bad of a job, had its perks and its down falls overall a nice work environment. Steady work and was very uniform in tasks assigned to the worker."
good,"I believe the work life balance is just right, They were very good to me when my husband died. I have had a good experience with the work place culture and a basic good management."
good,"i was just a stocker, so i usually just stocked the dairy shelves and assisted customers with any questions or tasks they required assistance with. it was very easy and no real thinking involved."
good,I didn't mind working thier they just had too many managers not enough work hands . and defiantly not enough work hrs per week . and no benifits what so ever.
good,I really like the pay every week that is really convenient. Fun to laugh and see new faces in the store. I learned how grocery retail work and communication skills with all kinds of people.
good,"Working for Kroger was a wonderful experience. Besides the occasional nit picky manager, I have no complaints. Coworkers turn into friends and then into family. Had I not gone into healthcare, I'd still be working at Kroger."
good,"This job provides a great deal of experience in customer service and conflict resolution. Although most people start out making minimum wage, there are opportunities for advancement and the company encourages employees to pursue those opportunities as well as educational opportunities. The benefits are great as well and you can also plan for retirement for this job. In short, this is a job to career opportunity."
good,"Kroger as a corporation is a great company to work for. Compensation is competitive, and benefits are amazing. My particular experience is mediocre because of the management I dealt with."
good,"Long hours and clean work place, worked holidays and mandatory overtime. They have a point system, incentive pay. they watch you every second but stll good place."
good,"I loved working here, I loved my coworkers and the managers. id usually go in, clock in, go put my stuff away and automatically knew to go straight to whatever register I was assigned to and begin my normal day of work."
good,"I trained multiple associates and have been employed with the company since this particular store opened on April, 3rd, 2014....I have exceeded the minimum requirements."
good,"The Kroger Company is one of the best starter jobs for anyone seeking employment. There are also potential scholarships and room for advancement if you pursue a career in the business. Full-Time work is practically a given, and its relatively easy to get the job. Giving it a try wouldn't hurt much, but if you need a place to start, go for it!"
good,"However, working with the Kroger (Food4Less) Company was a pleasure! In almost every work day, there was something new to learn in every department especially with the job description as Universal Clerk!  A work day at Food4Less is very simple and even more simple when you've been trained in your department. Managers and supervisors of the Kroger Company (Food4Less) are intensively resourceful. Having the ability to cope with employees and customers at any giving time. The hardest part the job would be working in a department where there are a number of task that's unfinished from the work shift ahead that had to be completed before a certain time and didn't get completed at all. Working with friendly co-workers would be the most enjoyable part of the job because their like a second family at work."
good,It was awesome creating bonds with regular customers you begin to know by name. Also enjoyed the team i worked with at the time. I loved the fact I was able to be a part of the Grand Opening of the first Kroger Fuel Center walk in gas station.
good,"Great place to work, room to grown and advance. Training through coaching and developing with one and one with assistant and head of the departments. Mentoring offered with members of management. Competitive pay with superior benefits after completing a year with company."
good,I love working with the Associates and helping them find potential in themselves for growth.Management from my experience is willing to teach you. Family oriented stores.
good,I worked there fourteen years I only stop working there because of health reasons and not being able to run register without my pacemaker going off . I worked every job in the front end also work in floral department backery and frozen foods . I worked night stock . I enjoyed working here because I did a lot of different job that they felt I could be trained to do . so I worked wherever they needed me to work it was nice to meet some very interesting people as my customers.
good,I learned alot working with this company customer always right courtesy services if i can help that is my # one priority make sure my customers are satisfied before leaving so they will keep coming back  helping when ever I can which is called teamwork making sure the store is clean for the customer whiping the registers down making sure bags our stoked clean floors keep eye out for spills  making sure the carts are stacked for customer interning the store work the backery department work scann coordinator self checkout making sure all tags for next week sales are put up scand the perimeter of the store printing and hanging great prices every day low prices
good,Krogers is a great job and great experience for anyone who is looking for a part time job great people run it and it is a very nice setting.I worked in the customer service desk for about a month i am still working there it has showed me how to deal with the customers and how to talk to them.
good,"Kroger is a very associate and customer focused company. It is very willing to work around school schedules, alternative work schedules, and things of the sort. I would go through my day, running a register at times, bagging groceries other times, or working the service desk. If you're willing to learn, you can do nearly everything there is to offer. Also, over time, the people you work with slowly but surely start to become a second family to you (Management and peers alike)."
good,"When I started working at Kroger's I was 16 years old. They start excepting as young as 14 years old. When I got their the work seemed easy speaking for the produce department, but by my second week there I was working night shift all by myself. Some managers were understanding that I was new and I was still trying to get the hang of things others expected me to know everything the first two days. Once you get there and get to know everyone loosen up you'll have fun and time will fly and next thing you know your making 14.50 an hour and you know how to run several different departments."
good,Working with the customers getting the product out making sure the orders are on time and making sure the product on time and everything is counting for
good,I was quite apprehensive to work in a grocery store even one that I frequently shops at but after working there I wish more places was like krogers. From the beginning at training I learned that they cared about their employees as much as they care about their customers. I was Sad to leave but was proud to have been apart of the Kroger family.
good,i learnt alot about the kroger culture and ewhat they do before the foods end up in the kroger stores. the management department was great and did a fantastic job
good,"Love the wonderful people I work with couldn't dream of a better team atmosphere. It felt like home the minute I walked into the interview. A very small pharmacy, very friendly folks."
good,"Good work days. Very flexible, will work around your schedule. Ask you to do a lot of jobs. Employees are all very friendly and management is very friendly."
good,Kroger Is A Very Great Job With Nice Sweet People And Has Great Benefits Like Life Insurance Dental Insurance And A 401k Plan The Pay Could Be A Little More Substantial But All In All Its A Good Job To Have.
good,I would recommend Kroger as a good place to work. I enjoyed the fast paced atmosphere. It was a great experience and would gladly work for another kroger
good,The hardest part is getting outside to work on the carts for an hour without having water on you. it is not a job for asthmatic people. I would recommend this job to those who are physically fit. I gave it 5 stars cause the environment is fun to work in.
good,"I loved working here.  My supervisor was firm, but always approachable.  I typically would bag groceries, but also had the responsibilities of cleaning bathrooms, collecting trash, retrieving carts, and helping customers.  It could be physically demanding, but I loved the constant moving because it made the day go by faster and you are less likely to think about the time."
good,"Spent 27 years with The Kroger Co and found it to be very rewarding."
good,I really enjoyed working for Kroger's. It was a great! place to work until Kroger's changed market Managers. I loved it!! I was inspired to get up every morning and look forward  to my coworkers and the customers. Thanks for the opportunity.
good,very flexible hours. fun team members. some supervisor needed to pick up some slack. if you're willing to work and be respectful every work day is a good work day.
good,"My favorite part about working for the Kroger company is with my hectic life from high school even to college I was able to have a flexible schedule. They truly worked with me and I was able to easily change it when it was needed. Customers are lovely, and coworkers are easy to get along with."
good,"I only worked here as a part time job, but they were very flexible for me. While I didn't always get as many hours as I wanted, they were very willing to schedule around my Hiking trips."
good,The Jobs were not that bad it was the management that had no idea what to do. The company them self as a hole is not bad just had a bad manager.
good,"A typical day and work: Every day I came into work, there was a new challenge, and it was always fun to overcome that challenge with my coworkers. "
good,"The Typical day at work was one a person couldn't complain, The people were nice and the work was fulfilling. I learned great customer service and money handling and money responsibility. Management were always fare and only wanted what was expected. The workplace culture was always welcoming and fun. The hardest part of the job was being overwhelmed with customers with not much help but I always got the job done and the best part of the job was being able to put in a good days work."
good,I started as an assistant manager and was promoted within a year to manager. I truly enjoyed working for this company and only left to care for my children. The staff is caring and very helpful. The company will help you better you cares within the company and offer great bonus to management.
good,Production department from shift supervisors down to regular employees very teamwork oriented. Good work culture out on the production floor as well as in the company office. Great General Manager with a clear vision of the comany's mission. Top production management at this facility needs more cohesion and teamwork orientation. Plant overall is a great place to work with very good benefits.
good,"It was very active, I learned how to bag correctly & gather karts in an appropriate speed. Management was okay. The workplace culture was helpful to others in need. Hardest part was doing things in an efficient manner. Most enjoyable part was seeing other people happy for helping them."

good,I enjoyed going to work each day at Kroger. The interaction with the customers was exciting and I felt like I was really helping them with their transaction.
good,Great job for college students.  They work very well with school schedules.  Pay is pretty good.  They offer insurance to part time employees. There is room for advancement.
good,My job was bottom tier but it was still a decent place to work and my favorite job so far. Work was fast paced and i enjoyed dealing with customers.
good,Good customers freah fruit able to meet new people and experience the new work place . Friendly staff .. very long lunches felxibility grettin customers helping them put to the car with groceries
good,Great opportunities to gain skills working with the public.  Room for growth.  Hours to meet just about any need.  Many stores to work at.
good,It was very nice to have my own area where I worked. (This depends on where you are placed because you may be placed in a larger department.) Mariano is a very nice environment and whether the day is busy or slow you will have a great time meeting new people and networking.
good,"When I came to work at Kroger, I would usually bag groceries or help on the register. I learned how to properly bag groceries, use the cash register and how to collect carts in the parking lot. Management was very on top of their game but also cool. My co-workers were easy to get along with. The hardest part of my job was grabbing carts because we had certain men whose job it was to collect them but sometimes us females had to do it.

good,"fast and steady pace, management and co-workers were great, the hardest part was staying under the time scanning time frame, i enjoyed working at Kroger."
good,"Working at the kroger fuel center is pretty enjoyable.  There's a lot to do, but there's usually two of us working most of the time.  One person will run the register while the other does the outside stuff, or we will swap back and forth. I normally load up all the trash from the pumps, bathroom, and kiosk to take up to the trash bin up at the store.  We go out and assist customers paying at the pumps when they have are having problems. Also, have to go out and check for skimming devices once a day. Of course we have to do cleaning as well, clean the pumps, bathroom, inside the kiosk, sweep the parking lot to keep it looking good. Management seems to be friendly and helps a lot with schedules they work well with your availability.  My co-workers are all nice people, we all have stuff we would rather do while we are down there and we are good about splitting all the work.  We all do everything but if someone would rather be on the register and the other do trash thats fine.  Sometimes we are by ourselves and when that happens we can only go out of the kiosk when its not super busy.  That's probably the hardest part about the job is when you work a couple hours by yourself and people need help outside but you have customers at the window too. Which doesn't always happen its just a pain when it does because you want to make everyone happy.  The most enjoyable part is how fast it is.  You don't have a lot of time to kill on the job because if its not busy you can find stuff to do outside if its just filling paper towels or wiping down the pumps so they stay looking good."
good,"I really enjoyed working there, I had a raise in 3 months. They were always glad to see me and i like being there doing my job."
good,"I really enjoy working there. I started working on a regular lane, and have advanced to the U scan. I like to keep busy and being on U can I am not. I also don't like the hours.

good,"great place to work"
good,"In my five years of working with Ralphs, I have been treated fairly and they accommodate my personal life and well as my education. Advancements seem far between, even for people who put in great effort in their work ethic, but it's not bad. Management for the most part is great and treat their employees fairly and with respect. Their are always a few that do not act as maturely and a tad bit hypocritical. Job security is outstanding, no complaints at all, but Advancement could be more fair and rewarding."
good,employees and staff are very helpful and benefits are great as well. customers are always first and right. Busy but fun environment to work in
good,"Customer service, customer service, customer service! Management meeting at 10 am, daily product ordering by 1pm. Production throughout the day of varies items.

The most enjoyable part of that job was talking to all the customers."

We do get a little busier during holidays throughout the year, but nothing I can't handle. The most enjoyable part of the job is being part of a great company such as Kroger."
good,"As my first job, working Kroger's was very enjoyable. My job was to stock shelves and help bag when it was needed. At first it was very tiring, because you're standing for 7+ hours a day, but you get use to it after awhile. My supervisor and co-workers were patient, helpful with me. We had excellent teamwork and finished jobs orderly and timely together. My most enjoyed part about working at Kroger's were co-workers and our teamwork."
good,The Management was very friendly and was willing to work with anybody the only problem i had was there communication was not very well with each other

Speak with store staff along with management to see if they had any issues to investigate. Work along side Human Resources with employee issues with interviews."
good,the job is a good job you know when you get raises i feel like they should pay cashiers and bagger more than what they are getting paid. It should be more opportunities for workers to advance in the work house.
good,"I took a job with Kroger when Farmer Jack closed. I have been happy working at Kroger, it is a fun work place with supportive management in the stores. Kroger Company needs more trainers that give hands on training for the new employees. The seafood dept. has grown, I like to train, manage, wait the counter, write orders, check in orders, fill, work displays, and run the dept. Multi tasking has always been a part of this business.  With proper training my colleagues enjoyed  working along side me and preforming daily tasks.  The lack of hands on training has made it harder for them to catch on so I have choose to move on to give my experience to a company that wants to grow. I believe my experience can do this for your company."
good,"A typical day at work involves me walking into the Kroger store, clocking in, and then going to the end of a line to bag for customers.  When asked, I go out to the parking lot to grab carts for a half hour minimum, but it is not a pain at all, it is rather fun.  While working at Kroger, I have learned how to properly bag groceries, but more importantly, I have learned basic and complex principles of customer service.  Management, at Kroger New Albany is great.  They are very flexible with break taking and hours.  All of my co-workers are great and very nice to me.  I am yet to meet a mean person while on the clock.  In my own opinion, there is no hardest part of the job as long as you get good sleep and stay focussed.  The most enjoyable part of my job is being around customers and having a good time while making money."

The hardest part was trying to make sure I type in the right number for the right fruit or vegetable but that really wasn't that hard.

Once the truck is unloaded then I run freight for my assigned isles for the given night, condition or face those isles and run any back stock. I do work closely with several Co-Managers with what to expect on the nights grocery load, as well as upcoming sale items coming in, and deliveries for other departments coming in.

You would learn how to communication, help, learn where everything in the store is at, learn how to interact with people. the hardest thing I would say about Krogers is when you're doing one task, you have to stop what you're doing to do another and the go back to the first task you was doing. You really have to multitask doing this job. Mangers excellent. Co workers you'll get along well. But the job can be fun though"

The hardest part of the job would be the lifting for me and the most enjoyable part of the job for me is meeting new people every day."
good,"People think that working at a gas station is easy, but in all reality, it is hard. The customers can be rude and just cruel in general. It can get messy.

good,"Over all was a good Company to work for, room for advancement, they had good training methods. I thought the best part of the job was getting to deal with the customers. I believe the hardest part of the job was trying to figure out what management wanted, because one day they would tell you one thing and the next day it was different. Out of the ten plus years I worked for the company I learned that everyday you can learn something new from someone else. I also learned that sometimes it doesn't matter how hard you work its the results you come up with."

There are plenty of opportunities to advance in the company rather quickly, and if you want full time you can work your way up to it once you have some seniority. The hardest part of the job is not panicking when you have a heavy workload or when the store is extremely busy, but most of the customers are extremely friendly and overall its just a nice place to work."

Make sure Olive Bar signs were correctly placed and presentable.  Walk around Cheese Island and replace and neaten cheese displays that have been shopped, rebuild displays of cheese.  Pull out dated product, mark down products that will soon be out of date.  I would make a list of product to order that had sold or needed replaced.  I would make a list of cheeses that needed cut, and filled.  The Deli Manager was my immediate Supervisor.  Great person.  The crew that I worked with were a great mix of people young and old.  I enjoyed going into work everyday.  Letting people taste and experience different cheeses that we sold.  Help people find what they were looking for, and along the way hope that they find a new cheese. Mon & Thursday were Order days, and Receiving Days.

Whenever my pharmacist is not available, I know that my co-workers will help me to the best of their abilities to solve my problem. The hardest part of the job is working the first of every month.

I have been there for a while so I have met so many wonderful people. I help out on the checkout lanes when our lines get backed up. Whether it is jumping on register to scan groceries or bagging the groceries to help get the customer out in a timely fashion.
good,I love working at Krogers. I love the people who work there and the people who go there. I love walking all over the store and getting paid to shop even if its for other people.

good,"I truly miss this job. There is so much opportunity for an individual with this company, I couldn't NOT recommend it. They are very willing to work with students schedules. The environment is warm and welcoming. Teamwork is second nature. It's so fun, it doesn't seem like work most days."
good,Overall a fantastic place to work! Management was very nice and willing to help. The facility is really nice and accommodating to new mothers. I really liked working there.
good,The thing i learn is i got better at customer service. Working at kroger is good most of the time the people are good but some time the manager be tripping
good,i learned several of skills in a small environment. i interacted with many types of different people but also built relationships with regulars. They put trust in you and gave you more responsibilities the more you did good at your job.
good,Wonderful  places to work loved all of my coworkers.  And the manager where great.nive and friendly guests. The co.company care for the people  who worked for them. Just a great place to work. Wish they had one here in Alabama.
good,Enjoyed my time with  Kroger's. Made many contacts and  Friends.i learned alot that  carried  over to my nee jobs. Most of my Managers  were  really  excellent  people.
good,Kroger is a great and friendly company to work for. 10/10 recommend Kroger as a career enhancment. While there I gained great customer service skills and learned more about how to help people along the way. My management was amazing pay was great and I made alot of new friends
good,"Kroger is great, very easy. Nice crew members, great customers , great managers , easy to work with, flexible hours . The other employers are friendly n easy to get along with."
good,I enjoyed working at Kroger. I loved putting smiles on peoples faces and I love to help people. I believe Kroger is a great place to work and it builds character. And whilst with co-workers I enjoyed being around there was never a dull moment.
good,"Kroger offers an environment that goes from 0 to 60 in an instant. Shifts go by fast and the benefits are really good. If one has any concerns they can voice them to the union they joined. Paid vacation is offered after the first year, and you can request time off online through an employee portal."
good,great place to work with great benefits . overall satisfaction with company is great . they care for their employees as people witch makes it great to go to work.
good,"I loved working at Kroger, the management was great and there was alot of room for advancement. They promote within and I advanced quickly with hard work"
good,"I love working with Kroger! They really care about you and the people you work with will start to feel like family. I have only worked there for a couple of months, but I highly recommend this job. The only thing that I dislike is the amount of hours I work. Not enough."
good,"I worked at a Kroger store, Ralphs, for one summer and it was a very good place for me to work part time while continuing to take classes at the local community college, the managers were very flexible with hours and accommodating requests for days off."
good,Kroger's was a good place to work if you want a part time job eventually you can work for full-time minimum wage was not great I wish I would have had more hours and better pay working with the people was great everyone had good attitude and High Spirit the managers I worked with were good very understanding the work environment was sometimes stressful but also good
good,I started out as a regular clerk and within two years I had held multiple different management titles and had become a well known employee in multiple different stores. Kroger has great benefits for full time employees and they offer a lot of overtime/holiday pay. Coworkers are typically good workers and fun to be around if you work in the right department. Upper management was great as well! Highly recommend!!
good,The hardest part about the job was to remain calm while getting yelled by a customer because their coupons wasn’t going through because clearly it isn’t your fault. Workplace was relaxed when it needed to be a intense when it needed to be.
good,This is a good place to work with flexible hours and good pay. It has its ups and downs but mainly due to other employees not the actual business doing anything wrong.
good,Kroger is a friendly place to work for where you can also have many opportunities with. Working for Kroger helped me better my customer service skills as well as being able to do certain activities with a time limit (clicklist).
good,"The people are loving and caring, I actually loved going to work everyday. Everything about the job was amazing, the managers, customers and co workers."
good,"Working mostly backroom allowed me to work at a pace I was comfortable with while still completing my work. Due to the lack of employees, I was required to do multiple tasks during work."
good,"Great work environment. Set hours, good benefits, and awesome coworkers. I would still be working there if I hadn't moved out of the area. It's a not just a job, but a career."
good,In less than 2 years working for Kroger i had the opportunity to move up the ladder from just a regular night stocker to lower management with the very foreseeable goal of being upper management.
good,Lots of walking and rude customers. It’s very quiet sometimes. Fast during the day mostly slow business during the night. Very productive work make the time go by faster
good,"I had a great experience working at Krogers. I was working temporarily for summer employment in order to aid in the costs for the program that I participated in called Semester at Sea. Everyone at Kroger was kind as well as the customers. As a first job, I didn't understand how challenging and tiring it can be working for ten hours but being placed in an environment where everyone is extremely supportive aids in the idea of working for ten hours. Having such warm and caring workers allowed me to relax and not concentrate on working for ten hours."
good,"Currently, I am waiting on a bid for a full time job in the dairy department.  At that point, if successful, I will have full benefits at a union job."
good,"My work space is always a pleasure to go to. My pharmacists are always reliable, they know what they're doing, as well as making sure we do the right thing. The atmosphere is always positive and everyone gets along. If I didn't have to find a job in my major I would of stayed a little longer."
good,It was a very decent job. Started to have to many working hours for school. A little bit far . Loved working with customers. I had very good first job experience with them.
good,"The workers were respectful, listened when asked to do something, completed all task, and were happy. The customers were loving, and liked coming into the store to shop because of the friendly experience."
good,"As my first job, Kroger was a wonderful experience for me. Getting to work with the public is definitely challenging at times but it's always a good way to learn social skills."
good,Fast paced environment where there is always something to do. You will not get bored within an 8 hour shift. Management is closely tied to projects but does not micro manage. They let you do your own thing as long as it doesn't waste too much time.
good,Wish I could've worked longer but FEMA DISASTER INSPECTOR  so got called out after Hurricane Michael 2018 and was unable to get rehired upon my return
good,I is a really good company to work for. I am very happy with this company. I work for them for the past 11 years. I highly recommend to work for Kroger.
good,"It was a very fast paced workplace, but I enjoyed it, my co workers were real team players as well as the Management department. I liked the fact that you get to meet new people on a daily basis."
good,"typical days at kroger are very relaxed and good vibes all thruoghout the store most staff members and customers be very polite. evry type of person thier so many cultures and ideas mix its very cool at times, hardest part honestly is the parking lot, but you caneven make that into a positive"
good,"provided customer service"
good,I would recommend this job to anybody.  Health Insurance is good benefits.  I get paid each year for vacations. Pay is good with part time 32 hrs.....
good,"it a excellent place to work. Environment filled with multiply background and different characters all coming together to make "
good,"Filled approximately 400 prescriptions each weekday and had adequate staff to fill them."
good,"I may have only been employed for about 2 years, but I feel pretty happy with where I am at so far. A typical day has its moments of slowness, but it can get pretty busy, especially during weekends."
good,"I enjoyed my time at kroger, had a set schedule and great co-workers.  I would of stayed longer had the pay been a little better it was not enough to get by."
good,I love Kroger it's most definitely a job I would go to again. There are some rude customers but you eventually ignore it and keep a smile on your face and might even put one on there's.
good,"The work was good. Management are really friendly and are always willing to help. Coworkers are are nice and friendly. Basically just do your job and you won’t have a problem. Always be nice to customers even if they are being extremely rude. Be carefully about Sunday’s; that’s the busiest day of the week, besides holidays."
good,"-great work place"
good,"I loved this job. It was easy and a great faced job. Always busy. I was asked to step up and to take over the fuel leads position. I did everything from conference calls, making schedules, filing papers, cover shifts. everything. stocking shelves and marking stuff down."
good,Kroger wizard very nice company to work for many places of advancement I loved our 21 years there very nice company would recommend it to anyone I know nice paying job very understanding company for whatever was going on in your personal life
good,Awesome company with everything everyone is looking for in getting there first job. Great company that keeps everyone busy to help the day go buy and awesome with keeping customers first.
good,It’s a good place to work with people. Only problem is even though I’m working 30 hours a week I requested full time and only got part time. My paycheck is only 150$ and sometimes 180$. I can’t get more hours because then I’ll be full time and they don’t let people become full time because then they can have personal days vacation days or pregnancy leave or get paid more. It’s a great place to work but not enough pay.
good,Awesome with the right managment would reccommend to other people but not enough ti survive on and various area's need more work than other's and the customers were pretty cool.
good,"If u get a good review on the customer survey u get a free lunch. Or sometimes u get another type of reward. They always have contests, so when prizes like that too."
good,Kroger was a great easy moving up job. The more effort and time you put in the more rising you got. I moved up to Home manager with in two years due to hard work and dedication. They see potential and move you up. The pay is good and worth living on. The benefits also a plus.
good,Management could be better. But overall I enjoyed working at Kroger’s. My employees all got along and there were lots of laughs every time I came into work.
good,"Good company to work for.  thanks for opportunity. Great benefits for part time employees.  I would like to find some day hours, instead of all nights overall everything is good."
good,Kroger was a nice work environment where I got to learn as I worked. They provided a friendly work environment that was conducive to employee moral. The most enjoyable part of the job was to leave at night with a job well done mentioned by the manager.
good,"Kroger always worked with my schedule along with my personal life and school life, they really care about their associates. I love the people I worked with and the job it self but I wanted a fresh start and something different"
good,"A typical day at work is a long, and hard working day full of preforming good customer service. You learn about safety of all areas & how to handle things without a manager around."
good,Kroger is a great store. the people there are very friendly. I learned how to sack correctly. I learned a lot of great things there. The management there is very great.
good,"I started out as a courtesy clerk so a typical day for that position was getting carts out of parking lot, clean bathrooms, bagging groceries, sweeping the whole store and taking items back that customers did not want. Then I became a cashier. As a cashier, I rang up groceries, collected customers payments, asked them if they had a kroger plus card, greeted them, and thanked them for visiting Kroger. Then I moved up again and because a Guest/Customer Service Desk Rep. In that position I processed refunds and exchanges, Lottery, Western Union, Money Orders, people paid their bills at customer service and handled complaints. As a shift supervisor I managed shifted and sent people of to their breaks and maintained scheduling and also called in other associates if people called out or didn't show up. Management was okay. Some were rude. It's very busy and fast-paced and you have to know how to handle rude customers Hardest part was when it was the rush part of the day or on the weekends when it's then busiest and everybody calling out. Most enjoyable part was talking to customers, brightening their day, receiving awards for customer compliments."
good,"I like working there. "
good,Management genuinely cares about employees and the core group of workers have a great culture. Kroger will take care of you if you are willing to put in the work!
good,"I learned communication. I learned how to stay stress free under a stressful moment. My favorite part of my job was the customers, it was nice getting to know people especially when they were regular customers."
good,Me personally I loved it if I didn’t have to move I’d still be there I loved my coworkers I love my environment the house were cool and the pay and vacation days were very fair.
good,I loved the job. It was a wonderful learning and growing experience . I’m am so glad I was given the opportunity to work for the company I would definitely recommend it to others people
good,I liked the management! It was a cashier job so standing and doing the same thing all day was the job. But the culture was family like. This was my first job and everyone was so helpful and rooting for me. Great first job.
good,"I stock produce all day and communicate with customers too. I learned a lot about produce and how to operate electric pallet jacks.Management is good, culture at Kroger is very good. The job is pretty easy, the hardest part is dealing with rotten produce. most enjoyable part is the other employees and the customers."

good,Kroger always worked with my school schedule while allowing me the opportunity to promote within. Management lead by example and this made it an amazing place to work.
good,My boss was flexible with hours do to being a student and an employee. Learning experiences were provided constantly to do better and to correct flaws within your work ethic.
good,Great place to work. Working there was a good learning experience I’m thankful for. I worked in customer service and at returns during my time there. Fry’s was my first job and during the 2 years I worked there I met allot of great people and learned to deal with all type of customers. Working there mostly taught me to how to handle tough situations in a professional manner. Also there was always opportunities to grow in the company.
good,"Kroger was GREAT for allowing anyone the opportunity to cross train, learn, and grow in the company. The managers were cooperative and helpful with any store-related concerns or issues."
good,"Very fast paced physical work, lifting boxes all day in and out of extreme temperatures (90+degrees to -15degrees in a freezer) Management was a bit secluded. Workplace culture was good. Hardest part of the job was the physical aspects."
good,I have enjoyed working for Kroger and have grown so much going from fuel clerk to lead of clicklist. I am looking for better opportunities to grow even further.
good,"I loved working for Kroger throughout my whole high school career and soon after. The management was for the most part always kind, caring, understanding and helpful. I would recommend this company to any friends or family who would love to work retail/customer service."
good,The typical work day is very effective. Almost 100% of tasks are completed within that one day frame. I've learned to handle many problems and concerns customers have in a timely manner with sufficient resources. The management is always very helpful and supportive throughout the day. The environment of the store is always progressive. The hardest part of the job is maintaining a time frame in order to have everything completed in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to interact with people throughout the day.
good,"I love working with this company its been really great "
good,"Ralph's is an excellent company to work for, I enjoyed my coworkers.  I enjoyed interacting with the public"
good,Unload trucks and process produce on the truck. Review shelves to restock and clean. Management gave me the tools and training to learn how to manage my area.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Kroger Corporate office in Blue Ash Ohio. Its not a large call center so you really got to know the people you worked with . The Managers and support staff were awesome. If you are thinking of  joining  the team I would say apply directly. As a temp from a staffing agency you don't get the full benefits like sick days, Vacation time off,ETC"
good,"I enjoyed working for the Kroger Co. for many years. Fun place to work with great benefits. Room for advancement, paid vacations after the first year, fixed hours, union based."
good,"Enjoyed working for the Kroger Co. for many year. Room for advancement. Fun place to work with great benefits. Fixed hours, with paid vacations after the first year. Union based."
good,"When I applied and was hired at Frys, it was a relaxing interview and the managers were really easy to get along with and the work done was common sense projects. It provided a lot of movement and times of standing in one area. Overall for a first job as a courtesy clerk, Frys is the place to go!"

good,"Give respect, you get respect.  Loved working for Kroger.  they gave me so many opportunities.  they provided a safe working environment where i had the chance to learn and share knowledge."
good,Great place to work if you are dedicated to put time and effort to succeed. They work hard to make sure safety is the #1 priority. You get paid a good wage and have good opportunities to grow and make more. The more effort you put in the job the more they will be willing to work with you and pay you more. Great management and a fun work environment.
good,The job was very easy. Nothing you cannot handle.  Nice people to work with. The break was very short. May have rude customers but as long as you did your part you were okay.

good,Worked at the starbucks in Kroger and really enjoyed myself along with all of the regulars.  Was always fairly treated.  Moved up after 7 months from a bagger to starbucks.
good,This was a fun job while I was in high school until the weather changed. Overall learning experience though but would not want to make a career out of it.

good,I might do the same thing everyday but still its always different and I love talking to all the friendly staff where ever I go . I am blessed to find a company so awesome.
good,"i loved working with all of the coworkers. when i first started i had to take care of the carts, help costumers, clean up messes and the bathroom. I also got to work in produce."
good,The job was easy and there was always room for advancement. Coworkers were nice and managers were mostly friendly with the exception of a few. Hours were consistent.

good,"My first ever job. I worked here in high school and college..  I helped customers, checked, bagged, and closed. I have made some life time friends while working there"
good,"Great company to work for. Great environment, well designed pharmacies, excellent software, and best management of any large company I have seen. Highly recommend."
good,"Kroger is a good company to work for. It could of been better management at Holt Kroger. EL Kroger was the cleanest, most helpful, safe store. Always can find a worker in that store."
good,Kroger was a great company to work for but after 9 years I was up $3.75 from where I started 9 years ago. I needed something that paid more and left for hospital job that did not work out..
good,"This is a place that promotes career growth, teamwork, encourages good customer service through incentives, offers benefits, offers an education assistance program, employees have the backing of a Union and so much more. Great place to work."

good,i started off here as a cashier years ago. it was a great place to work with flexible hours considering the fact that i was still in school. i would definitely recommend this place to a teen looking to start a 1st job because if you stay here long enough you can become gain experience in all areas of the store
good,"Nothing special about working at Kroger, you either love it or you don't. Deli work isn't for everyone. It'll either make you or break you. It is an easy if your used to working hard."

good,"Fred Meyers was the best job I ever had. The customers are cut throat and sometimes hard to handle but your manager was always there to help you get out of any situation. Fred Meyers had different policy put into action to help protect your job. It is also an union job. The pay is great. In every position the pay is always greater than minimum wage with the ability to have pay raises based off of how many hours you've worked. You get paid vacation time each year and sick days. After 30 days of employment you get health, dental, vision and 401K. After five years you get to invest in Kroger Stocks."
good,I would recommend this job to any body who needs a part time job.has lots of benefits to offer for full time and the managers treat everyone well and willing to teach u anything you need help with.
good,Always sonething to do and a customer to take care of but everyday was exciting. It had it's challenges like all jobs but it was always a fun place to go make money.
good,very relaxed easy work place. i enjoy the people i worked with. we all had the same goal of making money. my managers were understanding at a lot of things.
good,"When I worked there I was a cashier and in charge of the self checkout line. I learned how to process EBT cards, WIC vouchers, coupons. The job wasn't really that hard as long as you paid attention to running the registers. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet people."
good,It's was a good place to work at. It's little stressful when you working at the uscan. You dealing with 6 customers at time. When some of the customers mess up they getting mad at you
good,"I Enjoy Working There And I Know I Am Appreciated By My Manager's,I Was Laid Off From My Previous Job In July Of 2016,And After Going Through The Goodwill Of North GA Work Adjustment Training Program Kroger Interviewed And Hired Me In December Of 2016"
good,I've learned a great deal about accounting and how it effects the company. On the job training and the ability to ask questions gave me the confidence to do what was expected of me.
good,"Paying Plant freight bills, monitoring payments with issues, following up on any unresolved issues. "
good,Kroger was a fun work place we had customer that talk to us while we ring up their items and we also had days we can dress up like on holloween and Christmas and also Valentine's Day. Management was also great too
good,A Day in retail can be either the best day on earth or a day from heck.  it's all on the attitude around you and with Smiths they work really hard to have great attitudes with both their associates and customers
good,"I worked at Dillons Marketplace in Derby, KS which is a company that Kroger owns. Dillons was my first job back in high school and when i left for college i had hoped i wouldn't need to go back. But when i did come back they welcomed me with open arms. I've made a lot of great friends from working there. Not only with employee's but also with customers. They don't supply the best pay out there but if you're willing to put in the time they'll get you up to a semi livable wage (at least as far as cashiers go). I got along with all of my managers, and most of the people i worked with. In 2014 i went to the world cup in Brasil, and they were able to give me a 2 month unpaid leave of absence so that i could accomplish that dream. Breaks were few and far between but that never really bothered me. I prefer to work straight through and skip breaks. The one downside was that 90% of the benefits they offered were irrelevant to 90% of their employee base. A discount on a car is great if you can afford one, but if you can't it's not anything you're going to be using. I always said that i don't need a discount on a car but to extend the 10% discount to everything in the store would be amazingly helpful."
good,Enjoyed nearly ten years working for them. No two days were ever the same. Enjoyed the challenges of meeting payroll guidelines set by corporate. No complaints.
good,"I been to Kroger since 2011. It is a good work place and the customers are amazing. I love that job. The people, The atmosphere, the employees, I love it all"
good,Stocked aisle assigned to me. Was pretty good at stocking all aisles assigned to me. Knew where every product went in the store. Had a Bistro where I would buy me A dinner every once awhile. Good place to work. Had A liquor store in the store also. And A bar where A person can order A beer or mix drink.
good,Working for Kroger has been a challenge but I wouldn't change anything about my experience. Kroger basically groomed me to have patience and an understanding for others. Typical work day clock in at seven and start picking until three. I would say the hardest part of the job is when the store is extremely busy and we have a lot of orders. It does get frustrating but I continue to do my job and make it work. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I'm picking and all the little kids are just running around. It seems like a lot chaos but seeing the customers happy and smiling is what really gets me through my day.
good,I simply bagged groceries and retrieved carts cleaned spills and restocked items that were left behind. My co-workers were curteous and the managers respectful.
good,"It was a Good Place to work, only exception felt like management treated you like a robot with no feelings...when my grandpa Died it seemed hey didn't care all they wanted for me was to come to work and act like nothing had happen"
good,Krogers was a really good job to work at. Great employees and great conversations. The only complaint I have was the pay. Very flexible hours and vacation time.
good,"My training went smoothly, very friendly environment, good pay, ability to work towards retirement plans and benefits, workers not only feel valued but are rewarded at times as well."
good,Typical day at work would be helping customers and cleaning up around my area. I've learned that the customers are always right and to make sure they leave happy. Management is nice and they always listen to me when i have an issue. I love the people I work with and don't have a problem with anyone. I'd say the hardest part would be when a customer isn't very happy and I can't help them with what they want.The best part about my job is working with great employees and being able to interact with the customers.
good,"i was a worker of foodsco for several years.but that several years i didn't even notice it that it was that long.because i enjoy working at this company.i was in the states all alone, by my self  no relatives to lean on.but foodsco offers me not only a family but more than a family....so by the time i lift and yrs past the only thing i can do right now is to bring back the memories i have when i was working in this company.....if i can only turn back time and work again at this company..how i wish i could"
good,"Great environment, family oriented, and always something new to do. The retail life you never finish but find a great spot to leave your department in the hands of your team."
good,My overall review of Krogers stores is that it is a very friendly environment to shop and to work. During my time there I had a very enjoyable experience.
good,"Alot of people complain about work life balance, but those people just want weekends off. Being off on a Monday is fantastic. Not as many people running around town. You will have good and bad managers, but mostly good if you work with them. Health insurance is fantastic for what's out there if you make full time. I pay only $30 a week for my wife, kids and I. And it's blue Cross not scamcare or whatever. Understand that you are there to do your job and what your told and you will have little stress. I've been with the company over 9 years and worked in almost every dept. If you have the drive and ambition you can move up to dept manager in as little as 4 years or less making $18 an hour or more with no college required. It's stressful at times, but every job is. Walk in with an attitude that no one will out work me and you will go far."

good,working at Marianos was a great experience for myself. I learned to work with a team and to manage my time with the tasks at the bakery. The management was great and every manager I had was willing to work and train me to be the best employer. The most enjoyable part of working at Marianos has to be the people that I met while there. Working at Marianos has to be one of the best experiences that I have had working.
good,"Mariano's would always be busy , however; it was a fun job. Employees were so friendly and we were all like family. We had Employee appreciation day once a month and the managers would have free food for us in our break room. They always complimented us on our work. Every time I walked into Mariano's my employees would all be smiling and so will the customers."
good,"Kroger typically has the manning needed to cover customer needs. Management is available to help when needed. Great benefits and discounts. Some days can be busy, but it's mostly balanced."

good,"The duties of my job at Kroger were fairly organized and set in an orderly fashion.  It is a great place to work and develop a strong work ethic, as well as to communicate with customers and coworkers.  It is a great place to work for a first-time job and the break and lunch periods are very reasonable.  The hardest part of my job would probably dealing with customers that, at times, would appear as being rude or having an attitude, but that doesn't happen often and is very manageable.

good,I enjoyed working here as a teenager. It worked well with my school hours and the pay wasn't bad for one of my first jobs. I worked three departments and cashiering was probably my favorite.
good,"my typical day at work was like , I would clock in and ask my manager which cash register I would be working at.

good,Same as previous review of the Kroger Company as it explains my work experience with Kroger. I truly cannot complain about my experience with Kroger
good,"I loved this job as well, growing up in the restaurant business, since my family had 6 restaurants, I had the chance in learning to prep food, take inventory and keep shelves stock with fresh fish. I also had the chance to sample all types of fish, grilled, fried and bake, to let customers know how the food was, and the best way to prepare meals. I was hired as a meat clerk, and then got the chance to move up from meat department after a few months to Head Seafood Clerk, learning about the difference between male and female lobster, and learning where most fishes come from."
good,"A typical day at work was quite fun, great hours, i learned how to communicate well with people, and I worked with great people. The hardest part of this job was the cold, since I worked in the dairy department, I was in the freezer most of the shift, the easiest was the customer service.

good,"Kroger was a great learning experience for me. I learned so much in such a short amount a time. Ultimately, Kroger helped me become a better person."
good,Im giving a 5 star review cuz when i worked there the environment was amazing. The vibes were positive and the employees were amazing until the manager left and was replaced with douchebag that judged everyone based on race
good,"I Loved this job, it was my second real job and it paid well enough for me to buy my college books for the semester and have money left over. Each day I would come into work and tend to customers with their deli needs, or preparing party trays, or stocking the shelves. I learned how to become a morning person, having to work 6am to 2 pm everyday. Overall my experience was great. Most of my coworkers were college students so we all got along perfectly."

good,Very easy going workplace. Wonderful managers who will help if needed and encourage productivity. Every co-worker gets the job done and done correctly. Its an environment that feels friendly enough to ask questions.
good,"Kroger was like a second home to me.  Not all customers were pleasant, but I always tried my best to make them feel comfortable and answer their questions to the best of my ability.  I started out as a cashier in 2009 and by the beginning of 2010 I was promoted to assistant manager of a department.  My coworkers were great people and we all worked as a team.  The hardest part of my job would have to be having to let people go when they didn't do their jobs or for whatever reason."
good,working for this company was a good. I learned many things about how the company works and how they liked things done in a professional way. I also gained amazing people skills im not shy at all anymore.
good,"I started after graduating high school, worked 14 yrs, but wasn't making the money coal mines made,, Had alot of fun working with customer good and bad....Sometimes wished I had stayed and went into Mangement...."
good,"I have only worked at Kroger for almost a year but I feel like I fit right in. They accepted me when I first started and didn't hesitate to help me learn. A typical day at work is: clock in, get told what register to get on, and scan away! We help customers with anything they need whether it's unloading their carts or finding an item. I have learned to open up to strange people and to accept them and be grateful towards them. The management at Kroger is good, some sour apples, but still good. My co-workers are the best part of clocking in. Everyone saying hi and greeting you, it feels fantastic to be wanted. The hardest part of my job is when a customer is just trying to find something to ruin your day. You learn to get over this. The most enjoyable part is to get people checked out as quickly as possible so they have more time in their days to spend not standing in line at a grocery store."
good,things on a day to day basis are smooth and fun. most management is understanding and flexible with your work schedule. you have comparable benefits and a good discount threw out the store on most items you would buy. co-workers are fun and help each other out to get things done in a timely manner.
good,A typical work day at Kroger was you came and clocked in. Next you would start at your station and start bagging as soon as customer came in. I would bagged their groceries and put their groceries in the grocery carts and sometimes take it to their cars. Then the managers or co workers would tell me to go and collect the grocery carts for 30 minutes and after I get done with that. I would come back and bagged for another hour and then the manager would tell me to cleaned the bathrooms and sweep the floors. From this job Iearned about initiative and about customer service. The management was ok. They always helped me when I needed it. The coworkers were really nice and always were there when I need assistance. I don't think it was a hard part to this job. The most enjoyable part was helping the customer bag their groceries because I enjoy helping people and I think it helped with customer service.
good,"I would count cash and total checks for Brinks early, answer phones when necessary, helped customers find the products they needed, help service deli or bakery when ever needed. Satisfaction always came when a customer was happy for the service provided. The hardest part was when I had very little to do."
good,A very professional environment to work and learn. Lots of interaction with customers and great opportunities to counsel and educate patients.
good,like training and reaching goal. we made work fun while we met company goals.  Love seeing those loyal everyday customers and you already know what they want before they order
good,"Cashiering, greeting different or the same customers with kindness and respect. Sometimes you'll be assigned to another job if the store is very busy. Stocking sharing stories with your co-worker to make time go by a little faster."
good,Great place to wok. Great place to cease opportunity for growth. Kroger offers training and value to each of their associates
good,"Working for Kroger is like working with your family. Everyone at my store was very excited to come to work. Front end associates were, for the most part, high-school aged. They would enjoy talking to each other, getting to know customers, and chatting with regulars. Each department worked together. It taught me how to make customers happiest. "
good,Working at Krogers was very much like working with family. Everybody there was very nice and genuinely cared about you. The store itself was incredible with being clean and just having what you needed.

good,During my time at Kroger I appreciated the opportunity to work with the individuals of the company. I enjoyed the challenges of work and also enjoyed the advancements I made during my time there.
good,"Everyday life at Kroger was a little slow and boring at times but also fast paced and stressful at other times. I learned that working with costumers all day can get stressful but if you be patient and treat them right they usually wont give you any hassle. The management there was well trained and professional. My coworkers were nice and friendly and were't afraid to have fun sometimes. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep everything organized and not to get flustered on the stressful, busy days. The most enjoyable part was when you didn't have too busy of a day you could relax and really spend time and enjoy interacting with each costumer, and also knowing that they are leaving happy and satisfied."
good,"Kroger is a great place to work, especially for your first time job. you learn customer service and there is always room for advancement. they always encourage their employees to move up as well."
good,"the job is  a great job and you stay on your feet which is a good thing because it not only helps you stay productive but it also help you stay active and lose weight which is a great thing especially for me. the most enjoyable part of the job is the filling you get when you are working your not only working but your also helping the factor get there products out for the customers. The hardest thing of the job well to me, is making sure that you don't miss count or mess up but I have learned that if you focus and really pay attention to the numbers and how to count by fives or 2's you will do just fine and it makes not only the job better but it makes our percent or rate go up. im a very hard worker and when I worked at Peyton's I loved it because the facility and the supervisors made sure that you was on top of your work and made sure that you was understanding everything and if you needed help with certain loop."
good,Kroger was one of my first jobs in life and they really helped me to learn a lot about people and I also have some life long friends that I became friends with when i worked at Kroger.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Kroger. My co-workers welcomed me with open arms. They also worked well around my school schedule. Kroger was always busy. There was never a dull day working there. When I first started, the only hardest part of the job was remembering all of the produce codes but I managed to do so."
good,Stellar customer service professional's building rapport with patients while dispensing and distributing pharmaceuticals. Teamwork was never an issue and I thoroughly enjoyed my position and my co-workers.
good,I loved working here. I had to quit because i moved for school. I love working in a place with friendly coworkers and managers.
good,I enjoyed the fast pace work and customer interaction. I moved up fast and advanced quickly. I learned a lot about cash handling and customer service.
good,"A typical work doy for me here is spent mostly on a computer at my desk trouble shooting and ultimately making a bad situation good for our stores.  I've learned that making a ton of money isn't as important as working in a job you enjoy.  Managemnet is for the most part great I get along with all levels of management very well and all are approachable.  The hardest part of my job can be the days where it feels like there is not enough time in the day to get everything resolved, but it always does.  The most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers, I am very lucky to have such a smart, fun loving group of people surrounding me every day."
good,"It was a great workplace for my first job. Fun and exciting. Lots of friendly people, two 15 minute breaks and love i working there"
good,Great Company to work for as a pharmacist! Pharmacies are busy in terms of work load but Pharmacist at Fred Meyer has  good amount of help with trained pharmacy technicians and cashiers who provide excellent customer service to the customers compared to some other retail pharmacy chains. Pharmacist has time to provide clinical services and help problem-solve patient issues.  Compensation/ benefits are awesome.
good,Absolutely LOVED my job at Kroger. It was okay pay with great benefits. Made tons of friends that I still keep in contact with today. I highly suggest working for Kroger.
good,"Loved working here. Due to a difficult pregnancy couldn't continue working here. but it was nice. The employees, the co workers, the atmosphere, the bloody piano. It was awesome."

good,"Working at Krogers, I was a courtesy clerk, bagging, receiving carts, cleaning bathrooms, assissting  cashiers and managers. it is a really hard job, but i loved the job because the Mangers were willing to work with you, availability was a big thing they would work with you on and the customers were amazing to meet."
good,"A typical day at work would be helping customers and keeping the store a safe and clean place for employees and shoppers. I learned how to deal with customers and communicate effectively with co-workers. The hardest part of this job is helping angry customers, the most enjoyable part is knowing I'm making a contribution to my community."
good,"Work with customer for money and product transactions. "
good,This was a really great store it was small store but had that big store feel to it. Was too crowded at times the customers were always polite and kind.
good,I used to bag groceries at this place for about 9 months before being transferred to stock. I loved working midnights and having a blast talking to my co-workers while still getting work done. It did take a toll on me after a while which made me look for a different job with a better schedule.
good,I learned more from the people I worked with at Fed Meyer and from Kroger/ Fred Meyer Culture than I can begin to describe!
good,"This is a place that is excellent for your first job. "
good,"I work in the Fuel Center at Kroger. My typical day is cleaning pumps, conditioning, helping customers, stocking, and running the cash register. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people that I work with. The hardest part of the job would be the program that we do stocking through. Its called mimik and it always gives us problems. Management isn't too bad."
good,"Overall I liked working there. The management were very helpful and friendly. The hours were great, just didn't like working overnight because I didn't feel safe."
good,A great place to work the staff is very welcoming and easy to get along with. They offer several opportunities to move up in the company.
good,"The Kroger Company is a great company to work for. It is a fast past work environment on most days. Some of the  things that you can learn is time management skills. Another skill that you learn is problem solving I am really good at problem solving since I work at the customer service desk. So I have to help the customers get their problems resolved and the employees also."
good,Fun and exciting job that lets you learn from your customers and associates on a daily basis. Management plays a large role in excellent customer service as well as peer training and volume control.
good,Awesome support both in personal and business.  There is always someone willing to help make things right for the customers as well as the Kroger family of people
good,"The working environment was great! My co-workers were friendly, and I loved my job. The only complaint I had about working here would be that management kept hiring new people in my department when my co-workers and I were already requesting more hours. Aside from a few communication problems between management and store associates, it was a fun place to work with really friendly people."
good,"Days at work are the same, same people, same items, same co-workers, most likely the same schedule too. Management is up-beat and great to get along with. co-workers are relaxed and are team oriented people."
good,"Kroger company provides great working environment. The work is easy; I need to break down orders and stock them on the shelves, and then organize the shelves and clean my work area."
good,"I learned how to check and learned how to work at a fast pace, I greeted customers nicely and with a smile"
good,"This was my first job.  The managers and employees are so friendly! It's not hard to move up in the company.  I got my first promotion in about 3 months!! It's a great job if you love people.  The hardest part of the job would probably be dealing with rude customers sometimes,  however, the managers step in when things are to hard for you so there's not much stress on you!"

good,"My career is always teaching me new and effective ways of dealing with others on a day to day basis. There is always ways to impove yourself when it comes to dealing with customers, co workers and in general how you carrie yourself. I have learned so much I do not even know where to start. I have worked from the bottom to the top and that has given me a realistic perspective of  the job expectations and the employees as well. I have learned to be organized, the importance of completing projects on time. Initiating pilot programs and job fairs. Interviewing and Hiring is a comon weekly task wich I actually loved. I  Have been successful in developing  positive, energetic & often times sensitive communications with coworkers and staff. The hardest part of the job would be even after using all the recsources available to me sometimes it would not be enough to satisfie the customer or employee. Even though this happened rarely it did not sit well with me. Having the opportunity to hand pick employees at my discretion, weeding out the good from the bad and coming out on the winning end is always my goal. I excel when I have many things to do, the more responsability the better I am. My ablity to accomplish the most detailed and sensitive activity proved to be of  proffesional leadership quality. It was a challenge I take on with pride. This is the most gratifiying to me and I am excited to learn more."
good,"I enjoyed the very short time I worked at Ralph's. They were good to me from the start, and didn't single me out when I told them I was leaving. I really appreciate everything the managers did for me."

good,Very nice place to work. The company is very willing to work with your schedule
good,I learned how to help serve people on a daily basis . My co-workers were indeed fun and helpful . The most enjoyable part of the job was going to work everyday . The hardest part was leaving when it was time to clock out

good,"I owe a great deal to the Kroger Corporation. They were opening a new pharmacy in their store in Lewisburg, WV.  I had absolutely NO pharmacy experience, and they took a chance to me to train me to be a pharmacy technician.  I went on to become nationally certified thanks to the wonderful Pharmacists at Kroger. The ONLY reason I left was because the store was bringing in new management and I had an opportunity to work in my home town (Alderson) versus commuting to Lewisburg, about 17 miles away."
good,I loved working here I earned a lot of hours and overtime and had the opportunity too open and close the fuel station and be one the first people to be trained at the grand opening of the fuel station.
good,"Workday-"
good,"A typical day can consist of quality control, inventory management, ordering inventory, and customer service.  You are able to acquire and build a working knowledge of quality control, inventory management, and great customer service. Management and coworkers are friendly and willing to help should you need assistance. The hardest part of the job can be the workload during the holidays, which see a substantial increase in business.

good,Night stocker.. learned to work with the people that were around me. No hard part to the job. working at night (at that time.) was enjoyable to me!
good,I learned many things working at Kroger whether it be to put in different codes or taking all forms of payment. I learned a lot of self suficiency and values to keep with me as I move on to other jobs. I learned how to offer the best customer service possible. The hardest part of the job would have been when it was very busy and not enough people working. It could be stressful but it was managable when you just take a deep breathe and relax.

The best part about working for Kroger is they make you feel like family, like you belong and you have a purpose.

good,Kroger is a very loving and fun workplace. You’re not supposed to have fun at work but I never go in dreading to talk to anyone. You have to stay on your toes though. If the store gets busy you can’t disppear and the managers do not put up with calling off. Always come to work when you have to and do your job to the best of your ability and it will be the best work place.
good,this place i came in to it as a regular grocery clerk and with in three months time i was one of the lead managers at night. just show up on time and be prepared to work hard.

good,"I applied to work in the bakery, but I accepted a position at the fuel station where I was taught by several of my coworkers on how to operate the technology, register, and other duties. It was fun working there. Sometimes traffic picked up and it was busy (i.e. when everyone gets off of work), but otherwise the pace was rather relaxed. Duties included opening/closing depending on your shift, but otherwise you'd simply make sure the station is clean, mop up spills, report if a machine is out of order, and of course, ring up pumps and let people get their gas/products if they want to buy something."
good,Kroger is a great company for a first job. They give employees a range of opportunities for promotion and are considerate of personal lives outside the company. Some days can seem harder than others but that is the nature of demand. Other days are a breeze and can feel like no work at all. Management varies from strict to understanding but not once could I remember not being treated as a person. The managers were simply honest people doing their best to keep the company prospering while also keeping their employees happy.
good,the employers expect their employees to work hard to the best of their ability everyday when they show up to their shifts. It is a fast paced job but when they have their occasional slow down times the employees are expected to continue to stay busy.
good,"I enjoyed working for the Kroger stores! Great discounts, great benefits, paid time off, free products and also great experiences! I truly enjoyed the time spent there!"

YES, it pays the bare minimum to live off of but i wouldn't have had it any other way. Working there didn't feel like working with employees, it felt like i was working with my family. I have never had such a bond with so many people at once. Management never felt like bosses to us, or to me at least, they acted like they were at the very same level but everyone knew we needed to respect them no matter what.

The best part of the job was being able to help customers. At this job I learned what a great work ethic really is. Management Gets better over time. The newer management is the least understanding they are. They tend to forget the difficulties in performing a wide variety of tasks in a certain amount of time with a limited experience. Corporate is extremely critical which can dissuade some but it is constructive criticism that provides progress. The hardest part of the job would be getting list of specific tasks done whilst assisting a large amount of customers and but helping customers is still the best part of the job.

good,Good part time place to work when retired.  24 hours open represents a problem with staffing.  High turn over in staff.  time is compressed for putting out products.
good,The jobs I held were very busy and challenging. I liked both of these aspects.  The management was great to work with and they treat all employees with respect.  The hardest part is that every day was different (which I liked).

good,Working for Kroger has had its ups and downs like any other place but with Kroger if you want to learn and can show you can retain what you have learned then there is a very strong chance you will be considered for a step up in the company. My time with them has been really great I have learned a lot and met a lot of very warm and kind people. Everyday is a challenge but to me I think that's how every day should be. My boss since I have moved over to nights has been the best I have ever had. I tell my friend and family and strangers that if they are looking for a job why not give Kroger a chance. While I started out at part time I still worked a lot because if you work hard and they see your a good employee then the rewards can be awesome

We also as a courtesy clerk would sweep, and do parking lot. We take turns doing sweep and parking lot, we want to be fair with everyone by doing the same job all together. I've learned that their are a lot of discounted items on food. Management is good as well which they could help you on anything and make you understand. Workplace culture of course we discriminate here which is very nice. Hardest part of the job is asking a question to a customer about finding an item and you yourself can't find it either.

good,"A typical work day consists of helping, communicating, coaching, assisting store Management and Associates in processes of facility, and dispatching Tecnicians for any store  repairs necessary to keep the stores running efficiently.  I've learned that great customer service uplifts spirits of Management, Associates, and Technicians to form a family oriented and friendly workplace. The Kroger culture enriches lives with diversity,  integrity, fairness, dignity, and respect to all.   The toughest part of the job is definitely dealing with certain clients. When they give us a hard time, it is hard to do our job. On the other hand, when you get a really great client, it is probably the most rewarding and simplest part of the work. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with.  My co-workers are caring and helpful.  We all work together."

good,Working at Baker's is something different. Helping the customers and my co workers out is a new life experience for me. Getting to know everyone is a very quick processes.
good,"Duties included ringing up customer orders and offering assistance to load them into their vehicle.  This was my first cashier job, so I really started to learn how to use a register and problem solve any pricing issues.  The working culture was fairly nice as I got to work inside and on a computer, but could be stagnant at times if business was slow.  The hardest part of the job was working quickly to ring up orders and bag groceries if business was high (major holidays or popular sporting events).  My favorite aspect of the job working with a computer, solving any pricing issues, and remembering various product codes for non-scanned items."
good,All managers worked with employees. Employees got along. Job was enjoyable and fun. Union allows job security. Very family orientated and very understanding.

The managers were so friendly and helped if you were short handed or if you got slammed out of no where and needed some extra hands. If something were to go wrong they were on top of it right away. Everyday you came in you felt like you were at your second home, and you learned new things everyday, you hardly done the same thing everyday. I can say that Kroger is family to me and the people i worked with made my days there better and most of the customers were so friendly. I would have to say the hardest part of the job would've been working on something new and being afraid of making a mistake or messing it up since I was learning a new task, I always want my work to be perfect and tip top shape. The most enjoyable part of the job was making our customers happy and seeing them come in and enjoy there time when they come in, you want to make there experience more enjoyable than what ever problems they are going through.

The management at Kroger is nothing short of excellent. They run the store smoothly and make sure everything is in its proper place.

My daily tasks consisted of cashiering and providing exceptional customer service. I did work in a fasted pace environment. The leadership was amazing. They always found ways to help the workers improve. We attending meetings just so that we would become better at providing exceptional customer service. Everyday was different. You never know what kind of person is going to come through your line, which was the fun part. We always stayed busy so you could only complain that it's too busy.

I have learned so much from working here, like decorating cakes, about baking and proofing bread, and frying donuts, and the importance of doing all the properly. I have amazing co-workers, they always make work fun, and show that they actually care about me. The hardest part of the job would have to be the customers sometimes. This being my first job in the food/ grocery business, I wasn't really sure what to expect working with customers. Most of them are very friendly, but there are some people that are very rude, and harsh."

I learned a lot about money handling, customer service, communication, and how to become involved in the workplace. Management took care of every issue in a timely manner and worked hands on to promote the company at every level. The coworkers were hard working and made the job fun.

good,Learned all about customer service and applying people skills to my everyday life. Management was great! They always made sure to check up on each employee to make sure they were doing okay. Management also made each employee feel like they were being appreciated and awarded for their hard work.
good,I learned how to stay composed in stressful situations and how to work with costumers of all kinds such as unruly or nice. I would do all the invoice such as all the trucks and product that came in and handled all the money transactions. I also helped my employees break down product. I am all about being a team player and I made sure as the leader to keep my team working and consistency and I always took responsibility for my team. The hardest part was the labor having to move anything from 50 to 100 pounds all day everyday. The most I enjoyed was my employees and the great work environment the warehouse provided.

good,"A typical day at work was hard working at krogers. Not because the job was hard, because they judged everything about people. It was basically like highschool, they had people that was over the age of 20 acting like they were 10 years old."
good,"There's always something to do, and even though I was given Level 3-4 work as a Level 1, I enjoyed it thoroughly. From unloading trucks, to distributing boxes into aisles and restocking shelves, there is plenty of work to be done. Understanding managers and friendly co-workers can be found here. Even though taking on aisles with huge loads was difficult to finish within 2 or 3 hours, anyone can buckle down and do it. Working as an individual and as a team all at the same time is the best part."

I was taught how to approach customers the right and wrong way, I was taught to handle things with care, I learned to be alert and always on time. Management is always on the look out for everyone of their employees. They did a great job at tending to their customers and their employees, lazy was never in their vocabulary and if so, it was never a good outcome. My Co-workers are friendly, hard working people, they do their job completely they do not get lazy or behind no matter how hard the work got, we pushed through. The hardest part of my job was when I had to handle rude, customers. They tend to take advantage of people in the grocery business, they cross a lot of boundaries but I had a heart for people so I was able to handle the people well enough, good or bad attitude towards me."
good,"Every day consisted of executing a well organized routine. Walk in, check the inventory, cycle out-dated inventory with fresh counter-parts, and consolidate. Naturally, as the day progressed for associates, responsibilities such as customer service, and workplace upkeep presented themselves and where taken care of accordingly. "
good,Great and happy people to work with. Will help you out with literally anything! Awesome scheduling due to the fact I'm a student.

good,Productive workplace with friendly employees and management. Management treats employees fairly. The manner in which employees received overtime was very beneficial as getting 40 hours of work each week was difficult.
good,"Kroger is one of the best companies I have ever worked for. I advanced from working on the floor, to price changer, then auditor within four months. I was making $1.35 more in four months. The employee's were happy, and it was one of the most positive company's culturally. I had a great time on this job, and they offer benefits, plus 401k. Great place to work."

My co-workers all were super patient during my training, and made sure i was up to speed. All of them were super helpful, and considerate. I think the hardest part of my employment at Kroger was retrieving carts from the parking lot. But I was told to never try and take more than I could handle at a time, and they allowed me enough time to work at a decent pace to prevent injury. The most enjoyable part of my employment at Kroger was knowing I could get along with all my managers and co-workers, and almost all of the friendly customers."
good,"Moving at a fast paced, and occasionally multitasking is a typical workday. You learn to deal with hundreds of different personalities per day. The management is very supportive and really do care, and is available anytime you need them. The job is very fast paced so I would say that we could have more breaks through out a work day, but overall the job itself is great. Being out there on the sales floor assisting customers is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,A great place to work. Very positive and upbeat management. I always looked forward to going in to work. There's always a warmth and a family presence with the staff.

good,"I loved working for this company.  Everyday as I pulled up in my car I looked at the front doors and realized that dreams do come true.  I wore my uniform proudly and looked forward to work everyday I was scheduled.  I got really excited when I got called in because it gave me another opportunity to make customers leave highly satisfied.  Since being fired I have built a shrine in my living room with my employee uniform and other Kroger propaganda.  The management is really awesome and seem very interested in you as a person.  Co-workers are some of the most intelligent people in the grocery store business.  My only dream is that Kroger gives me one more shot at being a shining star in the retail business.  The only other job that was better then Kroger was working in the kitchen at the Illinois River Correctional Facility in Canton, IL while I was incarcerated.  Peace Out!"

good,"I learned skills like being able to multi-task very easily. Some might think that being a cashier, bagger and doing stock isn't hard work. Well it is but guess that was the best part. The harder I worked the better I was at being able to do more things at once while still being able to concentrate on each thing precisely."
good,The company is great. Training for newcomers has to be more in depth; lack of it exposes a big liability to the company. Nice little incentives every six months.

good,"Working at Kroger is easy. My job is cashiering. I welcome customers, ring them up, memorize product codes, check them out and tell them to have a good rest of there day. This is a people business. You interact with customers 24/7. Some are sweet and kind. Others tend to be rude and disrespectful but will need to grin and bare it most of the time. And then there are customers who are just happy and funny and make you laugh. When you meet co-workers it can make working fun too. They also have very flexible hours."
good,Kroger offers employees a well-structured workplace experience with decent compensation and showcases a fun staff.
good,"I spent most of my time at Kroger clearing carts from a parking lot. In Atlanta, especially during the summer, that's not an easy task. I was in pretty good shape, though, saved me from having to get a gym membership. I loved my coworkers, and the management was always super helpful. I would definitely recommend this company."
good,"A typical day you assist customers anyway that you can, ring out their groceries, bag them, sometimes even help them out to their car. Management always has a listening ear.

Unloading the pallets wasn't too bad. I loved working in the cooler. It was always too warm in the store, but in the cooler, and the produce department, it was much colder. Upper management didn't bother the produce department. We kept our sales high, and shrink low, so they focused their attention elsewhere. The produce management was also very laid back. We always had stuff to do, but we were never rushed like the cashiers up front. The co-workers were pretty good about allocating work so that not one person got stuck with everything.

I also developed people akills when it came to supervising 1-3 backup associates as well as the outside vendors when they came in to check on their products. It was also during these latter years that I returned to school and earned my Associate of Arts degree before I left the grocery business for a couple years to work at UPS and returned in 2007 due to lack of full-time opporutinities at UPS."

good,"Kroger is a very good company that is well run from the top to the bottom.  I was well informed on my responsibilities before starting and was given the necessary training to seamlessly transition into the workflow.  A typical work day involves me helping the pharmacists in typing up scripts, putting away orders, releasing medications to patients, counting pills and pushing scripts to the pharmacist for verification.   The pharmacists had an excellent system in which all the technician rotate to different positions in the workflow.  I was fortunate to work with arguably the best group of pharmacist I have ever encountered and a very competent set of technicians who loved their job.  I learned a lot about dealing with insurance companies, distressed patients and working in a fast paced setting.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with adjudications on the first of new cycle when insurance companies change the formulary and copays.  However, nothing beats the feeling of seeing the face of patient after helping them get their medication on time.  Overall I enjoyed my experience at Kroger and would definitely recommend it to family and friends."

The hardest part of my job is making sure that everything in the pharmacy runs smoothly while unexpected events and problems can occur at any second.

good,"From what I recall, a typical day working at Kroger as a Bagger/Part Time Associate would include bagging groceries and other items into bags, oftentimes doing carry-outs for customers who are unable to place their order inside their vehicles outside, and some slight janitorial work. Also, you would have to maintain a positive attitude and outlook for the customer. If the customer had a bad shopping experience, such as not being able to find a particular item, it is your job as a Bagger (as well as the Cashier's) to make sure their last five minutes of being at your store is the most positive, warm, and inviting. I learned a lot working at my store and they (manager/supervisors) were so patient with me while I was training."

If so then I immediately call other co-workers to see if that shift can be filed (this also happens all through out my shift). Next I look to see if the cashier or baggers is due for a break / lunch. If so my responsibility is to send them when it is appropriate. If not, I then walk around the store with a shopping cart to gather items on the shelf that are ""misplaced"" and put them back as I go. While working through all of my breaks and lunches through-out my shift I have to make sure the registers have cash pick-ups. Which if it is starting to accumulate to much money or if it is running low then I do the necessary  adjustments to make sure the money till is just right. Also depending how busy it is I must send the right amount of people outside to push in carts. I keep an eye on how many shopping carts we have available for customers at all times. If the line at customer service is long ill jump on a register and help to get customers in and out with their needs fast and efficiently. The bathrooms must be checked off and signed every two hours. To keep away from complaints I will always check to see if it has been done and the cleaning taking care of. At the end of the day all misplaced items must be put away, all carts must be in, all break and lunches were taking care of, bathrooms are done, and I must count down all registers before leaving."

The job wasn't always easy and always fun but i made the best out of it! They worked with my school schedule until they got a new Customer Service Manager and he decided to cut my hours due to my limited availability.

good,"When Ralph's Grocery Company took over the HUGHES Market that I was stationed at, my workload changed a bit. I was the Midnight-8 am cashier, which included stocking designated aisles. I was also the person in charge of price changes on the floor level. Management was very detail oriented and getting acclimated to their way of doing things was made easy because of this. I was lucky that most of my co-workers stayed at the same location, as I considered them extended family (we were all at that location for many years). The hardest part of the job would have to be the ""graveyard"" hours, as I was not working those hours prior to Ralph's taking over. I enjoyed the fast paced atmosphere every night."

The day starts with the balancing and closing of the previous days books, organizing breaks and lunches for the front end employees, writing drafts, making deposits, and dealing with daily customer service duties. The management was very easy to get along with and always promoted high employee morale. My co-workers were some of the best co-workers that I have ever worked with. The hardest part of the job was going home and leaving work at work. Being a department head meant many phone calls at home after hours with problems that would arise in the office. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the public. I genuinely enjoy working with the public and helping to meet their needs."
good,"A typical day at work went by fast, it was a fun place to work. Working at Kroger has taught me how to take control of a bad situation.

I learned great customer service and how to engage in conversation with complete strangers in an appropriate way. My co-workers were great. They helped me with the job and also encouraged me when things got a little difficult. The hardest part of the job was walking customers out to their vehicles when the weather conditions changed. The most enjoyable part of the job was engaging with customers all throughout the day, which made the job fun."

I made money orders, cashed checks, checked vendors and ran the express check out.  Management did not have to worry about the front end when I worked, because I had it under control. I worked well with my co-workers, we had no problems. The hardest part about my job was getting robbed and having a gun held to my head and being pointed at me. But otherwise I loved my job. I lived so close to the store I worked at until when something went wrong at the store, manager had them to call me to take care of it."

good,"I was a Lead Baker for 17 plus years.  It was the best place to work, and have children.  The management allowed employees in the bakery department to alter the schedule due to children illness and events.  I loved working there and having the ability to be creative and flexibility.  The company went to a solid structure and eliminated the flexibility.  It is still a great company for many employees that love what they offer."

good,"It was a great experience i started as a bagger and ended as a grocery clerk. a typical day starts with me putting away stock and ends with me on a register most nights, but when i wasn't i faced items and cleaned up as much as i could. My co-workers were wonderful, i actually still talk to a lot of them. The most enjoyable part of working there would probably be the holidays, because you didnt have to dress in uniform and it was a more relaxed environment"

good,"From the time I clock in and clock out I strive to work my hardest. I have the position of taking care of the store by picking up trash, emptying out the trash cans, collecting carts and baskets, handling customer service and always have a positive attitude. My managers and co-workers always make my day, they are my motivation to keep us as a team and make customers satisfied. The hardest part of the job has to be not being able to make a customer fully satisfied, due to an item they are looking for and we don't carry anymore or overall they feel could have better customer service. But at the end of the day I always enjoy my position and the area I work for."

Management made sure we always knew what to expect as the day went on and made sure we were well informed.  My co-workers were the best part of the day because we could easily team up and achieve our tasks at-hand.  And as for most jobs, the hardest part seems to be when it comes down to crunch-time: if your CEO is coming into town, we all have to raise the bar, but otherwise the job was well worth the time spent in order to go to school and live a comfortable life outside."
