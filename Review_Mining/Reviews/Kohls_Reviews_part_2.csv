good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Great job to have a laugh while getting the job done. Also, all facets of people work there and you become apart of a team right away. Collaboration and division of labor is perfect. Thanks for the opportunuty"
good,"Reapplied there because I did enjoy it there but wasnt hired due to prior employment attendance issues."
good,N/A I do not have many memories of my experience at kohls it has been quite a while.  I do remember having to wake up at 3:30 AM to get to work because someone had the idea to unload the truck at 4:30 in the morning. It took a couple months for them to realize that was a bad idea
good,"I worked here seasonally and it was really fun. It’s fast paced, but that doesn’t mean it’s a miserable work experience. There’s always something to do."
good,"I've worked at Kohls on a part-time basis  for approximately 5 years, and I still look forward to going to work there.  Kohls hires good people and most of their managers demonstrate respect towards their employees.  Kohls offers benefits to their full-time staff and job security, which may explain why there are many long-term employees there.  The staff is very supportive of each other, including the management team.  I still enjoy working there.  The environment is both fast paced and relaxed.  "
good,"Pretty easy, laid back job. Management was decent. My first day of work after training was Black Friday which got me used cashiering fast, the rest of the time was usually pretty slow. The worst part was rude customers and some employees, most of the workers were fine though."
good,"I like working with my employees, its a great team. Management sometimes needs improvement, but when working with the right team its enjoyable.  Its a fast paste store, so your always on the go and have projects to work on."
good,I loved working here the staff is awesome. The only thing that turned me off was all the things they sold me on as far as benefits changed as soon as I was a yr in. That disappointed me greatly then they capped hours for employees who weren’t full time just so you couldn’t qualify for most benefits. It made me feel some kind of way. I couldn’t get full time hours anymore so my money was limited. That’s when I knew I had to move on.
good,"I worked early shifts so it was a bit exhausting, but it was a good place to work regardless. I was able to apply myself and got some good deals on clothing with the associate's discount."
good,"I have no complaints, I knew what my job was and I did it. I was encouraged to do my job and learn other jobs to increase my wages. I was able to learn truck unload, floor assoc work and customer service as well as cashiering. "
good,It wasn't hard or anything the pay was decent at $9/hr considering for the most part I just folded clothes and stood at the register. The biggest complaint I have is that the company wants you to sell their horrible credit cards and the customers get visibly annoyed with this as well but you have to ask 3 times which often times leaves you with a frustrated customer by the time you're done
good,"Easy company to work for, great atmosphere, I'd definitely recommend Kohl's. employers were kind, nice, understanding, very fair when scheduling everyone."
good,When I first went in I started doing my work.I all ready know how to do the work they give me.No the work was easy.I really enjoy working there I got along with every body.I  just was get frustrated because they wont me to do mens departed in which I know nothing about. But I try any.
good,Everyday management will meet with shifts and explain goals and new promotions.Communication is great! Who doesn't appreciate employee discounts right?If you like to shop and get great deals while providing that same experience to customers this job is for you!
good,Working at Kohl's is a good part-time job. The employees are all very friendly and the manager's care about your well-being. While the days can be long or difficult at the end of the shift it is a good place to work.
good,"Coworkers had a happy and welcoming culture.  Everyone did their part and if they didn't, they where informed on where they are falling short.  Management is understanding and works with us often.  Some policies of Kohl's is annoying, but you will begin to work around them."
good,"it was really fun and cultured and civilized people there. There was so many jobs, great expectations from others. It lived up to its name. All in all I left because of someone watching people on the camera for too long. I didn't want to have to deal with this back lash every day from then on. Knowing I was a great worker. It was a good placement though."
good,Customers service was a nice position. .Love the job and the co worker was nice and helpful. The mangers was nice always there when you need them. Nice place to work
good,"The people there are really supportive and work well together.  You will have slow days and busy days, just like any retail store. I’d say the most difficult part of the job was dealing with unhappy customers.  They can be quite rude at times, but you just have to let it go.  Cleaning up at the end of the day can be stressful, but I enjoyed working with my coworkers and my supervisors. It was a temporary job for me and I didn’t make much money, but it was the least stressful job I’ve ever had."
good,"The hours were good and flexible. The work is consistent, keeps busy and the coworkers are all very team cooperative. The management was really good. The department work was easy to get done."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I wore a suit to the interview so they hired me on the spot. I pretty much did everything around the store at one point with people calling sick and positions needing to be filled. OMNI in amazing imo. Just walk around scanning stuff and getting familiar with the store. if you're seasonal or part time you might get your hours cut and given to another associate, like me. This really happened. I didn't even want the hours really and was scheduled two extra days when other associates hours were cut.  Management was mix-matched between administration heads with different shifts but most were generally cool"
good,I enjoyed  my time working for this company. As I got promoted there was more and more responsibility which included taking a lot of my time and I worked well over 40 hours every week.
good,It was a nice workplace. The customers were hostile at times. No discrimination during the hiring process. Flexible hours and willingness to work with my schedule.
good,"Kohl's is your typical retail store with really nothing too special. All of the managers and area supervisors are all really nice people and the same can be said for your coworkers; as long as you stay out of their personal business. Advancement is possible as long as you put your grown up pants on and talk to them. Most of the time, management will point you in the right direction. In all, great first job and a great job for a high school student."
good,Kohls is an excellent company. As a member of the IT group there is ample opportunity to make a difference. There are some exceptional leaders sprinkled throughout the company.
good,"Not a bad place to work at. I did enjoy working there, got along with a lot of my coworker and management. The only things I didn't like was, when the truck went down to maybe 1 or 2 trucks a week, I couldn't advance or move to do something else within the store."
good,Over all it’s not a bad work environment just didn’t feel like I was compensated well enough. I was passed over for several full time positions and it was quite frustrating.
good,"I enjoyed the fast pace of this job, but the staff the company was not understanding when I needed to take time off to see my sick grandfather in November. Yes, it was part of the holiday season, but I tried to take the time off as early as I could so I wasn't cutting into the holiday season too much."
good,it was a good place to work. management was good and everyone was super helpful with helping with and questions. everyone works with a smile and everyone is always willing to work hard for the god team
good,"good working environment, understandable management. Good working experience as well as learning and training. Well set goals, that were almost always kept."
good,During my short time of working there it was definitely a warm and inviting work place. not only were my coworkers friendly but the customers treated us with respect.
good,"Relaxed work environment, advancing options available. Good company to work for overall, great for experience and as a career opportunity. Employee recognition and positive engagement at all times. Positive experience."
good,"Kohl's was overall okay to work at. Most customers were super friendly and understanding, but there was a good handful that got angry at you for their misinterpretation of the sale and coupons. Mangers were pretty good, but some managers went overboard when it came to credit and lines. Managers would sometimes get nasty with you if you have more than 1 or 2 people in the line, no matter how fast they saw you working. Credit is a big thing and can make the workplace stressful. It doesn't matter how hard you try, to some managers it isn't enough. Coworkers were overall good, but some had a sense of entitlement for one reason or another. I felt a little sense of favoritism in the place. Pay is okay."
good,A great place to work with great management and a fun work environment very flexible hours and minimum wage. Great part time Job and good customer service experience
good,Working at Kohls was very interesting the Salesfloor and being a cashier were probably the best parts. As a cashier if you sell customers credit cards you get “incentives”. That was always a plus.  They always catered on holidays. Everyone worked as a team. The worst part was probably working in the back doing Stock. The stocking manger was the worst she literally made me feel uncomfortable every time I did Stock.
good,A typical day as a sales associate includes providing customers with their needs and ensure each and everyone of them are satisfied. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the other sales associate.
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work, there are always new policies and procedures rolling out and new innovative business plans. The worst part is the low pay and slim chance to advance."
good,Manager was cool when I first started then it changed and somebody else took over then the hours went down and everybody got less hours as the days went by.
good,"Working at Kohls has been a pleasant experience. The team at Kohls is a strong one, and anyone who wants to work hard is welcome there. The managers are all approachable."
good,"Kohls was an excellent position during the holidays. The employee discounts are phenomenal. However, the store managers were obsessed with meeting the store credit goal. If you end up on the cash register, please note that it will require you to practically be a sales representative. If you aren't pushy enough to sell the cards, the job isn't for you."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"It's a nice place to work, but no one gets hired full-time. During December you can take on as many hours as you want, but they don't like excessive overtime. During the other eleven months hours are limited, you can work between 6-25 hours but never get a full 30. If you are semi-retired its a good place, but if you are working multiple jobs your availability could make it that you might not be on schedule every week."
good,"Like any retail store a lot of factors may apply differently. I was hired as a seasonal worker and worked most positions in the store in the few months I was there. Because of this I at times felt I was asked to jump around quickly and was never taught one position in full. Some things were never told to me which should have been and this affected me at times and I felt the blame was put on me. This is expected though as spending time on someone not expected to stay could be seen as a waste. The environment was fine, I made some friends amongst my coworkers and even managers. The pay was about minimum but expected."
good,"Their intership program in the stores was a good learning experience, but was a little unorganized.  Many days I would show up to work and was unsure of what I was supposed to be doing."
good,It was nice to work for Kohls but I wish that hours weren't cut so often....I realize it has to do with sales....so it's not the company's fault really....
good,I enjoyed working at Kohl's. When I expressed a desire to learn different departments in the store they tailored my work areas to learn more about the store and increase my chances of advancement in the store.
good,On a typical work day I keep busy and also pay attention to all the customers by greeting them and helping them have a great experience at our store. I learned over time that their age matters on how you assist them. The management is wonderful at kohl’s and they are like a big family their. The hardest part of the job is promoting the credit cards because some customers don’t want to here about the kohl’s charge cards  but I am one of the top ten for getting people to sign up. The most enjoyable part of my job as a cashier is getting to know customers and making sure they are happy with their shopping experience.
good,"Typical day was either cashiering, or working on the floor. The sucky part was getting scheduled at 3-4 in the morning during the holidays or being the only cashier early morning with a line full of people. Management was decent and my coworkers were very collaborative and fun. Overall good start if working part time."
good,This position can be very laborious at times. Very fast-paced. Helping customers find what they need and putting a smile on their face is a plus. The employee discounts are great perks and working/meeting new coworkers provide a good working environment.
good,"I was a seasonal employee but my time there I enjoyed, the management was great and there was always something to do so you always stayed busy! I would say this is a laid back place to work"
good,"A typical day at kohls consists of answering questions for customers about the availability of products and information on products. As a customer service associate, I handle returns and even exchanges. Most customer complaints come to customer service where they can usually be resolved or a manager is asked to intervene. Selling the kohls charge card to customers is important as well. We learn the benefits and can answer any questions the customer may have to insure that a kohls charge card is right for them. Store associates are friendly and helpful to each other and customers. The manager and assistant manager are understanding and are trying to get the best out of their team."
good,"I loved working at kohl’s, there’s a lot of opportunity to try working in different areas. The only problem is with some of the management, because no matter how much you do, it will never be good enough for them."
good,"> Dynamic company"
good,"Like most, if not all retail, it;s luck of the draw with managers. Some are good, some are bad, all create the environment you are expected to work in. The good ones I've had, helped me develop into the man i am today. I started working with Kohls in my early 20s and I loved it. It is a great company to work for when you are young and starting to learn responsibility and when in school."
good,"My experience at a Kohl's fulfillment center was very positive. "
good,"Working at Kohl's is a simple job with minimal training or education required. While the coworkers are mostly all nice, there are always a few that start gossip. The best way to deal with it is to just stay out of it."
good,The managers micromanaged the associates and made it hard to work there. Other than that is was a great company to work for and always a fun time with the others that worked there.
good,"I like working at kohl’s because of my coworkers and environment. It is actually walking distance from my house. And also the area it’s in, there’s food places close so I can go eat."
good,"It was a good seasonal position that payed every week. The pay was good, but the hours were disappointing. It is a relaxed environment with many helpful co-workers."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Loved the people, easy way to make friends, customers were great! Job was fairly easy, and a great place to work and pass time. Slow paced and easy to maintain"
good,"My time here was great, although management could do better. A lot of busy days, but the staff made them bearable. Everyone there was great, (some weren't) but it was enjoyable."
good,"I worked at Kohl's as a P.O.S. and Customer Service associate for little over a year until graduated college. The managers were all super friendly and motivating. The job can get hectic at times, especially around the holidays but it is not too bad. The pay was mediocre for the area I was in but they were great with working around my college schedule and days off. Though one major con was the amount of times the managers pushed credit card applications on all associates. If that isn't for you, I would not work P.O.S.!"
good,"A typical day at Kohls was to clock in and restock toys, clothing, and any decorations. Made sure to clean bathrooms if they were needed. Helped customers out if they were looking for something or if they wanted to return something, I had all the answers for the customers needs."
good,The biggest perk is all the discounts available to associates. It's also great that you are paid weekly. I don't enjoy how much you are pushed to get credit. You're expected to ask every customer that you interact with and it gets tiresome.
good,When I started working at kohls I did not expect everyone to be so nice. If I were to need help all I had to do was ask they were happy to help with a smile on their face.
good,Kohl's is a good place to work due to the fact that management doesn't have a problem letting employees get involved if they so initiative and ability. It's hard work but employees are recognized for their efforts.
good,"Nice place to work.  Other workers are friendly, manager's are friendly.  Hours are convenient for me. Training has been readily available and others are willing to help."
good,It is a busy busy work environment which makes the shift go by fast but at the end you are exhausted. Work culture is great and they try their best to make it a positive work environment. They also tend to hire from within when it comes to promotions. I move a lot due to being a military family. I tried to apply a few years later at another Kohls and they treated me like I was never part of the company actually offered me like $3 less than what I made before I left them. I worked for the company for 3 years so I couldn't believe they don't account for your previous work experience within their company.
good,Working there wasn't the best and wasn't the worst. It's exactly what you would expect from a retail job. Weekends are a must if you're going to work there
good,I worked at the one in Christiansburg and it was AMAZING. Friendly staff and managers. Nice and organized and they all put a huge emphasis on making a great shopping experience for the customer. Did not really shop here much till i got the job and decided to go to a different location one day...worst experience ever. The staff was unfriendly and unhelpful. Glad i decided to start my journey in retail where i did the only flaw is that there are constantly new people getting hired so if you have big bills to pay you may need to get a second job.
good,Really like working at Kohl's. I did not have problems or issues with management or my fellow co-workers. I was very reliable and did my job without having to be supervised all the time.
good,I really enjoyed my time with Kohl's and i would still be there if not for a certain district manager. I was with the company for 12 years when I had a DM with whom I could not please or work for.
good,Working at Kohl's was a positive experience.  Management was flexible and understanding of my needs.  Management was clear about expectations and did a great job motivating its employees to reach credit goals.  The most difficult part of the job is during the holiday season when the store was filled with customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers with their needs.
good,One can not advance into better positions. Even if one did the pay is not greater than the average employee and you just have more hours. Its a great beginners job though
good,"Kohls is a very nice place to work, the pay isn't great, but its a good transition job while I am trying to find a geology career path that fits well with my training"
good,"At first you get thrown into the fray with little to no training. In fact, I didn't realize for the first month that I was supposed to wear equipment like walkie talkies and RFs on the floor because no one told me. The customers are decent and the soundtrack is pretty killer, it's very unique and will help keep your spirits up. The hours aren't awful and the distribution of workload isn't too bad, but if someone calls in sick be prepared to drown a little. Truck days are a great escape from the customer service side of things, so if you're energetic and excited to be able to hide in the stock room for a while, i'd recommend it. I was promoted to a department head after one year, having applied as just a seasonal, temporary worker. There's a lot of room for job advancement, but everything is very fast paced, so you can fall behind if you're not careful."
good,"My time with Kohls was always temporary which allowed me to focus on my family while we were going through personal matters. Kohls was a good work place, great energy and good co-workers. Management was fair but you have to have drive and ambition  to obtain credit applications its required as an associate."
good,"-sales associate easy to get along with"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"loved the enviroment, I loved the people that I worked with. I liked my job and really learned a lot while I was there and also learned to appreciate those that work on customer service."
good,"Moat of the time the facility is understaffed, and when there arent any employees in the departments the sales associates are forced to clean up the departments. once its closing time employees stay after for about 30 minutes to clean up."
good,"Busy and fun place to work. Good management and helpful co-workers. Only draw back, this company doesn't offer health plan to part-time staff (most staffers are part-time anyway),"
good,"The hardest thing about the job is the hours. As a supervisor you are required to work early mornings, overnights, mid shifts and holidays. The inconsistency of your schedule makes finding child care virtually impossible. The benefits are good and the discounts are great but the raises are meager and advancement isn't likely."
good,"It’s retail so you’ll have your terrible days, however, management was always a great asset. Loved working for them.  Left only because I had finished school and was pursing a career in my field."
good,"Very cooprative team work under the excellent mangers supervision."
good,I worked during the Thanksgiving/Christmas season so it was always quick-paced. The managers are all very nice and I'd get employee discounts. Kohl's had a very fun environment even though it was fast- paced.
good,"A typical day begins with greeting customers with a welcoming smile as they begin their shopping experience with Kohl's. Helping customers locate desired items throughout the store is very gratifying. This experience eventually brings them back to the front of the store where a cashier again greets, thanks them for their purchases and patronage and completes their transaction. Removing recovery items from cashier's workstation and restocking these items completes the day."
good,"great for part time work, the culture continues to change. even though the pay is low Corporate office tries to encourage fun food days, but only if the management follow throughs. I went through 3 store managers in the 4 years I worked there."
good,working at kohls for almost a year was fun because i got to work with people i went to high school with. The managers there are really nice. The only thing i didn't like about kohls was clearing out the fitting room on a super busy day.
good,"Provide great customer service to your department and at times assist other departments"
good,Had bad times getting help with stuff but over all a great place to work friendly . suppled food for extra set up details not a lot of training for sertain jobs.
good,"Fun fast pasted if you got credits you was able to earn,more money you have to know how to count money good customer service the bad part is no benefits and short breaks. And if you work during the holidays its mandatory to work days like black Friday and most of the holidays they are open."
good,working there the people were great and friendly everyone work together well hardly any complications management helped whenever I needed learned . few leader ship skills while working there like how to be organized and punctual.
good,"A typical day begins with my supervisor and I discussing the tasks at hand and setting priorities.  Safety is always mentioned and policies are maintained. I am given autonomy in completing my tasks.  When trucks are complete and all shelving is in order, I enjoy meeting customers and offering assistance.  Many customers have expressed their appreciation to management and I have numerous notes in my file documenting such good performance."
good,This stores location had a good staff and good jobs. The only thing that could have been better was how often things were worked out onto the sales floor.
good,"I would continue to work here, they have lockers ! It was nice to work with everyone, everybody soo happy to work there & it was easy to work there. Easy to change shift as well"
good,"good job, but rather overworked and underpaid. felt sort of unappreciated and overlooked. enjoyed the work overall, except at back to school time and Christmas when the dressing rooms exploded! enjoyed organizing departments otherwise."
good,I enjoy working at Kohl's.  The hours are flexible and adapt to my family life well.  The employees are fun to work with and management is fair and respectful.  We have opportunities to volunteer outside work.  The discount is good.  The customers can be engaging and make the day go by fast.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"overall company is a good place to be. Company tries to stay ahead of the digital curve. Downfall, they make many procedure changes but do not give much information on the changes. No stores do things the same."
good,"Kohls is a busy bustling community that always strives to make the most of her shopping opportunity."
good,"A typical day consisted of unloading 18 wheelers on the dock, stocking product in the warehouse, stocking product out on the floor, collaborating with colleagues."
good,Kohls had a nice working environment. Management was nice and had very flexible with hours. Customers were nice as well and the environment was very face pace.
good,"Enjoy the flexibility of setting my hours by submitting availability times that do not interfere with my full time job.  Being the second time I work for the company, my manager is very familiar with my work and challenges me to do my best daily."
good,"Worked at two different locations under three different styles of management and one thing remained the same throughout it all,if you want recognition for your hard work, you better have the numbers to back it up. With little room for advancement, all you can do is try to work as many hours as you can to be happy here."
good,I loved working at Kohls. The management was great because they cared about their employees to the point where we felt like family. My only concerns where the poor pay and I was only part time because its hard to move up in the company.
good,its a nice place too work during peak and they a  good schedule  were you can only work week ends an you can still keep you medical while doing so they also want you to go too school although there is no mor school program
good,"• Greeted customers and performed sales transactions at Point of Sale"
good,Most of the day is spend sorting out and putting back the fitting room clothes. Managers were very cool and relaxed as long as you do your duties. Would recommend.
good,"Typical day at work starts with plans that were usually laid out from the day before.  Information is then communicated to the teams, and plans are executed.  At the end of the day, the store is analyzed for tomorrow.  Then plan is created for the next day."
good,I really enjoyed working at Kohl's. Their cash register I think is one of the matter systems retails use. Making purchases and payment processes quickly and getting the customers out the stores accurate and fast. Customers real dislike the long lines.
good,Kohl's is not a bad place to have a part time job at. The pay is low (which pretty much all retail is). They will work around your schedule; most people I worked with had either a second job or was a student. If you are trying to pay bills this may not be the best place for you unless it is a second job. The hours will vary week to week but they let you pick up other people's shift that they can't work. You get a 15% employee discount which you can use along with their other discounts. There will often be free food in the lunch room.
good,I truly enjoyed working at Kohl's. The best part was meeting new people on a daily basis along with serving the regular customers. I also loved how I was able to cross train in multiple areas of the store.
good,"Kohl's is a good place to work. They have many area in which an employee could advance and work more hours. During the holidays, the hours are even more for everyone to work."
good,"A typical day at work is pushing for credit, and providing the best customer service. Management was good when I started, but got worse as I stayed. The store manager at the location I work at now can be quite undermining, and a push over to customers, so the associates get walked all over. We're often short staffed, so they expect us to the work of multiple associates almost everyday; some days we don't even get breaks. The other associates are quite lovely though, all nice. The hardest part of the job would be having to do so much work and get almost no recognition for the effort and work that you put in. However, being able to talk to regular customers is the most enjoyable because you get to create relationships with these people."
good,"Kohls  would make my work day was when I was working with teammates who worked together if one needed assistance."
good,"they have great products and do a superb job in providing multi channels for purchasing goods. Discounts, coupons, and Rewards add to the marketing powerhouse that Kohl's is known for. enjoyed working with the customers. most difficult part of the job was the employee turnover due to them going to another job either for better pay or career pursuits."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,This job was a very good one to have. The hours just weren’t there. I love the people that I worked with. Everyone was absolutely amazing. The store was always ran very smoothly and if help was needed you got it.
good,"It  was stressful at times, especially when the day got busier. However, that can be said for any place that deals with customers. We tried to be as efficient as possible, but it's difficult at times due to scheduling and call offs. Occasionally we were spread a little thin around the store.  People working together get things done faster, but one also has to remember that their own work comes first. The managers were helpful, for the most part. Occasionally, one ""rubs you the wrong way"", but it didn't deter us from getting our jobs done. For the most part we all had fun and joked around when we could, even with the managers. I definitely learned to be patient with people, both customers and fellow workers."
good,"Co-workers and management are friendly, upbeat,  and are hard-workers. The atmosphere is great. They care about their employees. They have job security and some advancements."
good,I usually pulled items to be put out on sales floor.  Then the items would need to be placed on a cart and taken out on the sales floor at the appropriate locations.
good,"Great great place to work. Just a drama queen infested male manager that turned everyone against everyone. I loved working for this place and it wasn't stressful if you sucked up, but besides the manager itself this place was a wonderful place to work"
good,"There is no typical day at work to provide, which is why I really enjoyed my time here.  There are always new things to experience, and a lot of opportunities presented with which to learn.  The senior management is a very receptive team, and always looking for input from the staff, which is very appreciated throughout the company."
good,"I enjoyed working here, I got to just listen to music and do my job, plus the pay was really good (to me at least.) The shift was either over in a flash or felt like an eternity, just depended on the work load. Over all I enjoyed my employment there, I liked most of the managers, pretty chill and cool, when it was slow they were understanding of the lack of anything to do and were understanding of any issues encountered. There was really only one dillhole who was way too strict even with absolutely nothing to do (everything was clean/stocked up and nothing was coming in, so literally nothing to do but wait and he still got on to me for not doing anything, wasn't even my departments manager nor a general manager)"
good,"When I first started here it was a wonderful place to work, but I would not say that it is a place to stay in long term. I should of moved on years ago but I stayed hoping it could become a forever job but it just not  the type of job this is."
good,"Kohl's Contact Center is a very good place to work. Many different opportunities within the call center including E-Commerce sales and service, Collections and Fraud."
good,Greeted customers and communicated effectively with customers and fellow employees; followed all company cash handling policies and special store loss prevention procedures.
good,The site in Dallas has some culture issues that need to be resolved before moving forward.  Not enough accountability across management.  Have been losing good tenured people for the past two years.
good,I would clock in for work grab the scanner and start filling orders from the staging areas or if I was needed to fill the trucks being shipped out I switched over and did that.
good,"Overall it is a decent place to work. The management is sympathetic and yet offer productive and suitable challenges to their subordinates. Holidays can be very busy, but not any moreso than might be expected from a large retail company."
good,It was a fun place to work and the management was better than other places I have worked in the past. They were very understanding when it came to uncontrollable situations and respecting your work availability.
good,there was a lot of drama between managers they enjoyed picking favorites and pushing their non favorites to the side. a very competitive environment and a very pushy environment
good,I worked for KOHLS during a very stressful time in my life and the manager at the Santa Clara KOHLS was very supportive and made me feel like I had a future in life. That KOHLS was torn down for housing.
good,"Overall, Kohls has a growth opportunity for associates that are interested in relocation. They do a lot of volunteering with the community. They are all about the customer with the ayes we can policy which makes customer satisfaction decisions easier."
good,At Kohl's you are asked to a lot for very little pay.  The discounts are awesome. The work schedule is very flexible you are allowed to pick up shifts when other associates post them and you would like to work.
good,"I worked at Kohl's for several years."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I worked a variety of times and days when necessary.
good,Seasonal help at Kohl's was good. Fast paced and slow paced depending on what time and day there were people shopping. It was a good first job to help give some experience in the field and definitely something I would do again.
good,"A very good job with decent pay for retail, however, management is not always the best with communication. I would highly recommend as a summer or seasonal job, but not something to do full time as it is extremely repetitive. They also push credit cards way too much."
good,"Good for young people in school or transitioning, as long as you don't mind working in a very unorganized store. Generally friendly coworkers and management."
good,"Coming into work, clock in and head straight to the Loss Prevention office, operating the CCTV's and watching for possible suspects. if someone is caught after walking through the store doors with merchandise they can be apprehended by the Loss Prevention Officers"
good,They would't explain things real well. I'm a good worker and a good people person. The management was very nice. It was confusing working there. Figuring things out on your own. Seeing and meeting new people.
good,It was an ok place to work at.  The work was fairly easy.  The managers were very friendly and would often bring food when the team did a great job.  Co-workers were great.
good,"I worked at Kohl's for almost 3-years. It was a good place to work for a young, college student needing extra money. They are very flexible with scheduling and worked around that very well. The atmosphere while working was never negative - everyone always collaborated with each other well. The hardest part of the job was learning how to work everything when I first started; the training was very minimal and it's essential to ask questions."
good,I started at Kohls as seasonal help and they kept me on after the holiday.Everybody I worked with was very nice and I enjoyed talking with the customers.
good,It was very busy because of the holidays so there was always something to do. The staff was very friendly and helpful and were available to answer questions most of the time.
good,Each store is different when it comes to how its run and how their managers handle things. During my time with Kohl's I worked for two stores in different states and seeing that not all stores are the same makes it a hit or miss when you choose to work for them.
good,I worked at kohls as a overnight backstock employee. My shifts started at 5a and ended at 10a or 1p given the opportunity to stay late. Management was really fair about hours and reasonable if time was needed off. Working with others was always enjoyable as well as not dealing with customers overnight. Hardest thing about the job was waking up early to start but once shift started it was a breeze. The days go by quicker.
good,"I have enjoyed working at Kohls, even though I have had my struggles with things. There is always somebody there willing to help you or answer any questions you need answered."
good,"I worked there for a little while and it was a nice place, I had to stock the floors and back stock the excess (which was rare), unload the truck, reorganize the store, change the signs for sales, mark clearance, and help customers with their questions. It was nice and relaxed since the workflow there was well managed. The pay was okay for the job that it was and the advancement had opportunities, you just had to be there when it happened. The people I worked for were fun and even though they weren't going to be there forever, they at least came in and tried to enjoy the job, giving it a much better feel."
good,"Great job for anyone looking for extra pay or with multiple incomes. Opportunity for growth is there, but not necessarily available always. Great company to work for that gives back to the community."
good,"If your looking to get the full experience of working in retail then Kohl's is the place for you. This was my first retail job and I learned about time management, stocking merchandise, and great customer service skills."
good,"They give considerations to all the employees like the HR adjust to all thei employee's request schedules. We are always given special treats like pizzas, sodas, Starbucks coffee during busy days like any holidays. And the best part of working at Kohl's is you get to get big discounts in all the things you want to purchased in the store."
good,The hardest thing of the job was learning how to do the  system but after everything became easy. The hours were good along with the workers. I enjoyed working sides of the store by myself sometimes.
good,"People are friendly and willing to help, answers all your questions. decent place to work, low wages but I assume that was because of the seasonal position."
good,I actually love working for Kohl's but now that the peak season is over there isn't any hours work is really slow so I'm forced to seek employment elsewhere until work picks up but may be forced to resign if I'm unable to work another job and Kohl's also.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Good productive company  with good employees.  Regular work but not back breaking work. Work gets slow at times, and then you crosstrain or help out in other departments.First of the year around January February and some of March there is very little work which means your hours are affected."
good,"other works are friendly if you need help they will give you the information needed or point you at the right direction"
good,This company in rockville was a volunteer service for a walk-a-thon for 5 miles.  The cause was raising charity for children who have autism.  Fun activity just hot temperatures
good,"For my temporary employment at kohls, I enjoyed the staff I worked with. You are paid fairly for the job you are doing, however if you are seeking a job with a decent amount of hours a week, this isn't a job for you."
good,I learned time management. It was a very fast past job. We were able to listen to music as we worked. The hardest part was cleaning up after the shift that worked before we came in.
good,"Enjoyed working here.  Staff and management were friendly and there were always fun activities for staff appreciation.  Was not told at time of interview that I would have to also work Saturdays (after working M-F) during peak volumes, which became difficult for work/life balance."
good,"Pretty good job, fast paced, great discounts, great people to work with. Only dislike is ive not been able to grow in the compan. General manager shoots me down whenever I get a chance to move up."
good,"I've been working at Kohl's for a little over a year now and I have to say, it's the longest I've worked a serious job with many responsibilities. I LOVE the people I work with and LOVE the discounts and interaction with customers. Whenever I can put a smile on someone's face it makes my day worth while. A typical day usually goes by pretty fast for me. Workflow is steady and before you know it your shift is over. "
good,"From day to day it was pretty fast-paced but also, organized . Since working there I developed better customer service skills and better time management and prioritization skills."
good,"Way too many dumb/angry customers that don't understand very simple things, because of this, the job became way too stressful for me after awhile. Also a lot of the equipment barely ever worked right, and the newer registers like to shut off by themselves in the middle of helping someone. It wasn't too bad for a first job though."
good,"I absolutely loved my job in the beginning, until my manager sexually assaulted me and was fired due to it, after that i feel as though some of the upper management had a bit of dis like because i went over there head with my complaint. i also feel that i had a target on my back because shortly after i was terminated,they claimed it was due to pointing out but i mysteriously went from 0 points to 22.5. the terminate you at 13 points, how is it that they allowed me to supposedly accumulate so many points and still keep me on. fortunately for me unemployment agreed with me that i was wrongfully terminated and i received compensation through unemployment for a year, unfortunately my weekly pay was so low i was able to still receive benefits because my pay and weekly work hours were so low."
good,"besides the customers its a pretty chill and friendly place to work, you  pretty much fold clothes and put away recovery (a bit of manual labor), if you're a cashier the only hard part is soliciting credits other than that if you don't know what to do there's always someone there to help you."
good,"During my time at kohls, it was definitely enjoyable. Very fast paced but it made time go by fast. I was employed for a few months during peak season and began working 40-50 hour weeks which helped out a lot during the holidays."
good,I love working for Kohls! Sad part is a few managers are very rude and don’t appreciate anything you do and just overall seems like bullies. Kohls is a good place too work there are just some bumps in the road with management.
good,"Being a cashier is an easy job you have to count the registers in the morning and countdown if you close the store for the night. Open the doors when they open. The workplace is great, have good attitudes, always smiles, and we all have a good laugh when we need it to build each other up."
good,get to work at 6am and depending on the day either we unload the truck or we restock/back stock the store. the workplace is very chill and most the employees are very friendly. the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to help friendly old people.
good,I was seasonal at Kohl's for a month and a half. I liked it a lot. The management team was always amazing and made everything super easy to do and understand. Everyone was really friendly and always willing to go the extra mile. I highly agreed with there policies like the yes we can and there innate abilities to boost their employees times spent there.
good,"I was sometimes left confused at the job, but i was quickly helped. I was never overworked, the job was pretty relaxed besides the holidays. The environment was tolerable. Some slightly off people there but it wasnt a dire issue."
good,The job was ok not to hard just had to fold clothes and pick up the store. Also the poeple there were fun and great to talk to. So i think if you want a good job work here
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Like the fact management aren’t afraid to get “their hands dirty”, working side by side with the employees. That may be because the store seems to be short staffed all the time. But have yet to hear anyone complain about it. That being said, compensation could be a little better for the multiple roles employees are required to do. "
good,Kohls was a great place to work even if it was only 20 hours a week. very flexible with whatever was going on. You can either run with your head cut off or you will be assigned some special project. Very energetic place to work
good,This was a temporary job I had while I was entering my first couple semesters of college. It was a fun job that introduced me the retail world. The job was simple and did not require a lot of training.
good,Ok place to work. Love the employee discounts. Only complaint not much room for advancement. I would recommend it as a part time or seasonal job only.
good,"while working at kohl's i was bored most of my day, i spent 7-8 hours walking through the store looking for things to keep busy with. management was mostly cooperative but i was given less then 15 hours a week and when i asked for more nothing changed."
good,Love working here but its seasonal if you are lucky you will get hired.i have worked there 4 seasons they sent a survey asking if i would be interested in a part time spot but i never recieved anything else
good,It was a goodplace to work . Themanament team was not vey freindly or sureof therejob.. the storemanager was alway on leave of abesents. So we really was on our own.
good,They throw you under the bus for the register that they do not do proper training for. 20 minutes of one day and they think you know what you're doing 3 months later. They expect you to learn by yourself and be available when needed. Meaning when they call for additional in the store.
good,"working in collections is a none stop talking on the phone, hang up with one call immediately take another call. People around you are very friendly and are always saying hello."
good,Kohl's is a very quick paced environment but very fun and the employees are awesome. I learned about customer service. The managers are fun as well they just want you to do your job.
good,"Every job has its moments, and i loved that with this job i was always busy and doing something. Love working with the customers. You can never learn enough."
good,"I worked for Khol's twice.  Both times a a seasonal worker.  "
good,Great job love my time here just sad its Temporary very easy job love working here never stressful enjoy everything about it easy money make a lot of cash this job paid a lot of bills for me made my life very easy I would love to have another job just like those jobs and they are so let’s listen to music while you don’t work so that’s an extra bonus
good,Everyday at Kohl's we had a quota to meet on how many credit card applications we needed to get so they would always be on us about that and would give us personal quotas too. We were always in competition with the other stores in the state.
good,"I can come in to work, be greeted by lovely customers and co-workers. On a day with good coupons out, it's not packed, but things start to move really fast. I learned how to greet customers to make them feel welcomed, sell Kohl's credit cards and rewards. Also,the supervisors were always helpful and persistent."
good,It was always fun to go to work and its very fast paced with great people. You can joke around while you get your work done but be professional  at the same time.
good,I was a seasonal employee.  It was a pleasant environment to work in.  Management is nice and fair.  The hardest part of the job was time management.  It always seemed like there wasn't enough time to complete my work.
good,"Loved taking care of my store! Dressing mannequins, putting together displays and making the store look beautiful. It was a lot of work but very rewarding."
good,"Great store, great company, great (most of them at least) co workers, bad management. Hours come and go in extreme opposites. Last week- 10 hours, this week- 30+. "
good,I was a seasonal employee but I absolutely loves working here. You get at least one break for every shift you work. The management is really nice and understanding and helpful.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,It helps you develop as a first job but some things make it hard to work there. The things that are the cons are the pressure to give credit without compensation or reward and managers reminding you.
good,Its hard work but that didn't bug me . they expect more in a certain way than they should but that is my opinion. I still had an enjoyable seasonal positional at the store that i worked at.
good,"I actually wouldn't mind working there again. I had fun, the employees were awesome and the many people that come to the store is entertaining. And being able to help people with questions or directions is also a good skill for customer service."
good,"overall, I liked working at Kohl's. My schedule was all over the place as it was not a fixed schedule, however, the tasks were very easy to perform and the other employees were very helpful and friendly."
good,"Kohl's is a good place to work for if you're a non-exempt level employee.  The company goes out of it's way to have several engagement activities for non-exempt employees.  The company also believes in developing it's non-exempt employees with several programs such as the Resource and Team Lead in Training programs.  "
good,"I enjoyed working at Kohls. I like their clothes and shoes alot. Working with customers of all ages "
good,This place was a good place to work at. Always had something to do. My retail experience began with this job. Continued to grow from there and really learn the ways.
good,Great job for those looking for a part time job. Managers practice positive communication with their employees. Shifts and type of work vary. Other staff are friendly and the overall work atmosphere is positive.
good,"When I worked here, although it was a temporary position, it was fun, enjoyable, and I very much did enjoy it! I had fun with the people I worked with, I had fun helping customers, and I had fun in general with everything that I did. I would recommend it."
good,"Meeting and making a connection with customers, asking questions and listening to shoppers' needs, then giving options and advice on meeting those needs.  Maintain a professional attitude with sincerity and enthusiasm reflecting Kohl’s commitment to our customer –  the most important person in our stores.  Learning company systems and procedures to enhance selling efficiencies and complete support duties.  Develop product knowledge by reading current vendor tags and pamphlets and attending training classes."
good,"Great people,fast paced and crazy hours along with discounts but lack of advancement unless in the circle.you can advance to a supervisor role which includes all the work and responsibility of management but none of the pay and insurance,vacation days or paid time off...ever..I love the place but hard work and awards should at least Grant an interview for a higher spot sadly it does not. Handpicked friends from other stores will make up the management team."
good,"It was not a Corporation, but a privately owned grocery store.  It was a fun place to work, and I knew many of the customers.  I left the company because I decided to move to Florida to be close to my daughter, my only child."
good,"I worked at two different stores in two different states. The first store I worked at was very enjoyable. Management and coworkers were all friendly, open, and approachable. The second store was the opposite."
good,Worked at a location that was closed by the company in 2016 but until then it was a nice part time job that paid ok and for that there was little expectation of you other than to just show up and stay busy.
good,"Kohl's was a pretty good place to work, but it was a temporary job for me. It was barely above minimum wage with no benefits. It's an extremely competitive environment, because everyone is expected to solicit credit. Raises are only given when you get a certain amount of credit card applications filled out/approved. I didn't see any room for advancement, nor did I care for having to work on holidays."
good,"Working at Kohl's can be fun, but if you are scheduled with the wrong people, it can be a disaster. You can have a flexible shift and help in many departments. You also have time to yourself so you can think and gain product knowledge."
good,"I have only been employed at Kohl's in Conroe for 42 days, but so far so good. I was able to receive health and vision benefits as well as an employee discount. I actually had to apply for them within 45 days of employment. I am only part-time however, so the coverage isn't as good as if I was full time or management. I do like it overall though. Fast paced at the register, but it is a relaxed environment and they work well with your learning pace. And I am a full time student so they work well with my school schedule too."
good,I loved working the merchandise sets. Lean and mean mentality as far as being properly staffed each day. Opportunities for growth. Daily goals that are strongly encouraged to be met.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Kohl's has a great team culture, but they are always understaffed.  Associates are over worked and under paid.  There is always a disconnect between work expected and the payroll to perform the work.  Every year, payroll keeps getting stripped from the floor associates."
good,"Checking out customers,telling customer about new merchandise or sales,  offers to apply for Kohl's charge card, put out stock. Helping other department with putting out new merchandise"
good,"A typical day at Kohls, you make sure to meet the needs for the costumers and make sure they are satisfied. Consists of working on the sales floor and being able to answer questions and to be able to work on the register"
good,It's an ok place to work. Customer service is very hard. QA makes or breaks your score. You make decent money and benefits are great. Paid weekly and cafeteria has great choices but a little expensive.
good,Fast pace working job lot of bending standing in water  pulling a lot of clicks but the work did get done I would recommend a a person that's in college
good,"Typical day at work consists of running go backs from fitting rooms and/or customer service back to the floor/department it belongs in. Also recovering the floor, which consists of folding, fixing hangers, and picking up items off the floor or off the racks and placing them where they belong."
good,"this job was a temporary job for me but it was fun while i was there. some of the management actually genuinely like their jobs and its great to see and be around, but the store manager was an absolute devil. I wanted to advance and do more in the company but since I got people to sign up for credit cards I was chained to the register and very rarely allowed to leave."
good,Everyday was the chance to meet a new personality and hear stories from the customers that passed through. It was a mostly friendly environment and also sometimes fast paced. And learned about store credit and the importance of appearance.
good,Kohls is great place to work with a great staff. They are professional and customer oriented.  There is room for advancement and great employee incentives.
good,"Recover of departments and dressing rooms, customer service, cashiering. Learned a lot about merchandising, Christmas time was fun. Hardest part, getting dressing for roo 's all clean and recovered when on a limited amount of time. Extra discount at holiday times."
good,Leads come around every hour to ask if need help. Associates energy keeps the place lively and fun. Hours flyby with the constant flow of organized work.
good,"Working well with others 4 days a week in a temperature controlled warehouse, showing good teamwork to satisfy the needs of the valued customers while being closely looked by managers."
good,I was hired during Christmas so I did enjoy monitoring lines and helping out with merchandise. Then got hired as a cashier loved the flow it was not a hard job.
good,"Managers are asked to do the job of many different roles that with most companies would be handled by a specialized department/function. This often takes away from leadership/associate engagement which is often positioned as the most important thing, even at the expense of production and performance."
good,Kohls is a big retail store that requires many parts to keep things running. There are a variety of jobs to be done and it was important for employees to be crossed trained so they would be able to help in any position.
good,"Everyday we are understaffed. there are never enough people on the sales floor to help customers or finish projects, like fitting rooms and recovery. WiFi always goes down so RF devices, and registers constantly aren't working properly."
good,Nice place to work. Hard work. It can be fun thought to help someone put together the perfect outfit. Also it lets you work alone most of the time which i am a big fan of.
good,Working at kohls was great! I loved who I worked with! The pay was not good but I was only 19. I was fresh out of high school  going to college and they worked with my schedule very well!!
good,I worked as a sales associate mostly in the shoe department. I worked about two days a week for 4 hours a shift while I was in college. I liked working there. The hardest part of the job was trying to find missing mate shoes. I really liked how flexible they were with my schedule.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Sometimes too many chiefs and not enough indians.  I learned to multi-task. The hardest part of the job was figuring out what boss to follow as I was given so many different directives. The best part was not being followed around because they knew I would do my job.
good,"Solid processes and systems."
good,"very nice place to work, I like all the manager people.  I like the activity of changing store design from seasons.  As an employee you can work as much or little in scheduled hours as fits your needs."
good,"I enjoyed the time I worked for Kohls in the Customer Service and Jewelry department. "
good,"This company is not too bad, they have some difficulty in keeping their store and employees organized and often have holes in covering departments because they are constantly calling department workers up to the registers but the managers are always helpful."
good,I learned how to handle certain situations on my own. I became more comfortable with working on a team. I also learned that in the work place it's okay to ask for help.
good,"Good place to work for clothing discount year round. Flexible hours must work 1 weekend day."
good,"I worked in Home and Kids department so I put away my departments' fitting room. I learned how to use a BlueBird and RF and on Tuesdays we did truck so I learned how to put away new merchandise. It taught me to organize new items from older items and put into persepctive how customers see the new items as well. The hardest part was, in fact, merchandising due to limited space from older items. Overall I liked working here because of the people I worked with made it fun and I enjoyed learning new things because in a clothing store many things change and I typically liked it."
good,"This job can be difficult with confusion from customers and sometimes lack of order but managers and employees always do all they can to help customers, fulfill orders and achieve customer satisfaction."
good,Some of the work days you would be to busy to get a break. The pay was not fair for the work you were told to do. It was a friendly place to work some of the time. You would be pressured to work faster.
good,"Kohl's was an alright place to work, the managers didn't make sure that the employees were satisfied with the hours they were giving. They gave new employees late nights."
good,I loved how Kohl's gave back to the community and offered volunteer work to its employees. I felt like they really took care of their own during big events and holiday's. Would always return to work for this company -for its great deeds and team spirit.
good,Recognition was a main focus while I was there. Too many employees that did not want hours. A good starter job for those getting into retail. Return policy is one of the best in the field
good,"Good for a first job. I liked it, they have many opportunities, but it wasn't really a job for me. Those who like to work with people and sales, this is a perfect place. Those who are a little more quiet in nature, I recommend a smaller place and a place not so competitive."
good,"I worked only seasonal so it was good at the time , fast , always had somthing to do costumer’s to talk to . After holiday my hours dropped COMPLETLY so it was more of a down fall for me"
good,Nice job for people who require minimal supervision . Once you learn warehouse layout job is very easy. A lot of people stand around but hard workers don't go unnoticed
good,Absolutely amazing managers! Sometimes the customers can be difficult and some days its hard to get anything done because we are so busy but overall its a great place to work.
good,I enjoyed my time there because I was able to learn a lot and was compensated well. The position I had as a beauty advisor was limited in growth and that's the reason I left but kohl's is great company to work for.
good,Great place to work. I was always treated fairly and my requests were always met. They have a great way to uplift and commend there employees. The pay could better but i was fair for a part time 2nd job.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I worked third shift 1-5 nights a week unloading freight, and you never knew from week to week what the next one would look like. No overtime - they will get all over you if you put in more than 40.0000 hours. Lots of management turnover. And they lock you in the building until the morning shift arrived."
good,"Working at Kohl's is not bad at all. "
good,"Kohl's is a busy environment which is good , it keeps you busy and the day will go by fast. At Kohl's, you have to balance on working on a project and giving great customer service at all times. The employees and young and inexperience , so you would have to keep coaching to complete the day. AT the end of the day , the store will look its best and business has been completed ready to repeat the next day."
good,"Kohl's is actually is a great place to work. The people are nice, its easy to get along with everyone. After a certain time there is actually a pay increase. Hours are flexible, can easily carry any skills learned into new workplace. Customer service is important and you'll eventually how to work around customers. Takes patience."
good,Loved working with the People and crew that was there when I worked there management was awesome and willing to help how ever they could when they could.
good,Overall was a good place to work at. Give up an opportunity to move up in the company. Also has great benefits and a great matching 401k plan. Again i would recommend anybody to this place
good,It seems that there was never enough staff to get all the tasks accomplished. Which made the managers stressed and in turn made the employees stressed. There were many nights that we had to stay over an hour after close just to get everything done. Even if that meant working a 9 hour day.
good,working at here can be relaxing when there is no work which then requires that you need to be cross trained in other departments. meaning one day you can start as picking and end up in packing .
good,"Although some days were hard, the work environment was pretty great. Friendly management, staff.  Did a little bit of customer service. Overall, great experience."
good,They promise you full-time hours and you get about 15-20 hours a week working here. They schedule based on how long you've been there and expect you to always keep your schedule open for them and when they might possibly need you. They throw you out there to work but if there are questions or you need help NO ONE is around to assist you. They just want you to figure it out on your own. If you did the wrong thing then they'll yell at you and tell you that you should've asked for help.
good,"First clock in, grab a walkie and bluebird, check the schedule for the week, start working. I learned how to be fast paced and customer satisfaction. The hardest part of the job are the holidays."
good,"They're are hard time at work but it is fun and faced paced you should never not be doing something am always folding ,on a register or helping a customer and if you do not know something ask some because they will help you we have team work and show our customers that we care."
good,"Worked at a lot of different stores. Each were great in their own ways. Too much emphasis to push goals on the employees. Too much stress put on the managers to push the goals. Physically demanding in addition to mentally. Great at internally promoting and developing their employees, though."
good,"It was a nice job to have in college. There aren't enough opportunities to have a career there, but I enjoyed working at Kohl's. The employee discount was always a plus."
good,"The store is big so everyone works by themselves most of the time, unless if you work at customer service. The Kohl's that I worked at hired a lot of seasonal workers, too many in my opinion so a lot of the time many people were doing nothing, not that there wasn't something to do."
good,"My time at Kohl's was great. I learned so much about myself, what I am good at and what I need to work on. Although my future goals have nothing to do with working at  Kohl's again, I feel my time at Kohl's helped shape me into the type of worker I am going to be in my future career."
good,I was only there for a few months and left only because I was looking for part-time. Great place for students to work considering they only hire part-time positions
good,"Always learned something every day. I always felt the pressure/obligation to stay late to get everything done. Most days I enjoyed everything I did, but I truly became married to my store. "
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Great atmosphere but there is drama because there are younger kids working there. Management was great except when corporate was giving them a hard time about soliciting credit...which then turned on the employees. But overall, I loved it for part time. I would never make a career out of it. It is hard to move up."
good,I really enjoyed my job at Kohl's. It was short lived because retail life isn't for everyone but I loved it.  It was always an upbeat place to work at and the supervisors were all wonderful people.
good,"It's a really easy job to maintain and the starting pay was decent. They are very willing to work to fit your schedule, especially if you've been there awhile. My only gripe is there isn't much room for growth, and the work is rather dull overall. The people are great though; they really make the experience 10 times better."
good,When i was working i learned a lot about organizing and working together to get things done. I was also moving up past the people i got hired with and was left with a few more responsibilities than others and i loved it. unfortunately i did not have transportation than got me to work right on time so they let me go but now i have my own transportation and i would love to have a fast paced always busy and helping people kind of job.
good,"Positions are enjoyable and motivating, coworkers create a great team, some of the management team is respectable in their leadership while others are not"
good,I loved working at Kohl's! The people I worked with were great and the customers weren't too bad either (most of the time). I was seasonal help so it was hectic and high stress at times.
good,"Khol's was a great job when everyone was on the same page. Good pay and benefits.  Nurse on site, as well as a counselor for use by staff. Although equipment was old and in need of repair."
good,"Kohl's was my first job ever and I began work as a senior in High School. Over the course of almost a year, I would not only learn basic working skills, but I would also come to feel like a valued member of a sort of ""work family"". The team that I worked with during my time with Kohl's showed me that work did not have to be viewed as merely a job that had to be done in order to earn a living. I learned that teamwork existed outside of the workplace and I made many friends, both young and old, that I will never forget. I was shown that proving yourself as a dedicated worker goes a long way and that establishing a network of trusted coworkers is helpful to finish tasks in an efficient and timely manner. In such a positive environment, it was easy to provide good customer service and maintain a good level of productivity."
good,"The employees and managers are all very friendly and caring. It is a very enjoyable place to work at some day, it has its days. Typically you have to keep your work space clean, and assist customers and well as you can."
good,"Work was always productive. Our job duty was to provide great customer service which I loved so much and assist them with any questions or help they needed on any specific departments. "
good,I really like working at Kohl's. It is a very positive and fun work environment. The staff is very nice and fun to work with. It's just not enough hours.
good,"They make it very difficult to let anyone go- so this is great if you're a slacker. However, if you are more of the hard-working type you may feel under valued as you'll be held in the same regard as those who do nothing."
good,"Kohl's culture is unlike any other retail chain. Kohl's lives their mission statement with both their associates and their customers. Being a manager, I have the privilege of setting the tone for our location and ensuring that my associates are happy in their role, and in turn making our customers happy to shop in our store. Kohl's values the customer perception and allows their feedback to propel positive changes."
good,"I enjoyed working there, team members I worked with were great. I found the store was dirty, and no thought to keeping the merchandise up of the floor"
good,Management often did not communicate with each other and employees about expectations. The pay was fair and the co-workers were comfortable to work with. Training was thorough and questions were resolved by most managers without problems.
good,Does not provide or offer health benefits to their part time employees. However Kohls does offer great employee discounts throughout the year. Holiday hours can be hard on the family.
good,My job was in a distribution center and It's a job of too much physical effort. You have to be willing to lift and move very heavy objects and keep a good score.
good,"I worked as a recovery associate during the holidays and it really kept me busy.  Although I did not work there for very long, I really enjoyed the job and getting to interact with the customers.  All they employees were really nice and worked well as a team."
good,I learned how to operate a cash register. The management was average. A regular for me was an associate cashier. The hardest part was standing all day. I enjoyed the clothing.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I thought Kohl's is a pretty good place to work as they have a friendly and professional environment. Though working as a P.O.S associate you are constantly pressured to meet credit goals and you have to push it but sometimes they give you rewards for it.
good,Es un empleo en el que aprendes muchas cosas y muy competitivo.
good,I was seasonal so I didn't work there long but everything was very organized and easy going. You always knew what needed to be done that day. Interacting with the customers was fun and I enjoyed helping them any way I could.
good,For the most part I really enjoy working here. Great co workers and the management is so easy to get along with. You can request time off and almost always get it.
good,Work has been slow and when its slow its really slow. the compensation is up and down and never constant. The company has its days when we have great incentives.
good,"The store was always thriving with costumers which made work time go by fast, because you were always helping costumers and busy keeping the store looking tidy."
good,"My job responsibilities were really easy and simple. Management and coworkers were always very sweet and nice to me. They've easily grown to be like my family. However, the biggest problem about working there is the lack of hours. I was lucky to even get ten hours a week. So do not rely on this job to be your main job to pay the bills. Despite their advertisement, their ""generous"" employee discount is a bit of an exaggeration."
good,"Your typical day is making sure all the clothes are folded and once you're finished with cleaning up the floor you might be called for taking care of the registers. The management is solid and hardworking, although it could use some changes. It's a bit competitive, however, it is easy to make friends among coworkers."
good,Productive and fun to work. I loved the discounts. Well kept up building and working environment was great. I wished they had a better way of transferring you to different dept.
good,I have done a lot of different jobs at Kohls. The environment is good most of the time.  I like that they are flexible with your schedule to work around other jobs and school.  This is a great 2nd part-time job.
good,Training of duties limited to hands on experience as a part time associate. Team approach to completed duties very strong.
good,"A day at Kohl's including running all parts of the store to ensure business needs were met as well customer satisfaction. I learned that the backroom process is the achilles heel of most businesses. The Management was friendly, respectful and had an open door policy. Work demanded a lot of physical and mental strain on your body so we had to find ways to include fun in our daily routine. We played music while unloading such as Temptations music which took the boredom of unloading and gave us a reason to be goofy yet still get our work done. I enjoyed helping people save money or just helping them find something they were looking for. Customer loyalty is extremely valuable not only to the company but to yourself. When a customer ask for you specifically is a rewarding experience."
good,I enjoyed working here at kohls. I loved the fact that there was so much customer service involved in being a sales associate. the other employees were fun to work with as well.
good,working at kohls was interesting and fun and it was a nice experience to see the type of diversity that was shown at the work place every one got along and we where able to get our job done
good,It was a fun and exciting place to go to work everyday. Always room for advancement. I was promoted to supervisor position before i was even there 90 days. Management was always doing give away's and awarding associates for their good work.
good,"Very casual work-space, yet not very clean, but very well managed, especially on black Friday. I would recommend this to be anyone's first job, or a when they need money for the holidays."
good,I am very pleasure to experience working in this department store. They help me to improve my confidence to interact different kinds of customers and I learned how to handle when it comes to problem solving situation.
good,It's a nice place to work at. Gets pretty busy from time to time. They don't give many hours during non-holiday months. Managers smile to your face but say bad things behind your back right away to other managers. Mainly hire old people who work slow instead of younger people who have more energy to work faster.
good,Kohls is a pretty good environment and I would recommend people to apply if they're hiring. Schedules are sent out a week in advance and management doesn't really give anyone a hard time.
good,"I enjoyed working with the people at Kohl's, it was a good environment. I learned how to read planograms and worked with others on various projects. The hardest part of the job was that at times we were understaffed."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I enjoyed working here as fulfillment associate , getting decent hours was my only issue, they were giving me like 4 hours a week at times.As a first job it was nice because the work was simple for me to do. Didn't have to worry about dealing with customers too often being in the back."
good,"A great place to work if you have good social skills, as a lot of interpersonal interactions occur. Through this job I learned many customer service skills as well as how to delegate tasks to others. All around being able to communicate what you want and to understand what others want is a must!"
good,"Go in at 6 am off by 2pm"
good,"I worked as a seasonal hire. Management and associates were nice. Training was weak, but associates were eager to help train. Hours and initial pay was good."
good,"They care about you and your needs.  Yes, they have rules and regulations but they understand life happens.  I have had issues come up and they have been very compassionate."
good,At kohls i work part time but always had to make sure store was cleaning fixing up after customers and cleaning up dressing rooms. Had to make sure customers were finding everything OK. When i was on the register had to greet them and asked if they would want to apply for rewards or credit card. Kohl's is a good customer service store friendly coworkers/customers.
good,Kohls provides great value to customers with many sales throughout the year. Management works with your schedule and there are opportunities for advancement.
good,Very nice store. Well stocked and well friendly. Problem I had was with the manger she was just not a nice person. But overall I did love the job and it was cool.
good,"The work is good, but how busy you will be will vary day to day. The management will differ store to store in terms of personality but most will just want everyone to succeed at the job."
good,Unload merchandise from truck and organize merchandise on sales floor and in stockroom. Process on line orders and package them for shipment. Assist customers in locating products or recommend alternate product and proving information.
good,The HR Generalists are spectacular. The work is challenging and the associates aren't always easy to deal with but the satisfaction of being able to help people who need it make the challenges worth it.
good,"There's a lot to learn in retail. You develop or enhance your customer service skills, working the registers, scanning merchandise with RF gun for inventory."
good,Kohl's is a fun and organized place to work at. I get fair hours and get appreciated for the work I do. I've learn to work with both difficult and easy customers. I've learn to work with credit card companies and corporate world.
good,"It was more of a learning experience. I am thankful for all that I learned. It was a good experience. I learned the importance of customer service. That is the most important and vital part of our job description. Also, just making sure that we work together to make the day run smoothly."
good,I worked part time hours and always had the option to call in for more. Forklift operating was extremely fun and got me over my fear of heights. Great pay for a first job. The job requires a lot of lifting but none of the boxes are really heavy. You are also on your own for most of the job.
good,"A typical day at Kohl's was challenging but all good ways. I worked in all departments on the sales floor, jewelry, cashier, and mainly in customer service. I learned a lot working at kohl's, I started working there soon after high school maintaining a balance with new college life and work. I learned how to provide great customer service, how to handle heavy amounts of work and different skills how to operate a cashier machine. Hardest part of my job was working long hours during the holidays, but don't let that discourage you, everyone has to put their time in when starting out in the big world. Most enjoyable part was having a great team to work with and everyone recognizing each other."
good,This job was a great experience and fast paced. I loved the managers and my co-workers. I sold a lot of credit my year working there and liked helping customers.
good,"Kohl's was a great place to work. I enjoyed helping all of the customers, and learned a lot about Kohl's and customer service experience. I also liked working with my co-workers and learning from them. However, I wanted to advance to another department as a full time employee."
good,"My typical day at Kohls was always busy but really enjoyable. I used to work on shoe department and everyone used to tell me it was the hardest department in there. Because I always had to make sure all the shoes was organized and in the right box and in the right place, I learned to be more organized and more perfectionists. I was almost always by myself but when I have coworkers working with me, we always managed to fix the entire department by being on different sides. I would be on the women's side and she would be on the men's side or vice-versa. The hardest part of the job was when my handheld battery dies and I had to run to get another one in the middle of a customer question. Or when more than one customer would ask me to get shoes all at the same time when I was by myself. But I always managed to get all the shoes at the same time. If more than one customer asked me for help I tell them that I would be right with them in one sec and they would always patiently wait for me."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,A very fun place to work though not a lot of opportunities for full-time positions or advancement. The discount program was amazing not just for clothing but housewares as well.
good,"The workplace is very flexible, very friendly. They have alot of sales you can shop on your break time and whenever you need help there is always a manager that can help. It does get very hectic in holiday season you must have lots of patience."
good,Kohl's is a relaxed working environment and pleasant place to work.  I loved my co-workers.  I learned that Kohl's is not like large department stores.  It is very unique and the store manager lacks knowledge of how much profit a successful cosmetic and fragrance business can add to the overall success of the store.  He is more interested in saving payroll.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the lack of organization and having to cover jewelry as well.  I believe jewelry is separate from beauty and fragrance.  I completely enjoyed engaging customers in facials and make overs.
good,This was my first job as a cashier and they made it easy for me to work there. I loved working there and loved the people that worked with me
good,I worked there for a short time over the holiday season . Worked with some really good co-workers my manager was awesome. Convenient place to where   I Lived.
good,I worked at the kohls in Burbank as a seasonal associate. At first I was really nervous and I was in the home and kids department. Then they ended up switching me as a cashier cause they needed help upfront. I was pretty mad at first by ended up just sucking it up and dealing with it. They had me watch a video and then threw me on the register. I shadowed a cashier for like an hour and then I pretty much had to learn on my own. They gave really good hours and store manager is super friendly probably one of the best managers I've ever had. However some of the cashiers weren't so friendly. Store was allways a mess from customers especially. Closing hours you didn't get to leave the store till about 1am so that was a bust. If your desperate for a job then apply here. You learn a lot and have to train yourself basically. Black Friday I was the line monitor so glad I wasn't on register that night. I love kohls but I'll never re apply they told me I could but it was to intense. Customers are to pushy and rude. What is up with all the clothing just being plus size not everyone is that size it sucks.
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work.  Able to develop great relationships and the culture is that of collaboration and driving results.  Loved working with some many different cross functional teams."
good,"checking in trailers, checking out trailers watching live viewer cameras on associates. Checking the inventory of products.  riding around the building checking parking lot."
good,"High focus on associate engagement. Flexible schedule. Great benefits for full time employees. Positive atmosphere.  You can have a life because schedule is flexible. Everyone is treated like a family. Good working environment. More work, more pay! ""Employee discount is a great benefit"
good,"A typical day at work can be slow or busy. Ive learned how to deal with not so nice customers by not confonting them about there attitude but by being nice and courtious and when all else fails notify the manager. The management is pretty nice they are a very chill group of people and I can have a normal conversation with them. My coworkers are cool, theyve become my friends and it makes the workplace that much better. The hardest part is probably being bored and not being able to do anything because you are all alone sometimes, but the most enjoyable part of the job is when you work with others they are cool people."
good,The other employees at Kohls are like family and do everything they can to help eachother.  The managers were not the best at playing favorites and were not flexible on hours.
good,"a typical day at work would start with a team stretching session, we will then go over, our previous work day, see how our numbers did on shipping and if we met our shipping requirements for the following day. what I learned form this job experience was the value of electronic and personal orders and the importance of online sales, and how  they determine how many work hours we get a week. the coworkers were cool, they always made it a good work environment no negativity, and made you want to come back to work  the next day. The hardest part about the job would be the long working hours, no time for your personal life but the paychecks made up for it. most enjoyable part about the job were the holidays, they made you feel as if everybody was family and that was cool, especially when your working 15 hour shifts some days, some times weeks."
good,The management staff is well organized with each manager serving a specific purpose. The employee would know who was working that day and how to reach them in any situation that arose.
good,"A typical day at work is coming in and immediately cleaning out all the fitting rooms and making sure the sales floor looks presentable to the customers. It is also to assist with anything the customers need and give them efficient service. I learned how to complete my work with a set time limit and to remain calm in fast and erratic situations. The management at Kohl's is very nice and receptive and they know how to do there job. Co-workers are nice and friendly and the hardest part was making sure the customers needs were met, but in the end you manage to achieve it. The most enjoyable part of my job would be the fulfillment I would feel when I managed to keep my appointed section clean and neat."
good,Kohls is a good place to work. A lot of great mangers and friendly co workers but no hours and minimum wage. The most enjoyable part of the day is going in and taking over. The replenishment time is usually one or two person a shift so when you clock in you become your own boss. The only problem is that the system is setup in the worse way possible so everything is much complicated than it should be.
good,Kohls is a very laid back employment environment in every department except receiving. Management and co-workers were awesome. As long as you did your job nobody bothered you. Very professional workplace and clean as well.
good,"I learned how each different department function; for example, inventory control, picking, packing, receiving and replenishment.  Alot of good proper training.  I enjoyed working with the team and they are really helpful.  The work schedule varies, however, there are apps provided for easy access.  Great for students and schedule flexibility."
good,"It' a great place to work as usually the people, both co-workers and customers, are friendly. It's a place where you have to think on your feet, figure out what needs to be done, how to help people, and know when to ask questions or ask for help. The hardest part is keeping up with the number of customers that may need help at any given time. The most enjoyable part is knowing when you've really helped someone find what they need quickly and that they left happy."
good,"enjoy the job, like working with the people and helping them, management is very helpful, we all work as a team to get everything accomplished."
good,"Kohl's is  good company to work in if wish to further your career in retail, it gives several opportunities to advance in the company"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Kohl's has great benefits like employee discount, fun laidback environment, and fairly flexible hours. Although work is laidback, recovering the fitting rooms is the biggest challenge and getting lots of credits. Retail is laidback but management always pressure the associates to open lots of credits. Another setback is the on-calls. associates can deny an on-call job but we will get angry faces."
good,"Cashier duties that included: Greeting the customers, ringing-up their purchases or applying for a credit-card first if they request it, and putting produces back."
good,"Great co-workers "
good,"Great, fun place to work, but the managers were rude and it was evident that they only cared about the business and not the employee(s) working for the business."
good,"I work the customer service desk so I deal with refunds, returns, adjustments and other problem solving issues.  Providing greatness to my customers is priority."
good,"report to work, staff meeting, what goals had to be met for the day."
good,"I worked evenings at Kohl's. On a typical night, I would go in, ring up items, while answering customers' questions to the best of my ability. I learned the in's and out's of retail. My managers were very helpful especially during my training period. My co-workers were very friends for the most part and they were easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the fast-paced environment during the holidays. I really enjoy fashion and clothes, so the most enjoyable part was being able to ""shop"" while I worked."
good,Kohl's is a nice part time job for kids who are in school and need a little extra money. But since it is part time you shouldn't be looking forward to a lot of hours unless you have open availability and then still you will need another job. A typical day you go in and clock in and get a walkie talkie and ear piece and check the sheet to see were they have you and then check with the Manger who's shift it is to see if they have moved you then you go work. I was very fortunate to have great co- workers and very nice management.
good,"Very fast paced environment centered around giving the customer the best shopping experience. Meeting this goal is often very challenging, and is always rewarding."
good,"The hardest part of the job was standing on my feet for a good five hours attending customers making sure that they felt easily comfortable and at ease."
good,learned  a lot about shipping and also different Equipment to drive to fullfil shipping orders also cross trained in many departments
good,"I started not knowing anything and now I have knowledge in every single position and every single field. I love all of my co-workers and will miss them when I leave. The only complaint I have with management is they don't possess leadership qualities. They put me where ever they needs hands. Whether it's at Customer Service, cashier, Sales Associate, Stock and Replenishment, or Online orders I will always carry out what my plans are for the day."
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work manager always remembers the names of your family when they shop, lots of group lunches and kudos, very easy to learn the business and job rolls and easy to train and advance to positions within the store"
good,"Typical day is busy and very demanding and customers need excellent services"
good,"The overall atmosphere was very positive and productive. The day to day work loading trailers didn't offer much in the way of excitement however the labor did provide a sense of satisfaction in a hard days work."
good,Management was very young in some areas so things didn't always run as smoothly as they can but overall a very nice work environment.
good,"While working for Kohls, I began to further understand what it is like to work in a retail setting. On a typical day, I would be assisting many customers, cleaning up dressing rooms, answering department phone calls, assisting on the cash register when needed, bringing out new merchandise and cleaning up the store before closing. I had worked at two different locations while working for Kohls and each management team was different. The first one was very well organized, very team oriented and was focused on making sure we were doing what we were supposed to be doing and making sure the customer was well taken care of. The other management team was a little bit less team oriented and didn't seem to be as dedicated to their mission. Though this management team was dealing with a less populated store, they could have been more organized and more understanding when it came to personal obligations and customer problems. One of the hardest things about the job was all of the different and difficult customers, but that comes with any retail or customer service job. I did enjoy my co-workers and my first location's management team while I was working there."
good,"I discovered a love for working with customers at this establishment, and have made many new friends both customers and fellow associates. My issue is that after 3 years of loving customer service and can't seem to move to the position. This lack of movement in my work has led me to find a new job. My Recommendation is to start working in one store find what you like then try to get that position at another store with your new experience."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"This is a wonderful place to make friends, have a positive work environment and learn a good work ethic. It is not, however a place to make any sort of living. You will get a maximum of 26 hours per week, except during the holidays, and although it varies store to store, you will most likely get minimum wage."
good,"I loved working there but the ""management"" just got to be overbearing. They always came around took you out of your department made you do something for them then got mad when no one was in your department which they only scheduled one person at a time in on even the busiest days."
good,A fast paced job that will take a lot of effort and endurance. The positive is that the co-workers are fun and enjoyable to work with. It's not for everyone because its overnights but it works for me.
good,"A typical day of work requires me to assist customers and keep the merchandise available for sale. I have learned how to provide customers with a great experience throughout their shopping trip. Management has helped me to become a better employee by working smart and safely to help my coworkers and I to be positive through our working day. "
good,"I worked in Beauty, which is very different from working any other department in Kohl's. The pay was way better and hours weren't bad if you're looking for a part time job. "
good,"The great thing about working for Kohl's is that you get to experience something different on a regular basis.  It is a challenging and rewarding atmosphere.  Pay and benefits are good for members of management, but are severely lacking for part time associates."
good,"A typical day at work would be greeting customers,performing various cashier functions ;such as credit card and check processing. and presuding customers the benefits of opening a Kohl's credit card"
good,we usually start the morning of with a huddle to talk about our daily goals. The one thing I learned is how to back stock and stock purge inventory
good,"I improved my computer skills, learned a lot about design process, fabrics, and seasonal fashion. Nice colleagues, every day something new to do and to learn."
good,"Kohl's was a good job to have, I don't have many complaints. The only thing I did not like was not knowing where I was working when I came in. The environment was fun and stress free with a lot of nice customers."
good,"Arrive in morning and pull my cart of boxes from the stockroom.  Freight team has already begun umlaoding the truck and placed them on a cart for each dept.  If that day the load was big, I would help the flow team process the freight.  Open and process all my freight for the beauty dept.  Stock items where needed, creat space for new items per the communication book (planogram).  Make and check all signs, displays, clean shelves, backstock itmes Im my stockroom, discard all empty boxes."
good,"It's a good place to work at, the only issue I have is they way manage their schedules especially you're a college student."
good,Overall it's decent place to work. Holiday hours are brutal and not much opportunity for advancement. Great that they offered part-time benefits and holiday pay and vacation.
good,"I really did love being an MJM associate, granted sometimes work would be stressful. The coworkers and management were friendly and everyone really worked with each other. The only hard part was zoning after a really busy day because we were short staffed a lot. They would only have one person in each department closing, which was tough. The dock was always messy so finding things and having an organized workplace was tough, but it wasnt too bad. Often times we would have food in the breakroom every now and then, and you get a raise each year based on your performances."
good,"I worked here part-time for almost 5 years.  The best part about working here was the employee discount and flexible hours.  I was able to work around my family needs.  However, the job is more suited to a college student who only needs gas and spending money since the pay is low but probably pretty similar to other retail jobs.  If you are looking for a career I would look elsewhere and if you work here while in college I would not stay more than a couple years.  Most of the employees were really nice which made for a good work environment however the management really stressed store credit card applications and rewarded those who excelled in this area."
good,Kohl's is a great company to work for. Treats employees fairly and puts them first. Constantly thinking of ways to better improve the environment since employees are there more than they are home.
good,the job was not hard people there were nice just as the supervisor. Therre was always something to do so you would be busy through out the day.
good,"Overall, great company to work for if you don't mind working the night shift. A real ""employees first"" based company, they will take care of you."
good,When I was with the Kohl's company the hardest part of my day was having to clock out to go home. The management treated their workers like family.
good,"On an average day at Kohl's I will interact with a multitude of different people including customers, other associates, and managers. I will first greet and interact with other associates and managers before making my way to my position. This position will either be on registers, on the sales floor, or in customer service interacting with the customers on a more professional and specified area. Then I will either finish closing duties or, if in customer service, handle counting down draw and close cash office for the day. After that I am allowed to leave and begin another day at Kohl’s, where you can expect great things."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Kohl's is a great company to work for. The employee discount alone is one that cannot be matched anywhere else. They strive to make sure each area of the store looks its absolute best.
good,"I worked in the children's department, keeping the area neat and easy to access. I came to appreciate the importance of organization and focus. I had a good overview of the department and what needed to be done. I had co-workers who shared my desire to do a good job."
good,"Working there is like working with a family, every one knows each other and we protect one another as we would a family. I would walk in say hi to everybody clock in and its like the atmosphere changes your whole mood. Jena the manager really stresses the fact that there has to be a smile on your face and we all love it. But the hardest part of the job would have to be the pleasing all the people. But I have learned a lot. We cant please everybody because if we did the store would practically be free, but you can change your attitude and please 100 more people a day; that should be he biggest reward."
good,"My experience working for Kohls was mostly positive. I enjoyed the atmosphere and customers. "
good,"Kohls EFC is a great place to grow and work. Every person in a mangement started out as an associate in Kohls. Things USUALLY ran smoothly in a normal work day with few errors. When errors did occur, management was there to look into it most of the time. Working here I gained many skills being able to be cross-trained in almost every department. It is a friendly work enviornment so getting along with my co-workers at Kohls was very easy. Management held strong to their ""open door policy,"" making it easy to talk to the management team whenever a problem arose. The hardest part of my job working at Kohls was probably keeping up  with making my ""numbers"" (the amount of work they wanted done per hour). This probably would have been more realistic if time-trails were ran in order to get the set number to have a standard for what was expected of the employees. The most enjoyable part of my job was definately always having something to do. Being versitile definately helped with this and the company was always willing and good about getting employees cross trained. Overall aside from a few bumps along the way, Kohls is a great company to work for."
good,"•	Count money in cash drawers at the begging or ending of the day."
good,"i really did enjoy working at kohls they are such a caring store and a fun one to work at to. i enjoyed how if there was a big sale on a weekend or so and they knew that it would be crazy when you went to go take a brake they had food for you you, i felt that was a really nice gesture. i dont know if all kohls stores are like that but the one i worked at was and it was very nice, i also liked the people i worked with and the managers where always so upbeat and willing to lend a hand when ever you needed one, that was swell."
good,I worked in a two story Kohl's and it was typically very busy all the time. At the end of the night I had to clean all the registers upstairs and downstairs and put away all the go backs. Also had to dust every other night.
good,Very flexible. Great for a side job or college student needing money. The only thing is when they hire college students the college stdents cause the turn over rate to be so high.
good,"I love working at Kohl's but the compensation is terrible.  I'm happy working there; the staff, customers and managers are all very friendly."
good,"Review customer accounts and correct discrepancies. Balance store safes, registers, armor car pick ups and deliveries. Processed information and finding to reveal employee theft and who was responsible. Worked as a team member and would always think outside the box when needed."
good,"Good Management, very fast paced, great communication between employees and management. Co-workers are very friendly and courteous. Much of my day is repetitive and routine, but it is doable."
good,"I loved working at Kohls. I really wish I wasn't a seasonal worker. I would look forward to coming to work everyday I was scheduled. If anyone needed to get their shift covered, I was always there willing to cover their shift. My coworkers were so friendly and would love to let you know about the store. Every holiday or special event we would always do something involving the entire store. I learned how to keep multiple dressing rooms clean and empty all around the same time. That was also the hardest thing doing while being a cashier. The most enjoyable part of my day was literally all day. I loved my job at Kohls. They make you feel like family and welcomed to the Kohls family."
good,"I worked there and I literally had to do everything. the manager would be somewhere and the assistant managers would be on their phone while i would stock the snacks, cashier, and assist with customers."
good,"As a retail store, the hours and days constantly varied from week to week.  Fortunately my co-workers and subordinates were always willing to pitch in and help wherever needed."
good,its a good work environment. There are opportunities for advancement. Fun team building activities. senior management can be overbearing at times.
good,"A typical day is fun,  because of the people I was around."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Friendly, fun department store to work in that taught me a great deal about marketing and merchandising. I took the job for the purpose of learning more about the retail business and learned much, but realized that retail business was not what I was interested in for the long haul."
good,"watched out for shoplifters, used a camera system on multiple screens, write repots on shoplifters and customer incidents, and keep control of situations and keep everyone calm."
good,"I am in charge of running the Shoe Department. On a typical day, I help customers and keep the department picked up and cleaned. I am also responsible for keeping the proper amount of merchandise on the sales floor for customers. There are four sales associates in my department that responsible for and making sure they are doing what they are suppose to do. I enjoy working with the people and making customers happy."
good,"Day-to-Day is usually very different and keeps things interesting and exciting but working in retail has its drawbacks - working most weekends, blackouts for vacation during holidays, varying daytime and night time scheduling, constant company metrics that need to be achieved daily/weekly/monthly"
good,The store was really hard too keep clean because of constant sales promotions going on and constantly getting new inventory.
good,"Work place was fun, good management and great with allowing a healthy work/life balance. Great co workers can lead to a great work experience."
good,"I was a beauty advisor which gave me a lot of benefits. I did not need to assist any other department at all as I was to focus on keeping my department successful. The hours are flexible and taking time off is not hard. Management was sometimes difficult to work with as there are many managers (store manager, assistant managers, etc.) and you had to listen to each one of them, but each had different goals. The most enjoyable job was the job itself: providing make overs and great advisement on skincare and cosmetics. I loved making a customers day and teaching them on how to take care of their skin/hair and how to improve their cosmetic application technique. The hardest part honestly was keeping up with the amount of things you were responsible for. In the beauty department, you held your own. That means you take care of your own graphics, your own truck freight, maintain your own stockroom, keep up with sales floor changes, AND you must always be ready to help the customers. This is not typical of retail stores as they will have a graphics team or a stockroom team. I did not have this, I was my own team. This wouldn't be so hard if management had made sure I had a full team and when I didn't, give me a hand since it is not possible for 1 or 2 people to run a 4 person department."
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work. The atmosphere and fellow associates make it an enjoyable time at work. It can certainly get challenging at times, but that's just retail. The hours fluctuate pretty regularly when it's not close to a holiday, but again. That's retail."
good,"Enjoyed the job, but not the hours as I did not have time to be with my family.  It was great to be busy all the time and many daily challenges.  Enjoy that part of retail."
good,They mostly offer part-time work with no benefits. Soliciting credit is a must. Being polite and kind is necessary to succeed.
good,I believe everything in life has its pros vs. cons and just like all jobs Kohl's had its own. If one decides to work in retail they will encounter similar issues in various forms. I learned the basic skills of retail and in-turn my worth in the marketplace.
good,"This is a very fun place to work. I enjoy the people I work with. The benefits were really good for part time workers, but they cut out the benefits. It is really easy to get time off if you need it.  Management is good except for some of the upper managers do not following through with their job duties and give it to other people to do. The hardest part of this job is getting credit. Everyone is required to ask customer if they want to open a Kohl's credit card. This company really puts the pressure on the employees to make sure they are getting customer to open up a credit card. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers."
good,"did both functions of collector and customer service,found it hard to go from one mentality to another due to their vast difference.As a collector trying to payment on a credit card.Versus as a customer service being  understanding when products were not available in the store."
good,"This was a starter job, I did while attending the erly years of college. The work was great, and though there were stressful moments, dealing with many customers, associates, and the management; I learnt so much, and helped pushed my abilities further. I am very thankful for the managers I had while I was there, they saw my eagerness to learn, and kept pushing my abilities and experience further and further. The had faith in me, and I rose to the occasion to learn as much as they had to offer."
good,"They expect way to much out of their associates. I enjoy my coworkers, everyone is friendly. I did learn time management and gained self confidence."
good,Kohls was a great company through college as the accommodated me with school and allowed me to transfer to different stores. I have learned many skills in kohls and they have provided me training in interaction skills.
good,"great co workers and good management team "
good,"Typical day at work,  Go in go to inventory desk print cycle count papers, go do cycle count report. Go to desk put back items that needed to go back into location, if did not havwe location I would make location for item, so the items can be picked."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"gained customer service experience"
good,Kinda hard to find other associates when its busy and needed help.
good,"Overall working at Kohl's has been a pretty good experience and a great atmosphere. But the pay is bad because being someone who has responsibilities and bills to pay it is very hard to live off this pay check and almost impossible to make it on your own without any help. Not only is the pay bad, but you do not get set hours, so you may be guaranteed a pay check at the end of the week, but one week may be great with 40 hours and then the next with only 10 hours, even 4 hours. So, you never really know what your pay check is going to be in the following weeks and that's hard to live off of. That is why I say this is a perfect job for a high school student or someone who is just looking to make a little extra cash."
good,I didn't too much enjoy working there but it was good for younger kids who are in high school looking for a job. I first started working there when I graduated high school it is a good starter position. I met a lot of people that were kind and friendly.
good,"This job helps gain many valuable skills in customer service and communication skills. Co-workers were as eager as you to learn and did not hesitate to help you or customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with different types of people and making their shopping experience pleasurable. the managers understood if you had school or something else that had to be done, so they did work with you on making a better schedule for you"
good,"Easy job, long hours, large company, many employees, not a place for growth, jut a job to get you by."
good,the constant work and productivity of this facility was a wonderful experience. I enjoyed the constant movement and clean environment was the best that I have experienced in a warehouse . Friendly people and great management decisions were also a moral booster...made it EASY to want to be at work.
good,"Great place to work. Great work environment. Everyone is there for each other, help each other in depts, teamwork, pitch ins, etc."
good,Kohl's was just a temporary and seasonal employer during winter 2014. I was hired primarily due to the holiday season and to work shifts on or in preparation for Black Friday and Christmas. My typical day would take place either in the stockroom or on the register where I would complete tasks ranging from unloading and merchandising to replenishing the sales floor to customer service. It was a simple and easy job with a good amount of hours and I enjoyed working along side my coworkers for the season. I worked at Kohl's because it was conveniently located close to home and because I enjoy interacting with new people and helping to provide them with a great experience.
good,I would spend my whole check here because they would offer great discounts to employees (we were allowed to stack them up). It's not a stressful job at all so it makes for a great second job.
good,"Management has been always been ready to meet me halfway on problems I have with schedules or assisting me when customer problems go beyond my experience. They are very flexible around school and are understanding of minor mistakes at work. This was my first job so I've learned more than I ever thought about retail, working, and people. Department stores attract an interesting mix of people, most of whom I'd never have spoken to or met without working together. I get on quite well with most of my coworkers and have socialized with them outside of work. The hardest part of the job can be the tough customers typical of retail and the high expectations for sales floor associates. My schedule can be quite hectic throughout the week which is a huge con as I can't make solid plans with anyone until I know what is going on at work. The most enjoyable part of the job are the volunteer events posted through Kohl's wherein employees sign up to volunteer and the company grants $500 to the organization each time the volunteer minimum (at least five associates) is met. Another enjoyable thing is  the fun stuff organized for employees, like mini parties or providing snacks (sometimes even lunch!) and the lenient dress code."
good,"Kohl's is a cool and fun place to work, you get to meet new people everyday and its also fast pace so that it keeps your shift steady and interesting it was a fun experience."
good,"Working at Kohl's was a cool experience for me"
good,"Its a great company and good environment to work. I like it here. I have learned a lot including how to use register, how to deal with conflict, be confident in what i am doing and with my knowledge. Very friendly work environment. The hardest thing about the job is when it becomes busy and you are trying to manage more than one task at a time. Most enjoyable is the people I work with."
good,Only worked there three months and enjoyed helping the people with their needs.  Co-Workers will very nice and helpful when I needed help.  Most of management understood that the customer came first and other misc. jobs came second.  The hardest part was the unloading of the trucks as this took place from 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM and you were locked in the store.  I was not used to working this shift and I did it 2 or 3 times to help out.
good,wake up early  morning and go up to the second floor in the break  room punch in and then go to managers office he would tell me what group to go with and then from there I would unload trucks with store products and when the products were merchandised I would help stock and assist any customers on the floor
good,Was a fun place to work and fast paced. I liked my team leader and the other workers.
good,Helps one to communicate better with those around them. Good customer service help and the staff helps motivate you to reach your full potential.
good,I love working at Kohls because of my co-workers. They keep it fun-filled and its a great atmosphere. Since I have been there the management has gone through so many changes. I know Kohls can be a great place to work but its not my forever job. I am ready to put my degree to good use and expand my horizons.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I work in customer service and deal with a lot of multi tasking.  Answering phones, helping customer, returns, re-tickets, counting registers, handling change orders for managers, sorting returns and media from all registers in store.  I enjoy the variety and it generally makes the time go by quickly.  It can be hard at times when it gets very busy and you are trying to juggle several things at a time."
good,Working customer service desk presented different situations all the time.  Management allowed you to use your judgment in making decisions.
good,"i really enjoyed working with everyone, very laid back environment. handled money and operated the cash register. the most enjoyable part was interacting with all the different types of people."
good,"The store I work at had great co-worker, but hours fluctuated a lot and there is not a lot of room to advance. A normal work day requires performing a variety task everything from unloading a truck to operating a register."
good,It was a great place to work the managers run the store effectively and efficiently. The fellow employee were also great workers. They company has good customer service and goals. I learned how to solicit credit and effectively sell sales. I also learned how to manage various positions.
good,Good experience being able to work with like minded individuals
good,"Greeted customers and ascertained customer’s needs "
good,"- A typical day at work would be joking and laughing with your co-workers while staying professional. Competitions were held to see who could get the highest number of credit applications in a day, whoever won would be rewarded."
good,"Customer Service and Cashier"
good,"I enjoyed work at Kohl's. Here, you can interact with people directly. You can help them on their choice of clothes, jewelry, etc. I learned so many different things like how to train your co-workers, how to convince people to open a Kohl's credit line, how to increase customer service satisfaction rate, etc.  Management are middle strict. Managers and co-workers are friendly, and understandable."
good,Engage with customers all day. Trying to accomplish all job duties on a timely manner. Always staying busy.
good,"--- just okay"
good,"It was only one day but it was very productive, the customers were all really friendly and the co-workers kept to themselves but worked hard."
good,My co-workers are always very helpful and friendly. At kohls management provides us with the tool to achieve our set goals for the day.
good,"Days were very long but yet very rewarding! I had the pleasure of developing multiple leaders and watching them grow into their next assignment. The support from the retail group was excellent, they totally understood the role I had and my ability to assist them in their roles as regional leaders! Partnership was a key part of my success and tenure at Kohl's."
good,"Kohl's was my first job after being a stay at home mom for 10 years. They were wonderful to me, but it's retail."
good,The wages are low for the work load. They expect you to stay late and break your back yet they don't even pay 8 dollars an hr.
good,"Strong reporting and analysis and excellent problem solving ability. "
good,"I loved working for Kohl's, but the ultimate downfall that there was really no room for people to work themselves up."
good,"this job is great, its testing of patients, but in all agreat job, not only do you have great coworkers, but also great managers who truely care. would recommend this job to ne one."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"While I was at Kohl's, there were lots of changes within the company as it grew."
good,A decent place to work and there is advancement opportunities
good,I enjoyed the fast paced environment. BUT there wasn't much room for advancement. they gave you 2 paid 30 minutes breaks a day and had basketball hoops and ping pong tables to use.
good,the working enviroment could have been better. the turn over rate was very very high
good,"fast paced, great coworkers."
good,"A typical work day consists of coming in and making the daily coverage sheet, set moral for all associates, have a team huddle about the daily goals and focus points, assist customers with outstanding customer service, do the cash office and open and close the store. The hardest part would be making sure that everyone comes in to do their job so that everyone is not having to their job plus others. Employees love working with each other and set a very fun and face paced atmosphere."
good,"A typical day starts at 6 am when I go around changing the sign toppers for the particular ad for that day or week. Once all is completed, it is then my task to process freight that has been shipped from the night previous; either to be stocked on the sales floor or put away in a stockroom. During this time, a member of management will undoubtedly touch base with me about the focus of the day; making sure to communicate their expectations and my response of what I need to meet and/or exceed those expectations. When I am given help, it is then my responsibility to make sure they not only understand the job but the urgency of getting it done quickly and efficiently. The hardest part of the job is making sure the signs are operating correctly and providing the most accurate prices for merchandise during a typical sale. Though it seems easy, malfunctioning equipment can just as easily make it that much more challenging. The most enjoyable part of the job is actually the part that is also the hardest which is meeting the challenge head on and surpassing not only the expectations of management but also my own personal expectations. It makes me feel accomplished in contributing to the locomotion of what can most often be described as a well-oiled machine."
good,"I learn how to perfect my job and the responsibilities that come with it. I was working in a warehouse so team work was definitely a priority. Each day I would come to work scan my work id in a work id scanner being our way to clock in and out when it was our shift then I would get a gun scanner to scan the items, and after that we would meet as a unit before we get our day started to focus on goals we can accomplish each day as a working unit."
good,"Ganhei conhecimento quanto à notas fiscais, área financeira, cadastro de mercadorias, e soma de comissões."
good,I have worked several areas in the store. Management encourages cross training and listens to our wants and needs. The work/life flexibility is great. I enjoy the one on one contact I get with customers working in the jewelry department.
good,"I can definitely say that the best thing about working here were the managers. They always kept the associates laughing and pushed us to want to do better. At the end of the night, while cleaning up the store, we all would split into different teams and see which team could get done first. That team had bragging rights until the next shift. "
good,"Overall it was a great place to work.  They were very accommodating to my schedule change needs.  "
good,"I worked as a Shoes Salesperson at Kohl's. I would come in and help out the customers that needed help finding what they needed. I also assisted the Cashiers when there were more than two customers at a time and if I wasn't helping a customer in my department, I would also cover for the cashier's breaks and other department's breaks. So, not only did I work a lot in the Shoe Department, I worked a lot as a cashier too. I got along very well with my department managers. When I worked there, I worked with two different Shoe Department managers and I got along with them both. I enjoyed the management and other co-workers, so it was a fun place to work at. From what I could tell almost everyone got along, so that was one of the great things about working there. The hardest parts would be having to clean up after customers during the holidays, due to the vast amounts of mess that would be left during that time. I didn't like the small amounts of hours I got, but the job itself was good so I stayed."
good,Typically a day at work consisted of cleaning out the fitting rooms and placing clothes back on the racks. I loved closing shifts for the most part and getting to know all the workers and seeing their true fun sides. If you were on the closing teams the managers for that night would also join in and help get it done faster and made the shifts very enjoyable when they were in a good mood.
good,"Great work/life flexibility. Unfortunately, my position was eliminated."
good,"I loved working for Kohl's, but the pay is very meager so it was time to move on.  I worked the jewelry department.  First thing I did diamond counts if they were not right, mayhem broke out ! I did searching through documents, returns, safes to rectify the problem.  I was very good in this situation because I'm a detail oriented person.   The problem usually turned out to be corporate had changed a class or department number without telling the sales associate, so our counts were wrong.  Since Kohl's pays so little, it is a lot of responsibility and was the worst part of my job.  I learned lots of useful skills, I know how to change a watch battery & to remove links from watch.  My co-workers were very nice and helpful.  The most enjoyable part of job was helping customers find just what they needed."
good,"Kohl's turned a lackluster IT department into an area leader in the field.  There were casualties along the way due to some high-risk projects."
good,"My work day usually went by pretty quickly, mostly a fun day"
good,"I came in to Kohls during the holiday season and was surprised to see how efficient and comfortable the work structure was like.  Even during the busiest time of the year where this location sold $3 million in merchandise before 11am, no part of the store was left in shambles or under stocked.  The communication between management and floor crew was consistent even after the holidays.  There was plenty of room for advancement, and I was daily given new tasks and responsibilities.  Not only did I work as a member of adset, but I was given reign over 5 different departments during my time employed.  There were retirement plans and insurance benefits offered, as well as paid vacations, pay raise offered early on, and chances for overtime."
good,I enjoyed working here. They were happy to work around my college schedule. There were too many employees. My hours were reduced to almost nothing.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Helping customers and keeping store profile in tip top shape.
good,A typical day at work would be very slow. Stocking and Cashier counter mainly.
good,"Cashier"
good,"Variety of things to try, very busy retail store. Fun environment."
good,"Assist customers. Replenish certain areas in the store. Unload new merchandise. Some of the managers were very good about helping their employees, but there a few who just gave orders on what to do, never gave any assists. The most enjoyable part about my job was assisting the customers "
good,"I was giving the ability to cross train in all store areas, Enjoyable work environment. "
good,"Kohl's has been a great place to work.  "
good,I liked working for Kohl's because this company really cares about their associates. My store manager was very friendly and understanding when it came to having to take days off for emergencies or other events I had prior commitments to. I had one manager who was not very respectful of others and she did have an attitude problem but I dealt with it as best as I could. The hardest part of my job would probably have to be dealing with this manager because she would always have an attitude problem and it was just really hard to not talk back to her or get upset with her. The most enjoyable part of my job would be being able to connect with most of my co-workers because they were all very close in age to me and most of them went to the same high school I did. 
good,"To unload incoming trailers and scan in all product using an RF scan gun. Check boxes for correct amount, color, style. Label cartons and send down conveyor system to be distributed automatically to its next origin. Very friendly enviroment to work in."
good,"At both the stores I worked at, the teams were fantastic. Working at Kohl's you get GREAT discounts! That's a big plus for shopaholics such as myself. "
good,"I love kohls, there was one rough manager but there was always room for advancement. I got the opportunity to work as a cashier and also an adset employee. It wasnt as flexible as i had hoped and the pay could've been higher because the job requires a lot of labor but overall I enjoyed the experience."
good,Changing ads on all fictures for the following day(s) sales
good,"Working at Kohls was a fun experience, and I made life long friends there. I also gained valuable skills while working there, and my hard work was recognized by management. "
good,I enjoyed dealing with the public and assisting them.  Had a lot of wonderful co-workers.  I love being a cashier.
good,Always busy with working in different departments.I learned how to manage my time.I made sure my department was clean and organized before I went on to break or the next assigniment.My co-workers were very nice and helpful.The hardest part was locating products.The most enjoyable part of this experience was handling departments and customers.
good,I had great co-workers. All the long term employees were hard working and fun to work with.
good,"Its been a nice place to work with opportunities for advancement, and decent wages/benefts...not the best, but servicable. Plus a 15% discount in stores is nice. But it is a large company and the pros and cons are mainly of any large company: so many people, an individual can get lost in the shuffle."
good,Worked in different departments keeping stock out and department in order
good,"A typical day included rounds doing maintenance on equipment and answering calls for equipment being down. On a regular basis, corporate would have projects and tasks that would need to be completed. The only real issue is that management would plan things without giving any hint that something was about to change. They would then spring these plans on you with very little notice to actually prepare or accomplish the task in question."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"during my shift I would help customers at the checkout and fitting rooms. I learned to be efficient, helpful and provide great customer service. The management overall is supportive and rewards employees. co-workers are fun and energetic people. the hardest part about the job is standing around the register for majority of the time. the most enjoyable part is meeting and interacting with new people."
good,"Working at Kohl's is great exercise, while also making new friends and learning teamwork skills."
good,There is a huge focus on customer service with Kohl's. The team is a very energetic crew that is constantly trying to improve.
good,"Overall, I really enjoyed working at the Kohl's call center. However, the hours I was working during the holidays was too much for me, and my work/life balance was distorted. I learned that I prefer face to face interaction with customers."
good,Extremely fun place and great team work. Management is okay but needs some organisation.
good,"Overall not a bad company to work for. Working overnight was fast paced,laidback atmosphere,and good co workers. Only negative was not getting a steady 40 hour work week."
good,"Typical retail environment, work varies with demand. Lots of customer interaction."
good,"Trained for 2 weeks in the Receiving Dpt; learned a lot from not only my trainer but my fellow employees as well. Everyday before we started, we stretched it out, which I think is awesome! I also love that we are scored each day on our performance because it brings a competitive nature among the employees. What I dislike about the company is the no-sick policy! Even if you are on your death-bed, you will watch your 12 occurrences diminish! All in all, it's a cool company. The End."
good,Working for Kohl's was a great experience far a interactions with the customers and the co-workers. Some of the management at the time did not deserve their job.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and theirs great management. The co-workers are nice to be around. However bebefits are no their."
good,"Processed merchandise returns, credit card payments, and questions from customers."
good,Management was very helpful and a good training program. The co-workers were fun and great to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers and having fun with them.
good,"Kohl's seems to be typical for the IT career field in the retail industry - running 400 miles per hour with their hair on fire. Very reactive to the ups and downs of retail, following the real thought leaders in technology, and struggling to make poorly implemented systems run in unevenly supported technical infrastructures. The result is harried IT staff, worn out operations teams, and a definite lack of career advancement for middle management."
good,"Ready to greet customers. Does your department look organized, picked up? New stock that has to be put on the sales floor. Helping each other in making the store look clean and ready for the day. Projects that need to be done and working as a team. Lets keep the store looking organized and to do that we need to help each other out. Team work! At the end of the day, you made that customer feel welcome and have accomplished the purchased that they came in for that day."
good,"I worked ten hour days on the Tower crew we took care of the lines, we made sure they kept running and cleared any jams that might occur. There were three of us and we were kept very busy. Before I joined the Tower crew I did the following-Inboud/Outbound,Pick/Pack and cross trained for almost every job that was to do there. Top quality magement staff they knew what to do. I really enjoyed being with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was being pulled from department to department there were times I had to switch 3 or 4 times in one day. The best part of my job was the great people I worked with."
good,"enjoyable work environment, ability to move up in company if wanting to."
good,"Typical day of work consisted of assisting customer with their shopping experience, cleaning out dressing rooms and putting the merchandise back out on the store floor. Cleaning the sales floor of clothes and other items. Carrying heavy amounts of clothing, folding and merchandising. Occasionally getting called up to do back up cashiering. Most of the management was friendly and helpful, while others didn't even know your name. All of the people that worked on the sales floor with me were very customer focused, friendly and helpful. Nice people to work with. The hardest part of the job was handling large quantities of clothing and getting it back out on the sales floor and keeping the sales floor clean. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers with their shopping needs."
good,"A typical day at work includes maintaining fitting rooms, organizing, cleaning and assisting customers. I learned that that team works helps get ultimate tasks completed. Management is supportive and makes the store runs smoothly. Co-workers are amiable, friendly, and tried to help as much as possible."
good,busy daywork. learned how to use the registeres and other departments other than my department. management was great. Co-wokers were nice and friendly. most enjoyable was helping the customers with the items they are looking for having them leave satisfied.
good,"good place to work, good people, good managers wish i was paid more"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,My typical work day starts at 6 am. I work with a bunch of great people. We have fun and all get along and joke around together while getting our work done. The hardest part of the job is well there is no hard apart if we all work together. My most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help people find the things they need.
good,"great place to work, friendly and really family oriented as well as room to move. scheduling is very flexible"
good,"The company had many things to learn and do on a daily basis and the managemnt staff was vey nice an fun to be apart of daily. The shifts and co-workers varied and made the position nice, the different departments each had unique things to learn. There was no real hard part of the job especially when you learned how to do the requirements for that depatment(s). My most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with customers and assist them with findling the products that they needed for either themselves, family, friends,co- workers etc."
good,"If you are looking to go out on your own, then running a retail store the size of Kohl's is a good place to start. I gained knowledge that I lean on today, such as managing people, scheduling, customer service, store presentation freight management and more."
good,co- workers are good and everybody likes to work as a team.
good,A typical work dayat kohls was peroidically busy . it's one of the best department stores in the retail industry.It was an great experience and I've grown to want more in terms of a career.
good,"Most managers had great motivation skills for sales boost, others lack a little team leadership skills (or lack of leading by example) . Some employees hard earned work goes unoticed or rewarded"
good,"Early in the morning, I worked in the warehouse dock, where we had to unload freights. Later in the day, I worked on the floor, assisting customers and also worked as a cashier."
good,Kohl's is a great place to work. I work with a great team of talented and friendly people.
good,"My day depeneds on any projects that need to be done. I am specifically in charge of doing Re-Wraps which is when I discount merchandise which has been opened by customers. I do price changes, merchandising of new clothes and cashier work."
good,"A typical night was unloading the truck and stocking/back stocking the merchandise. I learned some of the ins and outs of overnight stock. Management was great, they really new what they were doing. My co-workers were an odd bunch, but they did their best at their jobs. Hardest part was the repetiton. And the most enjoyable part was breaks and quittin time."
good,Kohls is a fast paced work environment that emphasizes on customer satisfaction. When in need the entire floor sales team was always willing to assist co workers with projects. We also worked together to ensure all customers had a good and easy shopping experience. One of the things that i liked the most about this company is that when it got tough the supervisors and managers rolled up their sleeves to work right along side of the associates.
good,"As the operations/merchandising area supervisor I was the primary opener. I would begin my day with assessing the condition of the building and addressing any opportunities before store opening. I would be responsible for the entire truck unload process as well as any other event we had going on (price changes, visual, ad set). Once the truck is unloaded I would be responsible for assigning tasks for merchandising and holding team accountable for timeframes. While the team is merchandising I would be responsible for re-loading the truck with all outgoing freight while ensuring the condition of stock room was to company expectations. During a non truck day I could be doing anything from new merchandise sets, building new fixtures, visual or MOD and running the store alone. At Kohls I learned a lot about operations. I was in control of final inspection of all outgoing RTV's, callbacks, damages including fine jewelry. I also received cash office training. My co workers were great! We had a diverse staff so it was great getting to know so many people with different backgrounds. One of the challenges that stands out is having multiple key associates call out during a key shift like opening or closing. I enjoyed working for Kohls! We were very involved in our local communities and gave back a lot. I enjoyed working black friday the most! We put so much into being ready for that day and most customers are so nice and happy for your help."
good,Overall enjoyable work environment despite somewhat physically demanding work environment
good,I used to be on the register everyday and while cashing customers we used to get an insentive for opening kohls credit card it was fun and exciting.
good,Going to my area were i was told were to work for the day.Keeping your area cleaned from the dressing rooms and going to get the returns to bring back to my area to be put away. If my area was good i went to go help others in there areas that need my help.Filling areas on the racks from the back. To filling the empty spots.I learned to make sure that I kept up on your area. And what you needed to fill them spots.The management to me was fair.My co-workers were good to me.The hardest part of the job was learning to keep up with the pace.The most enjoyable part of the job was getting the hang of it and helping other areas that needed my help.
good,This company is really organized. Everything was is order they management was also very nice and encouraging.
good,"bizzy, some day longer than others"
good,Every day was a new experience. They tried their best to make sure employes had a good work and life balance. They ensured that family was most important.
good,In by 5 am got ameeting every morning . Right after meeting got a stockpicker and checked it for safety. And started to work . Picking orders or putting away.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"This is a very good ""first timer"" job. You learn alot.You interact with people alot. You are always on your feet and up and moving. You also learn to work many different positions. No two days are the same."
good,A fun place to work but however only a full time job during the holiday season .
good,great experience working an a warehouse learning how to pack orders and loading and unloading trucks
good,"Very fast-paced environment. Work loads can be a bit overwhelming, but can be done in the required time with a positive attitude. I've learned to multi-task and prioritize in Kohl's. I have also learned how to overcome the stress of working with those that do not do what is asked of them. Most of the time I can get things done by myself quicker. When things are not being done, I take the job into my own hands and complete it."
good,I truly enjoyed my time at Kohls. My managers were understanding and my co-workers were fun. I felt the staff and the customers were always treated with respect. Kohls values their employers enough to work with scheduling needs. The only thing I did not like was the pay but this would be great for someone looking for a second job or a teen just starting out in the working world.
good,you get to work with great peole in a somewhat fast paced enviorment. you help out customers with whatever they need you work a very easy schedule great for part time employment
good,"As a sales associate you are assigned to a department each day when you go to work and basically keep that department clean. You will also be answering customer questions, helping customers with finding an item at another store, or helping them order it through the internet kiosk in the store. Moreover a sales associate will do some cashiering when help is needed throughout the day. I learned that customers can be complete slobs and if you are by yourself on busy shopping days in your department for even just an hour you will be drowning in fitting room clothes. Management is really good about getting you help when you need it though they sometimes say something else to the customer about prices at the register when you have already told the customer one thing. The people I worked with were awesome. As long as they pulled their fair share and did the work alongside me all was well. The job is as much about communicating with fellow associates as customer service. The hardest part of the job was when the Christmas season would role around. Customers were more rude and there was always an excessive amount of work that needed to be done and not enough associates to handle it. The best part about working at Kohl's was the people. The coworkers I had were great and knew just how to lift my spirits on the job including management."
good,A typical day at work was mostly helping customers find what they needed and hopefully helping them save a little more money by opening a credit account for them. I learned a lot about what the Kohl's corporation expects of it's employees and how the company itself operates. My coworkers were what made the day more enjoyable and my management for the most part is included in that statement. I don't know that there really was a hardest part to this job.
good,Kohl's Department Store is a fast paced job and it is a good place to work while in college because they usually work with student school schedules. But when it comes to communication between management and employees they tend to drop the ball often. They like to do things a certain way even if it is less productive than a different way.
good,"Kohl's provides a challenging position, that allows me to maintain a proper work life balance. The vision set forth by our leadership group is inspiring and gets my buy in. Most companies talk about putting their customers first, but I feel that Kohl's lives that idea in all functions. Our Kohl's Cares initiatives gives me the opportunity to give back to the community in a fun and useful format. I wish I would have made the jump to this company much earlier in my career."
good,"Good and fun working environment, everyone at kohl's is friendly. I enjoy working there because of the costumers and the associates. The only downside is your hours will be cut around the beginning of the year."
good,"Most days were early morning dashes to work to be greeted by my boss's Blasting energy as we unpack the trucks and enjoy our day."
good,Walk around the store trying to deter or catch people attempting to commit theft. It's not easy. It requires patience and precision but its a very rewarding job emotionally.
good,Working for Kohls was a learning experience. It was quite difficult to figure out what I was actually suppose to do because the training there was very minimal. I was put in home and kids and I feel like I could've recived a little more training. Other than that it was not too bad.
good,"I loved working there, but once the holidays ended, they would only schedule me up to 8 hours a week. I'm a college student paying for 100% of my tuition."
good,Proactive employer who is concerned with the customers positive experience. Kohl's is a highly  motivated company that strives to ensure each customer has an excellent experience while simultaneously ensuring the employees feel valued.
good,This job teaches me problem solving skills and allows me to display my leadership skills. The managers are friendly and always willing to help. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to interact with customers and other associates.
good,Enjoyable environment to work and communicate with others my age (high school). I learned how to better my time management and communication skills. Highly recommended.
good,"The job was good and all, but the walky talky system was very sketch and it was hard to communicate with a manager or another employee, which made it hard to communicate when you were taking a break or going on lunch"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Very standard retail job. Management is usually effective and good at working with the associate on tasks. This will very from store to store and as managers come and go but all in all a good choice for students needing part time. Though I can't speak to making a full career out of retail employment.
good,"Good benefits, Its always busy and the only bad thing is that they want you to stay longer than schedule sometimes."
good,"I could see at the end of the day what I had accomplished.  Kohl's is a very customer focused job, so you must have great customer service skills to work there. It can be discouraging when a customer is arguing with you over something you aren't allowed to do and a manager just immediately makes an exception for that customer. It often feels like the management does not back you up, but rather will back up the customer at every chance.  So, although your job is to help all the customers, it can sometimes feel like you are at odds with them due to the lack of support from management.  Despite this issue, I really enjoyed my time at Kohl's.  In the store I worked at, I was often placed in any department depending on our staffing, so I was able to work in Misses, Juniors, Mens, Shoes, Jewelry, and at the registers.  This flexibility in departments was challenging, but also resulted in a more fun environment for me because it offered a break from the usual routine."
good,Great place to work when first starting out or if you are looking for a long-term retail job. Management can be great and the culture there is relaxed.
good,it was a good experience for the past 6 years with many different skills learned. It taught me a lot of different qualities and how to deal with every situation that is thrown at you
good,"I worked there seasonally and it was ok. Pay was ok, but sometimes there was not enough hours. Was not kept on after season but knew that going into the job. Overall would work there again as a second job if needed."
good,It’s a great place to learn an work with other an quick to Remote good pay an hard working people it’s also not only a nice work Environment but fun as well
good,"When originally hired I was only trained for common register tasks. But then as my time working there increased at Kohl's I was somewhat trained to do customer service tasks, online pickups, and use handheld devices from different departments."
good,"I learned a lot at Kohl's. If you do what is expected of you the workday is pretty enjoyable. The other employees are willing to help you out and answer any questions. If you ever need to switch shifts with someone, they make it easy to do so."
good,"They are flexible with schedules, they are willing to work with you if you need the time off. Coworkers are friendly and there is a good working environment."
good,"Everyone at Kohl's was friendly and made sure to help out one another when it comes to finding a product or helping out a customer. However, when understaffed a lot of work is put on people which the pay should be more based on the amount of work and dedication is put in when working there. There would be times I would do extra work needed to make sure the store is accessible for customers foaround."
good,A typical day at Kohl's consists of signing in and heading straight out to the floor. There is almost always something you can or should be doing in order to keep busy. The management is always available to help you out and answer any questions as well as other associates. When the store in particularly slow your shift may feel equally slow going and during the holidays make sure to expect longer hours as well as earlier opening shifts and later closing shifts.
good,Good place to work if u like retail. Not good pay and they don't like to give raises but they do make us lunck a few times a month for us when meet production goals
good,"Truly enjoyed the team members...my las supervisor made the job mor enjoyable and competitive. Management has issues, every job I've ever worked bt team mates are fun."
good,"I had a good time working for Kohl's. I was able to move up from floor worker to cashier to customer service associate in a short period of time. I very much enjoyed working the customer service booth, except at the holidays because returns are EXTREMELY hectic!"
good,Assorted merchandise by the truck loaded according to store location built pallets and clean warehouse floors to assure team members safety used pallet jack on occasion
good,"A typical day at work for me is walking in, clocking in, and grabbing my walkie talkie. After that I ask where I am going to be for the night. If they give you a department you have to keep up with the fitting rooms and recover the whole department. Some days they put me on the registers where you check customers out and gain a lot of customer experience."
good,"A normal day in customer service would be to help customers with questions they have, if they need to make a kohl's or amazon return. we folded and hung the returned clothes and made sure the customers were happy with their visit."
good,This is a place to work. People are nice but I don't feel there is any organization. Also the pay is not very well for the amount of work I do. I go in not knowing what to expect I am going to be doing.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I liked the job. It was seasonal with the possibility of being permanent. The supervisor talk to you any kind of way. You have to have a strong work ethic there.
good,"Was a great start to begin building your career path. Learn multiple areas of the business, and meet great people. Multiple paths to grow, and multiple areas to continue to develop your skills in."
good,"There is a variety of training across multiple roles.  I change from day to day what I do upon arriving at work.  Some early mornings unloading truck, some days inside store on register or working with customers.."
good,"My managers and coworkers were always helpful and answered any questions I had. Kohls was my first retail job and I feel that it greatly educated and prepared me."
good,"Kohls is a very enjoyable company to work for.  The staff and management are competent and overall it is a productive company."
good,"Working as a truck unloader, Kohl's will make you work a repetitive task that will allow for you to perfect it. It is not too difficulty but youll often get more hours if you desire. The environment is friendly and the other team members are helpful."
good,The most enjoyable moment at Kohl's was solicit credit met a lot of people and helped them to save a lot of money. Wonderful store and assistance manager at one time.. Lot of different culture worked in the store... I learned a lot about different charity that Kohl's make donation too.
good,"Always hiring,  can't keep quality workers. Need to pay a little more. Discounts are great. MANAGERS NEED TO ANSWER ASSOCIATES WHEN THEY CALL THEM. LACK OF COMMUNICATION. Reviews need to be done. In a timely manner"
good,"You meet alot of people. It may be like a revolving door of people working there,however, there are people who worked there for years who are cool. I know people who moved up in positions and some who stayed."
good,"fun environment, enjoyed the people I worked with. I learned a lot about the operations side of the business and the logistical. No sense of accountability with in the local store."
good,I worked as a sales associate at Kohl's. The management was great and drove success. I enjoyed working with my coworkers. The working environment was great! The only problems were that we were woefully understaffed. This understaffing affected everything. We would have to stay almost an hour (sometimes longer) after the time we were scheduled to leave to clear out the fitting rooms and take the items from the cash registers back to where they belonged on the sales floor. This meant that if you were scheduled until 11pm you may not leave until midnight at best. This impacted my productivity at school the following day. If you don't mind working late this is a GREAT job!
good,"I work with great people and have good managers, hours could be a little better. Pay needs to increase and benefits for part time workers. The hardest part of the job is unloading trucks, most enjoyable is just being around people who enjoy their job."
good,The store was very organized. Every employee had their area that they focused on and the crew got along great together. Isn’t high paced unless during a holiday or promotional time period.
good,I liked my position as a truck unloader and stocker..I loved the fact that we stayed busy and moving at all times while working. I think that if I we're offered to come back for that position I would take it
good,The company in itself is great. Great employee discount. They are usually flexible with scheduling and sometimes allow you to cover for someone else if they call out. When the holidays are over and there isn’t much to do hours got cut to 5hrs a week at times and that is not suitable for someone who relies on that as an only source of income.
good,Great people to work with and kinda fun environment. Always something new to see and work on. Meeting new people and learning new experiences. It was a great place to work.
good,"its actually a really enjoyable place to work for. my co workers are amazing, and everyone is incredibly helpful. some of the management could be better, and training in certain areas could be better"
good,I did enjoy my position at Kohls. They pay is low. I loved working with the public and Management allows you to do your work unsupervised. If you are needing help in a department it can be tricky . They work with a limited amount of people at all times.
good,Kohl’s had a nice work environment and the other employees were nice and helpful it was just very difficult to get credit cards because you had to pressure customers into it. And if you didn’t then you didn’t get a credit which is bad.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Make the best out of a good situation and you will be alright easy work great people clean environment and a lot of great people that's willing to help
good,This is an EXCELLENT company to work for!!! They provide all benefits and they also have a 401k program to help you with retirement. The work atmosphere is relaxed for the most part (except when there was urgency to get orders out) and there’s not really a dress code. The only cons in my opinion were the hours because you will have to work 10 hr days but if you don’t mind then it’s cool. Overall can’t. say enough good things about kohl’s.
good,"It was a pleasurable experience, I was able to use my customer service skills, organizational skills and much more. I enjoyed assisting customers with clothing selections, providing them with savings on purchases and promoting Kohl's charge card. Schematics display set up and floor recovery and product representation."
good,"I worked at kohl’s for 3 years. Then rejoined as seasonal employee. Over all environment is very good. You must do your job accurately that is all what makes you perfect. "
good,"I mostly worked on the cashier especially during the busy holidays like black Friday and christmas, But I saw more work being done when I was out on the floor cleaning and restocking."
good,"I’d definitely recommend this position for anyone looking for their first time job. Even though the pay isn’t great, it’s a great learning opportunity. Based on my own experience, if you’re looking for a more rewarding position, try to work at the register. Management prioritizes getting credits over most other things, and the best opportunity for that is at the register."
good,"if you work with unloading trucks, it is very fast paced and tough work, early in the morning. but if you work the floor, it is very slow paced and easy."
good,"Typically dealt with angry customers about returns, refunds, ect. Managers made it very easy to still enjoy the job and learn how to acquire problem solving skills."
good,I enjoyed my time a Kohl's but I struggled a little with schedule. Kohl's is a great place to work if you are single or married with no kids. The schedule was not exactly kid friendly especially during the holidays sometimes I was leaving at 1am or 2am because everything needed to be zoned before you are dismissed from work. However the managers there were really great people.
good,Good Company with good employee culture and work/life balance.  They value employees.  Integrity is valued at this Company. Competitive pay is a challenge.
good,"Overall, Kohls is a great place for someone who has never had a retail job previously. Pay is a little low, but it is okay if part time. Depending on what position they put you in, you may have a different experience here."
good,"Lots of diversity, great camaraderie, integrity very important.  Very fast pace, no nonsense, but fun.  Some pressure to obtain credit apps.  Supervisors are very helpful and supportive."
good,If you’re looking for a good first job I would definitely recommend kohl’s! You get lots of customer service experience and the hours are fairly reasonable.
good,Easy job. Paid every week. Great additional hours availability. Low compensation. Management is one of the best I have worked with/for. Most associates are friendly.
good,"I learned from Kolh's that the amount of preparation a store does is a reflections to their quality service. I realized when working there that management and employees must successfully combine their observation and active efforts to maintain a level of presentation in order to upkeep a competitive yet thoughtful environment. Apart from wonderful discounts the staff there is polite and genuinely interested in upkeeping both customers and workers pleased. Labor is as intense as anywhere else like it but when completed, the joy of completion is a boost of satisfaction throughout your day."
good,"Every job has its challenges, but overall a good place to work.  There were the nasty customers and some drama between coworkers, but if you don’t let that bother you it is a good place to work."
good,I enjoyed working at Kohl’s. I never spoke with the manager but a couple of times; one being when I was initially introduced to him. They are pretty flexible in working with you. I found it to be well-balanced with my family life. I enjoyed the interaction with the customers and working the cash register.
good,"The company overall is great. Great discounts, fast promotion if you're willing to put in the work. Retail sales is demanding. With the right leadership and culture anything is possible."
good,Fast pace work environment. Kohl's has good benefits and discounts on merchandise. At certain times of the year overtime is available. Management treats everyone with respect. I only left because I was a part time employee and the hours no longer worked with my main job.
good,"Kohl’s has great discounts for employee especially during the holidays. Pay is lower than most retail stores. Always short staffed but managers, supervisors and scheduler are very accommodating."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,It was busy but manageable. I liked playing santa. I would pull online orders for the customers to pickup. Help out in the store where needed and assist customers.
good,I enjoyed my job there as a department supervisor . It was fun but hated the fitting rooms and having to back up  at the register. But I enjoyed  merchandising and making the department looking nice .
good,"Kohl’s was my favorite place to work. Granted I can be a little shy, but it was easy to talk to customers and help out where it was needed. If only the position was not only seasonal. I would’ve loved to stay there."
good,I have worked retail at Kohl's for 2 years now as a sale's associate. And it requires you to have the passion or drive to be a team member in order to keep going.You are on your feet the entire shift unless you work 6+ hours and its a fast paced store to work in.
good,"They have benefits, flexible schedule, employee recognition. Typical retail job. Employee discounts are probably the best part about working for the company."
good,I took my experience from other retail stores and used it here. Very friendly staff and learned more about the company and how things work. Great for people to have a first job and want to wrok their way up.
good,It’s a nice company to work for if your looking for a little something temporary. They are really flexible with adolescents since most of them go to school.
good,"Overall I really enjoy the benefit of working with this company. The only downfall is the pay, with economy where its at 9 dollars an hours is barely enough, but not enough for someone with an family unless its for extra cash."
good,The job was fairly straightforward with what was to be done and how to do it and I felt very comfortable with it. The pay however is lacking and there were some scheduling conflicts around holidays.
good,"Management treats you very well & shows appreciation for what you do frequently. Throughout each month, food is brought in or catered to celebrate birthdays, holidays & special occasions like the Superbowl. When they ask people to work longer than scheduled to finish a project, they frequently reward everyone with bagels & donuts for breakfast or pizza for lunch. Management really tries hard to make a very positive environment for workers but hdqrtrs is very restrictive with hours & the pay is minimum wage unless you work the occasional overnight or holiday hours for $1-2/hr more. They hire people constantly, telling them they'll average 16-20 hrs/wk, but many quit within a week or 2 when they see they're getting scheduled for just 4 hrs a wk. Current workers aren't getting enough hrs. It's expensive to train a new hire, so it seems the money would be better spent paying the loyal, hard working employees they have more & offering them more hours. It's a revolving door of new hires, & sadly, good workers have to leave because they just can't get paid enough & have to accept better offers. There are opportunities to cross train in different jobs & openings for advancement are 1st offered to current staff. Best recommended for seasonal work...beyond that, the hours are pretty inconsistent. There is no full-time for nonmanangement."
good,I enjoy working at Kohl’s. I love my store manager. She’s very nice and accommodating to people’s schedules. Scheduling is flexible. I love the people I work with and feel very comfortable there.
good,"I enjoyed working here, the only thing was that i had to remind them several times about my availability. I had 4 managers, and 3/4 were amazing to work with."
good,"Great place to work! Loved my job."
good,I worked part time and management was very flexible with me being a mom. They would provide lunch during the holidays and made the craziness fun. Not many full time positions.
good,"need to be flexible, employees are good but don't have much benefits offered for part time employees.. and so with working days offered.. I needed more time to work"
good,"We would strive every day to get customer service scores. It was all we focused on. Our raises, if any, were based on our STORE performance, instead of individually. I got a 15 cent raise one year. We were told every single night that our customer service score was low and we needed to do better. We could be the happiest, smileliest person, and still be doing poorly because no one cares to take a survey."
good,"While retail itself is not inherently difficult work, dealing with rude customers or difficult customers on a daily basis can prove to be stressful. Management for the most part was consistent and would provide support in line with company vision/goal."
good,Very welcoming and supportive of newly hired staff. Weekly incentives to meet credit goals and create atmosphere of fun work environment. Management does a good job of recognizing  and rewarding team work and for achieving credit goals. Employees encouraged to manage up co workers.
good,"Working at Kohl's is simple, easy and can be fun. As a sales associate I learned several areas of the store from front end to displays and dressing rooms. Customers can be difficult, but that happens everywhere."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Having not worked in retail in quite some time, I can say that it was quite the learning experience.  I picked up several new skills that can carry over to my full-time work."
good,"Work part time here while going to school. The environment is friendly and and I enjoy being around my co workers. Some customers can make your day while others can be annoying. (like the ones that get unreasonably angry about not being able to save $5 with a coupon and make you call a manager.) I'm not a fan of the 89 system, especially if you're busy or trying to plan your break. If they scheduled more cashiers accurately or fixed the system all together it would be fine. (I'll be called from the back of the store to get on woman's registers but by time I get there the line is completely gone, wasting my time walking across the store and creating more work for the people on the registers.) The pay is hardly competitive for how much you do there in my opinion. There's a lot of things I could nit pick but I suppose it's that way with most places. Overall my time there wasn't bad but I'll be glad when I move on to the next job."
good,"Given the nature of retail, it's rollercoaster paced with competitive, up-to-date fashion merchandise. The store manager is customer service oriented and genuinely cares for his store. The diversity is high which makes the work environment both fun and challenging."
good,Great place to work.. awesome  discounts... but I was temporary...store manager did not keep me  even though  she said i was an excellent worker.. but other than that nice place to work
good,The job is very flexible and has a good environment atmosphere but the pay is not adequate to the work. The hours are not very consistent either. but they are easy to come by if you really need them.
good,It is a good environment  everyone gets along and works well with each other. The only issue is the training isn't showing you where everything is put you have to guess on where clothes are suppose to go. Everything else is well organized other than that.
good,I only worked holiday seasonal position and it was a quick paced job of resetting the store overnight for the next morning's arrival of employees and customers.
good,"Kohl's is a very good job for anyone starting out from high school or in search of a job helping customers. They teach you how to be a great sales associate, especially on the front end, selling credits to customers."
good,This is a nice part time job fir a little extra cash but definitely not enough pay or hours for cost of living. Not enough customer service to cover the store.
good,"A lot of customer service experience, flexible hours, and decent management but not a lot of variety in day-to-day responsibilities and not a lot of pay."
good,The manager system at Kohl's is very good. The manager are very professional. The employees are very friend with each other. Everyone is treated fairly and equally.
good,Kohls is a great place for part timers the pay isnt great but the enviroment is. Kohls is a store where if your not in mangement your not making any money. So if youare looking to have a part time job then by all means kohls is a great place but for full time it isnt worth it
good,"Typical day at kohl's was either working at customer service dealing with customer exchanges, returns, and any other issues regarding payments/ signing up for a credit card. I also worked in the stockroom where I unloaded trucks two times a week along with merchandising the products to the floor before the store was open. I also was the OMNI supervisor over the Thanksgiving/ Christmas time of 2018 where I was doing overnights picking products throughout the store and packing customers orders that they ordered online and getting them bagged or boxed and ready for UPS pick up the next day."
good,Working at Kohls is a great job to have when in high school or college. The environment was fun and I enjoyed who I worked with. Although the only bad part was it could get very boring at times.
good,"A typical day can be busy or slow depending on the volume of the business ."
good,"I learned a lot working at Kohls, and everyone there is so nice and willing to answer all questions and help you learn different things.  As it is retail it's understandable that the store would be open on many holidays, but everyone feels the same way about it and supports you."
good,"It was a very fun place to work; workmates were friendly and always willing to help. However, the store manager was not very nice and only cared about making money."
good,"Unload product from trucks, inventory process, and shelving. While providing customer service to inquiring customers.  Product knowledge is good advantage of the position"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I didn't work there for long but the people seemed nice. I had one friend from school working with me so we kept each other company. My favorite part of working there was organizing the clothes.
good,"With good managers its an easy job. There's snacks or events happening almost every week if we meet sales goals or "
good,okay so ima keep it real it's a good second job or a good job for teenagers or people who stay at home still the worst part to me is EVERY morning hearing about okay u HAVE to get two credits majority shoppers have a card so that's what's stupid about it and if u dont they just harass you more BEST parts are discounts and by u being there u kind of get first dibs on clearance 3-4 a year u get 35%plus your 15%off everything but honestly that's the only good part and all I wore was black shirts black leggings and slippers everyday oh and far as breaks its stupid u only get two breaks and a lunch if u work 8 hours if less u get like 15min break 20min break and sometimes a lunch
good,"I mean, its a warehouse.. so yes you get dirty, and yes you get tired. BUT its crazy to say they make it fun to work here. The morale of everyone around you is so high. Its highly motivating and it makes you forget that you are in a big dirty warehouse. They aren't strict about phones being out, and they are always pushing you to work harder. Its a team effort at kohls."
good,Started working hear after I was laid off of my first job. The hiring process was very professional and they contacted me right away. The managers are great! The only downside is if you aren’t good at convincing people to sign up for stuff they can get on your back about that. Training was a little iffy and it can get hectic quick. All in all I highly enjoy the job and have made many friends
good,Fun place to work and they always did stuff for the employees to show appreciation. The managers are sometimes a little rude but the HR staff is amazing.
good,"It's a very busy store, especially during the Holidays. The staff and managers were amazing. The pay wasn't enough and you can't rely on only working there if you want to pay your bills."
good,Kohls  was  a great place  to work at  mangement was understanding learened different forms of business culture  was family based we all felt  welcome
good,"The manger are wow. They treat you like a family. The hours are slow and it is part time as well."
good,I actually worked at two different Kohl's stores.  One was large and the other much smaller.  Very different work environments and scheduling.  The smaller store had the hardest time with scheduling.  Overall I enjoyed staff and my job duties.
good,"ok place to work, nice people , fun environment, lots of work on days that they have shipment but it makes the time move fast because you are constantly moving around and assisting customers"
good,"If you are looking to gain experience, or have a limited schedule this is a great company to work for. Schedule flexibility is great. The pay is a little low but that is to be expected with a job that requires very lo ittle experience."
good,The holidays are the toughest times to work. The culture of Kohl's is very team based. I learned a lot about customer service and sales experience. Work with a wide range of people  every day. Everyday I learn something new.
good,"The customers were amazingly friendly, and management was amazing. Not many hours and the pay wasn't so nice there was no benefits but it was an amazing atmosphere and would work there again."
good,"it was a decent retail job. management was rude and didn’t allow much freedom to do your job. if the job got busy, you were not allowed to take a break."
good,Loved the People and most of management. A few were not as good but it's a great job for someone who is good with fast paced work and  there is no stopping there of the amount of people
good,I really enjoy the job.  Just would like more hours.  More money would be nice too.  The raises are to little.  Great for students.   They really are flexable with the schedule.
good,"In the point of sales position, the biggest headache is having to ask every customer if they have a Kohl's charge. If they do not, you were required to ask THREE times. I actually had customers get so frustrated by the second or third mention of the charge card that they yelled at me, and even a few walked out."
good,When the day would start we would unload the trunk as a team and after we get stared on stocking the shelf. We like to work as a team so we would all work together until it got done
good,"Very busy, usually over 100 calls in the que when I arrive at work. My team members are like family. Everyone is friendly and helping each other with difficult calls. Managers are there to answer all questions. Hardest part about the job is dealing with irate customers. Loved the fact that Kohl's has town hall meetings quarterly to keep us updated and informed about new things and important changes to the company."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Temporary Seasonal Position there, in the two months I spent there I felt welcome and treated as a valued member of the team. Fair pay and hours, surrounded by a fast paced and engaging position."
good,"Fun work environment. Friendly colleagues and nice managers. Unfortunately, the pay was low. I had a hard time making ends meet with the salary offered."
good,"Nice place to gain experience if you've never had retail experience. Fast paced,  especially during the holidays. Co-workers are nice for the most part.   Store is kept clean.  Custodial staff are great."
good,"A typical work day is pretty simple: Show up, clock in, light stretches, check for station (if applicable), and stay active. "
good,"I love the people I work with however managers are a tad lazy, there is favoritism, and the pay could be better for dealing with spoiled customers would come in being disrespectful to which we aren't allowed to defend ourselves."
good,"It was fun while I worked there i didn't like however, that in order to stay on, since i was seasonal, it depended on how much credit I sold but i would recommend working here, they give great discounts."
good,"It was working in the warehouse which was cold in the winter and hot in the summer. Everybody worked hard to get the job done, mostly for the sale merchandise."
good,"Kohl's managers are a very ambitious and down-to-earth type of people. They know their goals and do their best to reach it, with the comfort of their employees in mind. It was my first job and they've taught me a lot in my short time of being there."
good,"I loved the job. I made so many friends that it felt like I was there for years rather than 3 months. I would definitely work there next season and I would recommend everyone else to work there as well. However, because of the complex coupon system, you will have a few cranky customers in your experience there. Otherwise, great place to work."
good,"I always enjoyed working at Kohl's in Fairfield until pretty recently. The store was very organized but now that management has changed it is chaotic and stressful. It is also frustrating every year when they hire seasonally they give all the new people all of the hours and I'm lucky if I get 8 hours in a week. "
good,"Wish i could have worked their longer....                    "
good,"It's generally like every other retail job--- you organize, fold clothes, pick up fitting rooms, etc. etc. They do group volunteer events which is very nice, and they do (at my location at least), do a lot of little extra things for the workers, like throwing parties and pot lucks. They were also very helpful when I had to have a emergency surgery and be out of work for several weeks, and they worked well with me during my internships. As with every place though, management makes or breaks it, and I do not approve of all of the managers, but for the most part it's an okay place to work. Not terrible but not super exciting."
good,"I loved being around the fragrances and learning about new cosmetics coming into the store, my training was pretty awesome and my manager was very nice."
good,I enjoyed working with the employees and customers.  Kept me busy and each day was different.  Was clean environment and upbeat. The sales were amazing and I was able to get some really great Christmas gifts. Plus they have incentives for making extra money daily.
good,I enjoyed my three years here immensely! The people that worked here were wonderful and I became great friends with the majority of the associates. I have stayed so long because the environment has always been so great and welcoming but the pay began to effect my ability to stay.
good,Working at kohl s was very fun. I enjoyed helping people finding that they needed and was great at keeping my area cleaned and helping others. Overall a great experience but the management could use some work
good,Kohl's was a fast pace but relaxed environment. I enjoyed learning roles of other positions. My customers were always great at my location. My co-workers made me feel like part of a team.
good,I have enjoyed my working here. Could use a little more training in some areas but I worked during a very busy time of year (Christmas season). Excellent communication between associates and management.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Management was very helpful and supportive in getting me pointed in the right direction. They made me feel welcome and comfortable right from the start. Easy to communicate with superiors and peers. Overall, a good experience."
good,"I thought that Kohl's was a great place to work. Not only are the employees nice, but the customers are generally too. Furthermore, Kohl's gave us a discount percentage. for all the items in the store. They also did volunteering at certain places during the week. Overall, I was very satisfied with my Kohl's experience."
good,The most enjoyable part of my day is when I help a customer and they just smile. The hardest at times can be the rush and feeling like your under pressure to get the customers through your line.
good,it was okay the employees were all nice and cool. very easy job. no experience required. but its good to have some type of experience it makes things easier.
good,Stressful around holidays managers aren’t always understanding of circumstances and not enough help but you get enough breaks and pay isn’t that bad for hours part time
good,For people in high school or who just graduated high. Not a place to start your career but gain costumer service experience and patience. A lot of patience is needed.
good,"Put in your time, and they will notice. The job is demanding especially during the holidays, but that is retail. The hardest part I believe is the time spent on your feet,"
good,"While working for Kholes I love the environment and the energy surrounding my work space. Unfortunately the hours and the no guarantee hours needed for life necessity’s I.e (bills, insurance) it just can’t come close to covering all of the requirements needed to live in this day and age. Other than that the management and the people are amazing to work with they always try to help out any way possible."
good,I worked at Kohl's for over 6 months before having to relocate.  It is an awesome company with a great environment.  I love that they put the customer first.
good,Got to meet new people daily loved that always something new everyday. A great place to work the employers are also friendly and there to help new employees with learning the ropes.
good,"kohl’s was an okay place to work, i don’t like to say anything bad about them. i think i just like the food industry better than retail. if retail is your thing kohls will be just fine"
good,"As a floor associate, if you stay on long enough you will end up working every job available at the store. This is good for getting experience. Some weekends can get pretty hectic and you may end up having to stay a bit late to get your department clean. Management and HR is pretty good about who they hire so the coworkers were always awesome. Black Friday and tax free weekend are easily the hardest times to work. You will get nothing done, if you're a veteran you will likely get assigned some seasonal hires who have no idea what they're in for, and that's likely where you'll get your first taste of managerial experience"
good,All managers must be on the same page at all times they must be able to relay messages between each other without confusing the associates they have to settle their differences first and not in front of team.
good,"i liked .working, i mainly did overnights and we all .worked as a team to. get the job done. I would've stayed longer but i had to move unfortunately."
good,if your a need of a good place to work you should definitely apply.I would say the hardest part of being a cashier there is getting people to apply for store credit. The management also needs to be nicer to their employees and have better communication with them.
good,"It was very frustrating work, working with any type of retail work. Dealing with messes, people, coworkers and so on. The beautiful thing is to just work through it."
good,"I was able to take the time I needed to raise my children and balance my job  at the same time"
good,"The training is the worst part about this job,other than the normal retail suckishness (ressing room messiness, toys in the shoe department, etc). You were trained in a group for the first orientation and shown around by one person. Then the next couple of days you were trained in one department per day with a sales associate who didn't know they were training someone till you clocked in. They need a better orientation booklet, with detailed daily responsibilities for each department. I love all the people. They help you when you need it. The best part I think is the closing huddle. You get to learn about everybody and its really fun."
good,great place to work the people are friendly and everyone loves to help each other the only problem is the pay its not enough and it takes time to get full time
good,"Kohls was a fun place to work. I had great Co-workers that made my job pleasant, even when it wasn't. The holiday season can be a bit overwhelming especially at Point of Sales."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Enjoyed working at Kohl's. They have a talented and fun staff. I am real glad to be able to work there for the years that I did and have met different kind of people.
good,"Enjoy the 16 years I worked there"
good,"With online sales going up, in store employees have been drastically reduced. So occasionally, there are only about 6-8 associates in the building. Without much help on the sales floor, a closing floor associate will have to answer phone calls, assist shoppers, backup at registers, empty fitting rooms and recover one or more departments while battling messy customers. Cashiers have to endure long lines of customers who are upset that there's not enough help. This is not a place to work if you think that you can just focus on one department. You have to be on your toes and ready to jump in anywhere to assist."
good,I spent my time balancing cash and working customer service.  I enjoyed helping customers resolve any issues and my personal goal was to have them leave the store happy and with the desire to return.
good,I am able to work on my own projects while also meeting their expectations at the end of the day. The management is tough but at the same time you make friends with everyone and it becomes an easier environment that you feel comfortable working at.
good,A good place to work if you enjoy working with the public.  It is retail can be a roller coaster one minute swamped and overwhelming and the next slow. Always a task to be done if you are someone who wants to work and not just stand around.
good,"While working at Kohls is very intense to say it also feels like home as your coworkers tend to be very friendly and managers are very comprehensive to many circumstances."
good,It was a great job for a high schooler. But did'nt allow to work week days during the day when asked to be full time. Not enough hours. It wasn't easy to move up to a different position. The extra work i put it wasn't acknowledged.
good,Its not a hard job by any means regardless of location or title given. Honestly the 2nd easiest job ive had next to selling fireworks. Relaxed and mostly calm atmospere.
good,"The people I work with are wonderful. Everyone works well together as a team."
good,"Busy culture needs work but overall I enjoy working here. Hours are long, goals are hard to meet expectations are high. Best part of the job are the co workers"
good,"I did enjoy working for Kohl's, the only problem I ran into was when my school started and they claimed the only days they could schedule me were the days I was going to be on campus. They did not schedule me for two weeks because of this explanation. When I asked why the person who had only been there two weeks, in the same position, was getting over 20-25 hours, their response then was that they had to give her the hours because they didn't want her to leave the company. For this reason, I left the company. They were unwilling to work with my school schedule and were giving new employees more hours than their employees who had been there for much longer."
good,Exciting company that is doing everything possible to remain competitve.  Great opportunities for advancement.  Regional team interested in success of the store and it's team.
good,"Kohl's is a very fast-paced working environment. When there is a new job opening, everyone is welcome to apply regardless of how long you've worked there. They pick either the most-qualified person, or the person with the most flexible work schedule depending on what the job is. The management can be rough at times, but they do their best to fix the problems they have there with the other employees. The hardest part of this job is how quick you have to be, and how precise everything has to be even after an extremely busy day at work."
good,"The culture at Kohl's is fantastic. Kohl's really empresses upon engagement at all levels, team collaboration, and the ability to learn from making mistakes."
good,I work with people one in one constantly. I love people and I love being able to go above and beyond for my customers. I love to make people’s day because it makes my day.
good,Dealing with the customers was excellent it was more the management that really didn't help for career advancement. The work to family balance could have been much better.
good,"It's a good job if you just want a little bit of money. When I worked there at 2 different locations even I didn't receive any hours. I only worked maybe twice a week sometimes 3 times and sometimes none at all. IDK if that's because I didn't get many people to sign up for a kohls credit card or what but I didn't like that. If you're lucky you can get more hours I know some people who did I was just unlucky. But it's a basic job and you do get 15% discount on top of other discounts. But Seriously if you want to advance in this job then it may take a few years, but it's a great side job"
good,"Employee transfers, result driven, employee recognition driven company, with opportunities for advancement, internship programs for old/new employees."
good,"Management was accommodating. I found it to be a fun place to work, everyone that I worked with was very nice. Some customers can be rude but overall, people were nice."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time working at Kohl's. It was a seasonal position and I was given the opportunity to continue on, but during day hours, verses the night shift I was currently on."
good,Most of the employees were nice to work with and helpful. Working here around the holiday time can be a bit stressful but kind of fun. .... Most of the guest are friendly.
good,"I really enjoyed the People I worked with."
good,"Very friendly place to work, if you have a question it's easy to ask. Everyone is helpful and overall not a hard place to work. Just not alot of room to advance."
good,"Exactly as the title says its a great job for what it is. It was a high school job that I used to build up a bit of a savings while I worked there and also helped in developing some work and communication skills that I am still using to this day. Minimum wage, not really much room for advancement unless you had been there for a year or more however it was a great work environment and I would have and did recommend people to work there for part time work."
good,"The people and managers are great to work with. I learned a lot of skills while working here. I learned how to work registers, returns, people skills, etc. Fast paced, especially during holidays."
good,The managers at this location have been wonderful and supportive of the fact that I have a full time job as well. The staff is very helpful when learning new procedures.
good,"Kohl's is not a bad store or company to work at, it the management that makes it unbearable. Most of the veteran employees can run the store better than the veteran managers. Not all of the managers/supervisors are bad. Some do their job correctly and are a pleasure to work with, others not so much. Its a pretty relaxed working environment dress code is business casual with schedule jean days and other fun dress themed days. Celebrate just about every holiday, from christmas to national donut day, always expect some type of celebration and food"
good,"Overall the job is easy and fairly low stress. Pros: You can work pretty much work whatever hours you want, generous merchandise discounts, laid back work environment. However, the pay is slightly low and the hours are wildly inconsistent, you are on your feet for your whole shift (minus breaks), and management is rarely on the same page."
good,"Kohls was a great experience, I learned a lot about customer service. I learned how to work under stress especially during the holidays when their were a lot of customers in the store."
good,"Working at this business does give you several opportunities on what you want to do at the store. Most associates can be trained to do multiple jobs and stick with what they enjoy. From time to time, you are asked to perform other jobs that may not be your specialty, but the management will answer any questions that may arise."
good,Kohl's was not the worst companies to work at. The environment is nice and so were the people. Just sadly the pay is not competitive and wasn't enough to keep me there.
good,"It's a fun place to work. Great discounts. dealing with customers is the worst part but the actual work is fine. You can't do anything when a customer is scamming the store, you just have to accept the returns."
good,"The managers and other employees were typically respecting and open to questions. The work environment wasn't very stressful, even during the busier hours. Scheduling was never an issue for me either."
good,"joined when Kohl's was growing"
good,"A typical day can be very different depending on what department you work in. For me I got there at 4 am and left around 12 pm depending on my work load. I learned every aspect of retail here, if you want to see if retail is for you this is a good starting point. The pay is not great though, but if you show interest and potential you could move up. The hardest part for me was the customer service and sometimes with such a large/young crew the drama can get out of hand. My favorite was the back ground work, like rests, freight, shipping, and etc."
good,"Gave me a good background on the retail work life and helped me prepare for the business environment to work with different personalities, whether it's customers or management"
good,Its fun working at kohls. Collegues are supportive and friendly. Employee recoginition progams keep us competitve. Hours and days are flexible. Overall a good environment to work.
good,"It all depends on the person. Kohl's is, for me, a very dry and boring job. That doesn't make it bad, but in my experience it is not a particularly interesting place to work. Everyone working there is lovely and if your hardworking you will not have a hard time advancing in the company."
good,Fast paced work environment. They expect to much from one person. Having to do the work of 3 people but don't get an adequate raise to compensate for having to work so hard.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Kohl’s is a great place to work for students and the discounts are really great. As far as pay goes you might have to get a second job to support yourself. Kohl is a side job unless you become a lead or manager.
good,Good management support willing to work with you when needed.  I enjoyed working and learned a lot while working for the company when i was there. Good team player.
good,"It was a cool job. Kohls was very busy around the holidays and provided much work to do when busy. When it was slow, it was slow. The culture is a good mixture."
good,In the begining I appreciated the work environment then i stopped receiving hours. I would be called in for a shift and before i could make it in for my shift they would cancel. They don't appreciate their employees.
good,"Providing fast and Efficient Service, Enjoyable to sale retails and helping Customers ,Leader ship Abilities, Enjoy working with co workers in a team."
good,"I loved working here. $9/hr start pay for a cashier is hard to find which is also why it is hard to get a job there. I got the job due to me being an honors student in high school, I believe. I was the only teenager that worked there. Mostly, it was middle aged and up employees whom have been there for years, making $11/hr+ with some benefits. However, management has changed since I left, and I think they've stripping these benefits and are trying to get a higher turnover rate to cuts pay raise costs."
good,"KOHL'S in TC Mi is a wonderful part time job. They are friendly, work with your schedule. The pay is not great but the environment and discounts make it worth it."
good,I liked working there. It was only seasonal with no option to stay on as ours is a very slow off season. Clean work place great people to work with. They worked with your schedule and appointments. They had great savings and deals for the employees.
good,"Worked as sales associate in a fast paced but pleasant environment .  Learned how to manage time wisely & communication skill.  Learned about fashion somehow.  Managers or supervisor are respectful considerate & friendly to all workers.  Hardest part was short hours.  Plus factor are employee's discount, friendly working environment & excellent merchandise provided for customers."
good,"fast paced, sometimes heavy work load, fun coworkers--worked mostly in home/shoes, despite having to pick up/sort out big piles of shoes constantly (due to inconsiderate customers) I still had a good time being productive with coworkers & management helped me out quite a bit just starting out"
good,"I started working at Kohl's as a high school student over the summer and continued to work there during my senior year and the summer before I went to college. I generally enjoyed working there, but during my last few months, things started to go downhill. Employees would have scheduling issues, like only having a few hours a week as a part-time employee (I'm talking like 10 hours or less per week during the summer). On top of this, many employees in my department quit or got fired over the summer, at least 9 of them. This left us short-staffed and I would sometimes be the only person working in my department that day, meaning I would be in charge of five dressing rooms by myself. "
good,i worked really hard and enjoyed the work i was doing i never really had a specific job i did whatever they scheduled me for but toward the end of working there they started working me for truck mainly but i left because they only worked me 1 or 2 times a week and that is not enough for me
good,"I have worked two holiday seasons in a row for Kohl's - very fast and chaotic, but the management was understanding and just as hard-working (probably more) as the regular employees.  Pay was a little on the ridiculous side ($9.50 an hour) but there is a good employee discount and lots of small perks."
good,Good. I enjoyed my time there. I appreciate the opportunity to work there. I just needed to have a more fulltime position. I would like to see more hours offered.
good,"Kohls on a regular day is pretty slow, you're expected to be doing something if no customers are in line (greeting customers, go backs, organizing, etc). Hours are pretty set considering its hard to find someone to switch with you. All the full time employees were super helpful, and the customers overall were very nice. It got very hectic during the holidays but that was to be expected."
good,"I am a customer service rep"
good,"I was in charge of the shoe department during my shift and I would assist customers and by doing so, that made my day an accomplishment. I learned new skills while working for this company which I was able to take with me other places. Management was very good at the time. The hardest challenge for me at that time was register training but since then my confidence working with the cash register has been built. The most enjoyable aspect of the job was the friendly atmosphere of the work place."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"The management team I was under was good to me. They were understanding and would help you if needed. If you were a hard worker, they recognized you for it. It was a good place to start as my first job."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is being apart of a dedicated team.They make you feel like family.Working together is fun and doing it everyday brings you a lot of joy.
good,"I enjoyed working at Kohl's. It was a very laid back atmosphere. I was a cashier. The days went by pretty fast because Kohl's is always having sales and customers continually enter the store. Management was great! I couldn't get a full time position and when I was hired at another company full time I had to work hours that wouldn't allow me to continue to work part time at Kohl's."
good,"The pace is relaxed, it is a team atomposhere, usually more than enough help, however things are not communicated to well, pay is not great, no hours."
good,"A nice job especially if you like a challenge and good pay potential. They provide benefits for part time and full time employees, the work culture is sufficient and productive"
good,I enjoyed working for Kohls. Unfortunately I needed full time status for benefits. Was not avialable at the time. The culture was positive and like majority of co-workers.
good,"Working here was interesting. Learned a lot throughout the time with them. Also learned a lot about politics in the workplace. The job was fine, the main issue I had was that there was not much chance for advancement unless you were favored by the management team. Your work ethics, how well you do in your parameters/goals, and over all pride you put into your job did not seem to matter. Due to this I had moved on to another company."
good,"Great place to work for a first-time worker, you get to met new people and there are great perks for employees. This job can open the door for many opportunities."
good,"i had the best management team. work duties were doable. we had strict project due dates, sometimes we didnt have enough help to finish but we managed to get it done."
good,"I worked for Kohl's for about 2 years. I enjoyed my Job, i worked in the Home and Kids department. During the time that i worked there i was given the opportunity to grow within the company to grow and learn different task's such as the register  (point of sale), Customer service, early morning stocking and overnight mark downs. I would Recommend Kohl's"
good,Staff is very nice and cooperative . Management never micromanage and fair with everyone about the work. The enviornment is very positive and love working there
good,Great people at all levels of the company. Being in the front lobby you become familiar with faces and get to be exposed to people across many teams. It's a very fast paced culture and being in charge of two buildings can have it's difficulties. I'm not only a LP representative but also the receptionist. I'm the first person people come to with questions regarding the facilitates. This job keeps me on my toes with having to be able who to direct people to the right person.  Constantly being interrupted I have to be able to hand multitasking. I issue badges for all consultants and associates while juggling special projects and meeting vendors. I enjoy meeting all sorts of visitors and getting to know the teams.
good,Kohls was is a very good place to have worked.  The pay and benefits were fantastic. The culture and and workplace was very friendly. The environment and co-workers was awesome.
good,I was hired seasonally for Kohl's and I loved working there! The managers were great and helpful and all of the staff tried very hard to keep everyone's spirits up for Christmas!
good,The work environment is friendly and fun loving. Everyone is really great to work with. The pay isn't great and you are never guaranteed hours but there is the possibility of picking up shifts and the perks are nice.
good,Good pay for retail. Relaxed atmosphere. Good discounts.Not enough hours to stay. Went from 30 hours to like 10 after the holidays were over and all the returns came back. Nice coworkers.
good,People were easy to work with. The work was plentiful and easy enough to do. There was a good retirement plan. Lunch times were adequate. The supervisors were easy to talk to.
good,I was part time overall it was a fun place to work enjoyed the people I worked with all the managers and supervisors where very nice would still be working there but my full-time job hours was starting to crash with my part time and had to let one go
good,"well balanced work place, meaning you knew the guidelines within certain situations. "
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"While the employees and management were kind, the companies requirements put unnecessary pressure and strain on the stores, which caused customer service issues. There is a huge drive to convince customers to open up a Kohl's charge card, and if stores don't open enough they get penalized, regardless of if the reason you aren't opening more accounts is because you've already gotten almost everyone to open one or not."
good,Kohl's is a great place to work with excellent opportunities for advancement if you have a great work ethic and attention to detail.  The departments all work together to assist each other with completing daily tasks.
good,"My time at Kohl's was enjoyable. Any chance I got, I was able to expand my duties and learn to become a more versatile team member. It was easy to learn from and communicate with the three primary managers, and the people I worked with were great people. The most difficult part of the job is trying to help customers who are rude, or trying to assuage the anger of customers."
good,Part time is nice. good hours. decent shifts. good people to work with. managers are awesome. good balance between life and work. little opportunity for advancement.
good,"Management is great....they are will to help train you and offer any assistance needed for you to be successful in your position,"
good,khols was a fun and fast paced work environment. everyone one was like a big family! i enjoyed being employed at khols all though it was only seasonal. i always felt very comfortable in the work environment.
good,This workplace has a very collaborative team and leaders.  It is a department store so expect to be busy but fun. Kohls has processes for everything so no need to try to figure things out.
good,Its a great place to work part time here and there.  I would highly recommend for anyone who is seeking to work 8-25 hours a week. And love to be active and move on your feet. .
good,"A typical day consisted of running the cash register and handling cash, debit ,credit , and check transactions. I learned quick and efficient ways to get jobs done and how to handle customers to make sure that they are happy with their shopping experience. The workplace is very friendly and a good environment to work in."
good,Staff and management worked well with each other and there was plenty of support from the management team. Discounts for employees and room for growth.
good,fast paced environment with lots of room to grow and many people to meet. allows for a flexible schedule to accommodate for things such as travel and education
good,It was a great fast pace job I enjoyed working there for a few months getting to know some really great people. I had a lot of learning experience there. I know the work area better and I’m more comfortable than when I first started there I would most definitely work there again!
good,"I must say this is probably the best job I've ever had. A typical day at work for me was folding clothes and keeping the fitting rooms cleared out. I learned that when day shift doesn't do their job, we at night shift suffer the consequences. Most of the management was pretty laid back and understanding."
good,"Great place to work, however there can be a lack of work. Suffered from over hiring during peak season. Too many people and not enough work so many were sent home."
good,When I worked at Kohls I was a sale representative for the men's department but also helped out at other departments if necessary. Working in the men's departments was fun and you always had to be on the move helping all sorts of people.
good,"Only if had better managers it would be a better place to work and reduce stress.  However, when a manager doesn't know the business, but tries to tell you how to run the business it is frustrating."
good,Kohl's is a great place to start a careers. it is a very rough job and especially loss Prevention. It can be very dangerous job and although Kohl's doesn't really look at that aspect i didnt find myself in too many bad positions.
good,"I was hired during the holidays, so their was always some activity in the staff room to keep the employees festive."
good,I love the job they are very patient and really good at training there staff  in a safe and fast pace manner. I just hate the fact the position was seasonal.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Kohl's was a great company to work for as a late high school and early college student. I was able to transfer back and forth between the Wichita store and the Lawrence store. There are few opportunities for advancement, but management was very supportive in developing employees. I was able to learn various departments, customer service, and the cash office."
good,"This job is pretty easy once you learn it.  Usually consisted of working the register, checking out customers with their merchandise.  When I wasn't working the register I was re-folding clothes, and putting back items where they belong throughout the store.  I usually worked the closing shift of the store which entailed;  emptying all garbage and recycle from all registers and stocking them with pens, money markers, bags, tape, staplers, etc...,  and emptying all dressing rooms of clothing and putting it back onto the sales floor for purchase."
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work for the Christmas season. I have really enjoyed my time there with all my co-workers and management. There are times when the job requires you to move at a fast pace, so you better be able to move."
good,"Kohl's was a great place to transfer my Customer Service, Retail, and Cashiering skills. Too bad it was only a Seasonal position. A typical day at work consisted working the sales floor as well as the cashier or returns. I never really had too much encounters with my manager(s). We were all too busy doing our job. The ""hardest"" part of this job was folding clothes especially if you (I) hated folding clothes. The ""most enjoyable"" part of this job was interacting and hitting on the customers."
good,Really enjoyed the work environment. There are very loyal customers who come regularly which make the work flow very enjoyable. Love interacting with people
good,I love working there have fun. Love the different positions I work there. Easy to catch on to things. And Grew From overnight shipping and receiving to becoming a beauty specialist / supervisor. If I could go back I would.
good,The company had many amenities and was very nice on taking good care of the employees that they staff. I hope someday to find my way into the company again.
good,"Great environment, plenty of work to do work culture different from any job I've experienced before. Compensation is reasonable. Would recommend to anyone interested in this company."
good,its a stay busy job and makes the day go buy quick and the employees are really nice and friendly good atmosphere to work in. i would recommend kohls for some one who is looking into warehouse work
good,"I truly enjoyed my time at Kohl's. The reason I left was there weren't any more advancement opportunities, available. I was and Assistant Store Manager, and loved bringing a positive outlook and atmosphere to my team. Being involved in the volunteer programs gave me a great sense of pride and love that the company allowed the stores to volunteer and donate. I did feel part time employees were asked to do a lot for little pay, but I enjoyed that the company gave each store funds to do fun days and celebrations as thank you for the employees."
good,Not a bad place to work if you need extra money for the holidays.  Most of the staff is very friendly and helpful.  I'd say the worst part was you never knew when that angry customer was going to come barging your way.
good,"Co-workers are friendly however it can get competitive when it comes to signing customers up for email/cards, the more you get the better your hours/position will be. Overall great place to work, but don't call in!"
good,"I've only worked a week at Kohls but i have, so far, enjoyed my experience. How ever i've recently looked at the new schedule and i'm scheduled less than 30 hours much less. I feel i'd do a wonderful job being a sales associate. The manager is very relaxed but very concerned about the store which is i find grateful as its the managers job to make sure the employees down to the customers find a relaxing and successful shopping experience. The hardest part of the job is finding an alternative choice in case the item with sell is out of stock within the stores."
good,Currently working as customer associate. Meet and greet with a lot of customers. sometimes attend the billing counter. Often called up for extra hours during the promotional week.
good,"This is your typical retail store. As a cashier, I think it was one of the better ones. Management was fair, work was assigned evenly, and help was always available. There were also incentives for signing people up for the credit card, which could pad your check if you're good."
good,"Friendly staff, good place to work. I enjoyed working with the other people. The system was easy to use. The stocking was easy. I think this is the least stressful job I have ever had."
good,"Most of the people I worked with were about double my age but most were nice and helpful. The communication there was a little lacking, but overall a laid back environment."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"While I feel I am fairly compensated for the area, I feel the amount of pay for hourly management is not necessarily sufficient for the amount of responsibility that is expected. Otherwise, compensation and benefits are considerably high. I cannot say I understand the HR department as I feel they are a bit debilitating in comparison to other places I have worked. The company works hard to create and keep work/life balance, but they are a lean company and employees are expected to work very hard. That is very hard to justify when employees can easily leave for other companies and are not expected to work at the same pace. For that reason, we have a high turnover rate (despite not having the ability to necessarily terminate any employees). If we were not in such a remote area, I also feel the opportunity to advance would be greater."
good,Overall the job was exciting for me as a marketer.  If the store manager had better skills in verbalizing what the jobs duties were it would have been the perfect fit.
good,Assisted customers on the sales floor. Learned various ways to deliver great customer service. Adaptability is a must. Good coworkers and great work environment.
good,"Worked as a seasonal worker. I was at Kohls for 3 months then relocated to another state. In the short time I was there, I learned a lot, co-workers were helpful."
good,All the people and managers are great.  Not many full time positions available. Most people work only16 - 20 per week. Very understaffed. Overall a good place to work.
good,"Gets very busy when there are sales and coupons. Great work environment, everyone is so helpful and considerate. Would recommend others to apply and work there."
good,"even though i worked 10 hour shifts, the day went by fast. always had work to do and if i had any difficulties key team members always solved the issue. working with scanners was easy and nobody had a negative attitude. During peak season at this location was busy but ran smoothly."
good,"I loved working here, but I look forward to expanding my experience and trying something new. Weekdays were often slow and weekends were very busy. The discount is seriously amazing. They move management around often so that sucks when you develop friendships with them."
good,"The energy at Kohl's corp. was great.  Upper management was amazing.  Everyone worked together, not in competition and seemed to have a genuine care and concern for other's well-being and success."
good,Need more hours better pay More team members some are happy some are rude More communication with all to team members and more training with new team member
good,My position requires me to work independently most days. Management and I support each other to make sure projects are completed correctly and within a timely manner.
good,Kohl's was very flexible with my hours and very accommodating to my busy college life. They were very good with training and dividing responsibilities between team members. I would definitely recommend for anyone looking for an understanding work environment.
good,"The job was a typical job where you worked with the costumers, took care of the purchases, and could also be put to stock. It was not boring as I always had something different to do."
good,It's a good job and you're always expecting to do the same thing everyday. some days can be stressful depending on what sales are going on. Sometimes you have good days and sometimes you don't.
good,"I like this job because of the flexibility and a great team to work with. The managers and supervisors are great and work well with each other. I think this job is more for people whom need very flexible hours, a part-time job. I would like something more advantage. Where I could grow as an employee and receive benefits."
good,Went for my interview just to find out they already filled the position.  They said that I could start as a sales associate and move up from there.  That has yet to happen and the original position I applied for is now available again but they won't let me interview for it.
good,"It kept me busy and my colleagues were helpful and friendly. We did holiday activities and the teamwork involved was nice. Store could have been better organized, although this is understandable considering I worked during the holiday season."
good,I like the staff and some of the management. great place to work. Not really good in taking back previous employees if they quit before giving notice.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"when i worked at khols it was always something for me to do. while i worked there, there was always work to be done. management was pretty good. they really cared about there employees."
good,Great part time job for any student with really flexible hours and opportunity to move up. Love the way breaks work. The biggest con in my experience is that the managers are not that involved in day to day operations.
good,"A typical day is spent consistently working on clearing fitting rooms, helping and cashing out customers and having fun over the radios with coworkers. I have learned almost every department, which has lead to more hours worked. Management is compassionate and understanding. They are easy to talk to and give great direction. The hardest part of the job is angry customers. The best part of the job is my coworkers and the repeat customers."
good,Absolutely loved working here. The people are amazing and super easy to get along with. A typical day at work was busy.The people that work there are really worried about getting a lot of credits so the management made sure to have a lot of incentives.
good,I loved this job and would recommend working for the company to anyone. There were many benefits and discounts around the holiday season. Kohl's was a fast paced work environment that I was excited to show up to for every shift.
good,"When I worked there for a seasonal position it was a fun, productive work environment. I would highly recommend friends to work for a Kohls store location."
good,"A typical day at work was pretty relaxed. You meet in a group, divide your plans, and have an allotted amount of time to execute. You get to be create in how you design the store as well as following a guideline."
good,"Well run company. Management was fair to all employees. Plenty of "
good,"You go to work clock in go to you bank and ring up customers until its time for a break or your shift is over. The workplace had it's very nice people and others not so much like any other job but, the managers always have a joke or a great attitude."
good,"a typical day of work on a week day is slow but weekends are fast paced and you get quiet a bit of rude customers."
good,"A typical day at work consist of trying to get as many customers to apply for a Kohl's credit card. Also, maintaining a clean work area. The most enjoyable part of the jobs is when you can make someones day. For example, if a customer comes up to the register very unsatisfied and I'm able to figure out the problem and solve it and the customer leaves the store feeling better bout their shopping experience than before."
good,I love working at Kohls. Just hard to change availability without being reprimanded for it. It's a fun environment to work for and the majority of the managers are super nice.
good,if you dont make enough sales on the credit hours you get cut hours. the environment is very fresh and easy. when it is time for you to get a raise it only gets bumped up a quarter
good,"Good place to work. Management has good attitudes. Good people work there. I was a picker but never could get the preferred score they wanted me at (100%) because I didnt understand how it was being measured. i would still work as hard as i could. sometimes it was too much on bad days. They gave me a reasonable amount of time to try and figure things out but by the time i got the hang of it, i was too late. and they let me go."
good,Loved it here people and management is great. Love the deals employees can potentially get. Breaks are nice and mandatory. Managers are nice and respectful.
good,"Great place with friendly staff. "
good,"*Dealing with cleaning up departments"
good,"Most of the people you work with are very easy going, while business-like and quick-paced at the same time. The managers are easy to talk to and very understanding. The overall environment makes it enjoyable to be at work."
good,Kohl's as a corporation is dedicated to minimizing waste and promoting excellent customer service and they instill these values in their employees. A good company to work for.
good,"Working as a Seasonal Employee for Kohl's was a nice experience, but working on the floor just was not what I was looking for at the time. That being said, I got my breaks, the people were nice, and always had my back when I didn't know the answer to a customer's question."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"The typical day of work consists of backing up on registers and maintaining the cleanliness of the department floors and fitting rooms. The hardest part is clearing and repairing the sections while answering to the request of backing up. However, the enjoyable part is the interaction and teamwork all the employees put into finishing up the floors after our closing time. The management is great. The supervisors watch over for reassurance we are doing as requested, but allow us to work on our own time. I have learned to be more patient and attentive to details."
good,Fun place to gain customer service experience and engage in new friendships. Basic math and reading skills required. Management is great with flexibility for schedule changes and any emergency event.
good,"It was nice working there. I was there only for the season, while I was there I learned A lot about sales. I wish they could do days off, other than that it's a good job to work."
good,"Going into Kohls I was very motivated and ready to work. I wanted to be as productive as I could and never stop moving. I tried doing this for the first couple weeks, and it was okay. After a while retail starts to turn into a nightmare especially during the holidays. It's hard work and I enjoyed a lot of the time I spent working with co-workers but working the closing shifts starts to wear you down."
good,"they have reasonable expectation, never get mad at you. high, but reasonable expectations. they don't give enough hours and that's why i am currently trying to leave"
good,This was the best part time job I had as a student. You are held accountable for the area you work in. The management was always friendly and willing to help. It was always very rewarding to help customers find what they were looking for.
good,"I worked in the jewelry department and found it comfortable and slow paced. I performed a combination of register, stock and customer service. Management was nice. The hardest part of the job was working on Black Friday because we were mobbed in jewelry. However, we had an organized system which made it easier to deal with the volume of shoppers."
good,"Working at Kohl's is a great starter job for anyone looking for experience in the working field before they go for more serious jobs. The people are usually really nice and have hardly ever had problems with anyone I work with."
good,Good experience working part time at Kohls.   Very busy store and room to grow.   Extra help during back to school and the holiday season.  Those employees weren't trained very well and would call in or just not show up.
good,"I liked working there, they actually seem to care about the hard work that their employees do there... I just didn't like how I wasn't getting paid enough there or how I wasn't able to have more hours of work there. Yet, overall, it was a very fun and nice place to work and we all worked together and they felt more like family, than co workers."
good,"A typical day at work is busy always but fun."
good,Not too bad of an environment. Wasn't the best for me. Not enough help on the sales floor. The holidays are great because there's more to do. Great for someone looking for their first job.
good,There is the possibility of growing with this company. They offer raises and new job opportunities at least every 3 months. People here are friendly and supervisors here have good communication skills.
good,"It was a good place to work for, but there was not much room for advancement with lack of hours that could be given. Most of the staff was wonderful and had fun."
good,It was a good place to work while going to school. The pay was good at the time. The coworkers were all nice and the supervisors were nice. ..........
good,"The store was a great place to work, with great people, and the customers provided a good mixture of challenge and enjoyment.  However, the store has gotten very slow in recent years, and hours are becoming difficult to come by."
good,"Working at Kohl's was pretty relaxed. It was fast paced at the time that i worked there because it Christmas time so a lot of people were shopping for their families. The discount is pretty good and can be combined with any other sales they may have going on at the time. The pay is also weekly, so that's another perk."
good,it was an awesome job I would love to go back when season comes. I loved working here great people work was easy and it didn't take long to learn the routine.
good,not one of the best places to be the advancement opportunity is close to non existence expect if you know someone in management.  the actual duties are typical of retail cc focused and rude inconsiderate customers
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Customers must always be put first to achieve exemplary customer service and ensure a long term customer retention . I addition , you find that you build relationships with your customers and they become what is considered a regular and it becomes a more friendly environment ."
good,A typical day is taking incoming calls and process request as customer presents. I have learned to do great conflict resolutions and the management is open and approachable. The workplace culture is awesome. The diversity is welcome and wide spread. The hardest part of the job would be when it is back to back calls and customers are impatient as we all can be at times. The best part of the day at work is lunch when we relax for an hour and then again quitting time.
good,I enjoy engaging with the customers.We have a wide variety of them.I'm in Intimates & Accessories. I maintain the Dept & help customers find the items
good,Pretty easy going workplace. Management was always extremely nice & helpful. I would recommend anyone who likes to work in retail to work for this company.
good,Typical day at work was daily customer interaction. I learned management software in a people friendly place. Hardest part of my job was not always being able to satisfy unhappy guests.
good,Job was great work place was fun Management was a little poor. Management team was sometimes late and just wasnt always on track but my co workers worked hard and made the job more of a positive place to work. Im more of an on time guy and lets get some work done. We can have fun but lets work as well.
good,"It's retail so you work weekends and holidays. The pay is relatively low however, even considering it is just a part-time retail position. The management team was excellent and the store employees worked well together. As far as retail goes, the customers are pretty reasonable. The discounts are also fantastic if you are looking for that sort of thing. There is not really much room for advancement from part time to full time though."
good,The pay is not the most competitive but the environment makes up for it. Management is easy to communicate with and values your concerns. The staff is friendly and understanding and the perks are nice.
good,"This a is a decent place for anyone looking for a first job or if you're looking to make a little cash on the side.  If you're looking to make actual money though, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.  Other than that, your experience will depend on the management and employees you end up with (same as any other retail setting really)."
good,Everyone is kind and cooperative with each other. The management is always willing to work with my school schedule. Everyone helped me to get out of my shell.
good,Overall I really enjoyed working for kohl's distribution. Management was informative and helpful. My coworkers were always willing to help  you needed some assistance.
good,"Kohl's is a pretty good place to work. They tax everything that you win that is over $10, so be careful. You may think that you're winning, when you're actually not."
good,"Fun place to work, management is great, a lot of different people working. great security. Good coupons and great employee discount. Stayed super late after closing to make sure clothes and other things were put back in place."
good,It was fast paced. We were trained for most departments but packing was my favorite. The managers were really nice. They have a zero tolerance policy and i loved dat.
good,I really liked working there everyone was very nice and helped me learn a lot.  On a typical day I would go back and forth between the women and men department. while doing that I would also do go backs and customer ser
good,This was a typical retail type job. The company itself is great and offers there employees unbeatable compensation for the work done. The hours become pretty predictable after the first few weeks of work. Overall not a bad place to be.
good,I enjoyed my time working at Kohls I was only seasonal but I did a really great job. Everyone helped one another and it was a team effort. When I first started working there it was hard at first but I caught on very fast thanks to the help of the other employees that have been working there for a longer period of time.
good,"A typical day at work is very busy. Solving customer problems, returning merchandise, taking payments, listening to customer complaints, balancing cash drawers, dealing with money, and closing registers."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Kohls is a wonderful place to work, the atmosphere is wonderful as well. I always look foward to go to work, my cowokers are wonderful. they are like family."
good,A typical day is pretty relaxing at first but picks up pace in the late evenings. I learned about the different sales and rewards programs. The managers were always present or at least in the area in case assistance was needed. The hardest part of the job was in my first few weeks trying to learn about each procedure that was necessary to comply with the discount or sale required. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning about the customers and forming relationships that add fun to the work experience.
good,"This job really taught me a lot about the retail industry and helped me get a head start on what I wanted to pursue when I'm older. I learned about customer service, sales, cashier, and the basics of retail in general. Overall a great learning experience."
good,A typical day could be anything from really slow to a constant line down the aisle. You are constantly doing something. While working for this company I have had a leadership role that I excelled in.
good,Seasonal position . Trained to do exact work for a specific amount of time. Diverse environment. Co-wokers were team players.
good,"Its a basic retail job. "
good,This was my first job in retail and I loved every minute of it. This job helped me improve my customer service skills dramatically. Most of my duties revolved around (shipping and receiving) but I was able to dable a little bit in working the cash register. There wasn't anything that was hard about this job unless you ran into a rude customer. Sadly I had to leave the company due to a full time position with another company.
good,Having fun with customers talking to them and learned how they day was going. How to stop people from stealing things. I loved all of my managers. my co-workers were great.dealing with rude customers. making people's day happy.
good,"Moving to NC,  this was the perfect part time job for me to get acclimated in the community. The management staff was helpful and friendly, supporting all duties needed to succeed. Most of the store associates were too young to grasp the concept of how important credit apps and sales are. Being more informed on what expectations the job has will help those interested in advancing."
good,When you get to work you are greeted by our sweet associates and whoever is our on hand manager for the few hours you work.  After you clock in you meet with one of the managers and discuss what department you are going to work. Then you are off to do your job. It's super fun and you get to meet tons of new people. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet for long hours at a time. Sometimes not getting a break. Also some rude customers at times.
good,"*no day was the same"
good,"walking around the store fixing everything customers misplace"
good,Must be social in order to be working well. Must work well  under pressure. Must be ready in all times to answer customers questions about any of the products as well the problems they have.
good,"Kohl's is a great company overall to work for.  From working in an environment were belittle employees is the norm to coming here were they value your experience and opinion, what a breathe of fresh air.  Now I will state the overall picture for work is retail and people pleasing.  The only negative I will state is that moving forward and monetary compensation is super slow."
good,Took on the responsibility of manager for multiple departments throughout the course of the internship. Advertised product to the public in creative ways to increase revenue. Collaborated with colleagues to foster smooth workflow and enhance associate engagement.
good,"I always enjoyed working with a great group of people, being productive and learning new things all the time. Management was supportive and worked hard along side the employees."
good,A simple and somewhat clean environment that works hard to improve together and function as a team. Excellent work is reward and sub-par work is met with constructive criticism.
good,The job required hard work on a daily basis. The work was rewarding to anyone who believes in hard work as a corner stone of life. The management made it A very positive work place.
good,"Always learning new things, love working in a fast pace environment, co-workers are always willing to help; never hesitate to ask for help when needed."
good,I really enjoyed the team and the management they are great people to work with. The hardest part about the job was the it was monotonous. Basically I cleaned out fitting rooms. All day. It could be a 4 hour shift or it could be an 8.5 hour shift. It was boring. Plus at previous jobs I had so much more tasks to keep myself occupied with something different as the days went on. Walking back and forth between where the clothes go and the fitting rooms got old real quick.  Overall though if I had to pick this job again (which was a seasonal position) I would definitely do it again for a seasonal position. Not a full time or year round one though.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at kohl's."
good,"I work within the Mens, Misses, and Juniors departments, varying on the shift. I clean up the department, pick up clothes within clearance and the folded tables, and I situate the fitting room to ensure top cleanliness."
good,Kohl's was a pleasant place to work for the short period of time I did during the holiday season. The associates were helpful and friendly and my trainer was very good at her job.
good,At Kohls I performed basic cashier functions and sorted and put away clothes. I learned a bluebird system and did go-backs.
good,"11yrs going strong. Great company. Change is good, Something new everyday. Daily challenges with plans and place but need to be quick to react to change. Ever changing environment. It's the way of retail."
good,I enjoyed my seasonal time at kohl's. Great management team. Great people. I saw myself looking forward to going to work every day I worked.
good,was a good place to work nice and clean nice people but wasnt always active so it made the hours long and boring wasnt much work to be done all the time
good,for the most part it is not a bad work place but it could use improvement for instance some employee's do not do there whole job description for example we handle returns and most of the time when i get there for my shift there is always a huge pile (always) which is unfair. Another con  is that behind the counter it is dirty.
good,"A typical day at work would be doing my daily duties and helping out any time a extra hand was needed. The Hardest Part of the job would be climbing on a five foot platform and changing nine mannequins, safely."
good,I like working at Kohl's. It is a fun job and I have been able to train in many different areas of the store.  There is nothing hard about this job.
good,"It's a nice job that it's very well. I like the people and the type of work, it's just the work can be very repetitive at times and can get tiresome. The different departments definitely offer a variety of work."
good,Kohl's has a good working environment.  The company encourages the team to have regular activities off-site to promote cammaraderie among its members.
good,"Go from the minuet you get there till you walk out the door. Under staffed most of the time. Management was not consistent, each manager did their own thing and had their favorites."
good,"Was fairly decent in terms of culture but management could have been better,great work environment under certain mangers guide was well organized in certain aspects"
good,This is a great company to work for. Their only true downside is the pay rate. The company does take care of your with their benefits programs. Depending on the store you work for they are wonderful with working with availability.
good,"If you want to learn more the manager will be more than happy to train you."
good,"I enjoyed working at Kohl's Warehouse."
good,always busy. learned how to make displays with maniquines management was great co-workers were awesome hardest part of the job was it was only seasonal everyday was enjoyable
good,I worked at Kohl's for 5.5 years. They have a friendly and positive working environment. I started as a sales associate but was able to cross train to a variety of departments. The scheduling is flexible and the minimum hours scheduled is 4 hours.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Kohl's is a great place to get your foot in the door to a long road of success, however it is not a place to stay for too long. Customer service is the biggest challenge of the store, and having patience."
good,"The dept was really flexible with my work schedule and it was a good working environment. I would recommend this is as a great part time job. I did not work her full time, college summer job."
good,"A diverse range of customers and employees, you will love the employee dicount plus coupons (coupon layering) and the employee shop day. I cant think of anything wrong with working here besides a messy fitting room but it is your job to pick up clothes and fold/hang them. My favorite thing about working here was that i could put clothes on hold that i saw while working to pay for later!"
good,"Met amazing people, can be a fast paced to work during the holidays. Managers are awesome and care about your needs. Learned how to multitask and how to work in a fast environment. Hardest part of the job is learning how to use all these coupons but after a month you get the hang of it, with the proper training."
good,I like Kohl's. Management and employee's are easy to get along with. Everyone has the desire to work well and get things done.
good,the pay was good.. a lot of opportunities to grow and advance in the field.. management is ok.. flexible working hrs and plenty  of ot
good,A typical day at work would be getting started on work. I learned some much from greeting customers to new skills. Management is great they help you and listen. I get along with the co-workers we work as a team.The most enjoyable part of my day is knowing that I made a customers day.
good,"Unload truck, separate merchandise but department and then put in correct department. Organize and clean up department, set up displays, and make room for newer merchandise."
good,"I loved my 9 years at Kohl's.  However, they have declined in the past 12-18 months and I saw limited career growth opportunities as a result."
good,"Kohl's was my first job, it was an interesting environment. I enjoyed working there, for the most part. The only down side to kohl's was that it seemed to always been disorderly. Also, the kohl's I worked for had a lot of theft. At the beginning of each shift, within 5 to 10 minutes I'd find at least 2-3 if not more tags ripped from stolen items. Though I know that it can't be completely helped. I did continue to work there for 6 months despite this problem and overall I did thoroughly enjoy it. And by the time I left, the problem was almost gone, we got better security and less theft. My coworkers were very nice and they made me feel comfortable working, they were always there to help you out when needed. The E3's were nice too, they always checked up on the employee's making sure everyone was doing well and that their jobs were being preformed efficiently. The hardest part of the job at times were some of the customers, though I learned early on that I in fact work for them, and their wishes were my command. I helped each customer that approached me with kindness and respect, despite how some of them approach me in mean and angry manners. The most important thing is to keep calm, cool and collected. As long as you're doing that, you're preforming your job correctly. The most enjoyable part of the job was the great feeling I had at the end of the day or when customers would tell me ""You're a life saver! I've been looking all over for these"" or ""Thank you so much, I'll be coming back here again!"". Those responses are part of the reason I loved working just in general, knowing"
good,"typical work day is ringing customers keeping floor clean and neat"
good,"the customers were fantastic, friendly co workers and staff, did not see much from management typically only once a week, great and beyond easy to communicate and get a hold of,however  only thing i felt unsure about was the 25 minute lunch break."
good,"Work includes 9-5 or 9-4 depending on the scheduling.  Mondays are the busiest - entails scanning several inventory counts of certain classes for merchandise/diamonds.  Also, damages have to be done.  Work very closely w/management and customers.  A typical everyday routine is opening cases, making sure presentable.  Opening registers and helping customers.  If there is a truck schedule for the store, then I have to take inventory of any orange/grey totes.  "
good,"It was a fun place to work, permanent worker were always helpful, always willing to help, managers and supervisor were always there to help with anything."
good,"I have a lot of time commitment to my education and organizations and they don't work well around my time commitments. If you aren't in organizations though, this would be a perfect job."
good,Cashier and sales interacting with customers. Managers were very helpful and co-workers helped as well. Sometimes customers were difficult but always managed them right. I always made them smile.
good,Kohl s is all about delivering great customer service. Managers are easy to work with. Co-workers get a long great. Affordable good quality products.
good,"Unload freight and process to ensure correct sizes,colors,prices and quantity if correct send to shipping to be delivered to store"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"It started out as a great place to work. Management was always changing, from the front office all the way down to assistant manager. So you never knew what was going to happen from one week to the next."
good,"Some co-workers made the job unpleasant but overall showing up to work everyday was well worth it! I enjoyed communicating and helping customers when they needed it. Everyday we were faced with a ""rush hour"" and that was personally the best part of the job. I love having something to do and rush hour provided that."
good,Great place to start working out of high school.  You will learn a lot and have caring coworkers to help guide you.  The holidays are the busiest and the best time to make extra money.
good,"Pretty good place to work, good vertical movement opportunities. A lot of variety in the scheduling as well. Co-workers were always great."
good,"over night shift unloading trucks and putting out freight. training seasonal help. working with great people. train seasonal help, working with customers.Uses the 5 step program."
good,"The place is huge and has a lot of worker, so it very hard to have a personal relationship with your manger. Also you have a lot of mangers so for me it was very hard to remember names."
good,"This was my first job and I have been taught many new things such as cashier training, customer service training, floor training,merchandising, etc. I have to say this was a very good first job and I feel that the skills I have learned will help me with my future jobs and career."
good,"easy to learn"
good,"I worked at Kohls for almost 2 years, and what I found was that it is an exceptionally big company and you definitely will be busy. There is always stuff to do. I started as a cashier and moved up to Customer Service Captain. This was a full job for the time I had it. Endless amounts of stocking, re-ticketing, go backs, returns, customers inquiring as to where to find things. After about a year as the C.S Captain I was moved to Customer Service Area Supervisor. This was an amazing job. However there were a lot of things to do. I held the keys to the store, I had to count down the drawers at night, and had to make sure employees were following procedure. I also trained and did orientation for all the new hires and filed the paperwork. I made sure that employees were taking their breaks on time and their lunches as well as making sure that customers were always happy. In my time at Kohls I managed to raise the Customer service score from the 60's to the 80's! It was a lot of work!"
good,"Made lots of new friends, learned new things, could be creative to a point.  Helped set up and open store.  Most days when I worked was only one of two people on floor to wait on the customers. Liked working there just needed more than 12 hours a week."
good,"I enjoyed my time at kohl's department store, the supervisors were very friendly, the store manager was very approachable with any concerns or problems. Overall, Kohl's was a job i much enjoyed."
good,"I was a cashier and coworkers were always nice and friendly towards each other, there was no gossiping which is good because that's hard to find a workplace that doesn't gossip. Managers were always there to help"

good,"I was happy to work in a fast environment. I love to work in the morning unloading the truck. We have a great team."
good,"The workload at Kohl's is appropriate for the pay. Management is typically good, co-workers and management have created a functioning system that helps thing run smoothly."
good,"This was a fun seasonal job. It's a great way to get a taste in the retail experience. I worked every department and did a little bit of everything, so it was worth it."
good,.A typical day was one filled with enjoyment helping our customers make their purchases. The management was well put together team.
good,They didn't hire enough people during the holidays season so the seasonal people was doing alot more work than the full time or part time people.
good,"Fun place to work, but you have to work! Fast-paced, never a boring moment. I really like the management team and my coworkers."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"-Your typical retail job fast-paced and full of life. "
good,Kohls is a great place to work with lots of customer contact. I loved the interaction with my customers. Kohls gives discounts to its employees. Employees were also asked to volunteer to work with disadvantaged kids which was lots of fun and very rewarding.
good,i love working for the kohls corporation i am in  misses junior and mens department  i enjoy working with the customers on their selection of clothing and accesories all my coworkers are helpful and friendly  all my managers are knowledgeable and friendly as well
good,Ample amount of opportunity to provide customer service. I enjoyed educating the public in jewelry product knowledge. Met some of the best co-workers that I still stay in touch with.
good,"Khols is a good retail company to work for. I worked very hard for them. I helped run housewares, and toys dept. I also helped exceed company credit card app quota. I assisted on truck teams and logistics. I also helped new hires and trained them."
good,Greeted customers and helped them find what they were looking for. Assisted in display of merchandise. Operated cash register.
good,"I  love working with my coworkers. "
good,"It was a very comfortable workplace, with really friendly employees and management was extremely nice. They really cared about you and were super understand if you had something going on or werent feeling well. They work perfectly with any school or other job conflicts you have and pretty much always work around YOUR schedule which is very nice when you have many different things going on, they make it just a little but easier to handle."
good,"-slow but plenty to do"
good,"Retail sales & customer service for in person and internet shoppers,retail floor stocking and call backs. Warehouse replenishment shipping and receiving, inventory management, warehouse management and special operations details."
good,"low pay for the amount of work required"

good,"open and close store, assist costumers, positive environment, run racks, assist in all departments, stocking, HAVE TO HAVE GOOD MULTI TASKING SKILLS"
good,It was a fun job but you had to walk around a lot and move boxes. Working at the register was fairly easy but it got hard to stand after a while.
good,My typical day here was to run the customer service area.  There were times that it was stressful but other times it was a lot of fun.  It was always a fast pace environment due to the business.  I really enjoyed working here there was always something to do.  The management was great they were all hands on and helped whenever you needed it. My co-workers were a lot of fun generally everyone was in a good mood.  The hardest part of this job was the day after Christmas just to due to the volume of business we would do. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people all the time.
good,They made all of us employees feel like assets. They were great!! Benefits were the best I'd ever had!! They really appreciate their employees.
good,I love interacting with customers and making it an enjoyable place to shop! I really care about my associates and make personal connections with each of them. A favorite motto of mine: happy associates equals happy customers!
good,"I liked working at Kohls. I had a seasonal Sales Associate position. I  mostly worked on the floor, merchandising. The customers were great, as well as management."
good,The days are long cleaning up after customers all day. I am lucky to have good people that I work with and for the most part good management team. It is very hard to deal with very rude people and trying to clean up just to have people come by and mess it all up again.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I enjoyed working with customers, the typical work day was hard especially since seasonal employees was hired for the Christmas rush. overall management did a wonderful job to ensure customers' did not have a long wait at the checkout counter."
good,"This was my very first job and I really enjoyed working here. I didnt get to stay long because  of personal reasons. I enjoyed the department I was placed in. I didnt meet or greet with too many co-workers. But, they never hesitated to assist me with any issues I came across."
good,"This company emphasizes on customer service. The company also invests in training and mentoring for all employees and managers. Their training programs are very fun and I learned a lot from each of them. This was a great retail environment to work in. There were countless promotional opportunities to grow within the company. Compensation was a little less satisfactory, but the incentives and benefits made up well for that. I really enjoyed the Kohl's Care volunteering events."
good,Kohls is a nice company to start a career with customer service. retail is very inventive and you can learn so much just by being a member of any department
good,Very busy work place. You learn alot aboout credit cards because we had to offer the Kohls credit card. The customers had lots of questions about the rates and benefits. The mangement was very helpful. If needed management would hop on a register and ring the customers to ensure that the lines were moving quickly.
good,"If you like to stay busy and help customers, you'll like working here."
good,Fast paced environment. Always had something to do. If the register would get slow on some days. Then we would help other departments organize the clothes shoes etc. Very nice coworkers and management. Hardest part getting customer to apply for the kohls card.
good,"Even after two years I sometimes miss working for Kohl's because I really acquired great job experience and a second family developed around me when I worked there. The management team is great, though there has been changes from when I worked there so I'm not sure how that holds up now. We worked as a strong team and really enjoyed going to work everyday."
good,"When I was employed at Khols I loved my job and its environment. My co-workers were friend, open, and helpful. The managers were motivating involved and in tune to there staff, as well as, customers. There was always good energy flowing."
good,"Its an outstanding group effort to keep all customers happy. Where others need help, coworkers are always willing to lend a hand."
good,Good company to work for. The clients and co workers were nice. Learned a lot working for this company. The pa could have been more but really loved working with the kids.
good,"Overall, a fun and positive work environment. With the amount of discounts and coupons available to both guests and employees, I have learned to multitask in a way that would otherwise not be possible without Kohl's. We have gone through three Store Managers and numerous Area Supervisors since I have been with Kohl's, so versatility and adaptability among associates has been imperative. "
good,"This was a great company to work for. I had a wonderful work environment from the supportive store management. The company does care for their workers, and I would recommend them to others seeking a job."
good,Kohl's is a great place to work if you don't mind being micro-managed. I do not mean this in a bad way.  They do a great job of making sure things get done and have great planning tools. I sometimes regret leaving this company. Growth/opportunities just were not there for me. Great with new technology and take advantage of current tools/social media environment.
good,"Enjoys working with variety of customer with different situation, which allows the customer to walk out with a smile after accomplishing their needs and wants."
good,Good worklife balance options with flexability for personal needs.  Pay and benefits are competative.  Growth and learning opportunities are encouraged.
good,"A typical day at work consists of me operating Point of Sale registers. I solicit credit cards and rewards cards to all of our customers and provide them with excellent customer service. I have learned that a positive attitude, even on your worst days, can create repeat customers and also convince customers that opening a credit card is in their best interest. The management staff is always very approachable and full of positive reinforcement. All of my co-workers are great team members and we all work together very harmoniously. The hardest part of this job is always presenting my best self even when I don't feel like smiling. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers. They always make my day a brighter when I know that they were highly satisfied with their experience with me."
good,The environment is quick paced and always something new going on.  There are different tasks daily and an environment where good customer service is a must.
good,"At times you're twiddling you're thumbs trying to organize something that is already fixed and waiting on people and then it seems out of no where everyone shops, puts nothing away and they all go to the registers at once. Management varies and can be breathing down your neck or off in the office or helping customers right at the moment you need help. Training is done from a book and by frantically whispering to someone whose been there longer for help. Enjoyable part is the discount on clothes. Hardest is watching people have little regard for the work that employees put into keeping the store clean and leaving messes everywhere because they know an employee will clean it up. It seems like most people leave common courtesy at the door when shopping. They just want a good deal without having to deal with anything else, including lines or again common courtesy."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I enjoyed what I did. The schedule was fairly flexible. My immediate supervisor was great to work for and made my day more enjoyable.
good,"First retail job, enjoyed schedule unpredictable sometime you get 4 hours in a week to 20 hours. Really liked the staff most customers were nice."
good,"Weekends and holidays are the craziest times to work at Kohl's but the busy days are the most rewarding. I've learned patience, diligence, and to really work hard when the going gets tough. The management staff is very engaging and focused on bettering not only the company but the employees. My coworkers are all generally lovely people, which is important in a business that is so customer service oriented."
good,"The main part of the job was to satisfy the customers. I would work often in Customer Service handling returns and exchanges, looking for items in other stores that we may not have on hand. I learned a great deal of patience in this department and that there is always a way to make the customer happy."
good,"Go to designated work area for daily assignment, some days were busy others were not. I worked in receiving and it varied day to day with work load depending on time of year and truck count."
good,A typical day would be me basically watching over my department.  I would have to make sure that the area stayed cleaned and that the customer was taken care of.  The hardest part of the use to be dealing with customers and their attitude but over time I learned how to not let it effect me.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers.  They always keep positive attitudes and worked off one another.
good,"Great culture at kohl's; very diverse and open, friendly environment. "
good,"Served guest "
good,"Retail is always challenging, but the staff and managers at Kohl's are always willing to work with the customers and employees to exceed their expectations."
good,A typical day at Kohls for me involves cleaning out the fitting rooms and putting away any clothes customers had tried on and decided against.  I also help customers with their questions as they shop.  I'm also responsible for cleaning my assigned department as well as helping other departments with their recovery.
good,"Typical day at my job , usually begins with long tasks that can take all day in retail. Due to helping customers , answering phone calls and working in customer service. I enjoy my job at times, only because of the co-workers that surround me. They are a joy to be around. Also, helping customers by going beyond the standard limits that some associates do."
good,"Kohls is an ""OK"" starter job, for getting into retail. They reward you for great performance, but lack in the benefits department."
good,"Works as a team. Low pay and short staff but they appreciate what you do.can work whatever shift fits your needs"
good,"I have been working at Kohls for almost 2 years. I enjoy each and every moment of it. I made great friends. I have established good relationships with my managers. I also learned skills such as cash handling, good customer service, and learned the ways of the different departments. My co-workers were like family to me. The hardest part of the job was seeing good people come and go.

good,"This job is decent, we get alot of discounts. Management team throughout the whole building is shaky though. Honestly teamwork doesn't exist here. 10+hr shifts everyday. The hardest part of this job is the shifts, the fact that they start in the evening and end at dawn. Also the HR dpt is the most unprofessional, rude bunch of individuals I've met. Ihave a pregnant coworker who is on her feet 10 hrs a day and requested a different department because she was concerned about the welfare of her unborn child. An HR representative's response to her was that, she shouldn't of signed up for the job and that it was her problem."

good,"Kohl's was my first job and I had a great experience. I had the opportunity to work both closing and opening shifts. A typical day would be to come in and clock in and to get on to the floor prepared. We had to log in. Once the customers came up to the register we would ask if they found everything that they needed and if they had any problems, if there were we would try and resolve their problem before sending them to customer service. At the end of our shift we would make sure our work area was clean, and clock out.Working at Kohl's taught me how to operate the cash register and how to properly interact with customers. My main assignment were operating the cash register, managing money during closing shifts, maintaining a clean working environment and meeting the customers needs the best of my ability. I did work during the holidays so everything was a bit fast pace but still easy going. My co-workers were helpful and friendly. They were willing to help when I needed it. I wouldn't say there was a hardest part of the job, the tasks were really simple. The most enjoyable part of the job would just be helping the customers, making them happy and making sure they got everything that they came for."
good,"A typical day at Kohl's begins with assisting my HR counterparts with new hire orientations and on-boarding for full-time, part-time, and seasonal associates. Post-orientation, training kicks off, which consist of on job coaching, mentoring, facility tours, and over-seeing new hires in their roles. "

The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job was apprehending shoplifters.
good,"Great college job! I met a lot of great people, including the customers. Fast pace work environment, but a great learning experience that I wouldn't trade for the world."
good,"Meeting new people was always rewarding in its own ways. Management was available but not overbearing. If you are friendly and enjoy helping customers, this is a perfect job. However, you cannot earn a living off this pay. The hours are spotty and its hard to advance. I was employee of the month and after 6 months was rejected 3 different job positions."

good,"The majority of my time was spent merchandising a department to store standards."
good,"Working at Kohl's was a good experience for me as a first and part time job. All of the managers were well trained and very efficient at what they were doing. I would gladly work there again, but am interested in other job fields other than clothing/retail. The hardest part involving my job, was having to miss multiple days of school because I was scheduled to work. The most enjoyable part, was the friendships I made with my coworkers, and everything I learned working there."
good,"Ran the kids dept, clean up the floor and put clothes away. run the cash registers. managers were ok. liked my co-workers. holidays were the hardest. had some good times"
good,There is a lot asked of you at this job. Multi-tasking is a must! You are crossed trained in multiple departments. It is hard work.
good,This was a face paced place. I loved my co-workers. My managers weren't really compliant with my schooling. Other than that I loved working there. I liked how we could swap schedules freely.
good,You have the chance to earn extra with selling Kohls cards and at  my store we always had friendly competitive competitions with our work goals
good,I love my job what i love most is order picking because something about being excessively high off the ground relaxes me. I've learned a lot from a lot of different people. A typical day runs smoothly whether you're pulling off the racks or putting into the racks.
good,"Most of my work day was folding shirts and pants, assisting every customer anywhere anytime, recovery of the fitting rooms and sales floor, or backing up POS or Customer Service. I learned the beat ways to assist any customer and to manage my time so that my areas were recovered before my shift ended. My co-workers were the best part of my job, got along with everyone really well and worked even better with them assisting each other when needed. I think the hardest part of my job was continuously folding an area for a disrespectful customer to come in and ruin all my hard work while smiling. Management could have managed the store a little better but over all were a great team."
good,Overall good work pace. Management was somewhat unorthodox. Majority of the co-workers were neutral. Some challenging days were when I had to work the shoe department alone while its a busy day.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Unload trucks, separate boxes and items onto pallets. Load pallets on floor, process items before stocking. Job can be fun with the right crew. But can be annoying with the wrong crew. Team members tend to think they have a position."
good,"I stocked the Men's Department at the store.  I built displays for merchandise.   I worked with very little direct supervision but complied with company rules regarding how to build displays.  I had a floor supervisor whom I reported to but was mostly on my own to get the day's work done.  The worst part of the job was the fact that I only worked 8 hours a week and I could not live on the wages I earned.  I really liked working with customers and helping them select merchandise.  I did not have much interaction with co-workers, just on breaks but Kohl's employed other deaf individuals and I enjoyed my friendship with them."
good,"Great work atmosphere, with great supervisors. I enjoy the steady pace of work and the compassion upper management has for its employees. Hardest part of the job was the hours changed week to week."
good,"I gained a lot of experience and insight into the retail business to respect every single job that someone holds no matter how small. I learned that working in a store is not as easy as it seems, it takes a lot of discipline and patience to work as a sales associate. The hardest part was getting everything done in time because you have to make sure that everything is neat when your shift is over, but as soon as you fix one display a customer messes it up and you have to do it over. I enjoyed the interaction I had with the customers on the job, they would ask for my input on merchandise before they bought it and some were so grateful because I made sure to go above and beyond to make every customer happy."
good,"A typical day at work is a busy none stop day at Kohl's. I learn new thing everyday as it is easy to speak to management. The co-workers are quick to help if  needed and are willing to teach you tricks about anything you are confused about. The hardest part of the job is make sure your area looks descent, even on the busiest day like holidays.The most enjoyable part of work is giving the best customer service to each and every customer."
good,"i work on the sales floor in the misses, juniors, and mens department in the fitting rooms and on the floor. i also merchandise and do price changes."
good,"Typical day is placing new merchandise, restocking, organizing and customer service. There is always something new to learn and management is great at answering any questions or concerns.  The most challenging part is trying to find space for new merchandise when the floor is already full.  Many co-workers are great team players and feel like family."
good,"A typical day at work was coming in getting a head set and waiting on customers unless i was to come in and do floor sales or overnight /early morning stocking. I learned that khols is a nice and fun place and i really enjoyed the opportunity to work there. Management was really nice and was always giving a helping hand to everyone who needed it. I made a lot of friends working there, co-workers were very friendly and outgoing. The hardest part of my job there was working back to back overnights and early mornings and then coming in on cashier. i was not being paid enough for the amount of trips i was making back and fourth from home to work and it was really putting a strain on my health. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to learn new things and interact with lots of people."
good,"A typical day at Kohl's started with gathering my 500's (shoes left out the day/shift before for me to put away) followed by cleaning up my department, helping customers find the perfect shoe, linking the electronic signs, moving freight to the floor and or my stockroom, answering the phone and calling other stores to see if they had a product we didn’t. I learned how to run a cash register, a palm, and my organisation skills went through the roof, as well as my cleanliness. My managers were very upbeat people that always had something for you to do to keep everything flowing smoothly. The hardest part was probably the shelf's being knocked over. and the best part was the massage chair in the break room."
good,"Customer care with bookkeeping, training and assistance for cashiers and multi-department. I have learned about the consistent changes with customers, for they are not all alike, and that my major skill is customer service. Management is continually busy. Co-workers, as in any retail call out and become terminated for lack of attendance or poor customer service. The hardest part of the job is lack of communication and rudeness from customers and co-workers. Knowing that I have helped fellow employees and customers throughout the day fills me with joy."
good,"Ensuring at the start of business POS is staffed without any call-outs, all 17registers are functioning properly, Cash replenishment needed throughout the day along with picks done daily to ensure cash allotments are maintained, many customer service functions such as shopping carts and bags distributed throughout the store are maintained, handling customer compliments and complaints, managing associate breaks and lunches throughout their shifts, ensuring the associates are using the GREAT process in acquiring credit cards and rewards cards on a daily basis, recruiting for potential new hires, hiring and training all associates, new hire paperwork files are in compliance, great listener and problem solver.  KEY HOLDER. My co workers were my family and that was the best part of Kohl's.  The hardest part was when their were staffing issues with no store budget! Most enjoyable part was that Kohl's made feel Empowered to the do my job!"
good,"A typical day of work was to unload a truck, sort out all the items and then stocks the shelves followed by putting away overstock. I learned that there are a variety of people that can help as well as i also learned how to be time efficient. Management there was very well composed, they knew what they wanted and how they wanted everything done. My co-workers were a awesome bunch of people that could all ways give me a good laugh when needed but still worked hard. The hardest part of the job was honestly how slow the time went by, I loved the job I did there and the most enjoyable part was being with my co-workers to carry conversation while i work."
good,"The place was not too bad for a retails store. There were good times and bad of course just like any place. i was only hired as temporary seasonal help so I never had the full experience, but while working there i had a few responsibilities. Including, running the cash register, helping customers, putting clothes back to where they belonged, and making sure my area was clean and neat."
good,"I would start my day at work asking the manager what's the goal for that day. I head to the register I am assigned to and start checking out customers. I've learn how to persuade customers to open up a credit card and told them there benefits. Managers were awesome. They treated me very well. The hardest part was trying to help a customer and I couldn't help because as a cashier, we couldn't really move around. I enjoyed working with the employees. They made my working experience amazing."
good,I have enjoyed working there so far. There are many different jobs to learn and opportunities. If you work hard there is room for growth.
good,They focus a lot on the employee and keeping them happy and their opinion is really valued.
good,"Overall as a company it's a great place to work.  Only issues I've had is worth certain managers.  Lately I've felt cheated as far as full time openings, but that has to do with the management part."
good,Managers kind of stupid some times. Sometimes unfair. Nice coworkers overall. Nice and clean store though!
good,Overall I enjoyed working here. Friendly and knowledgable staff. Very busy environment because of the holiday season. I learned a lot about customer service as well as cash handling. This position was only seasonal and I would have enjoyed working for a longer period of time.
good,"A typical day at work for me is working customer service. Therefore I deal with returns, even exchanges, tagging clothes, payments and damages. I really enjoy working around my co-workers and my POS supervisor. The hardest part about my job is working with angry customers that treat kohl's workers like we aren't even human beings. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help a customer find the item they are looking for and the customer leaving the store happy."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Helping customers find merchandise.  Smiling and saying hi to every customer was a joy everyday.  Training and assisting co-workers was a enjoyable time for me.  When we did not have a product that we had advertise for a customer was the hardest part of the job.  The management team was very helpful.
good,Decent warehouse job. Hours were nice. Management kept changing.
good,Highly physical and busy job which made the night go by fast. I gained a lot of retail experience and the management was great. The co-workers were happy to help out and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was working all night but it was nice knowing you had the day to get things done.
good,"The most fun about my job is meeting new people every second! it's like a surpise you neve know who you where going to get or how is there personality. i also like fixing there problem, escpically when they do not believe they can be fixed. To see them happy and not so stress out makes me happy."
good,"Kohl's was a great company to work for overall. The managers were nice, understandin, and they lead well. The co-workers were fun, relatable and hard workers. The hardest part of the job had to be working in the stockroom unloading the trucks because it was at an extremely fast pace and you had to be there extra early not to mention unload hundreds of different items off of the truck. The most enjoyable part was working with a great team and serving great customers."
good,"During a typical day at work, I would be greeted by my fellow employees as I walk to the back to clock in then start my shift. I learned how to properly control a cash register, how to approach and help customers in a proper work matter, how to maintain a neat work area and how to remain calm during a problem in a store. The managers was understanding, polite, and to the point. Every one of my employees was polite even on a busy day. Working at night was the hardest part of the day mostly because it was slow and it meant that it was time to recover the whole store. But overall I loved how I became so into the routine in a matter of 1 week."
good,Kohl's does a great job balancing work and personal life matters.  It offers job rotation with various responsibilities to learn.  I have been trained in various areas of the store to better my knowledge and skillset.  The hours vary due to the retail industry and advancement is difficult.
good,"A typical work day at Kohl's, we have a meeting in the morning right before we going to our departments, there's isn't really must to learn, but if you ask to learn how to work in other departments the supervisors might let you go learn. The co-workers are okay, you have some who just comes to work and do what they have to do, and other like to talk here and there, but everybody is friendly. There isn't really any hard parts about working here, everything is pretty much easy."
good,"I work in MJM department which is basically doing laundry all day. Clean up fitting rooms, putting clothes away and folding clothes. I sometimes help out on registers if there is a line. It is a very simple yet stressful job. Management tries to work with you. Co-workers are great. I feel invisible doing my job, don't get credit for anything I do because mangers are more concerned with making their credit and sale goals."
good,"customer service desk"
good,"Perfect job for anyone 55+ who needs to take a break every so often and not work like the rest of the employees,"
good,"I would go in and take care of home & kids via:"
good,"The management at Kohl's is excellent. The Manage and Co-worker work very well together. I had learn a lot at Kohl's. This is my first retail job. I learned about the clothes line, how to put out merchandise for each department. Kohl's is a fun place to work."
good,"Good focus on team and people though the cost structure can be quite challenging for those with underperforming teams. Requires strong management behaviors and leadership focus to achieve sustainable results and build effective teams. Individual development is supported by senior leadership if you can achieve the results. If you can't, then your development is up to you and could be a bit tough. Results and expectations are generally clear so your understanding of what's needed in your development is usually clear as well."
good,Can open and close registers and work at all different forms of costumer service. Very good with getting others to sign up for credit cards. Zoning and running recovery.
good,a typical day at work is good along with working and getting along with everyone. i enjoyed my job and there was nothing hard about it.
good,"Kohl's is a fun place to work, with people who are upbeat and who exhibit excellent teamwork.  We are located directly across from the National Sports Center, so we have diverse clientele from around the world.  This makes it a very dynamic environment in which to work."
good,"I do believe that everybody needs to have some retail job experience sometime in there life, and I believe that Kohls is an almost perfect place to work for that experience. A typical day at work for me, I would never know what I would be doing that day until I went into work since I had multiple responsibilities within the company. The hardest part of my job was going into work on a daily basis and never knowing what I was going to be doing, it makes it hard to know what to expect within your daily duties."
good,"Set sales, helped customers, stocked, set up displays, cashier work, and warehouse work. Busy with customers and work to be done, but mostly enjoyable. Friendly co-workers. The hardest part of the job was getting everything done, while still making sure the customers were well taken care of. I enjoyed the co-workers and many of the regular customers."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Kohl's was a great place to better understand and further my IT knowledge.   A typical day involved monitoring Kohl's locations including stores, distribution centers, headquarters, and various other locations.   My position was focused on ensuring Kohl's networks remained functioning properly with a high level of up time.   Duties included troubleshooting LAN/WAN issues and monitoring for issues, analyzing them, and taking the appropriate steps in the case of failure or malfunction."
good,"A typical day at work can vary.  I usually work the registers but have helped in other departments.  I have learned that the customer is the reason we are who we are, so striving to do the best customer service is key.  The management group there is different, some are more easy going than others.  My hiring manager was a pleasant lovely lady that tried to help me with everything. She talked professional and never left her emotions get to her.  She retired and her replacement was far from that.  She would scold if you did not get credit applications or were not busy.  She did not speak well with anyone, plus did not care about family issues.  My co-workers on the other hand became part of my family. They were kind and willing to help, just overall friendly.  The hardest part of my job was asking customers for credit applications.  It was out of my comfort zone.  I feel that to much pressure was put on all of us about credit.  I was really good at getting credit and won top creditor a few times but I did not feel right doing it.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the sales.  I loved telling the customers how much they saved.  The smiles on their faces were wonderful.  I would talk to them like I have known them for years and make them feel important.  I love working with people."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be to go in, check all the fitting rooms, be sure to have them cleaned out and shopable for customers. I would then start recovery on the sales floor making sure everything was off the ground, sized and folded. "
good,"     Kohls was a great place to work, and it was a good place to prove myself in management. Here I had to oversee over eighty employees and manage their work schedules and activities to get the most positive results. Management was fully receptive of my ideas and abilities, and although there is always bound to be some difficult employees, everyone got along well. The only thing that I can complain about is the hours, which were all over the place and hard to become accustomed to."
good,"Worcester, MA store:"
good,"A typical day at work for me is to check in with my supervisor after clocking in. after being informed on the days sales goals and actuals then I head to the registers and assist customers with questions and provide good customer service, when it is slow I help nearby departments with folding clothes and placing them in their correct displays. I learned how to accurately handle money and the POS system as well as exercising my people skills on a daily basis. My managers are all really friendly and are available when I need assistance. My coworkers are good genuine people and I have made a lot of friends at this establishment. The hardest part of the job is when we are for away from meeting sales goals on a slow day and There is a lot of pressure to open up credit cards. The most enjoyable part of the job is being around a lot of people and being able to socialize with new faces everyday.  "
good,"    A typical day at work would be timing in then going to the start up meeting.  After that i would head to my door and start unloading and scanning in boxes.  Once scanned in i would ticket and push said boxes onto the conveyor.  At the end of the night you would update a computer holding all information for the day.  "
good,"A typical day at Kohl's is very busy. It is usually nonstop customer service, whether it be helping a customer find an item, or making the sales floor look presentable for the customers. Although days are long and busy, the work environment makes it a great place to work. The only downside to working at Kohl's is the compensation level and at time the lack of appreciation from upper management. Besides the few cons of the company, Kohl's is a great place to develop work skills and a great work ethic."
good,The co-workers were great to work with and kept me informed about shortages. 
good,Running the cash register and greeting people who walk into our store. Helping people find what they are looking for.
good,a typical day at work is usually hectic because theres not enough sales associates. Although the pay isn't great and the hours are scarce its a great place to meet people from all walks of life. the fast pace environment allows the employees to work well under pressure. Although the work load is high and a bit stressful there is always a great team scheduled and we all get along great. We also have a great set of managers. everyone gets along great and have great relationships
good,Great working environment. Learned how to deal with customers in a respectful manner and how to work as a team. Hardest part would have to be managing the go backs and your register.
good,"taking care of customers most of the day, end of my shift clean up my department & close down. The hardest part is the late nights, always having to stay so late to make sure everything is perfect. I really enjoy helping customers and merchandising. "
good,"one of the assistant managers (white male)"
good,Working in a home-goods/retail one stop opened my eyes to yet another workplace environment.
good,This was a great place to work. I enjoyed working with the public and creating life-long friends. 
good,"My typical day at work would include (depending on if i were opening or closing) counting the cash registers, making sure they started and ended with 200.00. I would ring up customer's items then try to sell them a kohl's card which would come with a discount (which I was very good at by the way). I would then bag their items, remove any hard tags, and say goodbye with a smile. All of the employees there were very cheerful which in turn made me just as cheerful. I would always enjoy coming to work everyday."
good,Working here was very easy going the customer were great staff was great very big on teamwork and customer service
good,"It is very flexible with hours but even though I have worked there for three years, I haven't got too much of a raise. Not a lot of opportunity to move up because they hire mainly from outside the company."
good,"Pay is average. Discount is only average. If you work hard and dedicate yourself to making the store look good and providing excellent customer service, as well as showing responsibility and drive, I believe advancement is an option. It can be a little mundane as it is the prototypical clothing retail store. There is a lot of folding and cleaning. Customer service and care are key. If you are not the kind of person who is able or willing to interact with customers of all types (happy, angry, frustrated, excited, or hurried for example) then working in this store is not for you."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"This was a fun job for me. This experience was very now an different as well. I worked in departments, which my job was to stock and keep the departments clean. Management was okay but it could have been better. But over all i gained plenty of experience to work with customer service again."
good,pay was great and you have your set days and hours but it is a drive. co workers are nice and management was actually ok. Many Perks to the job
good,"I would come into work, and after I had clocked in; we would have a meeting to discuss daily numbers that need to be acquired for that day. After that the supervisor would discuss who would be working where! Then we the workers would go to the assigned area to work and work the day there, until we were told to go some where else and work. beside when we went to break it would last for about 20 to 30 mins at a time there were only two breaks in a 12 hour period. I would work hard and to have all the orders that were in front of me finished and pack in a 12 hour period. I work on being as accurate and precise as I possibly could every day."
good,I would open the Jewelry department put out the jewelry for display. Restock the jewelry and sale accordingly. I also had to work in the beauty section to sale beauty products and run registers. I learned how to work with the customers to get a better result in sales. The management was good. The co-workers where awesome. The hardest part of the job was not spending all my money in that store. the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to engage with the customers.
good,"it was fun, lots of work evryday, very busy. i learned to operate the electiric pallet rider. the hardest part was loading the trucks and the most enjoyable part were the people who worked there."
good,"A typical day at work for the most part was great. I loved my co-workers. I learned a great deal in training when becoming a lead cashier. The management was wonderful with the exception of one manager in particular. The hardest part of the job was working with said manager, other than that, I loved it, but the manager is the reason I quit. She was horrible to everyone including customers. She didn't want me to move up in the company even though I was the top in credit sales, which is what they pushed extremely hard. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and working with the people I worked with. We all worked very well together. From the back room to the Cashier (Point of Sale) where we were the last person the customer dealt with before they left the store."
good,I really enjoyed working at Kohl's! I was there for 2 1/2 yrs and formed a special bond with management and my co-workers. We were like a big family! The hardest part of my job was not being able to help the customers with every problem they had.
good,"A typical day at Kohl's consist of stocking the shoe department and helping customers. I really enjoyed working with the customers because everyone is also in a good mood. The management staff were all nice, a few were rough around the edges at first, but in the end the entire team is dedicated to making the entire store a safe, productive, and happy environment. My fellow employees were all cool and we all looked out for one another."
good,Great place to work
good,"Typical day at work would consist of updating floor plans, helping various customers and maintain an already busy sales floor. Both management and my co-workers are great. We help each other out when we each need it and expect a lot, but it is rewarding when we are credited individually or as a team for providing such a pleasant experience. Hardest part of the job can be large workloads and working with tough customers and having to find middle ground with someone when what you offer is not enough. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the satisfaction on a customers face when I am able to find what they are looking for, either the exact item or something just like it."
good,Following company protocols to meet customer expectations
good,I like working at Kohls. They are flexible with your schedule and its a fun enviroment to work in. The one thing that I dislike about Kohls is how much they push for us to get credit apps.
good,"Fun work environment, flexible scheduling, decent pay for duties expected to perform"
good,"I liked working at Kohls. I liked the work and the other workers. I had an issue with the store manager. hours were good, morale of the store was good. There was a strong workload for everyone. Definitely don't work there unless you like to work, and work fast and hard. I made decent money (I was in MGT), felt bad for associates only making minimum wages. If you don't get charges, they don't like you and won't put you on the schedule."
good,"Typical day working at Kohl's for me was pretty much cashiering, customer service and maintaining the fitting rooms. That was probably the most important and hardest part of the job but it got easier over time. My co-workers were fun to work with, we always helped each other out when needed. I learned basic skills about working in retail at Kohl's."
good,"My favorite part of my job is the people. I love everybody I work with. They are always willing to help others. Sometimes we complain about why their work isn't done at the end of the day, but we all still come together and finish it as a team. Which brings me to my least favorite part of my job. Certain people expect so much out of you, but they don't realize that some jobs are just too big for one person to do on their own, meaning sometimes they don't have enough associates scheduled for the day. I could elaborate, but I think you would be reading for a while. They are very detailed issues. The management team has their ups and downs as well. It doesn't seem that they can agree on much. For example, I will ask one manager how to fix a certain problem and I will do it the way they had described to me. Later, another manager will come to me and tell me to do it a different way. I realize they are just doing their job the best way they know how, but it's very frustrating at times. I have learned many things in my 5 1/2 years with Kohl's. They truly do work as a team like they always say. If something bothers any single associate, the whole team does what they can to ensure a happy working environment."
good,Kohls is a good place to work I was able to develop myself and others while still maintating my APH. The management was always supportive and available when needed.
good,Definitely the best job for someone new to working. Not many hours are given to part timers unless they can acquire credit. Kohl's is customer oriented and will do a lot to please the customers.
good,1. I wake up at the un normal used to waking up for a job at 4am so to be at work by 6am.
good,"I have fun at work, i love going to work when i am on the schedule. Managers and co workers are very nice"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I learned how to unload the truck and merchandise the product out to the sales floor. On the occasion I would work the home department and customer service.
good,"At Kohl's I worked on the sales floor in the clothing department. So every shift my job was to put away clothes from the fitting room, clean up the sales floor and help customers who needed assistance. This job taught me a lot about being hands on when providing customer service. If they had a question about stock availabilty, then I had to go to the back room and check. If it wasn't available in the back, then I called other stores or checked online. I enjoyed management and I felt like they did respect me as an employee. I did enjoy my co-workers for the most part, but at times they enoyed talking about other employees and starting drama. Whenever this happened, I would just do my work and ignore what was going on. I would definitely say that was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part was being around customers. I genuinely like getting to know people and helping people, so this was a great place to be."
good,Fun place to work...alot of food. Very flexible schedule. Associate discount. Low pay.
good,"If we hadn't switched operations managers right before I went back to school, maybe I'd still be there. Instead, the ops manager ignored the letter in my file and decided that I'd get another job I liked better while I was gone and took me out of the system instead of giving me ninety days to come back like everyone else. (Funny, there was a woman who only worked every ninety days and they always let HER come back! And I don't know how I could be expected to ""find another job"" if I was in class five days a week!)"
good,"Work was all about answering inbound calls, resolving customer's concerns, questions and frustrations. Had great co-workers who helped out whenever I faced a question, which I could not answer. The hardest part was dealing with those upset customer's who down talked at you and had to talk to them in a courteous manner. But then their are those who just are so pleasant to talk to and enjoy your help."
good,"Most of the time the schedule say's what you will be doing that day, It varies with how much knowledge in departments you have. Sometimes I work overnight: for clearance price changing events or merchandising for visits and or holidays. Other times I work normal hours as early as 4am: for truck processing and taking it out to the floor, working on maintaining a department, helping out at registers when the line is long, marking up or down white ticket events, preping for clearance, sizing, helping out in customer service, working on go backs, helping in jewelry."
good,It was always a fun place to go. Everyone was nice and the customers were always understanding if something went wrong.
good,i worked 3rd shift worked unloading trucks did resets all the time on floor stocking worked with customers the last couple hours of the day been their a couple years.
good,"I like working at kohl's. It is a very nice and friendly atmosphere, and the managers are like family. Always trying to be supportive and understanding."
good,"•Customer Checkout counting the drawer at the end of the night, displays customer service to all the customers"
good,"Great upper management, days are filled with different contest and surprises to keep the employees motivated"
good,I liked working for Kohls. Management was wonderful. Some employees were great. Veteran employees definitely helped newbies.
good,"Management team, key holder, run the store during manager on duty shift, open and close, deal with customer problems, safety team member, cash office, data entry, excel spread sheets for truck unload, accounts receivable for Kohls charge cards, inventory, e-mail corporate office, train new employees, manager training through Kohls, daily team building meetings.."
good,Working at khols was a great first job. I learned alot about the retail business
good,"Really enjoyed working with all the people I met. Great working environment with great opportunity to grow and still have time to spend with your family. Although it was a great experience, I did not see working in retail as a career choice."
good,i was a part time employee with the company and had work very hard to try and be promoted only to be told i was to good at what i did and they would not move me because of that i started doing the job of 2 people and the raises were very small i had a 25 cent raise the whole year i was there... I needed a full time job and they told me they did not have anything available and they were not willing to help me at all even by giving me more hours
good,"As a department store, the work was not at all as bad as I thought it might be. I learned to sell shoes, the credit card, to handle customers. The management was top-notch, My co-workers were hard-working and likeable. The hardest part of the job was keeping areas clean (especially the kids department). The most enjoyable part of the job was to deal with customers and staying busy."
good,They are great at making the associates feel good about working there and have a ton of opportunities to learn more skills. The people were great.
good,"a typical day at work varied from day to day, which i liked. i learned to be a team player and help out where ever i was needed. the managers where nice, but sometimes not easy to get a hold of. my co-workers were reliable and easy to work with. i would have to say the hardest part of the job was trying to keep everything clean in the dressing rooms, espesially on a busy day, but i got the job done. the most enjoyable part of working there was making new friends and being able to help customers with their needs."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"My typical day at work varies depending on how busy the day may be. I would be in three different departments, Juniors, Misses, or Mens. I learned how to solicit credit because Kohl's offers Kohl's credit cards. The managers are fun and understanding. My co- workers are very friendly and kind. The hardest part of the job is keeping the fitting room clean after customers and putting their unwanted clothing away. The most enjoyable part of the job is associating with the customers because they are usually very friendly."
good,A typical day would be helping a customer with anything they needed. I learned to be more patient.
good,"Kohl's has a hard time understanding that you get what you pay for. If you pay minimum wage, you don't usually get high-quality employees. However, some of the people you work with are really wonderful. The people you work for, however, is just about the most influential piece to your overall experience. I worked for great management. All cared about the company and the employees. It seemed backwards, however, because some of the lower supervisors were really tough, when the executive managers were pretty easy-going...and it looked bad on the execs. It made them look ruthless too."
good,I enjoyed working here at times. There were cliques. I liked folding the clothes and sorting them to make them look organized.
good,i loved working there... just had some issues when I tried to transfer and getting in contact with HR
good,I liked working at Kohl's and thought it was a great first job. Management was overall very nice and hours were nice when I had them. Co-workers worked pretty well together. Hardest part about the job was communication. Sometimes it was hard to actually understand what the managers wanted because you'd hear different things from different managers. Most enjoyable part about the job was I got to learn about every department.
good,co workers are friendly ..SOME managers are professional and polite .. there honestly isnt no hard part of my job everything comes pretty naturally to me . the most enjoyable part is seeing the customers smiling face leaving the store satisfied
good,"A typical day of work consisted of greeting every customer that entered the establishment,help customers locate items, process returns/exchanges. In this company I learned professionalism,and how to provide excellent customer service. The management and co-workers at this company were awesome. The most enjoyable part of working here was being able to satisfy each and every customer."
good,I have learned so much from working at Kohl's and would highly recommend this company. There are multiple job opportunities with this company in a variety of departments.
good,I really have no complaints about this job. Anyone who has ever shopped in Kohl's pretty much has a general idea of what its like to work there. The environment is full of customer service opportunities and promotion is a common thing among employees.
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work if you are a college student. The hours are flexible, because if you have an emergency, you can always find someone to swap shifts with you."
good,I found the job rewarding. It was nice to see a customer who entered the store unhappy and leave the opposite.
good,Great place to work for students. Good management. Coworkers were very nice.
good,Kohl's is a very friendly based business and you would have a good time working with co-workers and customers. Customers are very nice and make your job very easy to do.
good,"Love to unload and load the freight truck ,because it gave me more experience in shipping & recieving. This was also a real professional environment."
good,everyone chipped in and did their part and everyone helped each other weather they were asked to or not
good,This place is very flexible with hours and the management team is very open to working with the associates on schedules especially during the time I was in school.
good,"Kohl's was a fun place to work. When I was there I loved it. I always had something to do, which make the work day go by fast. The managers worked with me and trained me in different areas so I was able to get more hours and work wherever they needed me. They only bad thing would have to be that I only mad minimum wage. Besides that, Kohl's was a pretty good place to work"
good,Kohls is a good starting out job. The associates are very friendly and it's a fun place to work.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,The work environment is awesome especially at the Christmas holiday.  A very fun and enthusiastic place to work.  Management is very motivating. Not much room for advancement.
good,I like working for Kohl’s and I only work for them Seasonal worker but the people who work there are the worst people I have ever work with . They abuse there power
good,I over all enjoyed my seasonal work here I just wish you got a better chance to stay of you spent allot of effort trying to learn. Maybe find a way to get an opportunity.
good,"Kohls was not a bad place to work at. While sometimes the work load was a little much, and direction was not as clear as I would have liked it to be, they did keep me busy, and truck days were typically pretty consistent throughout the week."
good,"Learned how to work on registers, folded clothes most of the time working, learned how to complete amazon returns. Management was nice and helpful co-workers were helpful as well."
good,I loved working there. I would love to go back!!!!  I loved the people I worked with. They were all so helpful when I needed help. Management always made me feel appreciated was always so helpful when I needed them!
good,Kohl's is an okay place. Most of the people that start are very friendly. Some people in management could be a little better. I love my job. Just wish they hired full time
good,It is a good workplace if you need a part time job and like staying busy during your whole shift. I like helping people and training new peopleI like helping customers find what they need and want.
good,"I like Kohl’s as a company. Most of my co-workers and the management were dedicated, friendly and we worked well together.  It was a well run store.  "
good,"they could do way better on their scheduling on hours, but it’s pretty easy working at kohl’s. they customers there are very nice and very patient. i learn about all their special sales and how to hold a conversation with the customers"
good,When I first get there I take some of the “take backs” from customer service and put them away. Then I check all of the dressing rooms and clear them. I then go around the store and clean up the first two fixtures and every 15 minutes check the dressing rooms to maintain. After I get done doing the first two rows I then go back to the third and fourth row and so on.
good,"Kohls was an amazing experience in the world of retail. The people that I worked with were some of the most amazing people I have ever met, however management was something of wonders. The managers were secretly kind of rude to employees."
good,"a typical day at work consists of setting up your daily applications, taking calls, securing accounts, processing delinquent payments and orders. The hardest part of the job is not given information down the chain correctly."
good,"It is a good place to work. And you have a good benefit there. You have time off with pay once you get hired. The work environment is very friendly. You don’t have to work weekend all the time. But the incentive is really low. You get a raise annually,But it is not a lot."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Kohl's. We rarely had strenuous shifts and when we did, it was around holiday/back to school seasons. The people I worked with were great as well and made the job even more enjoyable. I was sad to leave when I did, but I was moving for school and didn't have time for a job."
good,"This store doesn't reward hard work unless you're 'in' with the managers. They've had an endless stream of assistant managers that fail to effectively motivate or reward the whole staff. Their focus is on the register staff and getting the credit signups. None of the floor staff gets those rewards, even though the closing team loses out on some scheduled time when they finish early"
good,"I worked at two locations. The first was very casual and fun, I learned a ton from everyone there."
good,"I enjoyed the department I worked in a lot, I would've stayed on longer but the position they had to offer was a position I was not interested in taking, but I overall enjoyed the people I my department"
good,Unloading new merchandise and displaying it on the sales floor. Unloading merchandise trucks. Work in different area of the store to become more familiar with products.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Job is fine the balance of life and work is decent. Dont expect to just stay in one area, you will rotate roles frequently. Managers typically help with most situations and are understanding."
good,Easy work tasks. Excellent Management. Easy going work environment. Sales floor is somewhat disorganized in some areas. Coworkers are very friendly making it and enjoyable work day.
good,"Working with Kohl's was a fun and rewarding Job, physically and mentally. Seasonal but didn't push me away, unloading trucks, friendly associate's great place to work"
good,My 2 job interviews at kohl's were very different. the first was a very hard and scary interview. It was very formal and respectful. i am very thankful to kohl's for having made me a part of the team. through them i learnt what real team work was when it came to super fast pace environment.
good,"It was a nice and peaceful job, really actually miss working there. They bought us lunch quit a few times. The customers are great. They are never out of stock and if they are we can order it. Great place."
good,"It's a standard retail job. It gives you an opportunity to work on your customer service skills. Not a lot of room to move up, however the other employees are good people and will make your time memorable."
good,"This position provided me with a large variety of issues to deal with, from simple transactions to very complicated exchanges. In a welcoming environment, this position made for a fantastic job that was easy to work around the other things going on in life."
good,"Kohls is like any other retail chain with good and bad customers. The particular Kohls I work at everyone treats each other well and have a good bond, some call the place a second home usually in a good way."
good,"My day consisted of clocking in, then going to my register. I would ring customers up and offer them credit cards and promotions. When it was slow I would fold clothes and put away my go backs. I usually closed and at the end of the shift we all helped to tidy up the store, clock out and leave. Lunch breaks were 30 mins. It got really fast paced and busy on Friday-Sunday"
good,"Overall kohls has a very positive environment and seeks to improve all of their fellow associates skills for their required job position. This is a very good place to start your first job and get experience in the real world, but I do not see it as beneficial job for a lifetime."
good,"Kohl's is appreciative of all their employees. They do lots of event days with snacks or a theme to dress to (i.e. ugly sweaters for Christmas). They provide rewards for our hard work to keep us motivated. There's almost always snacks in the fridge and creamers for coffee. The break room is terrific. We have a lot of huddles/town halls/meetings. Communication there is great, and management is very approachable. They always thank me for my hard work. Everyone there is involved and always willing to help. That said, the appreciation I receive there is not reflected on my paycheck. I have been there almost 3 years and have only received one raise. Our store has raised our salaries, but hasn't increased the payroll so our hours have been cut.  I am not getting the hours I need nor the pay I deserve."
good,"Corporate has lost touch with the current shopping trends and the demographics of specific stores. Policies need to adjust from time to time. Consistency is important but there are times when you need to look at the ""big picture"" and not necessarily the bottom line. If you chase the cash, you will never be successful, but if you run a great company money will be plentiful."
good,"Working at Kohls is busy. The people are friendly, we have many repeat customers. The scheduling is pretty flexible. Communication is good between associates and management. Most the employees work part time because of other jobs, and many have been there for years."
good,Kohls treated me well you work in a very family like atmosphere however management could use work and stop picking favorites  the pay is really bad you need another job if you are going to work here however it's very laid back and they have food for employees sometimes and the coworkers are so sweet
good,I would definitely recommend Kohl's if you would like a somewhat relaxing sales job. It is a slow-moving environment and traffic can pick up during the evening.
good,"On a daily basis, I would help a team of people unload the trucks and either push out merchandise to the main floor or stock it in inventory. The management team was kind and understanding and very helpful."
good,It's really a great place to work. Customer service is our number one job at kohl's.Management always willing to work with there associates. working there all these years i have come out of my shell more.I learned new skills to help me along in my job.Sometimes the hardest part of the job is when you try and help the customer and there still not happy also not having the equipment and fixture you need to get the job done.The most enjoyable part of the job is when you can make the day of that one customer and they tell you how helpful you were.
good,"As an intern, you will have 1 manager and 1 mentor who will be giving you tasks/projects to work on. On top of that, you will have this ""Shark Tank"" project/challenge where you work with other interns to come up with cool ideas to solve business problems (prompt different every year). Ultimately, your manager and mentor will decide whether you get a return offer."
good,Learned about retail and the functions of guest services. I also could choose my availability and request off. The co-workers were nice. Left after management change and for a better job opportunity.
good,Friendly staff and co-workers. Appropriate pay and periodic motivation of staff by supervisors. Recognition is given on a regular basis. Enough break rooms and car park.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,The store I worked at was very accepting that it was my first job and scared to death. I started as a cashier and worked my way up through the departments. You work a lot of weekends and the holidays and hectic.
good,"I worked peak 17,18. The first peak i worked i was kept after but had to leave due to family problems. The most recent peak i worked very hard but was not kept because i received too many points. Then four months later they contacted me and said they liked my performance during peak and offered me an interview. Now i am Perm Part-time."
good,"Fun environment to work at that is fact-paced at times but that is what makes the day go by faster! Kohls associates were like my second family and everyone is so supportive of each other. My least favorite part of the job however was how strict the company is on getting people to sign up for the credit card. The way we are trained is pretty much to not take no for an answer and would get reprimanded if we didn't meet a certain goal of credit cards in a day. "
good,Kohl’s is a great place to work. Pay could be higher but there are opportunities to get extra hours. Management is helpful to everyone. Benefits are good.
good,I would walk in and go to the back of the store and clock in. Then I would put my stuff in my locker and see where I was working at that day. I would walk up to the cashiers and get on a  register and log in then I would call for the next person waiting in line. As they would come to me I would ask them if they found everything okay. Also I would bring up about signing up for a kohl’s credit.
good,"For a great place to work you don’t make good money. Besides that, they do offer benefits even to part time associates so that’s a plus. "
good,"i loved the benefits, which included legal services and pet insurance.  there are plenty ( about once a month ave  ) days they provide lunch/dinner. work is pretty easy in all depts. 10 and 12 hr work days. differentials for  3rd shift, weekend days, weekend nights and equipment operators"
good,Enjoyed the day to day. Management can be strict but never rude. They do what they can to keep employees engaged and rewarded for the extra hours worked and obvious stressful time of year.
good,"noting to difficult working there its a good place to start work but unless you ,move to a full time position its not a way to make a living but if they do work around your availability if your going to school or have another job"
good,"Overall my experience working at kohl’s was very pleasent, it’s a great place to work. I was able to be flexible and all of management was very thankful for that"
good,Great place to work wonderful people to work with but the best thing is the discount and the location and they are really flexible with your schedule what ever you may need it to be the only bad thing is the low wage.
good,"Love the store, merchandise is great quality and sale prices are beneficial. Working with our coworkers is fun and everyone is very helpful since we are short staffed the work can be overloaded at times but as a team we do what we can and work together. Many times you have to watch the time you need a break because if not they will forget and you’ll lose that time. With Amazon returns extra work I believe we should have an increase in pay but that’s my opinion since that alone is alot itself. The company does offers great perks to employees and you do save."
good,"While working at Kohl's I always had the support of the management team. Work was face paced, and we had to manage our time correctly. But we always laughed and had fun. Kohl's is a great neighborhood store as not matter what it feels like family."
good,"It's a good starter job for the younger crowd or a good part time job for any one looking to make extra money or just wanting to work seasonally. There are several departments to chose from ranging from light work such as doing quality detailed checks, to more physically demanding such as loading and unloading of trailers."
good,Seasonal hours great but then cutback hours after.Good place to work.Nice discount Nice people and managementsOverall great lace............................
good,I loved my managers and some co workers. Great place to work if you got the hours needed to pay bills. If you worked cash register you needed to sell credit cards to get hours.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is the ability to do many different tasks everyday.  The work environment is friendly.  The hardest part is the inadequate staffing.
good,Working in Kohl's was a great experience for me. It allowed me to work with customers and aid them in different ways that they needed. The job helped me grow in areas of my personal life.
good,It’s a great place to work just the location I was at didn’t have much hours. Management is wonderful. Lots of areas to work. Lots of advancements for sure. I learned a lot for being filfullment/picker.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Got along very will with fellow associates and managenent. They do a good job of giving out enough breaks to get you through the day without making you overly exhausted. But sometimes they are understaffed and it causes some turmoil in whether you can get things done or not.
good,"The job was not hard to pick up, fellow associates are well mannered. Some of the customers put a strain on being polite but the experience in retail has helped me better understand people."
good,"Jobs for the day are posted in the office and customer service. Each employee is trained well and thorough to do their job efficiently. If needed, help from other employees is welcoming and inviting. Coworkers are open and exciting to work with. Communication skills are difficult between management and employees."
good,"Third shift is no longer a part of Kohl’s but for a seasonal job, it was nice to able to put things out on the floor and take your time making the store look nice."
good,Kohls is a great place to work. They really work with your schedule and the managers were all very kind and helpful and caring at my location. The only downside is if you’re working part time you can get anywhere from 5-25 hours a week and it’s hard to live off of 5 hours a week.
good,It’s a great place to work at especially when starting in retail. You have to the chance to learn every position in the store. The store I worked at I had great relationship with my store manager she was the nicest person you will ever meet. Some of the associates I worked were extremely lazy. Overall my experience at kohl’s was great.
good,In the omni team the point is to grab online orders from around the store and prepare them for shipping. On a normal day it is a manageable shift of walking around the store trying to find products while occasionally assisting a customer.  Holidays will turn into a mad shift of trying to fulfill massive amounts of orders within the time limits with not much time for recovery.  Fortunately dealing with customers isn't the main priority so it's a nice position for those that like to keep to themselves a bit.
good,It's good for a first job. Every body gets along with each other. You get a nice experience from every department. You can totally change your schedule and managers are nice.
good,"Good company to work for based on their ethics and values and how they treat their customers. The focus of Kohl's is the customers. They try to say ""yes"" to every customer to make their shopping experiences the best that they can possibly be, even if the customer isn't necessarily entitled to certain things.  The work environment for my particular location was fun.  I had a good time with the co-workers I had. I made some good connections there.  Volunteer and community service opportunities were almost always available for the employees to participate in, which was great for people looking to add more things to their resume."
good,Kohls was a good job for the holiday season.  The training was very good.  The hours were sometimes long and managers didn't always make sure breaks were able to be taken.
good,Kohl’s is a very fast paced environment to work. There are many days where it is very busy. But there may be some days it’s calm. It’s a nice place to work. Flexible hours too!
good,I liked working there and I still would be there if our location did not close. We were not only associates we were family. We had a job to do and we helped others do there job if needed.I unloaded the truck to place items on floor . I also helped customers with there items.I also was on the sales floor to make sure the floor looked clean also the dressing rooms.
good,"Not too busy unless its the season very relaxed at times but fast paced when its busy. Management was alright, they pushed too much about credits and making people sign up."
good,"It's retail so most of the day in any job is taking care of the customer.  For a couple years I was there I did training of the new hires and new product training to everyone. I was a supervisor on the clothing side, then went to the front-end supervisor (registers and customer service).  I was often the manager on duty for the store since I was the super for the front end.  The last several months I was the overnight supervisor managing the truck team."
good,"Great company, team environment, positive, and always motivating their employees. Made fun and awesome team projects and challenges to motivate employees as well."
good,It is exciting to be a part of an ever changing company with diverse values and growth. Kohl's has been an exceptional part of my development as an executive. I look forward to taking my knowledge with me and building upon my success as a leader.
good,"A work day at Kohls consist of cleaning out dressing rooms, working cash register and opening kohls charge cards. Make sure the store Work place culture, I was able to meet so many different people at kohls in Las Vegas. So many different cultures and life changes when just talking to customers. Hardest part of the job holiday season, most enjoyable seeing my customers happy."
good,"I enjoyed working for Kohl's, but it is hard work being on your feet 5-8 hours/day, moving fixtures and merchandise.  The management was generally upbeat and encouraging."
good,Overall the management was great and working did not feel like a terrible chore. Kohl's has great communication between all associates due to walkies which is a perfect way for people to grow their interpersonal communication in order to complete your job. When needed anyone near the cashiers would be asked to help which again gives an opportunity to learn and better yourself. I would not mind working there again if it wasn't for the low wages and low amount of hours.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Typical day consisted of coming in early, and setting up racks for merchandise to be pushed out to the floor. Learned how to sort through different kinds of merchandise and where to put them. Organized the merchandise based of type into different locations for back stock. Management was helpful and ensured thorough assurance to complete tasks. Hardest part of the job, were during holidays. Most enjoyable part of the job, was being able to assist customers in locating merchandise."
good,"As an employee at kohl's the work was somewhat monotonous but the managers did what they could to keep us engaged and productive. The pay was decent, right around what the average for our area was."
good,"They worked with your schedule better than most retail. People that come to work at retail need to remember that retail stores need you to work weekends because that is there busiest times. If ask far enough in advance you can get weekend days off. If cannot weekends you should not apply. This was the best retail company I have worked for. The managers explained policies well, work with their employees and offered incentives."
good,"Such an upbeat and fun place to work. It is very fast paced but the people make it worth while. The hourly pay is decent for a college aged student, but not ideal to live off of completely."
good,Kohls was an easy place to work. All of the tasks were straightforward and management made working an enjoyable experience. Hours were lacking outside of peak holiday season.
good,"When you work there for so long the people become family. And if you dont like the managers, they are always switching and swapping places so always room to grow and move up"
good,"This is a great first job for someone either right out of high school or in college. Very flexible with great work to life balance, benefits, and vacation time."
good,"Very steady work and competitive. Had a video game room.Cross training different jobs, Onsite wellness center. Lots of team building.Able to participate in  voluntary events"
good,"Great choice for my second job, learned a lot about restocking, organization, point of sales, rewards programs and teamwork. Besides the minimum wage salary, I enjoyed my time here."
good,Kohls is a fun place to work. The co-workers at my store always help our and are focused to make the store the best it can be. The management team at my store support their associates 100%.
good,I wish they would have offered  me a permanant position I wouldve took it great place to work the staff is nice and I was provided and the manager is awesome
good,"I worked at the one in Columbus Ohio for 3 years. I gained a lot of experience working at kohls, cash handling, balancing the register at the end of the night, dealing with all types of customers. Good experience, the store was a  larger store, so was able to become familiar with the merchandise, ad set , promotions, deals,"
good,"was basic cashier ,learned how to run a computerize cash register,my manager was a good manager and helpful,the hardest part was mainly reaching shift required credit apps.once I learned the job I was left aione"
good,was only there a short time but enjoyed working with the staff management was ok dealing with customers who would try and return merchandise that the store did not sell
good,"I worked here for a limited time, and really enjoyed myself while working here. I felt like I could grow within here. I worked hard here and wanted to stay but sadly was let go due to no hours."
good,A typical day at work at Kohl's dealt with many different types of responsibilities.  Such as; ensure the department was fully staffed and merchandise was restocked and out for display.
good,"Management is willing to work around scheduling. Willing to crosstrain in other areas. Culture is great; very friendly co-workers. "
good,I personally really liked working at Kohls. I was originally a seasonal worker but they gave me a perminant position at the end. They offer great discounts for employees and goof benefits when you can get customers to apply for a Kohls charge.
good,"A typical day at work would be me coming in at around 8 am setting up my station for work. Then around 9, the people start coming in, and I start helping customers with any questions or help them with their purchase. That's how it goes for a while until things calm down and no one shows up I then clean my station and return unwanted items. Afterward, I would wrap up and gather my things and go home."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Wish the management was better at being for the accociates and not the all mighty credits, as well as the hours being better but overall a fun place to work."
good,"Fulfilling web orders by pulling items from the floor and back stock."
good,I enjoyed my time at this company. I enjoyed volunteer work through the company. Everyone at the company was friendly and helpful. I would recommend this company to anyone looking for work.
good,"The work environment was not overwhelming, the company is eager for you to ask questions and learn new skills. The scheduling was very flexible. The company has employees come together to meet credits and work together in a team,"
good,"Recently promoted in November, the busiest time of year.  Face pace environment.  I like the team I work with.  I have learned a lot with merchandising"
good,n my experience working there training was terrible. Management didn’t communicate well at all. Opportunities to advance were limited and not really worth the time. Hard work didn’t get acknowledged.
good,"Providing customer service, and recovery of the store at the end of the day.  Kohls offers a fun atmosphere with opportunities to learn new tasks.  The hardest part of the job is remaining positive and profession with customers who are not happy."
good,I really enjoyed my time in this company. I was going to school so they fixed my hours. management was good no complains on that note I would recommend it for college students
good,Fun place to work work made many great friends. Would recommend as a place to work for someone in school. Works well with school schedules and allows you to make enough money to make it through college.
good,"Managers were great. it is low pay, but if its for a part time gig it could be worse. Hardest part of the job would have had to be being one of the very few men which worked on the truck team."
good,"Welcoming and friendly management, competent co-workers, generally friendly workplace, generous management, happy customers, and patient supervisor. lovely place to work."
good,"Very enjoyable place to work at, the higher ups are very appreciative and nice. The working environment is calm and easy to get used to. Give a good amount of breaks and will help you with your problems as best as they can."
good,enjoyed working here and meeting the people that i did. Learned a lot about the business and was able to better my skills. I loved having the flexibility of the hours.
good,When working for kohls you never are alone. You're always on a team. Managers are always there to help if you need help. Customers are generally nice.
good,I had a really good time working at kohls it was only a seasonal job. I had good people to work with never rude. Mangers were very understating. Loved working there
good,The people I worked with definitely made the job for me. There was a very strong culture of comradery amongst everyone that worked at my particular location.
good,"Great part time job for a highs school student and great first time job"
good,Management is full of supportive and helpful people willing to work with you if you are willing to work with them. Work can be long and lack luster but they try to keep you occupied and for a stocking and truck worker it isnt all that bad.
good,"At Kohl's you become part of a family. You are taken care of by the other staff. As a team member, you also get to choose the kinds of things you wanna do. They love when you go above what you are supposed to do and learn new things because that helps the store a lot."
good,"The work was steady, most of the coworkers were honest, business practices were very gray area, numbers/quotas were always more important than safety, and supervisory/management style wasn't perfect."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I enjoyed working at kohl’s. The employees were ice and helpful while management, generally, were respectful. Of all the managers I had and the two locations I worked at, only two left a bad taste in my mouth. The discounts are pretty nice through the entirety of the year and they don’t overwork you."
good,"A lot of different types of eqipment to work on weekly. Learning was very positive and the workplace was very good. Management actually let the employs accomplish thier jobs,"
good,I did a little bit of everything. I know how to do mostly everything around the store and how every department woks. All the associates like to help each other to learn more effective ways to work.
good,"Kohl's is a very competitive, collaborative work environment. Days fly by, and no days are the same. The people that work there are great, and the management is inspiring. Hours can be long during parts of the year. Overall great place to work."
good,"I like working here however a steady work week would be a better environment.   The not knowing if one week you have 4 hours and the next you have 20 is crazy,"
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at the Hanford, CA Kohl's - Management was the key."
good,"I worked at Kohl's for almost 10 years. I enjoyed working at Kohl's because the overnight crew was so much fun to work with. Now that I don't work there anymore, I miss them."
good,come into work and see what is on my agenda for the day and get right to work. help out at registers if asked otherwise work and be productive until time to leave.
good,"Everyone gets along, lots of friends being made and people knew when to work and not play or joke around. Sometimes they even pay for your lunch as in buy you lunch."
good,"Meeting and greeting customers, educating them of the advantages of having a Kohls charge and how these discounts apply. Meeting and greeting customers.  Management works together with employees to bring greatness to the team.  The only one thing that is stressful in working there, would be pushing credit each and every  day.  The most enjoyable part would be working with great people and saving the customers money in the discounts."
good,I definitely believe that this is a great company to work for. I am on year four with this company and store three. This company really does care about its employees and managers
good,"Love the great customer service"
good,"A very laid back environment, you must meet quotas, but the scheduling is very flexible, difficult to get a fulltime position. Pay was adequate for starting position."
good,"Fast paced, lots of soliciting promotions and credit card applications.  A friendly place to work and most of the customers are pleasant.   Over the Holiday crunch, management had a buffet of food for the employees which was nice."
good,"When working in a department, you fold and hang clothes and help customers. It's a lot of walking. Management is helpful. You are expected to help at the registers when needed."
good,"A typical day at work was gathering clothes from the fitting rooms and placing them in their correct location onto the sales floor. I would also answer any customer questions or concerns. Moreover, I would help out at the cash register as an extra cashier when the lines would get too lengthy."
good,Worked in a customer service position and really enjoyed my job.  Interaction with both customers and employees.  Very busy at times but overall an enjoyable job.
good,"Great place to work when they are super busy, during the holidays.  Would have liked to stay after it slowed down after Christmas.  But, they cut all the seasonal help."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Kohl's employees worked well as a team. Associates were given tasks that suited their strengths and there were plenty of opportunities to learn. Kohl's always worked around my schedule to help me achieve my other life goals.
good,"This job pays the bills and doesn't demand too much so it's a good job; however, I would not want to do it long term. If you need something to help pay for school that gives you flexible hours this is a good option."
good,"worked around my schedule however when it comes to guaranteed hours they might not be able to do that but its not the stores fault its the companies. great vibes, and management talks to you and clearly states what they want done."
good,"The environment is very relaxed and punctual. Management is very organized and determined to have a great service everyday of the week. Coworkers are reliable, trustworthy, and friendly of course. I would recommend this store to almost all of my friends as a first job experience. The job is very well set and easy to get used to and comfortable."
good,Great place to work as a part time portion of needed. They’re always hiring during the holiday season and typically keep seasonal help if wanted. Trainings are quick and straightforward forward.
good,In jewelry I had more responsibility than most. I feel I should have been paid more than a folder or cashier. Very fun work environment and managers were outgoing and there for the associates. I would recommend this job to a friend and would go back if they had better pay.
good,The people I work with make me strive to be the best and lead them the best way I can. I am a natural born leader and I go out my way to try to help the build be number 1 I know processes that management doesn't even know. I am looking for more that what Kohl's can offer me.
good,Cross training is a plus. You will not get bored. Loved working with the associates. Hours vary depending on need and availability. Always learning something new.
good,"Some managers are more strict than others, so it really depends who you work for most days. Everyone helps each other out for the most part. Holidays and big sales can get crazy, but usually they are prepared to have a lot of staff for those kinds of days. It was overall a good company to work at and go to school part time."
good,Khol was new to area when I started. Soi  had a part in setting up the store and working there. We had a great manager that seen to care about the people that work there.
good,"The best part about this job was definitely my coworkers and management. That being said, not every store will be this lucky. My managers listen to problems and try to address them and nearly everyone contributes to a positive work environment. The worst part of this job is definitely the customers. I worked a lot in customer service here and a lot of people are convinced that I'm trying to steal their money in some way. There are rules I have to follow, yes, but most of the time I'm trying to get them the best deal possible."
good,it is a very nice place to work my job is very flexible and accomodating to my busy lifestyle they have great perks and treat the employees fairly. i enjoy working for kohls
good,Before I worked at Kohls I had no experience at all but now I do. Mostly everyone there I work with are very nice and caring. I love how they hand out awards. I don’t like the pay. $9.25 is not enough
good,I believe that you should wear a smile and be courtious to all customers. I try to help or wait on a customer the way I would want to be treated. When a customer you're waiting on tries to tell you something is on sale and you know for sure that it just went off sale you can explain this to the customer and if they still want the sale price get your manager. The best partof a job is when you know you've put a smile on someones face just because you helped them.
good,"A typical day at kohls is positive most days. The day will consist of checking out customers and keeping the sales floor clean and organized. The work environment is positive, however, if an employee does not make the credit goal, hours are cut and they are moved off of register even if they are a great worker otherwise. If an employee can sell the kohls credit card, they will be successful, if not they will be disregarded."
good,The managers make sure everyone is enjoying their job and works with them when help is needed. Always show how important each worker are to the company.
good,Kohl’s promotes a team work environment. There are some good workers who care about doing a good job not only within their assigned departments but for the entire store. Customer service is their number one priority.
good,"I really quite enjoyed being a part of this company, because they always did everything they could to make sure I was successful at my job each shift."
good,"Kohl's always kept me busy, and it made the day go by pretty fast. I was cross-trained so my typical day I spent cleaning out fitting rooms, folding clothes, backing up on the registers, at customer service, and at jewelry. I assisted customers when needed and trained new employees."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"My experience here at kohls was okay, the pay rate was very good. The department where i was at was nothing but ladies. Although i did relocate i would come back again"
good,A typical work day was busy depending on the day. Beginning of the week was a lot more relaxed and towards the end of week it would be very busy. I learned how to communicate with customers and employees. I learned how to use a cash register. The management was decent. At Kohl's they had a head manager and then multiple department manager/ supervisors. The workplace culture was fast past and hard working. The hardest part of the job was weekend because the fitting room took a while to get under control. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help customers and putting a smile on there face.
good,"Management gives good hours if you work hard and are willing to have a flexible schedule. Got along well well with coworkers as well, didnt have much to complain about."
good,I think as far as a first time job this was perfect for my situation. They treat the employees fair and the job is not difficult. They were flexible with me if i wanted time off and the team work within the job was great.
good,It was a very intense experience working at Kohl's but rewarding due to the people you met and the experience working at a customer service job. it gave me valuable tools to bring into other workplaces.
good,"This retail establishment is smaller, but the atmosphere was like family. I did not like their promotion regulations, but there was always chances to pick up more shifts."
good,Kohl's is a really fun environment to work because they make you feel like you're the family they take care of their employees with great health benefits and make sure day employees take care of their families back at home
good,"Co-workers were great, took and gave constructive criticism well. Customers were usually happy that we were there to help them, we go out of our way to make sure that shoppers have a positive experience at Khol's."
good,Working as a cashier wasn't so bad until the goal wasn't met when the cash flow is slow and management tend to get the employees to get the credit card applications.
good,A great employee with dedication to her company and takes pride in her service. she is a leader among her peers. and a great person to be associated with.
good,very relaxed at times. overall a competitive company. fast advancements . Fun environment. friendly. up lifting. great customer serves. could be difficult at times but teammates will help out.
good,I worked here only as a seasonal employee and I loved it. Kohl's treated me very  well and I got along with everyone including managers. They treated the employees often with food and special discounts.
good,"great place to work when ready for opportunities to help you grow"
good,Nice place to work as a part timer. Great culture and opportunity to pick up extra shifts. Flexible hours which is great while you are a student or decided to get an extra job.
good,Having good employees to work with and support systems. It was a nice and friendly environment. I learned how to be patient with customers and staff members.
good,if you've ever been to a kohls you know how messy it can get and that can get pretty stressful. price discrepancy was a big issue that customers constantly complained about
good,the new manager is awesome chico ca. liked the way they treated the employees was happy had to relocate to where there was no store. Old manager and staff very shadey but other than that the work load was good and ability to think for our selves was nice
good,I was only there for a small contract but i was pleased for being my first job in the field. i used what i learned to build into a great career. they have fully staffed kitchens for all their employees.
good,A fast paced competitive job. Learning to drive results and loyalty. Lots of hours and responsibility but fairly compensated. Great first job. Would not recommend to women with children.
good,Enjoy management and I enjoy the work environment.  I didn’t enjoy having to push credits on the register. Really liked the flexible schedule. I liked all the employees.
good,"My only complaint is attendance policy is bogus and they have no leniency. So hope you don't get really sick, in the hospital, or have loved ones die. Management is inconsistent with all of their ways"
good,I love everyone who works there. It is a great place to work. We are truly one big family and someone is always there to help you out when you need it.
good,Kohl's is a very friendly work place. You do have to make credit (sell kohl's cards) so if you are not comfortable with that then it is not the best place for you. But other than that they are very flexible and understanding.
good,Great place to work for. Management is wonderful and very good with work life balance. Pay is good for the amount of work you are required to do. Great discounts
good,"A typical work day at Kohl's includes refolding displays of clothes and clearing out the dressing rooms, putting the clothes back on the correct rack in the correct department."
good,This place is good for someone seeking heir first job or want to have fun making money on the side. i liked working here but the hours aren't that good.
good,There was always something to be done. I enjoyed the fact that it mostly kept me busy. The associates and managers were very kind. I would have stayed if I was receiving more hours.
good,"Too much drama, expect to get looked down upon if you can't get customers to sign up for a credit card, also don't be shocked at how many times customers will completely mess up the store."
good,Was very good at working with school schedule. Has a very work atmosphere along with good management of work power and dealing with wor issues. They are very good at working with you to get trained and work around issues that I might have
good,Warehouse - unload truck. Set up new displays. Put out new merchandise out to the sales floor. Restock sales floor. Help assist with customers. Clean dress rooms. Cashier / customer service.

good,It's a nice place to work and the people are nice to work with. they let employees have a flexible schdule and sometimes give lunch in the break room.
good,I was over the shoe department i would help people find the shoes they wanted for any situation. I maintained the Home and kids department as well. Straight forward job.
good,I learnedthe work force. I learned how to work the cashier and Management is very friendly there. When first starting everyone was very noce and helped with any questions I had.
good,the coworkers and management is good and overall my job was easy to accomplish. I worked on the sales floor helping customers while cleaning up the merchandise and setting new programs. it gets a little busy and crazy during the holidays but overall i enjoyed my job.
good,I was responsible for working the Customer Service desk taking care of Returns. I also worked the cash office and balanced the cash books. Responsible for daily deposits and setting up registers for the day.
good,Kohls is a good warehouse to work. It is a fast paced environment as are most warehouses. The management is good at keeping track of the work you do and they let you know how you are doing.
good,"I loved my job at Kohl's because of the other employees, but I did not get paid near enough what I wanted to and the hours were very lacking. I also asked many times for opportunities for advancement after I got my business degree, and nothing happened, so I decided to join the military. If I had advanced I would still be there."
good,"I love my job here, the only reason I would leave is because right now they are only giving me around 6-10 hours a week and I can't live like that. Other than that, I love working here, great coupons and discounts, and I love the ones I work with."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."

good,My typical day was pretty busy with man things to do; I learned how to manage my time and clean up the store as well as acquire knowledge in retail and how to count/stock the store. Management was extremely friendly and loved to help out associates succeed.
good,"Each shift varies from 10-12 hours per day. Most departments work in correspondence with each other. The pay is great and if kept busy time flies by. However you must be physically prepared to work, walk, and climb floors for your entire shift. Be prepared to get dirty and you will do just fine."
good,Working at Kohl’s was my first job and it taught me how to talk to and deal with customers. Sometimes not all customers were nice so it also taught me how to be mature about situations and how to handle them.
good,Working at Kohls was a lot of fun! Although they didn't train you 100% because you were expected to be able to think on your toes. The management team is great and able to assist you with any questions or concerns you may have! It's a great first job or for someone just starting out.
good,"It was a great place to work. They have a nice employee lounge with a ping pong table, cafeteria, and vending machines. They also have great and understanding managers,"

good,A nice job but maybe just not worth the nine dollars an hour for all the work you do. But they do give you a number of breaks depending on the amount of time you are working.
good,"Great management and awesome group of people to work with. First place I worked for that offers breaks for employees and I like how the environment felt busy but I was never too stressed out. However, like a lot of companies do nowadays, they are short-staffed and as a result the racks get cluttered and the floor has a bunch of lint on it as no one has the time to be able to fix the problems."
good,Kohls is a fast paced demanding job. The work culture is great. Working at Kohl's was like truly having a second family. Kohl's is on the right path to a successful future unlike many other retailers.
good,"Enjoy meeting new and repeat customers."
good,"It was usually busy in the store, so there was almost always something I could do in order to keep me busy. I learned how accomplish multiple side tasks while providing great customer service there. The management always felt that I was a responsible and quick learner so they would often have me step away from the register to help out in other areas of the building."
good,"Cross training is available, if eagerly sought out. Depending on what department you are in will depend on your day. Working at the jewelry counter is very relaxed, but around the holidays, it's very busy. Working at the register is fast-paced, as long as you have the customers. Basic training typically starts at the cash register. There's always something to do in the Misses-Mens-Juniors and the Home-and-Kids departments. The customer service desk can only be available to you if you've worked there for a certain amount of time and if you have proved yourself to management and to the teams you work in."
good,Working at Kohl's seasonally is great for the discount!  The pressure for obtaining emails and charge applications is intense.  Some managers have ridiculous games for if you do/do not get a charge application during your shift.  Made me very uncomfortable.
good,"I enjoyed working here but it was only a seasonal position. For the most part co-workers are very friendly, the job is fast-paced and does require some heavy lifting."
good,"I respected the company more after working at one of their locations."
good,"Loved my job very much, great management and very flexible hours just not enough pay. They were fantastic when it came to working around my college schedule and were great about giving you the time off you request."
good,it was a joy to work there the other people were nice and made everyone smile. it was slow paced and very easy work and loved the no set uniform. and more freedom of appearance within reason
good,"*Great part-time job"
good,"Fast pace but enjoyed helping customers. Great work environment. Short breaks with a lot of work. Many Late nights. Great managers, very respectful. Hard work."
good,"Being the largest store in the district, the Kohl's I currently work at has a very fast-paced environment. I learned patience and perseverance while working here. Management is filled with kind and caring people who try to get the most out of everyone working there. The hardest part of the job is trying and failing to get everything done on time."
good,"Kohl's is advancing faster than ever before through technology, operations, and infrastructure.  Many enhancements are great, but with speed comes confusion and at times the true priority may be in question."
good,I have always loved the great team work and fun that Kohls tries to have. Its like family when you are hired there. Everyone is so nice and welcoming.
good,"Kohl's DC Is improving. At first, management had poor communication. but when i reported harassment to HR, the problem was fixed the same week. Pay is very good for the amount of work. I would recommend Kohl's over other DCs. Communication was getting better when i was there."
good,"It was an okay experience however it was a very demanding job, that required more effort than needed for the pay that was being bestowed upon the workers."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Friendly place to work where great customer service is emphasized.  Started as a seasonal associate and it turned into an 11-year career.  If you enjoy working with customers, and the general craziness that can come with retail, I would recommend working here."
good,I loved this job while I was their & everyone is very lovable as well. I only left this job because I needed to better provide for my family and I couldn't pass the opportunity up.
good,"Excellent company that cares about its workers.  As a cashier there is an opportunity to learn all aspect of the positions available, from putting out merchandise, to sales floor coverage, and customer service.  Kohl's is a successful retail store that is always looking to improve and  meet the customers' needs."
good,"The associates and people are amazing all around. Management is also great and very constructive with you. I currently feel that for my position as a shoe lead, I am not paid enough for my duties but the hours i work are also part time and are very flexible"
good,This job was pretty fun with a nice discount on employee purchases.  The only downside to working on the freight team is the frequency of the trucks.  The hours were low due to few trucks.  This is a great job if you like to work at a fast pace which helps the time fly by!
good,I did a lot of work in the stockroom. I worked on a cash register. I stocked shelves. I folded clothes. They gave a lot of breaks. I got a walkie talkie.
good,"I love working at Kohl's as a seasonal associate. I have met some nice people, my hours worked out perfectly, and I would work here seasonal again. Great experience in retail if you haven't ever worked in retail. I also love the associate discounts"
good,Job is very busy. They do give you  two 30 mintutes breaks. They will allow you to work everyday during peak season.  Great place to work for extra money.
good,"Remember, the customer is always right. I learned to count money quickly and understand retail store operations. The management taught valuable organizational skills. These skills included.soliciting credit, inventory prepping, online order filling, and department managing. The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy boxes. The most enjoyable part of Kohl's was getting a 100% satisfaction rating in a post sale review."
good,"It isn't too crazy and everyone who works there is friendly. Managers give sufficient breaks, and they are clear on instructions for any project that needs to be done in the store."
good,"Working at Kohl's was my favorite job growing up. Everyday it was something new and different. Making your work day fun and exciting, because you never knew what your next work day was going to bring."
good,"Great place to work family, friend atmosphere.you are given opportunity for advancement. Your hours are flexible if needed and adjustable. Employees work with the community have blood drives, c"
good,"Kohl's is a great company to gain retail experience and learn how to work effectively in a team setting. You learn knew things every day, and have a lot of practice with developing personal skills such as communication with others, organization and time management."
good,"Very great place to work. They are very flexible with your schedule, I also had awesome co workers when I worked there. They associates jobs are pretty calm and routine."
good,"Assist customers from helping them look for a certain item, checking to see if we have it, or checking the customer out at the register. Management was great, worked well with your school schedule or other job. The hardest part about this job was how busy it got during the holidays, the most enjoyable part was it there was always something to do, and you go to interact with a lot of people."
good,Kohl's is a great place to work. A typical shift is 4-5 hours. We greet customers and complete customers sales transactions. We also assist floor associates in maintaining an orderly sales floor.
good,Friendly people and great to work for! Recommend to anyone! Flexible hours. Great people. Amazing break room and benefits if you get high enough. Would go back to work there for sure!
good,I have been working with Kohl's for over six months now and on average I get 8-16 hours a week. No one really gets great hours as no one other than managers are full time. Management is great and treats everyone with respect and are very friendly. There are a lot of events that Kohl's participates in for volunteering and charity. We have many ice cream days and other themed days that management provides for employees. A few times a year employees get a 55% sale which is really nice. Even as part time you are able to receive vision and dental insurance as well as other plans.
good,Would meet a lot of people from other countries. Management was great. Workplace was great. The hardest part of working was during the Christmas  holidays.
good,"The managers are always willing to help, and support every employee. They have many open position for you to grow within the company. It does a good job having their employees volunteer at community events."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Juggling a variety of tasks in this role.  Important to be able to multi-task to balance heavy workload.  New omni-channel responsibilities bring added workload with none coming off the workload.  Management just expects more yet offers little compensation increases to offset.
good,Was a good job to get a start out at after high school. The management was nice and organized for the most part. Never had any problems requesting time off. overall a good job experience
good,"I work on the average only about 8 hours per week, mostly on Saturdays. Hours were steady and flexible. Kohl's gave me my first job and trained me as cashier and allowed me to use f=my own creativity for product displays."
good,"It all depends on the area where you work and the volume that the brand you work on does. The more eyes on you, the more stressful the environment, every small detail counts."
good,"The other associates were always very friendly and helpful. Everyone generally seemed to care about the customers, and would go out of their way to assist them, as well as other associates. I started during the holiday season, so my work place orientation was on condensed timeline. However, rarely was there an experienced associate not available to assist in my learning-on-the-job. If you pay attention, you can learn  quite a bit about sales, and the business world. Or, if you're simply looking for an interesting job with cool people, KOHL's is an excellent start."
good,"If retail is something that you love, Kohls is a pretty fun place to work. The discounts for employees is really great and they really take care of employees in that way. The environment is relaxed and even when things are hectic or overwhelming, I found the days to be enjoyable."
good,Nice place to work. Managers are great and work with you. Other associates are quick to help out when needed. There is always something to do. Breaks and lunch are frequent and well structured.
good,"When fully staffed Kohl's is a fun place to work that is balanced with the work load.  Management is great, they listen to your concerns or suggestions and are proactive in getting the concerns resolved and the suggestions talked about and/or implemented."
good,It was a fun place to work. I really liked some of my co-workers they helped the time pass on the slow days and were a big help on busy days. I worked as a cashier and was told over and over on a daily basis to push different customer programs or management would talk to you about your sales skills.
good,I really like the way Kohl's gives back to the community.  Their associates are allowed to participate in many community events and this helps with team building.
good,Much room for advancement and improvement with a helpful and supportive set of management. Pay is not that great and hours are not guaranteed as a new employee
good,"It was evenly both fast and slow-paced, depending on the time of year. It was also competitive for extra money in your paychecks, depending on how many customers you could get signed up for the Kohl's card each day. I liked getting to dress up in a nice, stylish, cosmopolitan fashion, it made me feel very pretty, fashionable, and professional. The hardest part was trying to be manipulative/persuasive into getting customers to sign up for the Kohl's card. I'm a very honest, down-to-earth person, and trying to persuade people into signing up when you very well know how things work is difficult for me, so I didn't very often get added money into my checks."
good,"Typical day a Kohls involved ringing up customers and giving discounts, as well as signing them up for the Kohls credit card.  You always had to maintain a clean work place and balance your drawer at the end of your shift.  The hardest thing about working at Kohls was working the holidays. Other then that Kohls was an enjoyable place to work."
good,"In the dying days of department store retailers, Kohl's will be among the last dinosaurs to sink. They consistently both stay true to their customer base and adapt to meet new expectations. I rank them as one of the best brick and mortar retailers, period. "
good,Is meeting your quota for credits This job has you on your feet your entire shift (except for your break time) and bending over and back up over and over again to fold and put clothes in their proper areas. You really have to know your way around the store and the departments because you will be asked about random items through out your shifts.
good,"was very relaxed, i enjoyed the hands on customer service experience i gained while there. staff backed me up when customers were horrible and unreasonable."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I enjoyed it. Nothing bad to say about it. The management is okay, not the best, but they get the job done. Great culture. It was very easy and the everyone was welcoming."
good,I had fun while I was there. Good management and fun overall employees too work with. Was fast paced but didn't mind one bit. Loved working with the truck unloading crew
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work. Both customers and staff are friendly, and the overall atmosphere is comfortable. I would recommend Kohl's to anyone who is interested in applying."
good,"Supervisors encourage new ideas and coworkers are always helpful. The most enjoyable AND hardest part of the job were working with customers. Not all customers are easy to deal with, but it helped me learn how to deal with them in a positive way."
good,low pay boring job very rushed by management would not recommend working here unless you like silence and fold clothes rapidly. it wasn't a place i enjoyed working at at all
good,Worked for a string of bad bosses. The only thing wrong with the job aside from not getting paid enough for the city. Overall the job itself you need to deal with high levels. Some of the policies not always best foot forward.
good,Enjoyed my time at KOHL'S. They were open to new ideas and improvements. I grew a lot as a manager here and would definitely recommend it as a place to work.
good,"Need a little extra cash to pay for Christmas presents, Holiday employment with Kohl's Department Store is a great way to spread holiday cheer and check off the Christmas list for those special people in your life."
good,"I was only here for a month during the holiday season and for most people that's when business gets hectic and disorganized, but Kohl's really makes sure there is enough staff at all times and that no one feels overwhelmed while also allowing their associates to show initiative and gain reward for their job well done."
good,This location was a tight knit team. There was always cross training and we would help one another.  Our ultimate goal was to provide excellent customer service. Along with the management we worked to give the customr a pleasent shopping experience.
good,"I worked here for about a year and on average I worked only one to two times a week despite having open availability, and each shift is usually 4 hours. Made no money and worked very hard, lots of walking."
good,"My experience working for Kohls was overall good. I unloaded trucks, stocked, and helped out on the floor.  My only complaints are not enough hours or pay."
good,"I've been here 3 months. They are flexible with hours. Break room has vending machines. User friendly websites to view paychecks, request time off, manage benefits, etc. Friendly work environment."
good,"With the retail landscape as it is, Kohls has held its own. No major closings. Growth. Focus on the customer. Let's management the freedom to make sure the customer is highly satisfied by a yes we can policy."
good,.great place to work if you want to learn all aspects of running a multi million dollar location.  It trains you all the skills you will need to run a large department store.
good,"i worked at kohls as a cashier. is was great, easy, flexible hours. loved all the people i  met there, very great team. very well organized place. always something to do."
good,I was organized and very helpful with their customers. They made sure that their needs were met and the store was pleasing to the eyes.The store's goals were usually met.
good,I worked at Kohl's as a summer job and really enjoyed it. It was pretty slow paced unless we were running a large sale and my coworkers were really friendly.
good,"If you are a college student, and need a full-time job while in school. this isn't such a bad gig. it offers the flexibility needed to attend school, while working full-time."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,This is a fun place to work and there is great teamwork with all associates.  They are looking for new ways to have fun while working.  Only downfall is the compensation.
good,Very nice people that are worried about helping the company thrive. It's a fast paced environment and it keeps you busy so you aren't bored while you are doing your shift.
good,I learned organizing skills and customer service and assisting  others with murchandising. Putting items away. Restocking items. Helping other coworkers in finding items or taking or helping shifts.
good,I enjoyed my time working at Kohl's. The environment is fast paced and there is always something to be done . The hardest part is selling credit but after some time it becomes second nature.
good,Kohls has been a great place to work at and the people are amazing. I just was not making any advancements or being challenged enough to further excel.
good,"Always on your feet and on the move, never run out of things to do. Management is great, really nice staff. Great people always came in, always smiling."
good,"I would walk into this building every morning knowing that I was I working for a great company. I knew that I was going to work hard. I knew that once I opened those doors, the customers were coming. I took pride in taking care of each and every one of those guests."
good,"In the morning it can be very busy, but towards late evening, everything slows down so now there is time to clean up everything. Its easier to get things done."
good,I loved working with everyone there. the management was amazing and very supportive. it was a great work environment and very friendly. everyone was always willing to help
good,"From the short time I work at Kohl's, I love it. I got recognize for my work! A typical work day, is greeting the customers, and ringing up their items. Asking do they have any discounts, and telling them the great offers for the company credit cards. But sometimes it can get busy all at once."
good,"I only worked the season during Christmas and I very much enjoyed my time here. the people were really nice and even the customers. I was paid every week and that was awesome, the work wasn' hard and the managers were not bad either."
good,"Most members of the staff are friendly and help each other, and the customers usually aren't too rude, making it a pleasant place to work. The problem is that the store doesn't receive much money from the corperation to pay its workers, which leads to low hourly pay, few hours per week, and not having enough employees working during a busy shift. The managers understand that almost all of their employees financially need to have another job, thus they are very flexible with the work schedule."
good,The only time you get more than 8 hours a week part time is during the holidays and yes I mean 8 hours a week or less to many employees and not enough hours to go around but I love my job there great friendly staff
good,"On a typical day, associates will clock in and report to their assigned section and begin either putting clothes and merchandise back, checking out customers, or restocking the floor from the back.  I learned better time management skills because the store was always busy.  The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up and provide the best possible experience to the customers.  The most enjoyable part was providing and helping customers find exactly what they want and more with the benefit of great deals.  Management was great, always a call away whenever you need help."
good,"Great company to start in, timely raises and they offer alot of benificial things to their employees if you work hard you like wont have problems. You have 5 minute graxe periods to get back to your station. All around great work environment."
good,"Kohls is a great company to work for. However, peak season is extremely stressful. If you can get thru that, the rest of the year is a great environment to be working in."
good,"Typical work day was to arrive at 4:30 AM, have a morning meeting about our goals and then begin our assignments. It was fast paced, and the supervisors were professional and respectful. The general attitude of the culture was positive and motivating. Hardest part of the job would probably be the physical aspect, as you were working 12 hour shifts on your feet all day. I actually enjoyed this though as I saw it as a way to exercise while working."
good,You have to catch the customer if they are falling.The handbook says you are not to touch the customer at all. This needs to be amended to protect the LP's job and the customer's safety.
good,This job helped me to be more independent.  It showed me that I can solve problems on my own and showed me that people aren't as bad as they are in food industry.
good,A typical day I would go work at the registers and do that over everytime I would go in or for break. I learned to be patient with people to be positive
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,The management is a little crazy but they're all trying their hardest after all the jobs are different every single day. The job itself is fun and sometimes stressful because of customers mad that you have no control over store policy
good,"Kohls was a great place for the most part.  It was random crazy hours all over the place but it was a great environment. I had the best teacher for merchandising and was able to apply those skills when i left for a store manager position.  Moving up at kohls is the challenge though, as higher paying positions do not get a lot of movement.  Kohls is a secure place for the current retail environment as they are not in debt to properties upon open.  Their smart business practices and YES WE CAN policy make them a retailer people like to return to over and over and know they wont catch grief for any exchange or refund or return.  They have great sales.  And customers are loyal."
good,I worked 3rd shift. Unloading trucks and stocking. It was fun. Great work environment. Coworkers were nice and helpful. Management was nice. Plus great benefits.
good,I worked at Kohl's store. I worked part time over night shift. I learned a lot things on there.  I would say management was good. workplace culture was mix. I hadn't any hardest job. what i learned that was the most of enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Co-workers were friendly, something i didn't like was that they never had enough people scheduled to work the sales floor. But overall my work experience there was enjoyable."
good,"I liked it there, and now its going down there is not croweded any more. Kohls is great to shop and work, and now if u have to work its not good to work because the manger is not great."
good,"I applied for the job for a seasonal position. The management was great and explained everything so that i understood and felt i could do my job with little to no help. The staff was welcoming and hard working. i learned to do cashier duties, stack shelves, unload trucks, take and put up product in fashionable manner and how to work and help with customers in a helpful and professional manner. I worked hard and was asked to stay on as a full time employee, which made me feel as my work was recognized."
good,"My experience working here was great, I started with this company, it was great i meet some amazing people and had a great opportunity to move up with in the company. at the end of my career there i choose to walk away because i started to experience a shift from a leader that was not leading to the company's expectations. overall Kohl's is a great company to work for i would still recommend it a place to work."
good,Working part-time sales for Kohl's was a great opportunity while I was a senior in High School. The job taught me values that I would not otherwise have gained at that time in my life.
good,"could pay better for the long hours, night shift you get shift differential pay, I learned about replishing the shelves, picking orders, and packing, it was a lot of people working during the seasonal period that I worked, so you had to be mindful of others, and know how to be flexible in working in other sections or departments"
good,"A typical work day would include counting down a draw ,and preparing your self for the work day. Everyday I would learn a new to sell to people and how to approach everyone in a different way. Nice managers , job was not hard at all , free food ,best discounts ever."
good,"Great place, coworkers always giving a helping hand, get to interact with lots of people, give people a great shopping experience, managers were willing to help in any way possible"
good,Great place to work. Great people. Advancement opportunities. Friendly associates. Great products. Always something to do. I have enjoyed my work experience here.
good,"I learned many skills while at this job. I learned organizational skills, time management, and communication. It is a very fun and productive place to work. There is never a dull moment because there is always something to do."
good,Kohl's is a good company to work for and is good for a summer job. The managers care about their employees and provide a good environment to work in. The hours were not the greatest but it was still a good job overall.
good,This was a seasonal position for me. I was a cashier here and this was a great place to work to earn a little extra Christmas money. Thank you Kohl's.
good,I worked the holidays full time and I tried to get 16-20 hours with school in the spring. My location is pretty overstaffed and they couldn't give me full 8 hour shifts. Overall the best company I've worked for. They are very kind and customers are awesome.
good,I was constantly busy even when I didn't have a customer.  My co workers were fabulous.  I never dreaded going to work. I had a good rapport with mangement as well.
good,"My 12+ year's with the Kohl's Corporation has been great!! They have strive to better their Benefits for the employee's and making great strides on Training. I've had the opportunity to advance and hone my skill's with this company.  There is a fair opportunity for advancement in small stores because of the turnover of associates. 87 k+ stores Management have a tendency to become complacent in the interactions with their associates. "
good,"I like working at kohl's, but the pay does not add up to the amount of work we do. we go above and beyond for our customers and the company and i feel we should be paid more than minimum wage."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,This Kohl's Department Store is operated by a caring staff and management team. They place value on not only customer experience but also the employees and their families.
good,"Overall, it is a good company to work for. I do enjoy my job and my co workers. I just wish I could go full time, but that is not possible since there is a set number of how many full time employees they can have at each location."
good,"i was seasonal and it was so much busy in the store, i was well treated by the manager and all the team, We were like a family and help each other to satisfy the customer.It was a great experience than i enjoyed !"
good,"Kohls is an alright place to work at. Especially if you are part time. They do have levels of management training. I enjoyed providing excellent customer service, but did not like leaving at 2am after a one day sale. The work environment is very diverse. There exists very high pressure and stress related to constantly harassing customers to obtain the Kohls credit card."
good,"Kohl's was always a fun environment to work in. Always enjoyed the people I worked with and the customers I could help. Some downsides was getting hours cut after the holidays, but hey that's a business for you."
good,I worked mainly in fitting rooms and on the sales floor helping customers and completing floor recovery. I would help at customer service and on registers to help get the lines down. Management was great when I started but after being there awhile you could tell who cared about their job and who didn't take it seriously. It was a fun place to work and my coworkers were great. We had meetings every night before closing the store to talk about our sales goals for the day and what was going on in the store for the upcoming days. I would say the hardest part of my job aside from keeping the fitting rooms emptied and being understaffed on busy days would be that if we needed time of for family or emergencies it sometimes felt like it was held against you by management. I did enjoy the atmosphere and helping customers.
good,"As a Loss Prevention Officer for Kohl's, my day consists of continuous observation of the store for any suspicious activities such as shoplifting and return fraud. The main goal of our company is to capture shoplifters and decrease shrinkage in Kohl's through internal and external investigation. Also, it is my responsibility to ensure that employees and customers are in a safe environment."
good,They're usually pretty disorganized. The management for the most part is nice. They have a break room with a popcorn machine.They will sometimes put out food for the employees on holidays.
good,"Job overall was easy. we greeted customers, rang customers, answered questions and recovered clothing. There was a lot of folding and standing but it was a great job. You get to meet new people everyday and you get to see returning customers."
good,It was a good experience to work at Khol's. Everyone was very kind and welcoming at Khol's. However I did not receive enough hours.
good,"Kohl's is always striving for the best in their employees and for the most part that requirement is fulfilled. Working at Kohl's, you'll learn every department and part of the company that you are interested in, as long as you let your manager know."
good,Kohl's has a great family friendly work environment. Associates are very enthusiastic and happy to help anyone in need of assistance. The departments are well kept!
good,When it comes to working hard and efficient the store manager and other managers get the job done. The only downfall to it is that a lot of employees started to walk around when they were on the registers or try to distract other workers.
good,"I gained a lot of useful skills from Kohl's that can be useful in other jobs, such as leadership skills and communication skills. Management is understanding, everyone was extremely friendly, and supportive. Each person had a role, and we all worked together as a team to reach our common goals. Fun workplace, and there was never a dull moment. I'd definitely recommend this employer to students, or someone seeking additional part-time hours."
good,Very fast paced enviornment.Learned how to take on a leadership role. Great employees made work enjoyable.  management gave clear expectations in what they expected from thier employees.
good,"Fun, positive, safe working environment. Very good management. Excellent opportunities to advance in your career or into management. Has a very nice break room."
good,"I enjoyed working in the Home and Kid's Department for Kohl's as well as register and customer service on occasion. I was treated very well and believe that Kohl's is a wonderful, honest company."
good,"I was always very friendly, and I loved the other people that I worked with! The management was always really good and understanding about everything."
good,"Kohl's is a good place to work. Although understaffed at times, the workload is reasonable and the work itself is not difficult. Management makes sure that every employee gets their break during the day and on occasion, they will order in food for the employees."
good,"I honed my customer service skills, developed strong leadership skills and time management skills. The most enjoyable part of the job was that the daily agenda always kept me on my toes. I learned something new almost every single day."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"My job title was sales associate. Duties are to smile and say hi, greet all customers, go above and beyond expectations for customers.I thought it was really friendly. Who I worked with made me really love the customer service and the customer interaction. Primary job duties of Kohl’s sales associates consist of working sales floors, answering questions about services and merchandise, and ensuring customer satisfaction. Additional job responsibilities may include stocking shelves and organizing displays."
good,"flexible to schedule, family friendly, great benefits to employee in form of discounts.  managers understanding and employees supportive of one another."
good,I worked at Kohl's for 5 years. I felt close to my store team. I was a supervisor for the misses/ juniors departments. I learned a lot about merchandising and the visual aspects of retail. Sometimes I felt like there was not enough time in the day to get everything done. I was required to work overnight shifts probably every 2-3 months which I was not fond of.
good,Fast pace environment but help was always available. Management took control of any problem right away without delay. Interacting with the customers was my favorite part of the job.
good,Fun. Sometimes stressful around holidays. Fast paced. Recognize birthdays and event. No black out days but keep in mind everyone work black Friday and the holidays.
good,"For the most part, Kohls is a great place to work. Employess are nice, and managers are understanding. Almost every body is willing to help. and Hours are flexible"
good,Work hard work  fast gain as much knowledge in all areas as you can.....learn to keep a pace and stay focused. It will determine whether you work as a seasonal.....or if they hire and keep you on as a full-time /part-time flex associate
good,My years as a Loss Prevention Agent were some of the most exciting years of my life. I loved watching CCTV and looking for dishonest customers and employees. I felt like I was doing to help keep the costs of good down and the honest shoppers safe. Everyday was different and challenging in terms what needed to be investigated and researched.
good,It was fun and relatively easy. I mainly just help customers at the service desk. My managers were very understanding and easy-going.
good,Everyone is helpful in teaching you the ropes. The hours are pretty good and their system is a little messy but overall works. Very easy going environment.
good,Loved working at kohls I started at customer services and went to being a supervisor for a dept I loved helping people co-workers was great management well its 50 50
good,Short shifts (4hours) made the hour drive there not worth it. Pay wasn't great and scheduling was not ideal. Unless you supervise not a great place to work
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work but don't offer full time sadly. They will give you many options to work in different department throughout the store. I loved my co workers, loved the management team, and loved the environment Kohls created. Even most of the music they played was pretty descent. The merchandise they sale is unique and low priced."
good,I worked here when I was 19 and really enjoyed it.  It was a newer store and very well kept.  I was responsible for houseware area and learned a lot about kitchenade mixers/
good,Overall a great company to work for.  Growth opportunities were limited.  Great opportunities to participate in charitable activities and events.  I enjoyed working with the various team members.  Some of the long-term leadership were stuck in their ways and not receptive to new ideas.
good,Working at kohls is a great experience if you are properly staffed. It is very easy for employees to call out and leave you high and dry. There have been many nights where I was the only person to close the entire front of the store.
good,Checking out happy customers. How to use a register and higher communication skills. Very high management and very enthusiastic co-workers. Dealing with unhappy customers. Having a laugh with customers and co-workers
good,"Direct my associates under me their jobs for the shift. Double check schedule and change request, update inventory and incoming shipments. Once on the floor tend to the department and order of display and guest who may need assistance."
good,"Kohls offers a vortex schedule which allows associates to plan their work week around their lives. This is a great way to still be able to attend school, have another job, spend time with family, etc."
good,Satisfying with overall working with co-workers and managers. Excellent management and caring people. A typical day at work is just like every other day at work. You have a goal to accomplish and our goals have been met with the requirement %. You learn a lot from others and its great learning new things from other people. It helps you gain strength and knowledge about the environment.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,It was a great work place co-worker very friendly and a nice environment to work in and be surrounded by good people and nice work place
good,Growing company with wonderful culture and values . Kohl's Corporate has some of the most wonderful management systems who care & understand and treat their employees with respect & honor .
good,Positive and professional corporate environment with excellent management and employee supervisors.  Excellent work experience.
good,"Managements friendly, they make you feel like family. Never a dull moment at kohls, and the rewards were endless for employees. Recognition is a big thing at Kohls and they know how to give it."
good,"Friendly co-workers. New management so I really can't say much about it, but before everyone was easy going and very helpful and will recognize even the small thing that you do. Hardest part of the job was always saying ""YES WE CAN"" since it's the policy of the company, even if literally it's an obvious NO. Most enjoyable was working with people that are really willing to work hard to move up."
good,very good learning experience job. brings you out of a shy shell. good to work with people on a personal level. helps with customer service skills and patience
good,"Kohl's does a nice job valuing their employee's. Their flexibility with your work/life balance is the best I have been around. Overall this is a great company with really nice benefits. "
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company, they offer great discounts and have the best clothes."
good,"While the daily work was hectic due to understaffing, I had great coworkers and great supervisors.  This made handling the intense work load a lot easier because there were always people who had you back and did what they could to help you out and make sure everything was running well."
good,I liked working for kohls I felt like there since it being a department store I was able to dress like myself. I would work in the clothing sections of the store I would organize with the rest of the workers how closing the department would work best who would organize the floor and who would be responsible to maintain fitting room and returns. Management was nice and flexible to shift switches along with requesting days off. The hardest thing about the job was dealing with dirty/smelly clothes due to personal hygiene of an individual. I enjoyed interacting with customers on a daily basis.
good,When i worked there i felt welcome.they gave me plenty of hour's they give u opportunity to grow to another level.Khol's a grate job to have they got great benefit
good,Great Place to Work!!!  What I've learned the most from Kohls is the ability to multi-task among multiple projects. The ability to complete them all with an extreme sense of urgency as well as within corporate deadlines.
good,This is a Company that is good to work for when you are just starting a career. It helped me learn customer relation skills and a work enviorment to use in future job opportunities.
good,"A typical day at work is checking out customers, asking for credit and providing customer service. I really like this job, but it's really far from my house, but they're super flexible with your schedule so working here as a college student has been very nice. It's a chill job."
good,"My days at Kohl's were always fun because I never knew what i was going into work for. I was originally hired for Point of Sale in which i cashiered and then i solicited credit. after a couple of months I began working at Customer Service and on the floor. By the end of my employment, I worked mainly customer service. I directed and answered phone calls, I took in returned items, and closed the registers. My co-workers were great people, always helpful and thoughtful people. the hardest part of my job was coming to start my day and not knowing what i was going to do for the night, whether it be cashiering or at customer service or on the floor folding clothes yet it was a thrill because I am always up for a challenge. the most enjoyable part of my job was the accomplishment of closing customer service, the registers and having customer service clean and organized every night."
good,"All employees and managers are kind and friendly, will allow you to work a flexible schedule, give decent benefits as well"
good,"Part time shifts only, great job with benefits. great management team. you choose your availability, employee discounts."
good,Customer service and genuine friendliness can go a long way. Supply and demand is the name of the game. The schedule was fairly flexible because it was made simple when i had school and needed to make hours.
good,Typical day is picking up the areas I am assigned to. Hardest part is keeping up with the areas when it is very busy. The co-workers are wonderful.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"This company is nice to work for. Would be a nice first job for anyone,  you do have to be 17 to work here though. The management teams are nice to their employees,  they will also work with their people in many ways. Definitely a nice team feel in the workplace as well."
good,"I would come in and the manager would tell me which section I would be going to work in that day and I always came in early for a little extra time but when it was time to clock in I did and my day would begin I would start fixing and folding clothes until the manager would ask me to get on the cash register and I would go back and fourth til it was time for me to clock out. I learned how to somewhat work in a fast environment and I also learned how some of the other employees secrets on how they persuaded the customers to buy Khol's credit cards. Management was really tough especially on ""newby's"" but I guess in a fast paced environment you have to be. The co-workers were always different people so one day you would meet a new friend and the next you'd meet someone different not really bad but it made it hard to have a co-worker who understood like another newby, I was always with more experienced co-workers. The hardest part would be selling the Khol's credit because the only people who came in were the same ones that already had one and when you did find someone who didn't have one they weren't necessarily qualified for one but the most enjoyable part was meeting new people and seeing new faces even though they were shopping in the store way longer than you were working there."
good,"The manegement is always willing to help answer any questions you have about your job and are always striving to make it a happy working environment. The hardest part of the job is discrepancies with prices, but that is easily fixable. The bests part of the job is having such a dedicated team and set of managers."
good,Great Boss. Loved the store. The atmosphere was great to work there. I was too old to stand on my feet over 4 hours. Enjoyed the people. Wasn't my cup of tea.
good,"My typical day at work is to meet with the floor manager and receive instructions as to what you will be doing that day. If I have any concerns or questions during the day they are readily available to answer them. I have learned how to help customers in any questions they have. I have become efficient in the job once I learned exactly what they expected me of. As I have said before, the management is extremely helpful should anything happen. They will assist you is you ask it of them or find a way to help you another way. My co-workers are professional as well. They inform us when they need help, when we need to pick up clothes, or when they need to take a break.The hardest part of this job is when the holiday season comes around and employees work both harder and more excessively. Though challenges like these create stress for the employees, they keep a good attitude through it all. The most enjoyable part of this job is the benefits with both the associate coupons and the rewards for good work."
good,"The work was simple enough, and there was plenty of variation to it. I almost always worked the register, and I learned a great deal about the retail system, especially in the field of coupons. The management was nice and very friendly. The only issue I had with my coworkers was that some of them would leave to do other tasks in the store (like folding clothes and taking back recovery) multiple times during their shifts, leaving me alone at the register."
good,"Greatest group of individuals i had the privilege of working with on night shift."
good,Everyone that worked here were mainly friendly. If you are a seasonal employee then the managers don't really speak to you much. Lunch breaks are fair and there is a lot of standing up if you are a cashier. Was given the option to stay and work as a part time employee but declined for other endeavors.
good,"A normal day would just consist of coming in, making sure all of the merchandise was stocked correctly and ringing people at the register."
good,Kohl's is pretty flexible and understanding with your schedule so as a student it is convenient for me. I also had great help from everyone who trained me.
good,"To begin a typical day at work was never a typical day at work if that makes any sense. Everyday brought it's own rewarding challenges and adventures. The days are usually busy but always a blast. I would have to say the most important thing I've learned working at Kohl's is to always expect the unexpected, because you could literally have to deal with some of the nicest or meanest guest you could imagine. The management team was made up of world class professionals I really enjoyed not only the pleasant environment they continually fostered, but I also enjoyed soaking up all the life and retail knowledge they had to share. The associate team was great as well they really try to help make sure you transition smoothly into a knowledgeable associate in no time. The hardest part of the job would probably be black Friday it was absolutely an experience I will never forget in a good way. The most enjoyable part of the job was every single day that I was able to work there."
good,I would greet customers and check-out customers. I also did a lot of multi-tasking. I learned a lot of every department in the store. Mangers were very nice and made work place easy. Co-workers were fun to be around. Hardest part of the job was customers stealing. Most enjoyable part was working in a fast pace environment.
good,"The Kohls corporation seems to set a high standard for the treatment of its staff as well as its customers. This makes it a very pleasant place to work. Coworkers on all levels treat each other with respect, as the company would tolerate nothing less. Coworkers are not competitive against each other and work as a team.They are also more than cooperative when schedule changes are needed. As with many retail positions though pay is limited and it can take over a year to get a raise. There is potential for advancement but higher positions in the company require longer and not always desirable hours. All employees must work a minimum number of weekend hours."
good,"this wasn't my first job, but it had the function of first time job seekers, its quiet easy to get an interview here, and the flow of it also very easy to get the hang of it. For a cashier position, you have to be able to learn fast and to work fast, since people just want to buy their stuff and leave, and the lines can get long fast. You also have to be comfortable to solicit credit, which at first its awkward and uncomfortable, but usually the customers are nice and comfortable to talk and ask. Managers there are always listening on how things aren't working out, if there's any problems or if you need help on sales. Very open minded."
good,"I worked in the freight department, which involved unloading the trucks that brought merchandise and sorting it to which items go to the sales floor and which items go to the stock rooms. My favorite part of the jobs were the managers. They are really friendly and if you have any problems, they are easy to approach and will help you."
good,"Flexible hours and good management, if you're looking for a job where you will always have something to do, this is a good fit for you."
good,I can't say anything bad about the place. It was honestly a great job and everyone I worked with was extremely helpful and patient which allowed me to excel at the job.
good,"Great Company! Cool Enviroment ! I would reccommend this job to anyone that has a flexible lifestyle. A typical day is helping customers making paymnets, asssit with setting up online accounts as well as help explaining statements."
good,"assist new cashiers, process returns, damages to remove from inventory, price changes to inventory, unload trucks, greet return customers, with Great customer service experience.  The Company stands behind your decision and wanting customers to have great customer experience."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"This was the first job I had when I moved to South Carolina and was close to the apartment I had at the time. While the pay wasn't anything to rave about, the co-workers and job its self were. They were very flexible with my ability to work, I can't work at night due to night-blindness. They were also very good at letting you make managerial decisions without a manager and if it backfired they didn't make you feel bad about it."
good,Overral Kohl's is a good job.The team it consists is wonderful.The only disadvantage is the fact they dont have full time positions so its a struggle to get the hours sometimes
good,"Kohl's was an engaging and challenging place to work. In the last couple of years, the company put an earnest effort into improving morale, offering different incentives and benefits and listening to employees. Customers could be very challenging and payroll constraints could make daily workload and priorities unmanageable."
good,"While hired on as a temporary employee, I find the workplace environment very fulfilling. Kohl's takes care of their employees, and constantly rewards workers for their hard work through extra pay incentives and occasional hand outs when leaving (goody bags filled with candy and snacks). An added and unexpected bonus is the paid breaks. I have not only made good friends, but have gained experiences here that will carry on. My only wish is that this job could be permanent."
good,"An ideal day: clocking in, taking items into the lockers such as phones purse (locks for the lockers are provided by kohls) and grabbing a radio. You will check the schedule for today on where you will be located and meet with a manager and start your work. They will tell you anything you will need to know but usually you already know what your day will consist of."
good,"Greet customers and process customers’ purchases accurately and efficiently at the point-of-sale.  Maintain a neat, clean and organized register area.  Provide excellent customer service skills as well as the ability to work as part of a team and interact effectively with others."
good,Kohls Warehouse makes sure your comfortable on and off the floor. HR will take any problem and handle it as soon as possible.
good,I could not have asked for a better District Manager. He constantly pushes us and strives for greatness. He always believes in us and I have learned problem solving skills from him.
good,"I worked 3rd shift doing AdSet and unloading the truck. I loved working here because there was always something to do. Between setting sales signs to unloading trucks to merchandising inventory, you keep busy. My coworkers and I always had a lot of fun together while getting our work done!"
good,"The work atmosphere was friendly, with only minor drama among the employees."
good,I have worked at several locations and transferred each time and continue to enjoy working for the company.  I only wish they had more full time opportunities.
good,Great place to work if u enjoy working with customers on a regular basis. There always something to do so u will always be busy.
good,very fast paced job very friendly. easy advancement with decent pay scale for management. easy to come to work happy and leave happy
good,Nice place to work. Great place to utilize and learn customer service skills. Co workers were always friendly and willing to help.
good,"Better  Workplace with Supportive management."
good,"I was a cashier, the job wasnt complicated it was just memorization of deals for the week or day. calm environement friendly staff."
good,"flexible schedule"
good,it is a fun work environment.  Flexible hours.  Not high pay but not a lot of schooling needed. Great culture.  Everyone works well together and cares for each other.
good,"Great advancement opportunities, they are extremely flexible with a school schedule. Friendly staff and management. I have learned how to become more persuasive in selling a kohls charge card, how to find ways to make a customer happy. I enjoy helping them out and seeing a smile on their face."
good,I love the culture at Kohl's but I'm not getting enough hours. Everyone is friendly and nice which is a bonus. There is tons of running around that I do constantly so I'm always on my feet.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Great workplace with amazing bosses as well as amazing co-workers. Loved coming in to work that day. You were always welcomed with open arms no matter if you've worked there a week or a decade.
good,"It's a good place to work if it's not your main job.  I like the people I work with.  The scheduling is good about getting days off that you need as long as you give a two week notice and it's not holidays or Black Friday.  I work overnight and some of the work can be very tiring and make your body ache.  They will not tell you at the interview that some weeks you will only get one day a week. It's great for an extra job, not for the job to pay all the bills.  It starts out around min wage, maybe .50 more. I have been there 9 years and my pay has only increased by 2.50/hr. They will only give 26 hours max."
good,"I started working for Kohl's when they first opened and enjoyed working at Kohl's, but did not get many hours to stay employed."
good,"Always something to do. Never a dull moment. Everyone tries their best, to get work done on time and efficiently. Hardest part of the job is being able to keep up with the work load since there is nothing much constant work that makes it difficult, you learn to be quick on your feet and constantly supportive."
good,"Kohl's is a fast paced, customer driven company.  This sometimes put the employees in the vice of ""the customer comes first, but now I can't get the rest of my job done"". "
good,"The people I work with our great . Kohl is a great place to work at , if your looking to find something to keep a little change in your pocket. Its not very good if you need to pay bills , unless you're in higher power."
good,I have learned about customer service and the importance of dependability.  There is truly a family feeling working at Kohl's.  We rely heavily on each other to create a pleasant shopping experience  for our customers.
good,"I began m job with Kohl's as a part-time opportunity for supplemental income.  After some unforeseeable circumstances in my full-time employment Kohl's became my only job for close to two years."
good,"My favorite part of working at Kohl's is working with our customers--helping them to find the right product for their needs, helping them to find the best deals possible, doing all I can to make their shopping experience a positive one."
good,"Demanding place to work as some nights could get very messy, requiring a lot of picking up, hanging, and folding. Managers tended to ask for more than was possible, but were always very supportive and easy to talk to. Coworkers enjoyed each other's company, making the work day move more quickly. Customers also tended to be nice and thankful for any assistance."
good,A very fast paced environment. Always prepared to work in multiple positions. Friendly staff and management is very easy to get along with
good,lots of things that kept the job busy during the day. Customers very nice and enjoyable to communicate to about where to find merchandise.
good,"A typical day at work would be cleaning up the department from the night before if not already done. Making sure that the customers that come in to the department are spoken to and helped to their standers. "
good,"A typical work day included supervising the front registers, writing daily break schedules ensuring coverage for the point of sale, jewelry dept. and customer service,providing breaks and lunches for associates in said areas, getting change for registers as needed, stocking all register areas with needed supplies, opening or counting down registers at close, providing customer service in any and all departments in the store greeting every customer while on the sales floor. Taking care of voided transactions, trouble shooting any malfunctioning register, calling for register service if not able to remedy. Assisting in the stockroom with  back stock and fillling the sales floor as needed during any slow time."
good,it was a cool little job to work at. the job that i had didn't fit me. the managers did not communicate well enough to the workers.
good,"Kohl's is a fast-paced fun place to work.  Everyone involved from employees to managers has a common goal and that is the successs of Kohl's as a company. Management is very tuned in to you personally as an employee.   It's a very positive environment.  Everyone reaches out to help any other employee in need.  It is a great place to work.  The people you encounter, whether its the employees or managers, are positive minded and goal oriented. I guess the toughest part of the job is satisfying all customers and still staying within the company policies.  It can be challenging but it's never an issue.  You always have the support of management. It is so gratifying to me when we sell a customer something she/he has been wanting or needing or a while but for whatever reason wouldn't ""pull the trigger"", or has been wanting to set up credit but for various reasons hasn't had the opportunity, but then finally does and to see the happiness and satisfaction on their faces and to know you had  part in making that happen is very satisfying and remarkable to me."
good,Management is never to busy to help an employee or a customer. Plenty of teamwork amongst co-workers. All permanent workers willing to help the seasonal employees.
good,"I liked working at Kohl's, the people are very nice to work with but the management isn't very good. They care more about making goals than their actually employees who are trying their hardest."
good,"For the most part, I've really enjoyed working for Kohl's. Management is very flexible with schedules, especially for students. Co-workers are very outgoing and friendly, and we've all made it a point to work as team to accomplish tasks.There is a fulfillment in knowing you are doing a good job in your work, and Kohl's really highlights that."
good,"The ability to work with a variety of individuals. Managing budgets, calendaring conflicts, travel (domestic and inernational).  Plan vendor meetings and social events"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Worked with very nice people who were willing to help other employees out (mostly) and if you are with good managers, can be a great place to work."
good,Worked here when I was in college. Great place to work and loved the environment in which I worked. I would recommend for most college students to work here
good,"Clock in, meet with lead cashier and then I was register trained, would ring up and greet customers, take payment. Would stock and organize iteams"
good,"This was the first job I had after high school, and I never pictured I would be here still 6 years later. I have become an adult while working at this job. The co workers that have been there since I started are more like family. It is definitely a fast paced work environment with daily challenges, but I have learned a lot there!"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of clocking in and looking to see what side I was on, whether it was the women's or the men's side. I would then go to the front and sign into the register and start helping customers in the check out. If there was ever a moment where I had no customers waiting in line, I would go over and fold cloths, making sure the store always maintained a clean and neat appearance. When it was time for me to take my break I would walk back to customer service with all the clothes that customers did not want and sort them in the right boxes so they could be put back in the right department of the store later. The co-workers would help a lot and they were very friendly."
good,"What I liked the most about working at Kohl's was how each day would vary. I was trained in all areas of the store, and enjoyed being able to experience new projects every shift. I worked mainly at the Customer Service counter, but also picked up shifts working the early-morning truck, inventory, price changes, home/kids/shoes department, and special projects dealing with visual sets."
good,They will always think of their customers. Great customer service! I was given great training and welcomed by all team members.
good,"I was able to work overtime during the days I was scheduled to work. Kleinfelder gave me hands on experience with their work equipment and driving me to work sites, to give me knowledge and valuable information about how the company works."
good,"With my time working at Kohl's, I have learned a lot of terminology and retail culture. Although retail may appear like an easy job, it is actually extremely fast paced and tiring. However, retail is also incredibly awarding. I worked with a variety of coworkers, some who have been with the company for years and people who were brand new to the company. The hardest part was trying to make the store look as though nothing had been moved, considering we were usually understaffed but were insanely busy on a daily basis. But to make up for it, I was able to help customers with anything they needed and was always able to see that they appreciated my assistance."
good,"busy retail store"
good,Everyday I stocked shelves and made everything organize. I learned about having manners with great customer service with employees plus customers. Management was better than ever before when it came to the shift bosses
good,"Organize all the staff in this Department, replacement helping  the costumers, offering great customer  service and selling a credits to the customers."
good,I've never had an issues with working at this company. I loved all the managers to all the other employees. Great place to work!
good,"i loved the job and the people i worked with. Everyone got along, it was the best team job i have ever had! I learned how to drive a forklift and i got really good at it when i did not think i would. The hardest part of this job was actually getting my numbers and waking up at 5. All in all i loved this job the people made it so much fun."
good,"Fast pace, time went by quickly.  You had to meet a certain quota per day which I did but thought to myself as I age I would not be able to keep up. I sprained my knee and was unable to work for a couple of weeks.  They let me go."
good,"Worked in shoe department, therefore job duties simply consisted of maintaining a clean area, answering phone calls regarding shoes in stock, etc."
good,"In this company almost always my area of work was the ladies and young, a normal workday was to organize clothes on tables in the racks and also change the area to existing seasons, in most occasions also we had to keep clothing organized testers."
good,"It's a good place to work in a retail place setting.  They cut hours and the benefits aren't anything special these days but it's better than nothing at all. Management is great to work with, they're very supportive and helpful. We have many great co-workers (part timers mostly)."
good,"when i get to work,i clock in,i make an announcement that my shift just started,ask my manager my tasks for the day,make sure the sales floor is organised."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Kohls wasn't a bad place to work. Enjoyed the people and learned a lot about retail. Moved up in the company. Liked being an asset to the Company.
good,"Kohl's is not that bad of a place to work at. I've been trained in multiple things, cashier, merchandising, doing the trucks early in the morning, floors associate, the only thing that sucks is the hours, since now you can't go over 26.5 hours a week if your part time. other than that its great."
good,management can be a pain but they will work with your schedule and give u a good amount of hours.great coworkers to work with.
good,Working in the receiving department was fun for me. I came to know about new merchandise and fashion before any one else around me and that feels like ahead of the game. I was very well supported by me team members and management. The only hard part for me at this job was getting up so early as i had to go to work at 4 am. The only reason i am looking for new job is that i was hired at Kohls for seasonal positions and now they do not have any openings.
good,"Average retail job, does go above and beyond to take care of associates and with hard work it is easy to get promoted within the company."
good,"Its a good summer job, you will always have something to do, I only worked the afternoon and early mornings which both have their pros and cons. The mornings you have to unload merchandise from trucks, the afternoons is mostly cleaning and organizing the store. The management is friendly as well as the co-workers, the hardest part of the job is sometimes dealing with unruly customers however the most enjoyable part is unloading trucks. The job is excellent for those seeking work experience."
good,I liked my job at Kohl's. The managers and people I worked with were great to be around! I just felt like I couldn't move up there any further and I needed a change of pace.
good,"•	Handled cash, credit, gift cards"
good,"Love most of the people I work with, fun environment."
good,Everyone was nice and helpful. I liked this job but it really wasnt for me
good,"I was hired as a seasonal worker, and I enjoyed working at Kohls. But unfortunately I was laid-off due to business decisions. I was only needed for the holiday season."
good,I really enjoyed working here. The people was great. I learned a ton. It was overall a good atmosphere management was great. My only issue was the distance.
good,"•	Assists customers in locating merchandise and answering a variety of questions concerning general merchandise; demonstrates use of merchandise upon request."
good,In a typical day you will encounter a wide variety of customers and fellow associates. There is always something new to learn and always something new coming from this corporation. The coworkers are always willing to help coach and teach for others to grow.
good,At kohl's I met new people everyday. I assisted customers and I made sure my work environment was safe and productive. Management was great and helpful.
good,Would get store ready for the days work and made sure orders were being completed. Great work environment
good,"I worked one on one with clients and created and proofread and assembled programs for weddings, funerals, Parties, Businesses, & special occasions. It was a fast paced business. I scheduled times to meet with families needing our special services providing excellent quality customer services for happy and bereaved families."
good,"I learn how to multitask "
good,"customer service, training and human resources, management didn't develop employees, co-workers are great, getting advancement. Helping people."
good,I think its a great company to work for as a student or if you just want a part time job.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Every day is different with new and exciting challenges. The company is still growing and looking to become top-dog of all other retailers. You get to constantly grow your skills, as well as obtain new ones. This is the kind of work environment where you can achieve and succeed if you push yourself individually. To work here, you must have the goal of wanting to better yourself everyday and be hungry to learn and adapt to the ever changing surroundings. I have moved up fast within 3 and 1/2 years, and it is because I have improved myself individually."
good,very fun job to have i loved working here every employee and manager were very nice
good,Great staff and an overall fun place to work. Very customer service focused.  The wide array of hours and late nights can be difficult to embrace.
good,"The place is beautifully kept, and its great place to work and you will meet all types of people to work with. A great learning experience in terms of meeting people and customer service. The hardest part of the job, keeping things in place in the backroom.. that's the worst kept place.. and the most enjoyable part is keeping the things where they belonged.. and ringing the customers was the fun part. You will meet lots of motivating people, appreciate the work and help for the holiday season.. The management is good, always responds to the queries and adjusts to your schedule."
good,Enjoy assisting customers with order placement. Constant training enables me to be prepared for any situation that may arise with customers.
good,"Normally when I go to work, I clean up whatever department I am in, restock the shelves, help customers, and help the people check out. I have learned how to merchandise. The management is pretty good at Khol's, they are fair and kind. My co-workers were fun to work with, but also very hardworking (most of them). The hardest part of working at Khol's, to me, was my constantly changing schedule. I need something stable. The most fun part of the job was my co-workers."
good,"A typical day at work would be to empty out rails of recover followed by emptying out fitting rooms and zoning (organizing rails on the floor and fold tables.) Always be ready to be called up to the register and to stop what you are doing to help a customer."
good,"Giving EXCELLENT customer service."
good,"Kohl's is an excellent place to work, while going to school and they work with you on your scheduling for your class schedule. Awesome place to work and I learned immensely about customer relations."
good,As much work as they have you doing (which is a lot) they dont offer very much.
good,"Working for Kohl's was a great experience. It's a company that gives its associates the power to make and enforce decisions for themselves in order to bring the best possible experience to the customer. Having worked with the company in their Customer Service department I had the opportunity to help many customers and problem-solve any possible concerns they had or with their time in the store."
good,great place to work .great co-workers and good discount. flexible work hrs
good,it was a good and friend place. i ran a register and bagged cumstomer ideas.
good,The workers at Kohls are very friendly and helpful.  If I ever need help my co-workers were always willing.  This is a very fun atmosphere but professional as well.
good,"A typical day, depending on where in scheduled, lets say in jewelry. If I open I get a walkie and my keys open the counters and count the jewelry in the cases and enter the numbers into our R.F. unit. Once those are excepted by a manager I see if there is any freight to work from our truck and if there isn't we have a communications book to let us know what we need to do for the day, other then helping the customers that may stop to look at something. You learn a lot during the day about all the new products we get in and how to set things up to appeal to the customers. Our managers are around for us if we need anything and coworkers are willing to go out of there way a well. The hardest part for us is making sure the customers know we are around for them because we get busy or have multiple things to manage during the day. The best part for me is knowing a simple helping hand to someone can change their day. If we don't have something in the store they need we go out of our way by helping them order it online and letting them know it's free shipping as well. It does make a difference for the customers and associates to help however we can!"
good,A typical day at work entails never knowing what new challenges the day will bring.  It can be very fast paced but never boring.  The best part about working here is interacting with a great team.  Management and co-workers are always encouraging and supportive. Team work is always a plus. Working at a place like this really helped me develop better social skills and it's really fun getting to meet so many wonderful people.
good,"Early morning supervision for setting up the ads."
good,Fast paced upbeat work environment with focus on the customer.  Pleasant working environment where everyone cooperates and the managers are friendly and respectful to employees.  Customers are generally pleasant and appreciative of my efforts to serve them.  The most frustrating part of the job is the low pay and not being given enough time to properly do everything that needs be accomplished in my department.  This job constantly challenges me to organize my time while always putting customers first. I think the most rewarding part of this job is when I can fulfill a customers needs.
good,I enjoy working at a store where there is no down time. I like having something to do all the time and that's what Koh'ls gave. The only downer was that it was a seasonal job.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,The one thing I love about my job is it's different everyday and offers new challenges.  It's really interesting to be in the retail business because the landscape is always changing and if you want to keep up you need to move quick.
good,This is probably the best first job to have because its a fun environment to be in.I really like being around the people here.
good,good work environment people were friendly if you like fast paced place. It will a good place to work.
good,"I loved this job..."
good,"The E-commerce warehouse was a great place to work. The employees worked well together, there was a vast amount of over-time available, and the typical work week was four days. I advanced to Assistant Supervisor within six months and learned an immeasurable amount about production in a warehouse."
good,"I enjoy coming into work everyday. With the Loss Prevention staff I work with I have been able to build a strong camaraderie with them, which allows us to perform our job effectively."
good,Kohl's is a great company to work for. They care about their associates and believe in taking care of their customers.
good,"Kohl's is very team oriented and customer service focused. It is very fast-paced, especially on the weekends. I am cross-trained in all of the departments, but mostly work in Jewelry and Customer Service. These areas have strengthened my communication skills, as well as improved my decision making skills dealing with customers one on one. Management is all about making the customer's experience the best at every moment in the store from when they walk-in, try on clothes, and check out at the register. My co-workers are friendly and love to work together to get things done. The hardest part of the job is when we do not make our credit or email goals, but when we do we get rewarded for it by management with food days, prizes, and treats. The Yes We Can policy is very helpful and makes my job enjoyable."
good,"-Independent work environment"
good,This was an easy going professional organization that gave you opportunity in everyday situations.
good,"Great attitude toward customer service"
good,I love the clothes we have and the deals we offer our customers. The people I work with are fantastic
good,Kohl's really surprised me. I was used to managers that didn't care and if you messed up you were out the door. Kohl's gives their employees a good atmosphere to work in; you know you are being taken care of by the staff they have.  They are always willing to train you if needed or answer any questions you might have about something. My duties were pretty easy; I simply put clothes back were they belong and kept the floor as clean as possible.
good,"When I started at Kohl's, I was setting up the store before its grand opening. I loved working with my fellow emplyees and highly enjoyed the physical part of setting everything up. I started out working in the harlines department and loved my job. Within a month of working on the floor and at the registers, I was promoted to harlines supervisor. I highly enjoyed the responsibility of the job and being the one that people came to for help. I helped customers in anyway I could to give them a good experience. I worked in all departments when needed. I also had 6 or 7 people working under me that I deligated different responsibilities to. My initial manger moved to a different store and I received a manager that was not very personable. I had to put my 2 weeks notice in when I became pregnant and was not allowed to sit down when I needed to."
good,Kohl's is a faced paced and high demanding work place. They are a very results oriented work place. Their main goal there is customer service and satisfaction.
good,Good place to work and the money was great! Give you as much hour as you want to work.
good,"A typical day as a key holder would involves either opening or closing. At openings you shut off alarms,  get the safe ready for the cash office person to do the balance and deposit. Walk the floor to make sure its recovered and customer ready for the day ahead. Check the computer for any sets, etc and make sure all my people have there priorities and goals to start their day."
good,"Hired to help set up new store on Nevada.  Set up displays, fixtures, add product as it arrived.  Once store opened because sales associate and worked on the floor helping to maintain product displays, mark-down's and mark-up's on items.  Setting up some of displays was difficult."
good,"I worked night shift unloading trucks, stocking merchandise, back stocking, cleaning up the dock, and sometimes price changes. Management was pretty great. easy to get along with and always helpful. I think the hardest part of the job was doing price changes although we hardly ever done them it was just boring and made for a long night. The people I worked with made the job fun."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"On truck days I start by unloading truck while the others separate it then we put it out or log it in as back stock. Other days ill replenish, help build new displays or help with new sets, or over night price change. "
good,"Lots of daily counts in jewelry"
good,"Everyday that i work is a challenge, To get credit, i learned a lot, My co-workers are fun to work with. The hardest is when you have big line and there are not enough cashier to help and provide great customer service."
good,"• Investigated and resolved customer inquiries and complaints in an empathetic manner"
good,"A typical day starts with good mornings from everyone.  My keys are always ready for me to retrieve from the customer service locked drawer. I have managers who are generally very cool to work with and always willing to provide coverage when I need to get supplies from the locked cages in the stockroom.  The managers provide support on a continual basis.  For the most part, my co-workers are a joy to be around.  I'm pretty much the only associate in my department but I am not without associates around the area.  They are always willing to lend a hand when needed, just as I am willing to help them.  I've learned to focus more on my customer and not the task in front of me.  My customer is the most important thing at the time.  I really enjoy the tasks that I get to do. I do enjoy meeting the different people that come in as well.  I have met some of the most wonderful people."
good,"Kohls can be one of the most fun workplaces depending on the people surrounding you. My Kohls is like a big old family and it's a lot of fun. As for the work, it's not that bad at all, it just gets dull after awhile. One thing that is very crucial to the corporation is your customer service because customer service is everything to them. The pay is Minimum wage so don't expect much."
good,"A typical day at work, would consist of unloading trucks and stocking."
good,I enjoy this job it was great fun and I learned  a lot about retail and about the behind the cines of a store.
good,"a day at work would, have to have constant energy, a positive attitude. managers are attentive but guiding. Most employees are team players and interactive. the hard part about a job is a customer who is just not in the mood for any mishaps. The best part of a work day is how many smile you can give a day."
good,"Throughout the holiday sales, it's a tough job to keep calm and patient while with rude customers. But with the help of Co-Workers and a calm attitude, the time in customer service will pass by easily."
good,"very friendly co workers, able to give your input on things and how they can be better ."
good,Loved kohls stores would stll  been there if more advancement dm level
good,Kohl's is a fantastic place to start your career or just add some work experience to your resume. Management is willing to be flexible with your schedule and provide support to help you perform.
good,My typical day is repoting to designated area for work. I unload trucks and worked frieght on sales floor.
good,"A typical day as a cashier starts with being assigned to a register in either the first or second set of registers. During the middle of the week, it was usually slow but on the weekends it picked up significantly. The customers were understanding although some could be difficult. I learned how to deal with difficult people during my stint at Kohl's I also learned to be a team player even it means taking one for the team at times. The management were great in training their new employees at their positions. The hardest part of the job I would say was how quickly it could become overwhelming with the flow of customers. The most enjoyable part however would be the customers."
good,Its fun but i also like that I am constantly moving and staying busy.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Went in, looked through the fitting rooms for clothing left behind, hung them back on the racks, checked the stockroom for merchandise that could be brought to the floor."
good,"Enjoyed decorating for the holidays as well as the day to day events. Employees work well together, as well as management"
good,"Fun working atmosphere. Everyone's great to be around. Management is pretty harsh sometimes , but they just wan the best out of you. hardest part of the job is going home. i love my job !"
good,"Work at kohl's wasn't to bad when I started management was really nice not demanding at all. But since there has been new management things took a downhill turn in employee moral. Management became too demanding and started getting strict with deadlines just to earn more money for themselves, made employees resent working there. Aside from management Kohl's has been a pleasant experience the coworkers become really close and make it a very friendly environment to be in. The hardest part of my job would probably be unloading the truck because of how much management is on our backs to finish it by the time ""the computer"" says we're suppose to be down that gets a little frustrating. The most enjoyable part is working along side some of my coworkers I can say have become some true friends I'll keep with me even after I leave Kohl's."
good,"A typical day at work involves, assisting customers with concerns, maintaining a clean work environment and completing daily tasks to increase sales and customer service"
good,A typical day at work included helping customers with everything they needed and even going the extra mile to help them by looking at another store. I've learned time management and great customer listening skills and problem solving. Our managers helped us when we needed it and helped show us what its like to be in a managers position. The hardest part of the job was not being able to get the customer what they needed due to it not being at our store and having them drive across town to get an item. The most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team to finish our work.
good,I wake up in the morning and go to work very early and at 12 or so i go home and get ready for the next day. I've learned that the earlier you work the better your day will be. The management was the best i have been apart of. My co-workers were very good people to work with. The hardest part of the job was waking up at 330 in the am. The most enjoyable part of this job was interacting with the co-workers.
good,"It was a great place to work at. Great pay, great people, great management, this was my favorite job I ever had."
good,"I learned a lot about retail, creating great customer service, effective superisor skills and dealing with upper management. The hardest part of the jobe was the holidays. I needed to keep open communication with all employees as well as management while setting the floor in preparation for the holidays.  The most enjoyable part of the job was my interactions with all customers and making sure they left happy and satisfied"
good,"Overview of Store and company expectation. Fast pace and learn different things daily. "
good,"It was a good  company,enjoyed activities,company picnics, and christmas parties."
good,"You get paid next to nothing. You start at minimum wage, and working your way up to a reasonable rate is unreasonably difficult. Management is understanding, but in the end it's your fellow associates that motivate you want to come to work. It can be stressful, definitely hard on the feet, and customer are, at times, unreasonable. But hey, that's retail for you, so nothing too shocking about that."
good,"Hours varied. Unloaded product and stocked the Back/Floor. Also, worked the Cashier and Customer Service with some Sales. Usually had great and cooperative Employees as well as Customers."
good,"The pay is low, but expected that in retail. Great work environment and management."
good,I enjoyed working for Kohl's.  The company seemed to care about it's employees.  They offered competitive wages and were willing to work with difficult schedules.
good,"When I first go into the store I check in with the manager on duty. keeping up with the fitting rooms is the number one priority. Always smiling and saying hi to our customers. When it gets really busy I normally will jump on the register. We are always soliciting credit, that was probably the most difficult part of my job. Moving the department around was my favorite thing to do. I got to merchandise all the clothing and make it look really nice. being the misses supervisor I had to keep up with my department by cleaning and always picking up the floor."
good,"Responsible for keeping fitting rooms cleaned out and preparing clothing (hang on hangers or fold) to be returned to sales floor. Cleaning and straightening of the sales floor, to provide the best presentation for our product. Backup cashier as needed, when there are 3 or more customers in a line, or to relieve primary cashiers for breaks. "
good,"A typical work day at Kohl's consisted of retrieving a ""walkie-talkie"", communicated with the manager for the day to let them know you had arrived, and being assigned a specific area or task to complete. Within thirty minutes to an hour of clocking in there was usually a meeting for the associates to retrieve any items that needed to be returned and to receive further instructions. I usually covered the children's, home, and often times the lingerie department. I was responsible for collecting any clothing left behind in the dressing rooms, and returning them to their correct home. I also assisted in the appearance of fixtures and mannequins. While working here I learned how to maneuver through their stock room, find the appropriate items and place them on the sales floor as well as stock any new items or inventory that arrived. Management consisted of the store manager who was very active with the sale's associates. There were also about six different managers that floated from department to department to assure that tasks were being performed correctly. Being that I as well as most of my co-workers were hired during the Christmas season we all seemed to float around to different departments of the store. The hardest part of my job would have to be maintaining the last minute rush of customers who shopped within the closing hour of the store. As a sale's associate I was responsible for performing my regular task as well as, maintaing the fitting rooms insuring that they didn't become overcrowded with clothing, as well as helping the customer, which is the most important thing"
good,"My typical day usually starts with me catching the door for customers leaving or entering the store, I know it's not really much, but I feel it's a common courtesy, especially when someone has their arms full! Entering I usually find my coworkers scattered here and there and if they have a moment usually they'll nod or give a greeting, sometimes they have a moment to chat, give an update on how the day's been, just preparations for what is to come.  It's like a family in our little store, and we all try to support one another when we can, even if it means cheering someone up when they've had a tough customer, or stepping in to try and bring a situation back to earth.  It can be rough working the floor sometimes, you never know what a person will need and when you work the very core of the store (Intimates and Accessories) you sometimes have to know a bit more than your own department.  Generally I find I have been questioned about anything from shoes to housewares and suiting, so it's a position that will really keep you on your toes! But for every sour nancy that I can make smile, or for every customer I bring honest joy to, it makes my day that much brighter.  "
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I worked at Kohl's seasonally. It was very fast paced, especially during the holidays. I was a front cashier, and a normal day, I would ring people our, consistently for 4-6 hours. My co-workers, were very nice, and were always teaching me new things. Especially about, how to get Credit Card Applications. I loved interacting with people all day. There was nothing I can say, that was disheartening about working at Kohl's."
good,as soon as you clock in you go straight to the sells floor and help every customer possible
good,It's a great place to work for and the coworkers are great as well as they become your second family.  Management are usually never on the same page as you could be told two different things by managers and not sure which one to listen to.  The hardest part of the job is usually having to work alone because working alone means more work then you can handle.  The most enjoyable part of the job is just working with such great coworkers.
good,"Typical day starts with dock prepping, eventually towards truck unloading/processing., After truck is finished, you move onto merchandise processing, handling, and stocking/back stocking. Occasionally there are price change nights, self explanatory, along with merchandise replenishment nights. Management is great, very friendly and understandable, Co-workers are very friendly, easy to get along with and provides a great work environment. Hardest part about the job is getting things done at a fast amount of time when the team is shorthanded everything gets backed up, and its harder for the team to maintain when it is shorthanded, lots of duties to perform, and very exhausting work at times, not that great of pay for how hard you work. Something enjoyable is the friendly co-workers that make the job very nice and not as hard to do, the environment is overall pleasant and enjoyable. "
good,My typical day at Kohls was enjoyable. I provided assistance to customers which gave me satisfaction. My co-workers were wonderful to work with. Everybody worked as a team. The hardest part of my job was when I lost it. I made an honest mistake that I didn't know that I did until it was after the fact. I was not given the benefit of the doubt and was let go. 
good,I really loved working at Kohls. It was a great atmosphere and it was fun being able to interact with all of the customers. I learned alot of great customer service skills while working for Kohls. The co-workers were all very friendly and great to work with. The managers were all very understanding and professional. 
good,Overall Kohl's provided solid job security. Co-workers were great in terms of supporting each other. 
good,"It was a great place to work.  I learned how to hone my customer service skills by working more with public - the good and the bad.  Management was good, co-workers were fun to be around and I found that just by being with them made the work environment that much more enjoyable."
good,"Daily duties are as such; organize your area, help shoppers with any and all of their related needs, distribute merchandise properly. "
good,Great place to work but hours are light unless it certain holidays
good,"While working at Kohls I learned many new skills.  Such as working in a fast paced environment, how to handle any situation, and I learned that I am a quick learner and can perform tasks I have never done before with little to no trouble.  The management was good, they are always willing to work with my schedule as it changed semester to semester.  My co-workers are all real friendly nice people.  I can get along with most anybody though.  The hardest part of my job at Kohls is folding a table or just getting a fitting room cleaned out and then having a customer come along and destroy it.  The most enjoyable part would have to be working as a team with my co-workers there."
good,"Kohl's is a very good place to work if you understand what your real job is. The management does value excellent customer service (going above and beyond for people, making sure that before they leave they are satisfied with their experience and if not what you/a manager could do to help), however, your true job is to sell their store card and collect emails. This can be slightly difficult as most customers already have a card but if you are a good salespersons you can sell the card to those who don't have one. A typical day (depending on the area you work in) would include greeted customers upon arrival and departure, checking out customers, assisting them with shopping or any problems they were having. Always remember to be willing to help them with anything, no matter what the situation, the customers and managers love that. You will be on your feet for a good amount of time but everyone is timely about breaks (except for the holiday season, very busy time but moves quickly). The area where I worked had very good management, they were timely and well informed, the only down part is they are constantly pressuring people to sell more and more credit. Expect this wherever you work. The most enjoyable part of the job was being around the coworkers who were very helpful to me at all times and there were certain customers who very nice, funny and understanding (but there will be some creeps, beware the creeps)."
good,helping customers pick out the best jewelry for them or help them make a decision for a gift. I like helping customers and getting the know them personally.
good,"Working at kohl's was a fun experience. They genuinely care about their employees, customers as well as the environment. They are GREEN company. My overall experience was amazing. I only left due to relocating to Georgia."
good,A typical day was unloading boxes from trucks. I learned to be patient and productive. My co-workers was some of the best people I ever worked with.
good,"Typically, I would come in and do some computer based training. I would then follow that up by working on the floor with a particular department. Throughout the day, I would have check ins with the managers and change what department I was working in. Occasionally we would work on special projects."
good,"Overall, an easy company to work for. They try to make sure to recognize and reward associates who make an effort. However, the pay over time isn't the greatest. After working there for 2 years, minimum wage went up and the company refused to reflect that on current employees wages. New employees weren't making much less than employees who had been there for a year or longer. They easily promote within, but some have an unfair advantage and many managers play favoritism."
good,"It's a great job, but hours are negligible and you have to almost fight for them. On the other hand, working there is fun, co-workers are generally easy-going and part time -therein more relaxed. Mini-vacations are offered and you'll always have a general idea of when it's time to hustle, vs when you can take a break. Customers are also very friendly."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"My typical day at work consisted of greeting guests, maintaining the stoors cleanliness. The management team was a bit un organized at times. My co-workers were very friendly and professional. The toughest part of the job was keeping the dressing room area clean and organized. Over all I enjoyed taking on the new challenges every new day brought."
good,"Would go in and depending where I was working I was either working in back or up front. Would entail making sure store was clean and organized, having a general idea where everything was, knowledge of POS system, and around holidays work long hours."
good,My typical day at work is consistant in always having a task at hand.
good,Overall a good place to work for with a fun and rewarding company. They are constantly expanding and opening new stores
good,Great place to work.They keep you busy and they keep it exciting
good,This is a great company to work for with a lot of amazing people. The management is very personable and helpful. You start learning about the retail industry from day one and continue to learn each day. You gain great experience and more responsibility as you show more potential. This is an overall great company to work for and gives you opportunity to move up if you work hard.
good,very exciting
good,"I learned alot about plan-o-grams, visual needs, great training,"
good,Kohl's does provide a good balance for work and family life. It is overall a good place to work for a starter job. If you are looking to find a career I would not pick Kohl's unless you are planning to go into management.
good,"Store team was very good,with solid field leadership. Fast paced and varied experiences."
good,A typical day includes putting away merchandise in the correct spot and maintain a clean store. I learned how to provide excellent customer service. the hardest part of the job is around the holidays when the fitting rooms get out of control. The enjoyable part is working with people that you can get a long with and will help you if you need it.
good,"Kohl's was a great place to work for, Management was good, but the atmosphere was the best part. everybody was in a good mood, which was surprising for the amount of hours we worked. Kohl's had dinners for us, occassionaly, great pay."
good,"The people are a joy to be around and the managers are exceptionally nice. Goal of the day is to get high numbers in email subscriptions and credit applications, as well as having a clean and tidy store for the customers."
good,worked 8hrs in a nice building
good,"A typical day entailed working the cash register, greet incoming customers, fold and maintain store cleanliness, customer service activities and clean store for next opening"
good,"Khol's was a very good experience to me! I enjoyed the people I worked with, management staff and our customers."
good,Difficult to move from hourly to salaried position.
good,"Great training, communications and leadership. everyone needs to work hard everyday to meet workload. need to have or create a winning team to win- ""finish first""."
good,Coworkers all worked as a team which was great. unloading the truck of merchandise was fun. Hardest part was unloading the truck on time.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Working with customers, unloading merchandise, resettnig floor displays, and selling product."
good,I worked with great people who made even the long holiday hours bearable. The management was always able to work with you on schedules and they were understanding.
good,This was a retail job. I learned about how to deal with customers in a sales environment. The employees tended to friendly with the typical drama that is expected in retail environments. I think I enjoyed the overall atmosphere most. The hardest part of customer service is the knowledge that you can't please every customer every time.
good,"good company,fast paced, repaired maintained distribution center conveyors and handling system. Hardest part of job, was that it was a temp postition."
good,My co-workers are amazing along with management. Customer service is a key.
good,When I was working at kohl's I enjoyed working there. I learned that everyone works as a team at koh'l. they are very respectful there I loved the management there. There wasn't really a hard part on the job because I was only bagging people items that people bought. I was mainly helping out the cashier for the seasonal job.
good,Very good company very flexible scheduling fun people and descent managers
good,"Typical day at work includes running merchandise in the fitting rooms, being on the floor to help customers, helping back up cashiers when needed. At Kohl's, the customer is the most important part of our job."
good,Kohl was fun to work for. I got the opportunity to meet different people on a daily basis. This company taught me the true meaning of customer service with class. It had a business attitude at the store. The managemnt expected 100% out of their employees. We all got alone well together. The team work was excellent. There was not a hard assignment or department at Kohl because it had such a positive enviroment.
good,I enjoyed working at Kohl's. Everyone worked hard as a team to get the job done in a fast and friendly manner. They were flexible with my college hours and were good with scheduling around that.
good,"A normal day at work consisted of cleaning out dressing rooms, re-stocking clothing area, keeping floors, dressing rooms, and shelves clean, cashiering and also helping customers with what they needed. I learned to be more helpful and how to better handle situations where customers were not pleased. The management was very helpful and understanding of personal needs of other co-workers. My co-workers were all very friendly and everyone got alone with everyone else. The relationship with co-workers was also spent outside of work on a friend basis. The hardest part of the job at Kohls was when a customer was not pleased and there would be nothing to do to be able to help them. The most enjoyably part of the job was honestly the entire job. The employees were fun to be around and so were any of the managers. It was fun helping people with what they needed also working with clothes is always a fun task."
good,Work environment was excellent. Learned various skills from management.
good,"My shift would begin by bringing overstock from customer service to its designated area. Depending on the shift, there could be a meeting btween management and associates to discuss the key objectives for the day. Once in my assigned department, I would speak to my co workers about what is the priority in the department. Through out the shift the associates are working as a team to greet customers, assist at the registers, clear fitting rooms and answering customers inquiries on the floor and/or phone. The most challenging part of the job is when the pace of the store is more than the associates can keep up with during the shift. I truly enjoy helping customers find that item they have been in search of or leading them in the direction of a certain style. I've learned how to work effectively with different personalities and how to operate outside of my comfort zone."
good,"Working at two different Kohls stores across the country, I've experienced both good and bad things about the company, but mostly good things. The management (that I've experienced) is very understanding of schedules, and any situation that you might be personally going through. There is drama amongst employees sometimes, but overall, I have nothing really negative to say about it. One store I worked at didn't really have its priorities straight when it came to promoting the right people (Ex: a person having 2 years experience for a supervisor position would be overlooked by an 18 year old person with only 2 months experience, etc.)"
good,"Worked a 10 hour shift Monday-Thursday working in the Shipping department. I was also cross trained in several other departments including Receiving, Pack-2-Light, Over-flow, Stripping Dock, Flat, and Vendor Compliance. Everyone was easy to get along with, hard working, and always willing to help each other out. Hardest part of the job was managing the heat when working in the semi-trailers."
good,"overall good, friendly helpful managers. very flexiable. set ads for current sale ads take about two hours to set and you have to work about three to four days a weeks."
good,"The company has created a nice work/life balance for associates. If you are able to get a position here, you will enjoy your time. However, moving up within the company will take many years. Those that hold top positions aren't going anywhere."
good,"Working here was fun , time always went by quickly I learned that being a team means everything. The Management was ok. My co-workers weren't always social.The hardest part was trying to sell Kohl'sa Charge cards to customers. I enjoyed how I was always busy and how time went by so quickly."
good,"a typical day at work woulud be unloading the 53 ft truck then moving on to help fold, or help hang. then after we are all done take all the racks out to the floor for the overnight team to process."
good,I love being part of the Kohl's team. We all work together to make it a great shopping experience for the customers. You will never get board either you will always have something to do.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Typical day would be opening at 6am. Preparing schedules for the day, setting up opening associates with tasks to be completed and do daily cash office duties. Or the closing shift involves recovering entire store from the busy day. With the intent of setting up the next mornings staff for success, counting down registers and closing down 15 or so registers nightly. Then just closing down cash office and locking and alarming store."
good,I started as a department manager and then was promoted to a supervisor. The hard part of the job was the hours as Kohl's was often open very early and they stayed open very late during the hioldays.
good,It was fun and alot of work to learn from and I have a great time to learn about different people and how the jobs would get done.
good,"Generally I love Kohl's. They have been very good to me for the 5+ years I have been with the company. I'm given challenges so my work load is never the same and because we all have different schedules every week, I'm not working with the same people every single day so it gives me variety."
good,To make every customer happy. Toprovide great customer service and make sure the store is ready and clean for the day. I loved this job but sadly had to give it up for a job that provided more income. I loved helping cutomers and making them happy.
good,Great customer service driven store focused on the customer. Motto was Expect Great Things. Taught hands on customer service through the store policy.
good,"Flexible hours, Smile and say ""hi"" to customers, ensuring customers leave the store satisfied. Following store procedures and guidelines. Co-workers and management are friendly and helpful."
good,Everyone I worked with were very nice and very helpful if I needed it. The managers were very positive and very helpful with any tasks that were challenging including dealing with difficult customers.
good,kohls is a good place to work for if your looking for partime work and flexable hours. there discount is the best.
good,"Good team enviroment, Great health benefits, Medium Salary, Slow to little advancement opportunity."
good,Great company to work for. Good benefits and promotional opportunity. Work/Life balance could improve a bit though.

good,They are always willing to work your schedule with you life schedule. the managers treat you like a person.
good,The work enviroment is great. Very laid back and flexible with hours.
good,"This is a very fast-paced environment where there is almost always too much to do. Physically and mentally stressful, but if you are going to work retail this is the place to do it."
good,"Kohl's truly is a great place to work. The people are caring, most managers work to help you succeed and there is a general sense of purpose to succeed."
good,"Kohls overall was a wonderful place to work, and taught me a lot about responsibilities and good work ethic. While work can be a handful, the environment was always positive."
good,I enjoy working at Kohl's because I am moved around to different positions which allows me to learn more and to be of service in different capacities.  The employees are friendly and helpful.  Management is helpful as well.
good,I loved working for kohl’s they have a great management team!! They give out bonuses they let their employees know they are appreciated!! I would love to go back.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Kohl's is a pleasant place to work. It is a customer service oriented environment that focuses on the needs of their customers as well as their employees.
good,"Helpful and understanding. Able to go to my boss anytime, and fellow coworkers. As long as I was on time and got my work done then it was fun and steady."
good,Never really had a problem. I got a meal violation from working with one of the managers. I really loved working here get that the hours sucked but still enjoyed it....
good,I enjoy working with the people around me including managers. The job is easy to gain valuable experience from such as interacting with customers and being able to help them with any questions involving our services or products in the store
good,"Been at kohls for almost 5 years, really enjoy it, just looking for next challenge. Hours were nice 7-330, with gym onsite. Office is very well lit and easy to work in."
good,"All the employees there were extremely friendly, patient, understanding, and open minded. The management was good at listen to the employee concerns and were very understanding of real life circumstances. My typical work days were busy but enjoyable, I learned a lot about sales tactics. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who came in looking to get away with something. Its very hard to deal with that kind of energy from another person and those kinds of customers can be overbearing and tend to try and dominate conversations and push the cashiers into giving them discounts. These customers were extremely few and far between so it was a concern I rarely came across if ever. The best part of the job were the everyday customers. The people who come in there are usually always friendly, and if you smile at them, they smile right back."
good,"i usually worked an 8 hour shift on omni with anywhere from 1-3 or more people. everyone was super helpful and had good communication. it’s important to be quick and able to carry heavy items since it’s a timed job. online orders are priority. the worst part was when there were issues with the phones since those are the number one tool for online orders. overall the job is a good, steady-fast paced job."
good,"Flexibly hours, great team to work with. Nice discounts. You will learn diferente tasks and management will be there to support you. In this place you will have to  focuses on getting satisfied customers."
good,I enjoyed working at Khol's.  The supervisors were nice and they seemed like they care for the associates.  The other associates were friendly and helpful.
good,Working at Kohl’s was a great experience of customer service. The management was great and it taught me many things. If I had any questions they would help me through it and show me how to fix certain things.
good,"The day starts out quickly and easily, with an assigned position that is displayed in the company's app for employees. The tasks given are easy to learn and master within half a day, with coworkers that make any new steps easy and fun."
good,coworkers was nice and helpful management. was also i worked there twice didn't like trying to get credit cards but i did it anyway why is this important i liked my job just didn't get enough hours i am a people person and i like people i have worked in retail for 30 years
good,it is a fast pace and learning experience. you meet different people and you meet different goals.Everyone is willing to help .Flexable and easy going.
good,Life at work was pretty cool. The coworkers I were cool with were nice and all the supervisors and bosses were pretty nice too. I learned how to handle the register pretty decently for the first time and to have patience. The hardest part of the job was that sometimes it would get repetitive and tedious and it was hard to stay concentrated at times. The most employable part of the job is that you can easily just breeze through a day with just working and doing what you have to do to keep yourself occupied.
good,everything was fine there. The managers where very nice and understanding. The job was very flexible with my school schedule. The other employees their were very helpful and nice.
good,I worked as a seasonal employee in putwall I sorted the orders for packing. I packed the orders and I did trouble shooting for orders missing items from them.
good,I learned a lot about working retail during the Christmas season. The other workers were friendly and knowledgeable. Managers were very helpful. Was able to work a good amount of hours during the season.
good,"The job wasn't all that bad, Their scheduling for part-time would be ridiculous at times. they would make me work 6 hours per day for like 4-5 days a week. barely got any time off."
good,"Kohl's is a good place to work. I made quite a few friends there. Job is fast paced and challenging. Leadership, I believe is a bit off - they are not quite tuned into their employees."
good,"Kohl’s is a wonderful place to work, has great flexibility and great management. At kohl’s, there is always something to do to either tidy up the store or to put new things out for sale."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,When I worked at this Kohl's everyone was really nice. Everyone set a clear expectation of what they wanted you to do. Sure there were rude customers but that's every retail job.
good,"I was taught a lot about customer service, and since it was my first job, it gave me a sense of urgency and working hard. I worked very early mornings most days."
good,Working at Kohls Distribution Center was easy even if it was for a short time i met a lot of friendly employees and management members that made the job better. If help was needed anyone would provide it with little to no questions about it. The part i loved most about working at the distribution center was the large open area to walk through and I felt like I got exercise working there.
good,This Was A Seasonal Job For Me . I Had To Be Really Independent Working Here . I Feel Like I Had To Help Myself To Succeed InThis Company.  But The Co Worker Was Great And Landed Out A Hand.
good,It was a good opportunity and experience   I learned a lot from the people I worked with and I learned new things I didn’t know before I will forget the people and the customers
good,"importance is placed on signing customers up for rewards programs and charge cards. its also important to be a team player, and cashiers are expected to help with the floor when closing the store."
good,I like the products that are offered at this establishment. There are always good deals and friendly associates. All of the team members care about the success of the company.
good,"Khols required you to be a well rounded person. They could assign you to work anywhere in the store at any point of time. I specifically worked in the shoe department, where I guided people to the most suitable shoe available for their lifestyle."
good,They are always looking to move people up within. Great company to work for. Pay is great work life balance is good. Besides during the holidays where you basically have to work everyday all day
good,Its a warehouse that has many different sections. You find one you like and stick with it. You wanna make sure you have a little fun doing your job while you get your work done. or else it will be a long shift standing on your feet.
good,My experience with Kohl’s has been very pleasant. The team does a really great job with helping me know what to do. I feel happy when I work there. Everyone is so friendly and supportive. The managers are understanding and helpful. Kohl’s is such an amazing place to work at.
good,"Kohl’s was my second retail job and it wasn’t a bad experience for me, everyone’s nice and the store is always organized when it comes to schedules so you’d find it slightly easy."
good,"organized go backs, communicated with customers and co worker was fun and brought a social life to the environment, mostly young people working and made it enjoyable"
good,It's ok I enjoy the work it's fast face the management is well benefits are good also and they let you listen to music as you work so it makes the time go by
good,"There was a reason behind everything we did. The moves were well thought out and planned thoroughly before execution and it really showed making life easier on everyone. The environment was generally happy. They would always work with my requests for time off but slowly gave me all closing shifts which really killed my work life balance and that was not going to change. Once you excel at a position it felt like you were kind of stuck, like you may not climb the ladder because they liked you where you were.  There were alot of learning experiences and the company was really good at keeping things positive and to give back to the community which also brought the associates together and really made you feel like part of a team."
good,"In my case it's a location issue. A lot of visits from CEO and district managers are placed. They are in the transition of advancement. They lack a lot of good people. Those who work there at the moment are stressful and selfish in task orientation. They have dealt with a lot of mistakes and overwhelming situations, resulting in lazy management and pressuring employees in going above and beyond. They prioritize unacceptably and place a lot of weight on all departments. The job isn't secure for those lifting 50lbs and/or less, folding tables, putting away recovery and cashiering. I say it is a work in progress if you are willing to suffer to express the company needs better placements."
good,Really fast paced and u always had extra help if u needed it . Always able too move up with promotions. Managers really made sure u understood job duties
good,"I worked with Kohl's close to two years and it was great experience. Taught staff to use Kohl’s customer service system phones, computers and store systems. Trained staff in processing returns, exchange, and damages. Set up and organized Customer Service department for staff use. Multi-tasking, answering and transferring phone calls; processing returns, exchange and sales. Train new hire staff to how to use and work on kiosk machine, fix any computers or printers issues. Balance the needs of multiple customers simultaneously in a fast-pace retail environment."
good,"A very open diversity place to work, friendly staff, comfortable dressing code, and working environment. Lots of nice potlucks. Great job for Kohl's shopper."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Everyone who works at Kohl’s has a great attitude, they include everyone in what is going on that day. They make sure everyone knows what’s going on every morning before they start the day. Management is very understanding, and cooperative."
good,Good place to work. Friendly management and well organized. Only down side was schedule more hours than agreed on at interview. Loved the promotional coupons and Kohls cash. Did all my Christmas shopping there. Rewarded for credit applications completed.
good,Effingham has a great management team. The first place I have worked in a long time that felt like a family. They are involved in the community through Kohl's Cares. Plenty of opportunity to give back.
good,"Job roles are easy, hardest part is dealing with certain customers. You can choose your hours. Everybody is cross trained to work the register as well."
good,"My time at Kohl's went well. Though it wasn't a livable wage, especially part time, I luckily didn't live alone, and the staff was excellent. I enjoyed working there."
good,I started out at fifteen hours and it did increase during the holiday season. It was a great work environment they gave us food and provided great attention to staff.
good,A typical day at Kohls was productive and challenging. I learned that you have to work at a fast pace and customer service was a must. The work culture was very friendly.
good,Good work life and have no complaints on the work itself. Be prepared to cross-train in different areas and curse yourself for spending half your paycheck on merchandise at work.
good,It's a nice place and the workers are super friendly. The hours can be scarce at times but it's a good first job to have. The management is clear with their instructions.
good,A typical day was folding clothes Maneger were chill very helpful hardest part of the job was keeping track of everything you needed to do just wish that they gave more hours
good,"Managers are understanding"
good,"Flexible hours, friendly staff, well organized. Hours might be low and it might not be enough for someone looking for fulltime work. It is a good job overall, and the pace depends on what department you work in."
good,Okay job to work at. The coworkers were nice to be around and everyone is friendly. The store in always lively and nice and clean. I would recommedn this job to anyone.
good,"Even though Kohl's had there Flaws but i loved working for this company a typical day would be meeting and greeting customers , prompting surveys and helping family with finding certain merchandise i also did recovery on the floor and put out clothing as a daily task."
good,"Great place to work, Great benefits , Great Schedule M-F am shifts mostly, Associate discount 15% plus stackable personal coupons.  Wonderful staff, Fast paste environment. Must have a sense of urgency and great communication skills. Must be able to use excel and microsoft skills, read, write and have leadership skills, must be able to complete task on hand. Must have great costumer service skills, Must have some experience with banking or cash office. Main duty scheduling and staffing must have knowledge using Kronos series a very complex system for scheduling over 100 employees. Answering phone calls!"

good,"Good company to work for!! Offers flexible hours and being a mommy..thats whats best about it, besides the customers...Management is always changing but Hey...it is what it is..."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,i enjoyed working at kohl it was a part time position  but i enjoyed helping the customers when they called from asking about an item in store or asking about an order they may have placed
good,"I am a seasonal associate. Its a pretty easy job. So far, I worked 3 days and have only done work on the floor and the back, which i don't mind as i don't like the register. I wish they spent more time on training, as I would like to do register at some point. The people there are great and easy to talk to or ask for help."
good,Kohls is a good job if you’re a beginner trying to make easy money just to spend. Majority of the time they work with your schedule and what your future plans are.
good,Kohls is a very family oriented company however the opportunity of advancement can get discouraging at times. I have learned a lot through this company and wish to be promoting within the company.
good,"If you don’t mind the fast paced environment, you work hard and enjoy interacting with a lot of different people I think this job would be perfect for you. Kohl’s was my first job and personally I was a bit overwhelmed by the fast paced environment of the store but I loved my co workers, most customers were kind and patient. Also all of The managers were amazing."
good,Fast paced during seasonal work.  Need to work independently and communicate with customers.  Shift work is normal and the job is often understaffed.  I felt that management tried to take care of employees.
good,ok job but im not into warehouse any more but if you are involved into the warehouse industry Kohls is not a bad job the pay is ok the people are ok and its overall ok
good,"Love working here. Great coworkers and management is alright. I am always busy but not overwhelming. I have been working there 4 months and already offered a lead role, putting me at my 2nd raise. The only bad thing is i never get 12-20 hours usually but that works for me right now."
good,I really enjoyed working at this place. I really loved working with so many different people they were very nice and friendly I love getting to know new thing and customers .
good,"I worked during holiday season and honestly had a great time, the work wasn’t particularly strenuous or difficult, however I walked around the entire store several times a day. Busy enough to stay working but not overwhelming 7/10"
good,I honestly can say that this company helped me be the person I’m now. I was so shy when I started. But we have a credit goal everyday and we make sure we try to meet it . So talking to people helped me out a lot . To make sure we meet our goal .
good,Working at kohls was an experience to remember - you learn the amount of stupidity out there. Thankfully the managers knew how to deal with this stupidity and helped their employees to understand and deal with it as well.
good,I liked working there . The people were very nice and friendly. I worked with one of my best friends. She helped out a lot. They taught me how to interact with many people. It was a good experience.
good,"Work was slow paced. I got along with all my coworkers. I learned a lot, very easy to get used to the work enviroment.  I learned how to use the cash register, how to make exchanges, and how to unbox and stock items. There was nothing hard about the job, I just was not getting enough hours."
good,Kohl's offers a good work/life balance. Compensation is not that great. Culture best example I can give fake Brady Bunch. Health care is pretty expensive.
good,"I liked the inventory, the holiday season was fun and entertaining. The people were fun to be around, I was able to expand my retail experience. I had never worked a Black Friday."
good,Typical day at work would be very busy and go past fast for my shift. I also learned more about patience and customer service. Also I enjoyed the employees discount.
good,"good balance between life and work."
good,Worked with your schedule and was good for getting days off if you needed them. Worked around my school schedule. Was a fast passed place and the days went fast.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"On weekdays I worked four hour shifts in the evening, and on the weekends I worked eight hour shifts during the daytime. My workdays were quite random as to what I would do. Most days of course I was in the back packing orders or going out on the floor to pick items. Other days though I would work in Toys for my entire shift, organize the floor, run returns, stock items, or set up displays. I would frequently be assigned special projects from a manager. Projects such as reorganizing a room for better storage, and even setting up and tearing down Black Friday or Christmas displays. My funny co-workers made the experience even better, and my managers were always considerate."
good,Satisfactory overall but could improve when informing employees on policy changes or procedures.  Employees aren’t informed of changes until after they’ve already taken effect.
good,Meeting new people daily. Seeing customers leave happy. Management was awesome. Showed compassion to employees. Opportunity to grow. Great incentives.
good,Really fun place to work at you get to experience all the new fashion and clothes great discounts and benefits cool management friemdly environment etc.
good,"If you don't have thick skin, or haven't worked in congested retail this is not for you. Also have to deal with favoritism. But they have wonderful vunteer programs and really do try to give back to the local communities."
good,I have loved being apart of the Kohl's family! Management is very helpful with accommodating you with your other obligations and offer many opportunities for growth.
good,It's okay to go the extra mile and do more to help out your team but don't let the laziest person take credit for your hard work. Especially after cleaning up their messes and having management complain to you about the lack of work happening in that department.
good,"Seasonal work, walking and standing for 8 to 10 hours, but I enjoyed the exercise, since i am Retired, i didnt mind the seasonal experience.  It was a bit challenging,"
good,"Kohl’s offers a ton of opportunity for career advancement, is extremely diverse, and offers great work/life balance. Overall I have enjoyed working here."
good,"This is a very fast paced environment and physically demanding position. The supervisors are all professional and kind, and willing to help you in getting ahead in your job"
good,"Everyone is happy to be there, fun place to work. Nice to get and go to work everyday knowing you are appreciated.  Amenities are great, cafeteria there has many options."
good,Working at kohls was my first retail experience and it has been amazing. I'm learning new skills and leadership. And helping me on working on my customer service. Helping people at kohls is the best ever.
good,Depending on the store and it's management team it can be a really fun place to work with a lot of great support. It's like having an extended family.
good,Working for kohls was a wonderful experience.  The work was rewarding and the pay was good. The management was helpful and understanding.  The only reason I left was because I moved to another state.
good,This job is an environment where you might sometimes work with the coworkers but the people are very nice. The workplace is very nice and so are the mangers who work there.
good,"Cashering will be required by all associates. Our store would try to keep at least one associate out on the floor but would prioritize reducing line times as much as possible. You must also sell people on Kohl's Charge cards. As a cashier, you will have a minimum to meet per pay period. Sales floor associates will not but will be encouraged to inform guests of the cards and its benefits."
good,Great supervisor fun atmosphere there are way to many perks it would take a book to discuss lbvs I suggest Kohls to anyone that's was honest hardworking and friendly
good,I enjoy working at Kohl's.  I love helping our customers and helping with their needs.  I only work at Kohl's part time on the weekends.  It's a nice place to earn extra income.
good,"Some of the personnel here would do their best to keep flexible schedules for everyone and maintain a good amount of staff. Training was excellent and the overall work environment was healthy, happy, and productive."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Normally I would come in and type in my number and then grab a walki talki and then ask one of the managers where they would like for me to be. I would grab clothes from the changing room and then put them back where they should be. I would fix the clothes and then organize the size how they should be. The works place is nice because I got to meet new people.
good,Kohls is an innovative forward thinking company.   They are proactively securing new opportunities for the company.  Amazon in my opinion is a great addition.
good,"I was in charge of the men's department and I found it to be a pretty good job in general. Other than constantly folding clothes, there were not many negative aspects of the jobs and the rest of the staff were very friendly."
good,on a day to day basis i would be between the front and in the back doing customer service. I would also be in charge of go back and make sure everything was in the correct places
good,"I had really enjoyable with co-worker. they are hard worker and friendly people."
good,"This was a great place and i would’ve loved to stay, sadly i was a seasonal worker. Great environment and people, someone always to lend a helping hand."
good,Working at Kohl’s was the best experience I have ever had while working in retail! Great staff and an amazing management team. I loved working with the customers and completing online orders. Great place to work highly recommend this company!
good,I enjoyed working for this company. The only issue I had was the company did not allow a enough time for training. I was fine with it but there were others who definitely needed more training to make them better sales associates.
good,Love working for kohls its easy going and most managers are very kind the workers are all very kind  kohls does a good job at making sure it's a fun and safe environment to work for
good,"Kohls has been a very great working environment and great experience for me and all ages 16 & up, the workers really do care about you and help you a lot through schedules and more."
good,Kohls has good discounts for employees that can be combined but their pay rate needs to go up further than the minimum wage that it was just raised to.
good,Kohls is a good place to work at. Good work environment and good culture. Supervisors know their duties perfectly and they show respect to all the associates.
good,I liked working at Kohl's due to the above minimum wage pay and the ability to adjust my schedule as each semester came and went. There are times that the management can be uptight but overall a nice place to work.
good,"Good place to work for a warehouse, nice people and easy going work. I work recommended others to go there. The management at kohl’s warehouse is great too."
good,Everyone there was nice and fun but everyone made sure their work came first. Everyone got along and everyone helped one another . The head staff even brought food for the employees for the holidays.
good,"Working here was very easy, was very fast paced but relaxed at the same time. Even though it is fast paced, it is competitive in getting bonues and raises."
good,Kohl’s warehouse was a good work experience for me. The people at kohl’s are very helpful and patient. Kohl’s was a good place to work and a good way to start your career off.
good,"Having never worked retail, kohl’s is a pretty good start. Kohl’s isn’t very crazy through the year and the store tends to be organized. I’ve heard stories of other retail stores and kohl’s handles itself really well."
good,"Employees who look forward to coming to work each day and who interact with coworkers in a collaborative and collegial manner create a positive workplace. They act on the belief that their working relationships have a positive impact on the employment relationship, particularly when they sustain good working relationships with their supervisors and managers. Employees with an enthusiastic approach to work usually are described as fully engaged."
good,I loved the atmosphere in the building I wish I never left. I know that if I could ever get a job baCk that this would be it. I loved my Co workers to management
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"My position was sales associate and I worked in the clothing departments. My experience consisted of making sure fitting rooms stayed in manageable conditions, answer and make phone calls, act as an additional cashier when lines became busy, and I did other things such as make price tags, purge and backstock clothing and use devices to help locate merchandise. As an employee at Kohl's, he or she may stand and walk on their feet for long periods of time. An employee will also be twisting, turning, reaching, lifting, etc. The company has benefits (i.e. 401k) and the fellow coworkers make the job so that he or she may have a productive yet joyful experience."
good,At the khols that I worked at was a team.from manager down too the employees.i would go back too work for that khols.they would ask if you wanted hours they would give it too you.it was up to you if you wanted to work you mess up it was because of you.call in too much are late all the time your job was on the line.they also had dress days you could win things for whatever activity they had for that month.also lunch would be given.
good,"Very flexible hours, staff is nice. Very reasonable and a fun enviorment to work in. Helps you gain expierence and teaches you a lot about working. I would reccomend."
good,"Kohl's in my opinion is a great place to work. They offer a range of opportunities for those who are willing to learn and take advantage of them."
good,The management and employees were great. We all worked well together to achieve the best we could do. The hardest part of the job was staying on top of everything. It is a big store and we were not always well staffed enough to make sure everything was always the best. That being said the staff worked hard to maintain a presentable store.
good,Pretty good work place to work at. Just needed to be more flexible with students.Nothing serious. The customers were abusing the yes we can policy sometimes.
good,"The coworkers and managers at kohl's have made my whole experience enjoyable. The only hard part about the job is during holiday season, as customer traffic is difficult to manage. Occasionally, multitasking comes into play and managers expect a lot from their associates. But overall, I have had a great and enjoyable experience."
good,"Kohl’s is a good company, who has the interest of its employees at heart, and always making sure that their customers have the best experience. Kohl’s is a team with incredible dynamic."
good,"I learned how to work in a fast paced environment and helped customers with their needs. A typical day at work would involve ringing customer items, bagging them, and closing the transaction."
good,"A lot of customer interaction is required at this job, need to be able to be personable and friendly. It is important that you will be able to deal with difficult customers even if you don't agree. Staff is nice and friendly to each other."
good,"I really did enjoy working at Kohls and I would of kept working there but my husband got very sick and needed to take care of him and the kids, loved the managers and other empluyees"
good,"I did like working at Kohl's just no late night childcare available at the time.  The daily task was answering inbound phone calls about credit cards, website, and Kohl's kids.  If the phones were slow there was work on address changes for customers."
good,"It was quick getting used to the flow. All the employees were very nice and managers were friendly. Training was really incomplete though, sorta just thrown into it, but it made me learn very quickly. As a high schooler the pay was really good especially during the holiday season. It was annoying though how much they pressed us to sell their credit cards."
good,Working at kohl's not only gave me experience in one department they also offered me a position in beauty which gave me the training I needed to pursue my dreams in make up I was also required to help and  work in several other departments such as Jewelry which gave more experience for any upcoming jobs in the future they  kinda let everyone branch out. We don't always work in our assigned department and that in turn gives us a better knowledge of the store's layout and helps us become familiar with certain name brand products customers could ask about. It was awesome getting to work for the company
good,Great team environment. Leaders that actually care about you as a person.  Can be a bit stressful at times but I understand that's all call centers. Great incentives.
good,Kohl’s was a great experience for me for my first job as being a floor associate and helping customers find anything they wanted. I loved working there and my coworkers were always there to help me. Great place to work
good,"I enjoyed working at Kohl’s. You get an employee discount, even on the clearance section. If working on cash register, it’s pretty competitive to get the most customers to sign up for the kohl’s card."
good,Fast paced workplace. I enjoyed working with co-workers and management. Good programs to help people with needs and a very clean environment to work inside and out.
good,"fairly easy tasks, multitasking was big as well as customer service. I liked all my managers and work wasn't something that i dreaded going to i actually looked forward to it."
good,Work was interesting and you always have something to do.  The people that I work with are usually fun to be around and make it easier to work.  Sometimes the management needs to work on communication just because it seems like some stuff is not transferred to the night staff like it should be.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Kohl's was a great place to work. It is a rather fast-paced environment and associates are often given specialized tasks upon the start of their shifts. Be sure to take breaks on time and check Customer Service for recovery frequently.
good,"Not bad, every day was repetitive but easy. Older workers make younger ones feel incompetent even though we do the same exact job and probably even work harder. Not much instruction on what your job consists of."
good,They kinda talk a lot about each other and they showed you once how to do something but I learned fast and I had coworkers who I loved to work with also
good,"It's my second job that started out as seasonal and I decided to stay on longer for the fun of it. "
good,"I worked for Kohl's for 13 years, would have continued, however, after a prior relocation, and subsequent move. I decided not to continue at the time of relocation requirement.  As with any position there were minor personality clashes! Not all issurs resolved in timely fashion. Cons:  additional duties added inadequate training of store personel. Inability to terminate abusive calls. Orignally started that we could advise customers of intentions of terminating calls if violent responses were given...Verbal abuse, totally unnecessary! We are there to help and resolve issues! Not to be abused!"
good,Teamwork is empathized a lot.  Great discounts available. 15% employee discount on top of any other coupons out to the public. Plus when theres a friends & family event its 55%.
good,Not a toxic workplace. Managers are reasonable and accommodating. They are more than willing to work with a person's realistic schedule. Clear and concise duties.
good,When working at khol's it was during the holiday season so of course it would be hectic. The managers were really supportive they made sure you got your breaks and that you were doing alright. The hardest part of the job is the layout of the store and being inside a hot store all day. They tried their best not to make it as hot as it was but it just couldn't be done.
good,"It was a good retail store to work at, and I had fun during most of my shifts. It wasn't a bad place to be, it just didn't have the energy I was looking for."
good,"Loved the management, the coworkers and the store. It’s was an enjoyable experience for me for it being my first Retail job. I recommended it to my cousin and she ended up working there as well."
good,"I enjoyed the short time I worked there as a part time /  seasonal employee. I received paid training and staff was great, would work there again if the opportunity arose."
good,"Good place to work, and great people to work with."
good,enjoyed working with the people I meet and some were very good at training with detail to information required to do my tasks. Very busy days especially during the christmas holiday. Hardest part of the job was having to do things alone when there wasn't anyone to cover the next shift. Enjoyed my supervisor and most of my co workers. Would definitely want to work there again.
good,Solid company that places a priority on their employees. Company has a solid customer base. Best suited for those leaders who can engage and inspire. Good work schedule for retail.
good,very well I enjoyed my experience and it proved to be very interesting with fast paced workers and a excellent supervisors. I got a chance to grow in a new place.
good,The role as LPO is very exciting yet dangerous. The pay does not support the job. Wage is low but the danger is high. There are not too many dull moments.
good,"I would say my overall experience at Kohl's was a good one. I spent a short time there, but the people and the environment all made it worth it. There were definitely times where I've had bad experiences with customers, but I was able to keep to calm and not take it personally. It's pretty hard to have your voice heard there, especially as a seasonal sales associate and that's one thing I didn't like about it. I don't think there was really anything that hard about my job. Everything was pretty self explanatory and was easy to pick up on. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people I enjoyed being around and overall having a good time."
good,I enjoyed who I work and the flexibility for hours. The people I worked with were always willing to help in any way they could and everyone got along well.
good,Only worked there for 2 weeks so far but I enjoy the job. I just do not get enough hours to support myself financially. I believe that is the only issue that I have. It is a very relaxing environment with very nice co workers and management.
good,Kohl’s is a very friendly work environment. It is fast past sometimes and other days it’s slow. Everyone is very cooperative and laidback. I would recommend this job to anyone.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,The staff in the two stores that I worked were engaging and dedicated to their jobs. It was fun to go to work and interact with the staff. Team work was key and practiced often.
good,"Since Kohl's was my first job, it gave me many learning experiences. If you're shy, like me, this job definitely helps to you to get out of your comfort zone. Talking to strangers wasn't my strong suit, but you'll get used to it. This job helped me achieve great customer service."
good,I was learning how to ( RF Unit Control Functions ) and ( Wrist Rocket Control Functions ). And I learned How to received and package products.How to pick products.
good,"Kohl's continues to stay current with technology and growth in the Omni industry as well as keep the Brick and mortar presence strong."
good,"a typical day of work always consisted of helping customers, It taught me how to help people in the best way. On the other hand it was also difficult dealing with customers because the store was a coupon based store, customers would get a little on the crazy side."
good,"A typical work day at Kohl's was fast paced. You started your shift and then hit the ground running. There is always something to do. I learned how to use their registers, which are more complicated than you'd think because they had two different types at the location I worked at. Management was tolerable, most of the time. They definitely worry more about making sales than anything else, but they do care a lot about employee health. They want you to take breaks and to stay hydrated. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the constant change in attention. I was constantly called away from my usual duties to do something else and it felt like I was never making progress. The best part of the job was the people. My co-workers were kind and big on team work. No one was left to brave difficulties on their own, unless there just wasn't a lot of people called in for the day."
good,"A typical work day consists of stocking, assisting customers and recovering workplace at the time of closing. Managers and employees are friendly for the most part and always willing to co-operate with one another."
good,"Management is understanding and helpful, creating a positive work environment. I help to be called back when full-time, permanent positions are available. My position was a temporary seasonal job."
good,The hardest part of the job would have to be during a sale and you have to work overnight to set up the modules and change tags but other than that its a great job to have
good,Nice job with good benefits and good hours. The people are nice and the staff give the best service in the business. Retail has never had a finer staff and collection of contributors to the common cause. Work there and you will never regret it.
good,"At kohls, once I would get to work. I would check my Emails to see if I had a certain duty that I would need to take care of soon. I would then either do what job I knew that needs done or start on the assignment that was shared with me. I would also check on associate's that were coming into work and those that are already there and make sure they know what their supposed to be doing. I would either help them or work by myself. I would do what needed done in my position till it was time for me to head to the front of the store to do my daily job of supervising the front half of the store."
good,"While I was working at Kohl's, I made friends that I kept even after leaving the company. I still keep in touch with a few of them. Their job culture is a lot like Disney in the sense that they like to say ""yes"" to the customer/guest as much as possible so they like to accommodate the guest if they can. There is very little I have to check with the supervisor in order to tell the guest ""yes."" "
good,"Everyone there is typically really friendly, there is always someone there that’s able to help when you need it, it was a fun work environment, everyone helped build each other up and supported each other."
good,"They always messed up my scheduling which made it hard to work since I am still in school, but other than that it was great. I would walk into work get ready for the day and usually start off by doing returns and resupplying the shelves."
good,I had a good time working at kohls. I really wish i couod've stayed. I enjoyed learning how departments work and giving out kohls cash to a customer. I think i may reapply.
good,"The people are nice. The managers are extremely understanding and nice and helpful. The compensation could be better, but it's a good starting wage. You get bonuses added to your paycheck every time you sign someone up for a Kohl's credit card ($1/card), so that is really motivating. I started as a seasonal employee, now I am a regular part time employee, so if you work hard, you can stay a long time in the company, especially if you are good at signing people up for credit cards."
good,"Kohl’s was a very good job. Good pay, but it was seasonal. I got to make new friends, and develop better costumer service whole doing so. I worked on cashier, and found new ways to operate it."
good,It was a great company to work for. We were usually kept busy. Employers cared about the employees and the store had primarily positive customer reviews.
good,Kohl’s is now my second job after working on gas food I wanted to work in retail to expand my experience.I love helping people find what they need and knowing they will come back just Because of your service.Khols teaches you a lot with the whole sales thing because you have to sales Kohl’s credit cards almost everyday it a great job have to keep everything neat.The managers are mostly always busy so you need to be able to pick up on things easily or even be able to yeah yourself.
good,While working at Kohl's I gained a sense of independence and freedom. I was working alone most of the time and mainly keeping the store neat yet organized.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I love working at the Kohl's.  Everyone is very nice and the managers are all hard-working and fair.  Due to customer volume, there is a lot of work to keep the floor in nice shape but most of the managers will pitch in as needed.  They set a good example for their employees. The pay is not competitive and there is no paid time off for part-time employees.  Much of the equipment is out-dated and doesn't always work which slows down the work that can be accomplished.  These are corporate issues."
good,"overall, everything was very organized and everyone was very kind. they all made me feel safe and taught me me new things everything so i was very pleased."
good,"Everyone was super nice and friendly, and you learn skills when it comes to dealing with customer service during the holidays. Management was very nice and would work with schedule."
good,During my time at Kohl's I was able to go from being just a sales associate to running the shoe department & home department along with working in the sock room which gave me a ton of experience in those fields.
good,"It was a good place to work as a seasonal worker, but I wouldn't stay there for a long time. Some of the managers were very nice and helpful while others weren't at all. They have a lot of days were they bring in food for the workers."
good,"Everyone was very friendly, but we barely made above minimum wage and there wasn't enough hours available to work. I enjoyed my time, but a constant issue with everyone was the low pay."
good,"Kohl's is a good place to work.  You can set your own availability for scheduling and they usually will follow it.  As a part-time worker, they work with me on scheduling time.  I enjoy the management staff and the other employees.  They are always doing special little things for their employees."
good,This was a seasonal job and it was perfect. I liked the people that I worked with and it worked well with my schedule and social life. Only time it got busy was on Black Friday.
good,Kohl’s was a decent place to work. I didn’t mind working there. The employee discount was great and the management was decent. The only problem was the amount of hours received. They do not give many hours a week. You are likely to get only 10-12 hours.
good,"Kohl's was an excellent place to work and was decently located. The hours/shifts were convenient for a great work-life balance, if that's what you desired."
good,"I learned patience, at least with people, while working at Kohl's. It was my first time in retail and I learned how to stock and talk to customers. I failed at times, but I did okay."
good,In my opinion I think that Kohl’s offers many great opportunities to young individuals looking for their first job. They pay is way above minimum wage at $9.50
good,During my time at Kohl’s I was able to get out of my comfort zone. I was able to reach over 100 credits within a eight months of working there.  I met some pretty cool people.  The managers were mostly kind.  I thought it was a good first job  to start off with .
good,"They start you out with decent pay. I really enjoyed working for them throughout the years. The people were okay to work with, it did seem like this place breeds dram though. I didn't like how they would keep adding on responsibilities to job title without increasing your pay. Overall it was decent but not a forever job. Was glad to have it when I needed it though."
good,Kohl's was a great place to work and would recommend working there.  The management team at Kohl's were great to work with.  Pay was average for the type of work.  Would go back if given the right opportunity.
good,"This was a good place for a college age job. Flexible hours, discounts, and friendly atmosphere. Full time wages were low at the time I worked there. Good place to work with class schedules."
good,"Very flexible work schedule"
good,"Good company to work for, but the local facility (Desoto, TX) has a lot of turnover.  Senior management out of touch with employees.  Peak season is a chaotic environment."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I worked at the Kohl's department store in Brick, NJ...first in the shoe department...later I transferred into Loss Prevention as an office and as a supervisor.  It was a good work environment with support from other employees, management and supervisors."
good,I enjoyed my job and the people as well. the shift always went fast never nothing to do. Management was great and customers were great. There was a lot of different culture there.
good,Loading 10-15 trucks at a time can be challenging but I managed to make it happen. Time went fast with all the work that was provided and I enjoyed it very much.
good,"Typical day was overall appearance of the store. putting back returns, and helping customers find things they need. Occasionally putting out stock or assisting on the registers. Folding and cleaning up all of the childrens and home department"
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my time at Kohl's! It can (of course) get crazy at times, especially at the Customer Service desk, but it is a fun place to work. The people are fantastic, as was the management. Only reason I left was due to a volunteer program that takes up a LOT of my time."
good,"I loved this for a part time job while in college. Flexible hours, and a fun, fast-paced environment. However the pay is poor regardless of ones effort and commitment to the company. For this reason I left."
good,Friendly fellow associates. Great customer interactions. helping customers find whatever they are looking for. great way to improve sales and customer service skills. plus there is a generous associate discount.
good,the people are friendly and helpful. There is a lot of things that needs to be done. sometimes it can be hard work. Not everyone that works there is helpful and outgoing
good,"I worked there for 4 years, and it was the perfect first job. The pay jump from $7.25/hr to $9/ hr one year was great, but it's only gone up by 9 cents each year, since then. For someone who doesn't have bills, the pay is fine; but if you have an adult life, you might want to use this as a 2nd job. Sadly, this was the cause for my leaving. "
good,"I ran register, greeted customer, and put merchandise back. It focused a lot on getting customer to sign up for charge cards. The staff and management were very helpful with meeting customer service."
good,"Customer Services is always busy which makes the day go by quickly. "
good,"Kohl's helped you understand the customer, show empathy and concern.  It pushed you to do better and it allows you to grow as a person.  dealing with people is a hard task and Kohl's can and will mold you for the world, if you allow it."
good,"I would highly recommend anybody that's looking for their first job, second part-time job, or even holiday seasonal job. Friendly staff and management."
good,"My experience at Kohls was a good one"
good,"I would clock in, get a bluebird and walkie talkie, sign into the bluebird with my Kohl's associate number and password, and start processing online orders and any buy online pick up in store  orders. During the holidays and can get super busy."
good,I really enjoyed working at Kohls. The management was great. My co workers were helpful. I loved the employee discounts. The job was not hard at all. The only bad thing was the pay rate.
good,I enjoyed my time with Kohl's because of the associates at the store. The job is not boring and fast-paced. There is a family culture and management was okay.
good,I was paid minimum wage and had no benefits.The discount was 15% off all items except name brands. Most managers were nice except they were strict. I worked holidays and it was super busy and messy.
good,I unload truck. I also do shopping when I am need.  It is a good place to work if yu don't have any bills. They don't have much work. But overall it's an good job.
good,"very competitive "
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I like working at Kohl’s. The work space is fun and inviting, as well as the people who work there. Yes, there are some slow days just like at any job but it’s a great place to work."
good,Started as a temp job for the holidays and I was offered a permanent job. Work culture was nice and so were the other employees. Management was also very nice and the discounts were great.
good,"Great benefits and people to work with"
good,"i learned a lot working at Kohls, the only problem is that they don't give you much room to grow or get promoted. It's a fun environment and all manager are really nice"
good,It was fun to open a brand new location.  Never enough staff on the floor.  Constantly messy and not enough staff to help clean.  Everything was about getting credit applications.
good,"I would work with the public and that was fun. I learned a lot on the computer with returns, working with all the coupons, rewards points. Kohl's is a good company to work for they have benefits, they make sure you kept current with all company policies. They also encouraged strong employee relations and team work."
good,Good seasonal job.  Expected shifts.  Good working conditions.  Friendly atmosphere.  Great employee discounts. Good training for job.  Black Friday was a great experience.
good,I really enjoyed my time at Kohls.Great management team and associate.I was promoted 2 times and learned alot from working with the management team I would not have succeeded  if it wasn't for the great training they provided.
good,Kohl's is a very team oriented company. Employees are expected to be friendly and cooperative with customers. The company puts a lot of emphasis on their credit card and ask cashiers to ask every customer. Schedules are flexible.
good,"I started my career in an entry-level position and steadily increased my salary as I moved roles. The culture is definitely family oriented, and the company ensured the values of the organization are known and followed. Compensation is fair, I enjoyed working here."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of helping customers find the items they were looking for. I would also ring the customers up with their items, I would ask if they had a kohl charge card and if they didn't I would ask if they would like to sign up for one. I would also stock shelves and help with inventory."
good,This was a very productive environment to work in. The managers were good and didbthere job the way they should. It was a pleasant please to work at..
good,"Very family oriented seasonal job, close knit company, very friendly working environment, employees and management were helpful and guided their employees throughout their journey."
good,"Maybe the best workplace environment, that I have ever been in. Very helpful employees who were genuine all across the board.I would have loved to stay, but do to personal matters. I could not remain employed there."
good,While face paced it was a very friendly environment and well organized. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep my section clean. I learned how to have better management skills to better help the customer.
good,Good management. Spend alot of time working with cutomers. Learned good customer service skills. Spend alot of time at register. Not bad workplace culture
good,"Everyone was fantastic and nice and the pay was good, I just relocated and needed to switch jobs. No overall complaints. Worked truck, was not that difficult."
good,"A typical day at Kohl's involved meeting and greeting customers, assisting them in finding the products they need.   The hardest part of this job was knowing the stores entire inventory.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction gained from helping customers find what they wanted."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Management is awesome an d fun to work with. They're very flexible and understanding of your needs. They always make employees feel appreciated and give out lots of recognition.  They are always doing nice things for employees like pizza parties and they always have tons of snacks and food for employees in the break room. Sometimes they have special days where you can come in wearing a team jersey, or plaid days, and they always give you a nice card for your birthday."
good,"Stressful environment, but it gives you the opportunity to learn how to style and put different types of clothes together, and still make it look very appealing."
good,I enjoyed working for this company. Each work day bought excitement. You were always learning something new. The hardest part of the day was wrapping up the waves before next shift. But seeing the end results was great satisfaction.
good,"Overall a great place to work at to become"
good,"Always look forward to work, the people I work with make a huge difference."
good,Very friendly environment to work meet new people great customer service teaches you good time management and how to present offers going in inside the store and sale them
good,Great place to start off.. Wonderful team... Clean work place ..great discounts... Family   friendly... I loved the little time I did work there very fun place
good,"This job wasn't my first or ideal choice but I learned quite a bit about the operations of the retail industry.  Personally, a good employer for those getting their foot into retail."
good,As my first job at 19 years old it was a great way to get my foot in the door. It has been some years since i worked at kohls but i would return give the chance.
good,"Great place to work, a lot of opportunity, very engaging , work life balance. "
good,"Great environment . Always met with smiling faces. Also, there was always a room for you to improve and gain more experience. My favorite part was meeting the staff."
good,Good place to work with very friendly coworkers. The hours were very flexible and would recommend for anyone as a first job for its hands on training.
good,Great place to work. Though I was a freight unloader and an inventory stocker I still had fun because the managers gave me enough inspiration to keep working. I had to do a lot of things at Kohls but the kindness and pay made it worth while.
good,Kohl’s is a good job to get a start out in the workforce.  Gives you customer service experience and register experience.  Teammates are very friendly and willing to help.
good,"seasonal u get your hours "
good,"needed more oreintation to jelwery department, I had no experience and no personnel use of jelwery.   Asked for another position as a chashier but none available, even explained my no experience or personel use of jelwery."
good,"Great for a part time job in my senior year of high school. Flexible hours and upbeat management and coworkers. Most of the sales associates are also young adults, not much room for promotion or growth in this environment. Very much a ""revolving door"" job, typical of retail."
good,"The staff was extremely warm and welcoming and the customers always came back for more, the shoe department kept me on my toes and busy at all times. Loved working here."
good,"I have worked at Kohl's different times in my life.  They have always taken me back with open arms and positive attitudes.  My co-workers are like a big family.  Some you love and others you don't, but they are family."
good,It was really enjoyable. The team dynamic is very great and effective when it comes to working in the freight department of Kohl's. I would recommend this job to others.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"It was a great place to work. my coworkers were very nice and helpful. the managers were also very nice and helpful. it was a pretty easy job, it did get boring at times though."
good,"The real killers are boredom and foot/back pain after a long shift. Great co-workers, but the job itself isn't to be taken lightly. Very flexible hours and shifts."
good,Probably my favorite job besides my current job now. Management and the employees were amazing. It was fast paced and times but also relaxing. I would work here again and recommend Kohl's to anyone.
good,"I came on Kohl's as a season associate and stayed on part-time while I finished my certification for a social work license. Good atmosphere and management. Fair treatment, open door policy, helpful associates."
good,"A typical day at work was cleaning out one to three fitting rooms out. I would organize the clothes by brand and put them back out on the floor, assisting with any customer questions and calls. The management team was excellent! They all where there to help me if  needed it, along with also asking me to extend my hours as a part time associate. My coworkers where all very nice, outgoing people, also offering a helping hand when needed. Personally, I feel the hardest part of the job was finding where everything belongs, and getting used to how often they changed the display. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help out a customer!"
good,"In charge of merchandising for five store locations for apparel and hardlines departments. Maintained visual consistency in all stores for interior, art graphics, lighting, fashion, and seasonal trends. Implemented all displays in store windows, signage, platforms, shelf-uppers, and jewelry cases in a highly artistic flair. "

good,"Was nice working at KOHL'S . i worked on the floor, registers and customer device. Most mangers were nice and some not so nice. all of the coworkers were great and most customers were great."
good,"I generally worked 8 hours a day, five days a week.  The job consisted of putting out stock, creating display, floor moves, ticketing merchandise, setting up sales, organizing stock, doing markups and markdowns, making lists of  key items and best sellers, and ordering new stock for fill-ins.  I also trained  new employees"
good,i worked part time and pretty much got to pick my own days to work.  work was fairly easy pay was decent for the work.  Nice break rooms.  pretty laid back.
good,Great place to work as a student. They accommodate student schedules with little to no hassle.  There are many incentives during the peak season to work nights and weekends.
good,Great please to work at lots of very nice people and the environment is always great. It’s an ideal place to be a part of. You would love it everyone has the mindset of growth.
good,I give four stars because it was overall a good place to work and didn’t mind going and it was a relaxed atmosphere and if I had to do it again I would
good,Working a khols was a very nice experience. it i stress free and very productive. Management was always available when needed. workplace culture was very unique and diverse. As in any ob the hardest part was on busy days but nothing serious. everything was cool about this job nice and smooth. Really enjoyed working here.
good,"At C.S  it is always busy so you need to be able to multitask and have a fast pace. When you are not assisting a customer there are mark downs to be done, damages, counter damages."
good,"Providing customer service regarding collection issues, review account adjustments, resolve client discrepancies and short payments.  Reconcile customer disputes as they pertain to payment of outstanding balances that are due"
good,I enjoyed working in this environment. The coworkers were fun to be around and the managers were very relatable and understanding. They allowed me to be in charge of different projects with little guidelines so that I got to do what I wanted within reason. I was also allowed to experience different positions when requested and trained adequately for each change.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I worked in both the home dept and kids dept. along with a back up cashier. my job was to kept the dept clean , down stock when possible, help guest find product and answer questions or check other stores for inventory.  The hardest part of my job would be to keep up on the fitting rooms if the person before me didn't keep it clean before my shift would start. and the most enjoyable part of my job was the friends I made both associates and just guest that would come in and we hit it off."
good,Checking stock and replenishing anything that needs to be filled. Talking and interacting with customers to insure they are being helped in the right manner.
good,"I usually work for approximately 2 hrs, 4 days a week. I manage the closing out of the previous sale day. I have learned to manage my time effectively and improved on my math skills. We are able to work independently or collectively, were we have the freedom to use our own judgment."
good,One of my biggest achievements was oversaw the security of stocked items. it was my responsibility to attach security senor to all the items as they arrived at the store
good,This job allowed for many advanced opportunity. I was able to move to all department until i found what suited me. I was allowed very flexible hours and was given time off when asked.
good,Easy place to work. Everybody has even work duties. Everyone had a smile on their face everyday. Great 2nd or first job for any type of person. They do work on some holidays.
good,Great start job. Easy to learn duties and great people experience. The variety of roles makes it exciting to go to work. Each shift is full of various jobs and constant customer service.
good,great work enviroment and great people to work with a lot fast pace also very interesting place to work at it a cool place to get experience and learning more about working at a clothing store.
good,"I was a temporary employee at Kohls for the 2017 holiday season and they were flexible, kind, courteous and a great place to work for! They offered great incentives for reaching store goals and made each employee feel as though they were working for a team and that if they did well, the team did well, without pressuring anyone or placing unnecessary stress on the employees."
good,Not sure why I left loved the work place environment loved the people our team and leaders and the break room and the cafeteria  above all was great and friendly
good,"Working at Kohls is a good job to have, especially as a starting job and as part-time. For me, i love my co-workers and managers. Thats what makes this job so enjoyable for me. Plus working retail there is never a dull moment."
good,"Was one of the best jobs i had everyone was nice and helpful to eachother, the training is not the best but you learn real quick. The Management is great and understanding if you have something going on in your life it really becomes a family.  Its a great part time job."
good,I enjoyed Kohl's.  I worked there for 10 years and the management staff was very accomodating.  I left the company for personal reasons and they were understanding.
good,"I`ve learned so many things here like recovery,cash register and entertaining customers.I`m enjoying my job here so far and my co-workers are friendly."
good,A typical day at work consists of folding clothes/recovering your assigned department. You bring out the go backs every few hours and assist customers with what they need throughout your shift.
good,"I unloaded the truck at kohls.  This was lifiting sometimes heavy boxes, but mostly clothes and sorting them by their category.  It was a pretty straightforward job.  The truck showed up and we unloaded it.  Worked with great people."
good,"Kohl's was a very relaxing retail job that i would love to go back to. Only thing i did not like was working at night. The register was sort of difficult to work with but as you be on the register more and more its easy to handle. The customers was a little rude but as much rude as a fast food place. My duty was working in the panty and bra section making sure they were in the right place, and placed on a rack nice and neat also make sure the dressing rooms were clean."
good,"Ok place to work but was given better pay and benefits with Ford.  But issues when you have a child with asthma and family, Ford not a family based place."
good,The only thing I would have to say is they could distribute more hours. But I also understand that this job is based on volume. If the volume isn’t there then there is no work. But it is a great environment to work in and a great job to have
good,"•	Develop client’s basic living skills (social, domestic, and hygiene) through instruction and encouragement. "
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Working at Kohl's required the ability to be very flexible and cope with many different situations. Coming to work every day was a different experience because one moment one could be working in sales and visual organization and the next minute you could be restocking merchandise. The job was full of important virtues and lessons regarding punctuality, good sportsmanship, teamwork, being resourceful and learning good customer service skills."
good,"Although I only worked here short term, it was just that. A nice job for college kids to do part time and still make money on a flexible shift. Difficult to move up but a good part time."
good,This place a is a great place to work at if you are attending college or have another job else where.  The atmosphere is exciting and fun while still straight and to the point.
good,"I love working at Kohl's! The co-workers are great, I get great deals, and they are always encouraging. The pay and the hours are the only things I can say bad about working at Kohl's."
good,"I have learn a lot from my manager and still advancing."
good,"Good discounts but hours were sucky , had a fun time working there but its only as a side job if u dont get that many hours especially as a cashiers .."
good,Everyone worked as a team to conduct business and help the customers. There was great teamwork where the managers would pinch in and help to motivate and pick up where there was need of help.
good,Loved working there but was only there for the summer and for some reason when I relocated back to Miami I could not transfer back to Kohls and therefore stopped employment.
good,"After working at Kohl's for 7 years I can say that it was an all-around good first step into the workforce.  As an associate, it is easy to move around, to try different departments and see what you like best.  After working for them for so long, I have done almost everything that was available to me with the exception of becoming a supervisor or manager.  Some positions I chose while others I was placed into.  The managers at my location were open to their associates and willing to be flexible with about 2 weeks of notice.  "
good,typical workday consist of calling customers to collect and help them pay off debt also keeping their information confidential.  You can take a break at anytime you would like and lunches are scheduled. Management is pretty good as well.
good,"Everyone was nice and helpful. Training could have been better but given the time of year it was understandable. "
good,This company was great to work for. Kept you on your feet. Had a fun time. Good break periods. You have a lot of work to do but it is worth it. Good company. Lots of fun.
good,"It was a good experience to have during my 3 to 4 years of working here it was fun, but it is time for a change to pursue for more of a full time position"
good,Working with the customer service team in the store to ensure that all customers needs or complaints were being addressed. Also made sure the merchandising and promotional sales were accurate and followed by the sales clerks.
good,The workplace culture at Kohl's is everyone help everyone. People from each department always come together to get the job done. Whether it be helping out a customer or helping out each other when trying to leave for the night. All employees come together at the end of the night to clean up the store and get it looking great for the team coming in the next morning.
good,I helped to set the store up and was able to learn the process.  Great supervisors that were always there when I had a question or need some assistance on a busy shift.
good,"not very long hours, pay is good for the work but the positions are not made for a career job for the youth of today. very fun work environment and the employees are great"
good,"Working in the Kohl's Department improves my communication skill, and at the same time, it motivates me about getting additional degrees with the choice of Early Childhood Development. I made this choice because of having the experience in being a Early Childhood Teacher and Elementary School Teacher."
good,Very flexible hours while you are in school or working another job. Great associate discount. Long hours during the holiday season. Busy and fast pace during the holidays.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Fast paced, crazy busy after Thanksgiving through New Year's. Everyday is different, always something new. Offers a flexible schedule, so its great place for a second job."
good,Kohl's is excellent place for work. The environment is very friendly and helpful. The associates are very helpful. All the managers very helpful too. I liked very much working at kohl's.
good,"Khols is good fast work place , that pays good . You can choose from over night and day shift . The staff is real cool and the managing team is too. Khols is good joe for people of all ages .high school to college kids all can find a good work home at khols"
good,"I worked for kohls dc for over 10 years the work is fast paced so time is very fast 10hrs shifts 4 days a week, I liked the people and the work staff, but the, they will use you and don't want to pay you for your work, even hard to get a raise."
good,fun work culture with interesting tasks. helped me to learn more about customer service and dealing with difficult customers. Management was supportive.
good,"It's not the worst place to work but I've seen reviews where people think that. It can be pretty fun and I enjoy the people I work with which helps. The pay is decent and they always work around my schedule since i'm still in school. If you work register you'll be required to push credit. I don't mind it but some days when we're not making goal, the managers will constantly nag on the radio and have even called some people out in front of everyone."
good,Good opportunity especially as a first job. Relatively relaxed workplace as long as you get your work done correctly. Hardest part is usually customers but dealing with customers is a valuable skill in any line of work so this will help with that in the future.
good,"I liked working at Kohl's, it was a great job and I wish I didn't leave. I loved my store manager and I would give her the highest complement. She was so helpful and nice."
good,"Working at kohl's i very valuable, they will teach you many necessary skills to propel you into a nice salary. "
good,its a great seasonal job and pay if fine with incentives thru the holidays .i learned how to use rf scanners with this company work is easy and fun ..
good,I loved Kohls everyone became family the work was hard but honest. I had a few friends who worked with me. It never felt like work because someone always had a story about their life to share
good,"Kohl's is a simpler job, exactly what you would expect from retail. It highly depends store to store what your experience will be. If you do well and what your managers ask, your job will tend to be easier."
good,The job is good for people that only want to limit their income and themselves. No chance for opportunity and they are strict. This place would not be good to work at.
good,"I worked during the evening and late night hours, so it was very quiet and enjoyable. It worked with my family schedule. I learned how to be patient while working with customers, how to sort out problems and look up things customers needed. The fellow employees were very kind and enjoyable to work with. The hardest part would probably be rush hour times, where lines were long and customers got impatient."
good,"The environment was very welcoming from day one and the managers tended to check in often to make sure everything was going well. As my first job, it provided me basic skills that I can apply to other jobs."
good,Khols was a nice place to work at. They definitely treat each other like a team. There is very little gossip and the team culture is why i liked working there.
good,"this was my first retail job and my main department was shoes and it was laid back "
good,"I wasnt at Khols for that long, maybe a few months. It was a temporary/seasonal job. The manager was friendly and helpful. It was pretty busy during the holiday season but that is to be expected."
good,"Kohls helped position me with opportunities to advance with my personal nd professional development.  Benefits are a huge plus.  Thanksgiving to Christmas are the longest of days, but it comes with the job."
good,Fast pace easy job you jus have to wear comfortable shoes. Managers was nice understanding and always checked in on us.I like that's they let you work all the overtime you want.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,i loved working there to bad it was only seasonal. they help use to understand thing when need help we could where blue jeans just long we were will keep and look good
good,Kohl's had a great environment to work in with great people. The only down side was that you are usually working on your own in your specific department. I feel as though they don not hire many people sales associates because they are too worried about hiring more point of sale associates to boost credit sales.
good,"At first, Kohl's was awesome - great benefits and work environment and opportunities for overtime shifts during holidays. But new general manager came and was not so nice."
good,"We go to a start up meeting to get an assignment, most days if I start one area they will move me to another spot. They know they can send some people anywhere, and will do so if needed, especially if others are struggling in other areas."
good,"No review to be given at this time. Provided answers to the required questions help to cover explain the culture, work/life balance and typical day at kohl's."
good,very laid back but responsible work environment. managers care and listen to your concerns. freedom to make my own schedule and work alone without tedious direction.
good,"This was a good place to work while I was in high school, but I don't think I could work there as a college student. They are flexible with hours and time off, but I'd have to work a lot or get a second job to be able to afford an apartment. Moving up from a Sales Associate is difficult. You have to wait for an opening in one of the Supervisor positions and then be a supervisor for a while to be moved up to a manager, and that's still only if a position opens up. Overall, I enjoyed working there. The people are nice and I made some good friends."
good,I enjoy most parts of my job but there would  keep on adding task to my job even when I would say i don't have time not for more task. I did not fill like management is listing to you.
good,"everyone knows each other, we are a big family. if you need help, it is not a hassle to get it, and everyone is just really friendly even on their bad days"
good,its a great place to work.. I love the experience. It helped me grow.. and become the person I am today.. Thank you soo much.. I hope you have good salesmans like me..
good,Easy work to do. Keeps you busy all day. Good amounts of breaks. Occasionally food in the break room. Nice coworkers and understanding managers. I would work here again.
good,"They are all about customer service. You have to leave your problems at the door because when you walk through the doors, it is all about the customer."
good,"The experience depends on the manager and the kind of customers you encounter. They are very heavy on receiving credit daily for cashiers. Yet, you easily create new friends."
good,It was hard at first. My wife and I had a 1 year old son and she was pregnant with our daughter when I started with the company. Getting up at 3:30am to get to work was a challenge because I always made an effort to lighten the load for my wife before arriving at work on time. Being able to work freight daily was medicine for my mind and spirit.
good,"It is a great company to work for.  Good office culture, the people are great and  management is very solid.  Kohl's is making great moves in the retail industry.  You will not regret working there."
good,Fast paced and diverse workplace. During my time there employees and management were always welcoming and made working and enjoyable time. Great experience to see what teamwork culture should be like.
good,Was a good company to work for people was nice just didn't get any hours everyone who worked there was on part time but working full time hours with no benefits
good,i loved every minute i spent there. i would go back if i needed to get back into retail. the people i worked with were great and the job itself wasn't too hard.
good,good company to work flexible with hours and curteaous to when you need time off I recommend this job to anybody who loves working with people and helping customer
good,"Customer service is number 1 while also adhering to policies. You must solicit credit and rewards, and be knowledgeable about coupons, discounts and exclusions."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Management provides employees with the tools to be successful."
good,Would recommend. I enjoyed working here. Great discounts and very easy going coworkers. Friendly environment. Easy work and fun. The hardest part was convincing people to apply for kohls charge card. At Kohls you get graded on how often you get customers to apply for one and the better you do the better raises and benefits you get.
good,This has been a wonderful place at which I spent my time.  I enjoyed showing up each and every day and I would highly recommend others to visit and have their own experience.
good,I enjoy working at Kohls.  I have encountered a good relationship with my upper management and peers.  My skills assets has improved and I have gained more knowledge working in my field
good,Fast paced especially during the holidays. sometimes long hours if closing due to helping recover the store. staff is very friendly and helpful. management is willing to help out if you need it.
good,"Processing and managing all products to go to sales floor "
good,Very flexible and understanding environment good benefits.  Gives of a very family orientated vibe. Close knit working staff and customers. Common to have past workers still come in and rave about the environment and merchandise.
good,"When you have to work and your options are limited, Kohls is one of the best places to work.  Diverse tasks prevent boredom.  Great schedule flexibility for single mom."
good,I love working here. The work flow is really nice and smooth. The people are so friendly and helpful and amazing. This was definitely a great first job.
good,"I needed a place that could provide flexible hours and work around my hectic school schedule, in which case Kohl's delivered. Be prepared to be educated on additional departments in the store so that they can rely on you when it is short staffed. Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for part-time work, or even career opportunities."
good,Working in the Loss Prevention Department is competitive with a lot of focus on making your goal of 1 apprehension for every 30-40 hours worked.  This is not difficult as Kohl's does give you the tools needed to make this happen.
good,I was a seasonal employee I worked harder than most. I knew the most. several managers told me I'd be kept past season but because the only manager who apparently mattered I never worked with I wasn't kept but three people out of the 10 chosen to stay told the managers months before hand that they didn't want to stay past season. Turns out they did it by who sold the most Kohls charges but I was rarely put on p.o.s  but that was because i was flexible and had open availability so I worked almost everything. But they just had to keep a friend of mine who ended up having to quite because she told them she couldn't stay because she had no availability.
good,"It was stressful at times but had all the employees helping out when they can. I learn a lot about what the thieves would come in and take.It was mainly make up, shoes, and Nike apparel."
good,I made some amazing friends working at Kohls.  I am so blessed that I was an employee there for so long.  I enjoyed the work I did and the people I worked with.
good,A place where you stay busy and always have something to do. Fun and busy environment especially during the holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you know it is going to be a busy day because it keeps you moving and the time goes faster. If you are not sure about something there is always someone there to help you.
good,"Good place to work at, especially holiday times if you're looking for something temporary. Employee discounts plus Kohls coupons and their rewards card is an awesome benefit for holiday shopping"
good,"I loved working at kohls it was friendly enviorment everyone was grate good discounts ...."
good,Overall a great place to work. As a part time and full time employee your hours were never guaranteed. Shift changes make it hard when having a small child
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,A typical day at Kohl's is face paced. It depends if it is during the holidays where there are great sales or not. The customers may not be the easiest to work with but coworkers and managers will train you to make the process easier. The most challenging part of the job is at the end of the night people do not have a concern of those managing the fitting room and it can tough. The good thing is there is a support system that will help you get it done.
good,"Worked by myself but it was always relaxing on the slow days but on the busy days, managers or supervisors would provide help for you so you can focus on getting your job done, always friendly, always helpful."
good,"enjoyed customer service interaction with clients"
good,I've enjoyed working here.  No issues with building leadership.  Peak season hours building up to Christmas are ridiculously long but rest of year is fine.
good,I was amazed at the amount of training all employees went through prior to being put on the sales floor to deal with customers.  Kohl’s is a great company to work for
good,I first started out as a seasonal hire and within 4 months I had been promoted to area supervisor which was great for someone at their first job. The best part was meeting new people and getting to help people find what they were looking for. The hardest part was definitely the holidays with the overwhelming crowds and late night shoppers but I still enjoyed my job and kept a smile on my face the entire time.
good,"I was hired for seasonal help and they kept me on. I did look for other work since they only pay minimum wage, however, if you want a no pressure fun place that only works you about 10-20 hours a week, then check out Kohl's."
good,I enjoy working for Kohl's.They have a flexible schedule and management is great. I want to keep working there as a part time cashier.................
good,Good employer though very strict on rules.   Can use you to work 12 hours shift one week then 4 hour the next. as a supervisor the job is recommended but not as a associate
good,"I currently work here and love the environment. My only issue is that they tend to move you from department to department even if you feel uncomfortable or have no experience in the certain department. I was made to climb ladders when I felt uncomfortable. Just be willing to do whatever, whenever."
good,"Kohls was a great start to learn about retail. There were days were it was busy, and non-busy. It helped me learn a lot on how to deal with customers."
good,It was really nice working their everyone was friendly was upset when they didn't keep me after Christmas because I left my job in hopes to continue Working their
good,"My experience at Kohl's was a great one from start to finish."
good,I would come in get a headset. Look to see what dressing room I would be asked to help in. If the lines got busy I would help with the cashier. Everything was pretty easy.
good,I love my job here and would love to continue working here for a little longer but find myself seeking new employment because the hours are few and the pay is just above minimum wage making it hard to pay basic bills.
good,Good place to gain interpersonal and organizational skills. Great for college and high school students. Management worked with my schedule and adjusted as needed.
good,"It was a great place to work nothing hard very laid back and calm, great customers, loved going into work each and everyday for my shift, loved the place"
good,"The team members of Kohl's are all very competent and friendly. I receive a generous hourly wage as well as a sufficient number of weekly scheduled time. All in all, I would recommend this corporation to anyone looking for a great place of employment."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Working at Kohl's was a great first retail job. There was always something to do whether you're on the sales floor or on the cash register. It's kinda slow and the music sucks but besides that, it was a great place to work."
good,"I loved working at kohls, everyone was so accepting to the new people, There was only one mager i didnt really like, she was always hateful and judgemental."
good,This was my first job and I learned so much here! I got put in the customer service department so it was a great learning experience for future jobs involving customer service.
good,They was honest during the hiring process. This was a very demanding job until you got us to it then it wasn't to bad. All the people where nice and very helpful.
good,"One of the most crazy days we have had it was stressful overwhelming but we all worked as a team and got the job done.  My manager fed everyone througought the day as well , i highly recommend working at kohls !"
good,"Helps with people skills, positive working environment, and decent pay.Management is great for the most part, and your co-workers are generally nice people and fun to work with."
good,you meet new wonderful people there everyday. your work life will always be interesting and during the holiday time hours is limitless. even when it is quite their is always something for you to do or learn. you do not just stick to your job title. you are dabbling in every department.
good,"The environment is great, welcoming, and quick paced. All employees were nice with customer service and know how to work as a whole. Our main goal was to focus on great customer service!"
good,It is a great company to work for if you apply yourself and work hard.They give raises based upon your performance level.I was able to advance to a supervisor position after starting out as a customer service representative.
good,I liked my job just could of had more hours to work per week. Nice management and are willing to work with u in difficult times . They have great communication .
good,Very nice and clean work place. Management was on point an fair when it came to giving hours to whom ever wanted to work. The benefits was not all that pleasant but it was duable.
good,My fellow co-workers were very helpful and very nice. My manager was great and I like the discounts that they offered. I was always moving and hardly never stopped moving.
good,my job part was pretty easy all i did was stock items back in the warehouse and brought some back that needed to be packed and shipped out............................
good,I took this part time job because it worked well with my school schedule. Within my time there I was promoted to be an OMNI lead and had my own team during the holidays. This is a place best suited for college students.
good,"In my department we work 10 hours a day, 4 days a week. I like working from 6 am to 4 pm. We get experience in all departments, when other departments need assistance & we get 15% discounts on merchandise, even if the merchandise is on sale, etc."
good,Knowledge that the job is temporary allows for a much more relaxed environment where the majority of the staff were able to relax and collaborate well.
good,There are days where it is fast paced and days that are slow paced. The manager is easy going. They train you on the registers and you have to ask to be customer service trained when it isn't too busy. They're flexible with hours and days off.
good,"Kohls was a great experience hoping to be called next season. I unloaded trucks, hung/folded clothes,  restocked the sales floor and others the people were awesome."
good,"Kohl’s is a very productive job and I was able to engage with different customers about their concerns. My duties involved stocking products, clothes, and managing the cash register for transactions. All in all it was a good job."
good,"This was a good place for seasonal work. It was fast-paced and competitive, but everyone was respectful. Managers were fair and gave everyone a opportunities to do well."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Kohls is a good place to learn and grow, when I was employed I left because all positions became stagnant and no body was moving up so no promotions and I needed to move up. Other than that, really good place to get started."
good,"Kohl's EFC2 was a great place to work as far as warehousing goes as long as your meeting your expectation goals we had 20 minute breaks, big lunch room with plenty of microwaves,fridges and vending machines, good co workers and managements along with huge discounts and incentives they give out throughout the season overall it was one of the best warehouses I've worked seasonal and would would highly recommend if you are looking for a warehouse job."
good,Fast-faced. Keep up with workloads. Constantly reports to supervisor. Work as a team. Schedule to work alone; no supports. Training for new task is most enjoyable part of the job.
good,the job atmosphere was laid back yet sophisticated and punctual as well as other coworkers always were warm and welcomed all customers and co workers with a great attitude.
good,"Kohl's is a nice place to work. I worked as a Picker and a packer, I loved both positions because I stayed busy so the time would fly by. Only thing I don't like is after peck the hours drop from 12 plus overtime to under 4 hours a day."
good,"Store meetings, checking sales.  Weekly, Quarterly and seasonal reports.  10 departments and up to 211 employees.  Scheduling all departments for hours to meet store needs from open to close and still stay within payroll budget.  HR and Logistics.  Managing people and work tasks.  Customer Service and Satisfaction."
good,At Kohls it was nice until I was forced to make people apply for their credit cards. when you dont get people to apply for them you get less hours and by then your hours get dropped less and less. by the end you could be working anywhere from one to three days a week.
good,The part-time associate position offers great flexibility to pick your own availability and request time off. Overall a great way to make some money while you're pursuing other things like a degree.
good,"Management was willing listen easy talk to . People was helpful, the hardest part was stacking correctly on pallet the most enjoyable was meeting the people"
good,"The highlight of my time at Kohl's was working with the incredible people on staff. I truly enjoyed spending time with everyone while just running around the store or going into recovery. My managers were just amazing, too."
good,"Working at the cash register taught me hands on skills applicable in real-live situations. Healthy competition was encouraged, while everyone strived for excellence. Everyone was rewarded cooperatively as well as individually"
good,Id have to say this was a great fast paced retail job where I could gain customer relationships to keep the job interesting and fun.I had a great tore manager.
good,"I enjoyed my time while working at Kohl's.  Management was willing to be flexible with my demanding college schedule.  I learned customer service, merchandising, floor organization and strengthened my team work skills.  It was a great part-time job that allowed me to earn a respectable salary while studying for my Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from NDSU."
good,"Co workers are very friendly and helpful. Managers are understanding of situations from home or vehicle, especially during poor weather. Managers do ask about their employees."
good,Worked in IT sector. Good working environment. But the projects will be always for short term which is risk as there is chance of releasing people at ant time.
good,i think for the most part Kohl's was not a bad job they were a great family  and were good at team work in every situation like holidays or if it was just to help costumers.
good,management is great to work for if you like to go places kohl's is the place to work. they have an in company fund raiser that is for a great cause that not many businesses have which is very nice.
good,"Working at kohls was great. I did not get enough hours, however, I enjoyed my employee discount. The managers there were great I just needed a minimum of 40 hours per week."
good,The pay is great especially in peak. You have to be on it. You get to 30 minutes breaks. It’s pretty chill. They laid back on the dress code. Pretty easy place to work.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Kohls is a great place to work because they work with your schedule. Kohls associates are required to deliever great customer service. It is a very optimistic and energetic place to work.
good,"Very quicker paced and busy all the time, they do expected a lot from one person sometimes but its is a great place to work. Kohls allows you to learn to work the whole stores so you won't know."
good,"The work was relatively easy, and the managers love to give a helpful had if need be. There was always help if there was a problem. That is why Kohl's is a great company"
good,A typical day at Kohl's is busy. I learned how to juggle varying tasks at once and persuade customers to open a Kohl's credit card. Management put a lot of pressure on cashiers to sell customers on the Kohl's credit card. Workplace culture was competitive and overwhelming. The hardest part of the job was successfully completing a task before getting pulled away into an entirely different task. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting a discount on store items.
good,Wont get alot days if u dont work right . but overall like i said its a good place to work temporary for the holidays when u need a good check with enough hours but ALWAYS CHECK YOUR HOURS They try to take people money  .
good,its a nice company to work for cause they are very good at giving time off and working around your schedule. i work 2 jobs and they are very good about what days i can come work for kohls but the pay is not very good at all
good,"a typical day at work, learned to use different functions on an RF gun to count inventory, great management, friendly workplace. Hardest part of the job is finding some of the locations in the warehouse"
good,"A typical work day was finding candidates for selected stores. We worked to help fullfill their seasonal help. It provded great experience in sourcing, setting up background checks just all around recruiting. Worked with great managers, supervisors and co-workers"
good,"Very fun place to work at, fast paced, and very competitive. The hours are long but worth it because the pay is lucrative. I would highly recommend this position to others so they can indulge in the same experience I did."
good,I liked it it was very fast and the people was friendly sometimes the work was very slow but other then that the jobs is very cool to work at so I would recommend people
good,"Love the people I work with"
good,"Lead Cashier, assisted customer with a quick and friendly check out. Solicited Credit and email addresses. Provided friendly customer service and ensured that each customer found what they were looking for and made sure they didn't have any further questions."
good,"kohls is a great place to work. there is a lot to do and you're always busy. the discounts are great and management is nice. great place to do shopping at,"
good,"The management at Kohl's was really good, they are flexible with working hours; except on holidays where they need workers. I learned a lot about customer service and what customers want from workers and the store in general. Typical day would be working on department cleaning and organizing racks, folding clothes, helping customers, price checking, cleaning fitting rooms, working at the cashier tables, or if the manager need help with something they would call on Associates for help."
good,"Wasn't a bad job, I worked all aspects of it from Cashier to Customer Service to Supervisor so there is definetly chance to move up. Only real problem was after the holidays the hours got cut a lot."
good,"Kohl's is a good place to work at but when they start hiring new people your hours get cut down, they had a good work team, we would work in groups and we would help each other. It would help us get our jobs done faster so we all could go home early, and so that we wouldn't work overtime."
good,"Learned a lot of Cash Register Skills, credit and customer service applications, closing registers and final close, made good friends. and was lively atmosphere."
good,"Great during the holidays; very productive"
good,Great job for customer service type work. Kohl's was laid back .paid weekly a very accommodating job. Various types of positions and schedules available
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Associates don’t get enough training which can hurt the customer service. I believe that the customers whom shop here have no care for anyone but themselves and seem to not care if they’re messy.
good,It was just a job for me in high school. Nothing major to judge. I worked and mind my business that I all. The job was like any other retail job. Just a job
good,They have competitive pay and I would recommend working there. The job is fast paced and there were barely any over time that's given to us. But overall the experience was great.
good,Fun experience. A lot harder to move up as far as a career but good and friendly managers and staff. Easy work and loving customers. It’s a good first job.
good,I enjoyed working with the people there they were all friendly and had a good attitude about everything. The environment is face paced being in the back room unloading trucks.
good,"I genuinely enjoy working at Kohl's and the staff and management are great, however the pay rate is less than what I would like for the amount of work that I do."
good,Working at kohl's was the first job I've ever had. You are taught what to do during your shift and should know how to help customers. I learned many tasks working here that didn't just leave me working at the register so I ended up helping out around the entire store.
good,Very nice part time and full time work for those looking for extra income around the holidays. Always shifts that you can pick up and a nice break room to relax in. Management was always nice and professional.
good,"Overall my coworkers and management were a lot of fun as well as the environment. They reward hard work and show appreciation for their employees. The downside was low pay and minimal hours, but they do give regular reviews that allow for pay raises and advancement and they are flexible with school."
good,"Kohl's is a typical big box retailer.  Fast-paced environment, multitasking a must.  Focus on providing great customer service. Hardest part of the job is soliciting credit applications.  Most enjoyable part of the job is the way Associates are given priority."
good,Kohl's was a fun and friendly environment. Mangers always went out of they're way to help and tried to be as flexible as possible with us. I encourage first time Employee's to come in and fill in an application
good,"seasonal job, great place to work. Mgmt works with you and is helpful and friendly. I work in the shoe dept. I go in and assist customers with their purchases and keep my area neat and stocked."
good,The company was a great place to work. My hours were ok but I got paid weekly and the staff was always helpful and friendly. I would recommend this comany to anyone who applies
good,I have learned great customer service working at Kohl's! Greeting them as they walk in the store and helping them as much as I can is always the highlight of the work day. Just being there and being helpful is great.
good,"A typical day at work came with ease, everyone was generally cheerful and happy to be there as much as I was. It was nice to set goals for myself as far as selling credit. I was exceptionally proud of myself because I generally exceeded my goals."
good,"The job entailed was quick-paced and competitive. The hours you received was based on availability and performance based. You were given a quota. If said quota was not met, the managers would sit you down and discuss how to better improve your performance. Overall, the work experience was good."
good,"I was very happy here and unfortunately had to relocate. The working environment was well balanced, yet busy, and the people I worked around were great."
good,"Kohl's was a very stressful job to work.  Would only recommend it to those who can handle stress.  Many people did not like working there, but did it for the overtime."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"worked over a holiday season would return if needed to pick up another job, coworkers were friendly, discounts were great, management easy to get along with"
good,"I had the time of my life working at Kohl's. It is a great company that treats their employees fairly. It can border more on the work/family side of things, but it is still a nice place to work at."
good,"This workplace is somewhere you can walk in greet your co-workers due to the friendly environment. Management is always willing to assist with any questions or concerns about a task. The hardest part of the job is getting used to getting your expected numbers in productivity, but management gives you a fair amount of time to get used to the department. I really enjoyed the incentives and opportunity to make a great amount of money with overtime and holiday pay."
good,Great opportunities...great culture. Considering today's economy Kohl's is staying abreast with the current trends to ensure they remain a top notch company.
good,"Kohl's is a fun place to work they offer a great employee discount, They don't pay great but they are very flexible on work schedule needs. Awesome for a starter or part time job."
good,Kohl’s is a wonderful place to work. Flexible hours and great employees to work with. You get a balanced work time with quick and slow paced days. Nice greeting and talking to variety of customers every day.
good,"Not only did they provide for us, but they were very considerate of our college schedules. There were many occasions where I needed to pass my schedule down to someone else as a result of unexpected workloads, and they were more than willing to help me out."
good,"Kohls was a great place to work, there were great people you helped me along the way. I found it very easy to learn they was things were done at kohls. The Management there was great."
good,"Good management, fast paced, security was good. Great cafeteria, great employees to work with. Lots of work to keep everyone busy. No complaints from anyone"
good,"My position at Kohl's was seasonal, I worked in the mens department, my manager was really nice and let me pick up more hours by cross-training into pricing, and merchandising roles."
good,Good place to shop. Wonderful employee.  Very knowledgeable and helpful with customer. Peaceful good music. Free WiFi to shop. A lot of items. Snack and beverages for employee.
good,Very nice and competitive. Everyone is extremely nice and no one judges regardless of who you are. Kohls is a far and simple job with maximum effort and maximum benefits.
good,"Good atmosphere at Kohls,  great coworkers and The management was awesome and understandin and friendly.  I loved going to work there The customers in The area were  very nice as well"
good,Great company to work for with awesome benefits. A typical day at work consist of managing inventory making sure clothes were organized properly. The culture was great i loved my staff and i never really had a hard time and the best part of my job was helping customers find the right clothing for the right occasion.
good,"kohls has been a job that has given me the option to make extras money to help with life. The company offers a great discount program, and kohl is a store where i can get most of what me and my family needs. The store has been very flexible with my schedule to accommodate my family and full time job."
good,"Some may disagree, but this job is the easiest and the most fun I've had. The responsibilities are clearly communicated and don't change much from day to day. I had the opportunity to be trained on every section of the store so my weeks were always interesting. I may be unloading the truck Monday morning, and closing Customer Service on Wednesday. The managers were there as a career so it was obvious they cared about their jobs and their people. Kohl's culture was a lot more vast and involved than one may think for a retail job. Of course I would like to have been paid more but $9/hr was more than appropriate for the level of work we did on a day to day basis. My only complaints are that after some time of being there, I expected to be let alone to do my job, but the constant micro managing became grating. Every day when I walked in, the manager on duty would give me a rundown of ym responsibilities as if I didn't already know. The hours were also inconsistent, ranging from 6 to 30 a week, with no way to predict or budget BUT every time I requested more hours, they were given to me. "
good,"Everyone has been very helpful and patient teaching me my job."
good,"Kohls was a great place to work,when I transferred there from California I was told they would be putting a Kohls in in Cedar City,they never did.So I had to quit."
good,"very great place to work with great benefits ,nice people to work around ,great management,nice locations and very nice respect workplace i would recommend this job to anyone."
good,well i was really there for the holidays working december til may.. I enjoyed working there..they were understanding in the fact that i had a son and as to why i was late. People and managers at the time was friendly
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,There is always something to do here. Pleasing the customers is our number one priority. All the associates are very friendly and nice. The environment is very fast pace.
good,"Kohls has a lot of benefits for full time employees. For part time assossicates , they only receive discounts and no other benefits. Other than that its a good place to work. My store has great management and is very organized ."
good,I enjoyed working at Kohls and the people I worked with. Such a diverse  company which I real enjoyed. Plus I really love their brands. I would work there again if opportunity presented.
good,"give breaks,count register at closing, fun place to work during the holidays, the hardest when we fall short of some merchandise,and the customer has to goes elsewhere, the manager was much a team player"
good,A typical retail chain. Discount was nice. Enjoyed working with my fellow colleagues and the holidays were tolerable. I wish the paid a little bit more.
good,Been there two years this December - don't have any complaints as yet.  You have to work there yourself to see how it is. Not everyone sees the same or is looking for the same thing as another person would do in a job.  Try working there during the holiday season and take it from there.
good,I enjoyed working there but the schedule was never really fixed. You would get put in a different section everyday and sometimes it was difficult to recover the merchandise at the end of the night because it may have only been you in your section.
good,"This was a temporary second job.  I started this one week before starting at Northern Arizona University.  My job was to place sales signs.  Job was easy, employee extra discount day was great because our shift was in the evening when the store closed so we had the advantage of shopping/holding sales items."
good,"Management was amazing, shift supervisors were more than happy and eager to help with any issues, only negative piece to working there is mis-scheduling, often time last initials are not placed behind first names, if more than one person with same first names work there schedules tend to get mixed up.."
good,"Was an okay job, many benefits such as discounts on clothing & other items. Fast-paced environment. Management was great also, as well as our security team."
good,"Not a bad place to work, coworkers were fun and friendly, although a very fast paced day to day responsibility, it was a very rewarding experience. Would recommend for entry level."
good,I enjoyed the environment and the people that worked at kohls. Management was good and very well put together. i would recommend a friend or a relative to work there
good,"My job consisted of helping out in a clerical capacity in all of the buying offices.  I was hired as a floater and a fill in.  After the new CEO took over, he eliminated all floater positions.  There were no other permanent jobs available at that time so I had to quit."
good,great work culture. managers are very interested in helping one succeed. casual work place and great pay. it does get pretty crazy during holiday season with mandatory overtime and have to work some holidays.
good,Supportive and kind team with a group mindset. Very flexible and balanced schedule. Ample break times with snacks occasionally brought in to share. Good community.
good,It was a great experience working here i learned a lot of like skills from the people who worked there and all the managers and supervisors actually cared about me.
good,I enjoyed working in this environment. It was great working in my field. I learned a lot while at this job completing the duties of a loss prevention associate..
good,The employees and managers where great. But Even when you never want to work a cash register and touch ppl money they still make you train on it anyway.
good,Fast work pace great start pay clean work environment nice co workers..................................... Once you learn what to do it's easy and Once you get a hang of it it's easy
good,"It's a great place to work, I just wasn't receiving enough hours. The pay is great and the people are friendly. You receive long, paid breaks and other various pros. The cons are the numbers you have to keep up with but they are achievable if everyone puts their best in to everything they do."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,A typical day at work will be sales are great. Everyday will not be a successful day. Work place culture is diversity. The hardest part about working in retail is dealing with different attitudes.
good,I worked at night time 7pm till 7 am and all you do is get your scanner and it will tell  you were to go but you got to pick first up stairs or down stairs
good,They management team is slightly lazy but it's slow pace. It's easy money to be made and very nice customers to help. It's quick to catch onto tasks and training is thorough.
good,"easy work to do folding clothes , pulling merchandise from racks, "
good,"I started to work at Kohl's during the holiday season, but I had a blast working hard and give customers the service they deserve. There will be times when the manager would announce one's error over the radio which made me upset would be the only flaw with working at Kohls."
good,I loved working with the team at kohl's they were all friendly and made working there so much fun. Even though black friday and the holidays can get crazy it was a fun place to work.
good,"Good benefits like health insurance, dental"

good,"Greet customers, ring up purchases, take store credit card payments, sign up new customers for store credit, thank customer for shopping at your location, Management was great, workplace environment was fun, most enjoyable part of job was meeting new people."
good,"Great job for students as well as adults. The workplace is very diverse and the management is very friendly and respectful of employees. You must work hard for every shift, but it is a good environment."
good,A very good place to work at. You will get the hours during the holidays. Very challenging place to work. They do train you. I learned to do a lot of things there.
good,Great place to work good work environment. Love my kohls family Flexible hours and good pay for a call center with great perks and benefits...........
good,Good company. Good benefits and incentives. I worked hard and got compliments for my dedication and enthusiasm. I was able to benefit from this position.
good,I love kohls I had a newborn baby who kept getting sick so I had to leave. Did overnights which was good wish I could go back but looking for a better opportunity and more paying jobs to further my career
good,they are are a hod company to work for and they will hiring you if you have the experience to work there. They are very good and company policy as well
good,I liked it. It was only temporary. It was a lot of mess there tho. I was my first job when I moved to Dallas. Had to work holidays with no holiday pay 😒
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management.

good,this was a good positive place to work the management was good and kept everything organized and running smoothly mostly i packed online orders for shipping
good,I enjoyed working at this company as well. It was my first warehouse/production job and it intrudeced me to the tasks and duties of the warehouse career.
good,overwhelming and exciting.the other employies are very nice and if need helping with learning the job they are there to help you. i loved working there.
good,"everyone is nice welcoming and helpful!"
good,"A typical work day included helping customers, answering the telephone and processing returns.  There was nothing new that I learned with this job. I was already familiar with this line of work. Management was very nice and easy to work for and with. It was nice clean environment and friendly people. The hardest part of the job was putting away all refunds at the end of the shift. The most enjoyable part was being able to help all of my friendly customers."
good,The experience at Kohls was something different each day.. The customer kept you entertain and the staff was Awesome when you work with Great people the work day is AWESOME
good,"I was responsible for the fitting rooms, maintain the ladies area, assisting our customers  with selections. To be patient, and understanding. Management was great. I loved the people I worked with. Keeping the store maintained  was the hardest part. I had a lot of great people I worked with."
good,"Enjoyed working at Kohls, lots of hours, an i moved around the warehouse doing several different positions, lots of hours, overtime, an discounts on all ideams"
good,Best place I have work for. They know how to keep an employee working for them. Management know how to treat there employees. They recognize you for your work and you can move up quickly.
good,the store was very accommodating and willing to work with employees.the store did have an issue with keeping a store manager and promoting from within.
good,This was a good company to work for. They understood work/life balance. Management was great. Willing to help employees develop in their position to advance.
good,"didnt get more over time, it is a fast time and its a good enviroment pay rate its good, didnt like they told me i was getting hired on and then i didnt"
good,Enjoyable and rewarding place to work. Worked with nice helpful people. Learned to deal with upset customers and hand the rush at the holidays. A typical day was stocking shelves and returning items left at the register.
good,I enjoy working at Kohl's EFC and learning more of the intellectual aspects. The job can be very physical on a persons body. Being in good shape truly helps get through long days.
good,"This job is really as good as you make it. Pay is not decent at first but ambitious people with a good head on their shoulders and work ethic can get somewhere in this company in no time. Scheduling is decent, must be available to work varying shifts."
good,Very great place to work for to get your foot in the door for retail experience. 9 years plus of customer service experience with lots of room to grow with the company.
good,"Talking to and getting to know customers throughout my day is my favorite part of my job. I have learned that people have good days and bad days, and when they have a bad day they can try to place their feelings and emotions all over you, and to not let their day affect you. Place has good ethics and wants their associates to have the same ethics. The hardest part of my job is on a slow day. I like to keep busy."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."

good,It wasnt to bad. Unloaded and stocked clothes. Great people there to work with. Hrs were hard to come by. If they had more hrs to give i would of stayed longer.
good,In a typical day in my last position I fulfilled management tasks of opening the facility is also a enjoyable environment also providing strong customer service and resolved customer issues.
good,"a typical day at work - fun environment, friendly and helpful coworkers and bosses. "
good,great place to work part time.The ogranization does a great job of allowing you to grow and learn diffferent things throughout the store. Co- workers and managers are nice also.
good,"I loved that you could wear whatever you wanted to, and you could also have an MP3 player of any brand along with your phone to listen to music while you work. They offer higher pay for Associates who go above and beyond, and would like to train or become a supervisor."
good,"My job mostly consisted of standing at a Cash register.  If I was helping to open the store I would count each register making sure there was a maximum of $125.00 in it to start each day.  I would help costumers pay for their purchases and ask them if everything was to their liking with a friendly attitude.  My managers were very friendly and understanding.  Some were strict, but most were very nice and liked to keep a friendly work environment.  The hardest part of the job is standing in one spot for long periods of time and trying to get everything cleaned up in time for closing, however the best part of the job is meeting new people and sometimes making quick small-talk."
good,Employees are treated with respect & equality.. They are non-judgemental and understanding. Management welcomes and encourages you to express your thought & creative ideas..to find the best position to utilize your best assets. They strive for outstanding customer satisfaction
good,"I kind of enjoy working here. However, days I can work are getting messed up. Working for Kohl's corporation  furthered my experience in the work force, but it is not something I seek to continue working for. Management is great also."
good,It's fast paced work environment that deals with a lot of customer service. Everybody that works there are very friendly and helpful. The management is always available for you to talk to if needed.
good,"making sure the customers were helped and were satisfy. i learned many skills like from putting the freight that we unloaded from trucks in there right places, learned how to teach other people how to do the things i did. my manager gave me a lot of hours even though i was part time which was nice and he was very understanding. very fun and friendly place to work people are very understanding. having to move freight on my own. being able to work with other employees before and after store hours."
good,"fun place to work with plenty of opportunity for career development and growth. Bonus structure is great and the atmosphere is very encouraging."
good,"Some days are slow as molasses but then there are some that you can not breathe.  Wide range of co-workers,some work hard and pull their weight and others don't. they do work with available hours."
good,"The store itself was nice and the managers did their best and were good people. The environment of retail has some very rough days however, and the employees have to have a strong mental fortitude to continue to work there."
good,"Kohls is fun workplace, the coworkers are awesome they are always willing to help.I had learned to be very patient and helpulful to others, Im very shy person but at kohls i learned to communicate more with the costumers"

good,I enjoyed the store atmosphere and the support of the management.  This store creates opportunities to learn different skills within your employment here.
good,Kohls taught me a lot. Gave me opportunity to grow. Excellent management. Employees stay focused and work together well as a team. Great opportunity to grow.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I love working here but it got so over whelming when you didn't make credit. And if you did make credit is was only .50$ twice a year we got a dollar. never enough hours.
good,A great team environment that focuses on the customer and advancement of employees.  I spent 6.5 years with this company and was promoted twice.  I have fond memories of the people and the culture there.
good,I had a pleasant experience working at kohl's. The management was very friendly and did good training so you knew what you were doing. Also if any questions were asked they had a good answer to help solve the problem.
good,Worked in the freight department accepting incoming merchandise.  The team works very hard and well together.  Relaxed atmosphere and very dedicated to the community.
good,good management. i learned how to better deal with customers. a typical day was full of customer servicing and cleaning up the store. most enjoyable part was interacting with the various customers. hardest part was trying to open up credits.
good,I was employed at kohls department store as a department supervisor and I honestly enjoyed my time at that location it prepared me to work with customers and provide positive experiences
good,The work place is very friendly due to friendly management and workers. The store is very clean and provides discounts for customers which helps them save
good,"The work environment is constructive and it is easy to make friends. My managers are kind and not overbearing. It's still work, but not anything worth complaining about."
good,the experience was great but the hours were less then what I needed the management was very great and the pace of the job was very relaxed and unstressful we set our pace and the managers let us do it our way so long as we finshed in a timly manner
good,Basically I was a retail cashier.  Did merchandising for both men's and woman's clothing.  Management was always accessible when in need.  It was a fun place to work and the customers were always patient and kind.
good,Since I have been working at Kohl's I have learned to communicate more and able to cooperate with other people. Also I am able to enjoy myself because everyone is very friendly. A typical day at work I would restock and help customers.
good,Monthly calendar with fun  things to do and  free snacks. Managers at my store are encouraging. typical day at work is fast paced. I love my position.
good,"A typical day at Kohl's department store was assitsing the shoppers with any questions or items that they needed. I also was a cashier while working their. Overall, I liked my job."
good,"Kohl's was a fast paced job on a busy day but very relaxing on a slow day. The discounts were great, and there was always a supervisor on the floor to assist you and help satisfy your needs and customer needs."
good,"I have advanced through Kohls from being a cashier, to customer service return specialist, jewelry counter girl, to now a makeup artist/beauty advisor. Kohl's has a great customer culture and is focused on making shopping for the customer an easy experience."
good,It was a good place to work while attending school. They were able to work around my school schedule and I was able to take time off if need be. The team was always willing to work together to get things done
good,"This was a fun place to work at, with amazing managers and co-workers to just talk with. Can get it busy very fast, on regular days, but it is what keeps you busy and moving throughout the day."
good,"n/a i liked the job a lot i would go back if i still lived there."
good,"Though I had a good time working here it is nothing to make a living on. Each day I was assigned a department to stock and maintain. Often this would be disrupted by requests for assistance in other departments due to a coworker getting slammed, lack of staffing, or registers getting overwhelmed. Most of the staff and management where nice and easy to get along with. I enjoyed the job but for me it was a transition job."
good,"Good job if you are fast and like high pace work,"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Everything about the company is good but it could have a better pay rate. Management needs better communication of what is going on.  Associates need to know the new memos that are updated and policy changes.  Merchandising is good since you have books to look at where things should go.
good,This was a good first job. The hours were mostly flexible and the environment was balanced between fast paced and relaxed. The break room is a major plus to this job!
good,"A typical day includes keep the sales floor clean and providing great customer service. I learned to be patient with my co-workers, and with customers. The management team is hard working, & often let you know when you do things well. The culture is overall good here & positive. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers. The best part of the job is working with positive individuals, relationships you build with regular customers, and the employee discount."
good,Good Company to work for as a person who needed a flexible schedule during school. The people were nice and management was friendly. Many associates enjoyed the discounts.
good,"The store and employees were respected by management in a caring and concerned manner; from the structure of our schedules to meet the individuals needs to the patience with training and interaction of the supervisory staff towards employees and customers with dignity."
good,i like working there the employees are very nice to everyone and management does their best to give everyone the hours they want and need during the week. my only problem is you have to be available on weekends and its difficult for me to find a sitter half the time so its a struggle.
good,"Everything you need is at Kohls! A physician is even on site and you could either work around your schedule to go to an appointment or your manager could possibly fit it in. Cafeteria on site, GREAT FOOD! Everyone is a family a kohls!"
good,Good to be a part of this company. It has very good culture and working environment. company will taking good decisions. in right time and in right place
good,It's a fast pace job which inquires you to stand most of your shift. It's a friendly company you have to interact with the customer to make sure they are comfortable
good,"I would come in early mornings, and I would help unload whatever freight we had come in, which was clothes and appliances. I would help sort out everything and then make my way upstairs to start taking out the appliances. I would stock the shelves for the rest of the shift while working with others."
good,"Overall, "
good,People were nice. Good pay for the job. They did a lot of extra things like parties and giving free lunches. The supervisors are pretty nice but people sometimes mess around too much and don't get work done.
good,"Excellent service ,great environment, positive place to work. The associates work together well. The hours are flexible. Associates help each other out to get work done efficiently."
good,I started as a full time sales floor specialist and advanced into management through in-store training.  It is a customer based organization with a flexible schedule and great discount.
good,"Met a lot of friendly people, very entertaining, easy to do, a lot of friendly people, easily job to do, stayed busy, loved the manager, loved the people who worked there"
good,"Kohls is a great place to learn people skills and the friendly staff make customer their number one priority at all times. Though it isn't the fastest paced job, there is always something to do to keep you busy throughout the day."
good,its a nice place to work for a new job management is OK could be improved but best thing i learned there is they are really into the customer they put them first.
good,This company treats there workers very well. they are very hands on and they teach you what you need to know to succeed. They also let you use your phone and listen to music
good,Everybody who works/worked at Kohl's was very nice and welcoming to me. There was a lot of different departments and everyone from each department was very helpful to me and helped me out to make sure I knew what I was doing and that I was comfortable.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,typical day at work is ringing up good and fun or sometimes annoying customers who are angry at you for no reason even when you had nothing to do with it. managers are on your back when your trying your best. and when you give your all its still not enough they dont care about the hard work you bring you have to kiss up to get hours. other than that its fun with good managers and good coworkers
good,"A typical work day consists of myself recovering the sales floor and assisting customers with whatever they need, having knowledge of store product that drives our sales. I have learned good customer service skills, patience, and cashiering . Management at Kohls is great ,they work very hard to take care of the store. Best part of this job is the result of helping a customer feel good about their purchases."
good,This is a great place to work! Lots of benefits and opportunities. You can start at any level and work your way up. Everyone is friendly and welcoming and we get free popcorn and coffee!
good,"It was nice working with kohls employee and manager "
good,"the environment at kohls is very welcoming, managment does a great job at engaging the employees, this job was very fun and exciting. The best part of this job is the monthly meetings they were fun and a breath of fresh air. Kohl's is the type of job that does everything they can to keep employees happy and loving their job."
good,"I worked as a seasonal worker for a month. I already had cashier experience so no need to train me, I also worked part time early in the morning (most of the time) I have no complaints about the company or any employees."
good,Kohl's was a Great experience fun work area to feel comfortable and steady and smooth operation to get the job done. I appreciated the opportunity and would go back if a permanent position becomes available.
good,"Well managed organization.  Solid benefits and a positive environment.  Great perks on site including food options. This site houses the call centers for Card services, Kohls.com and Risk Management operations so it has its peaks and valleys of intense periods and down times for additional training."
good,"I enjoy working for Kohls it's a great company to be a part of and grow with."
good,"It was a amazing place to work I loved it, they helped me when i was pregnant and understood when I lost my son they were very understanding. I hope to be able to get my job back with them."
good,Working at this Kohl's location gets very busy at times. For the most part everyone is a pleasure to work with. The associates here are very willing to provide any assistance you need. The management staff is easy to communicate with and provide you with all the necessary tools needed to accomplish your job.
good,"My experience in store management at Kohl's was a good one.  I left because I relocated to a market that Kohl's had not yet entered.  Otherwise, I may never have left.  I would work for them again."
good,"Outstanding management staff, A+.  Management is friendly, welcoming, helpful."
good,"Kohl's was a very good place to work, I learned a lot of valuable skills that have helped me in other aspects of life. Not only that, but I got to improve my people skills by talking to and greeting all types of customers."
good,I left Kohl's due to getting married and wanted to pursue some other opportunity and have a more at home life. I left Kohl's for a job that had a more stable work schedule.
good,Hard work unloading boxes and unpacking everything that comes off the truck fast paced. Pushing product to floor. Friendly place to work if you keep out of the clicks.
good,"Working at Kohl's was great experiences . I learn how to open account,make payment, return items. I really like work in team to get things done . The management was great we always work in team. I really like working there for the holiday. There were very organized . Everyone worked very to get thing done."
good,I did enjoy working for this company for the time I was there. a typical day at work was very slow paced and easy because i worked the night shift. Management was always working with the employees to create a good workplace experience . The hardest part of the job was the training and the learning of the security codes because there were so many. the workplace was very dry but my fellow employees were always nice. i enjoyed working the register and interacting with customers.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"This was a very interesting experience. The environment was very upbeat, and positive. I loved working here. If I didn't have to leave for school I would have remained at this store."
good,Very fun job. A lot of work but the breaks are well spaced and given appropriately. Many benefits and nice workplace with great people.
good,"It was a great place to work overall. The atmosphere was wonderful. They really showed that they care at Omni staffing. It was very enjoying. The pay was good, the work life was great. I really enjoyed the atmosphere."
good,"Sales floor associate in the men's, ladies, and children's departments. Assisting customers and fellow associates with locating desired items, straightening sales floor and arranging items for sales ads. Handling transactions for sales in busy times."
good,"A typcical day at work would entail coming in and replacing the items that were either returned or the patron decided not to buy. The supervisors were all friendly and driven, they wanted the Khols that we worked in to be the best Khols within a 500 mile radius. The most  enjoyable part of my job was meeting interesting coworkers and supervisors since I enjoy meeting new people. The only con was that I had to leave because of school."
good,I liked this job. They were great with my work schedule. They helped me a lot and were always so friendly. I enjoyed working here. It was fun and exciting
good,"the management and the company was good, the job relatively easy but there was only one problem that the hours are too less sometimes 4-6 hrs A WEEK! which doesn't pay for anything so it's good to have as a side job since it pays better than most retail entry level positions."
good,I loved working at Kohls even though I was only seasonal. The supervisors and the manager were really nice and easy to get along with. I barely had any issues while working there. My only complaint would be that my feet were not use to standing/ walking around all day so they were hurting after each shift and I could not wear tennis shoes for comfort; I did try my best with sketchers though.
good,I enjoy being apart of a wonderful organization.  I enjoy working with the customers as well.  I am hard working person who loves to make sure that all customers are happy and satisfied with the customer service they receive.
good,"My time with Kohl's was relatively nice. The job I was given wasn't difficult (I worked Point Of Sale most of the time). The most fun I had with the job was when one of the managers would give me additional tasks to do apart from working the register and cleaning up shelves. I would sometimes restock the registers with whatever promos we had going on, restock them with Kohl's cash or reward cards. Occasionally, when I worked a closing shift, I would collect carts from outside and collect all the hangers from the registers that customers didn't want and take them to our recycle bin in the back of the store. Though I only worked seasonal, it was a fun experience."
good,"Each work day was very basic and diverse based on the position being given.  I had done many different positions at Kohl's, including cashier and package handling.  The environment is very open aired, yet still very relaxing and easy to work at.  In terms of negatives, it was mostly the hectic lines many workers at the front would generally have to deal with.  Otherwise, it was a very nice place to work.  I especially loved the employees there, as they clearly enjoyed working at the store, as well as the high level management."
good,This job was nice to help people and see the different thing going on in the store. Each day was filled with such different things and I enjoyed that..
good,"Worked with multiple people at once, most of the tyime worked independenty. Made sure I was organized and had to learen knowledge on merchandise quickly but had plenty of help when needed"
good,"There is always work to be done and seems to never be enough time to do it. However, there is great satisfaction when employees are happy with their jobs and customers are happy with the store's presentation."
good,"I have learned a lot working at Kohl's, mostly how fun work can be when there is a team wanting to work. Management staff is fair and hard working."
good,"When I first started It was a fantastic company to work for, wonderful staff, and management with room to develop. I was a part-time shoe salesmen, and while working there, I developed plenty of speech, inventory, and loss prevention skills. Then I was moved to stockroom and freight. I did not mind doing this, until the store manger moved on to a higher position. Around that time, the open position left massive competition among the management staff for the ""Store Mangers"" position, and this put stress on the employees that eventually caused me to leave the company."
good,"Kohls is a great place too work, i like there in all honesty only down side is very little hours. Its like management doesnt know how to spread hours properly."
good,"Customer centric company with high importance on customer service. "
good,"I've had a pretty good experience with Kohls (0736). The management is wonderful, they are very understanding of having to take days off, they bring food a lot, and they are always there to help. The environment is great and the people are, for the most part, very friendly. The only problem I have is the consistency. Since the holidays I've worked maybe a total of 50 hours. If the hours were more consistent, it would be a perfect job."
good,"Although it is retail, this is one of the best places I have ever worked.  The management is knowledgeable, nice and willing to pitch in a hand. They seem to really care about their employees."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,This Jon entitled me to be at work from 4am to 12pm good pay and also good people to work with it is also very time consuming so the day goes by pretty fast
good,fun work place. i miss it at times but i ended up moving. i  was apart of a crew that was full of energy. they helped who ever needed assistant great place.
good,Great place of employment. Will definetly continue to provide great service and will recommend this place of employment ot others. The employees are always happy and welcoming.
good,"A day at kohl's are easy going the people are nice the staff are wonderful. Working at kohl""s is only a part time job it;s great for young worker's that's getting started."
good,Kohl's was a great place to work unfortunately there was not enough hours. I worked there for over a year but never had more than 20 hours. I was moved to a variety of departments but the hours were simply not there.
good,"Overall the company was great, but I was just a seasonal employee so I didn't get to see too much of the company. The people were great and I really enjoyed it."
good,Good place to work friendly employees. Always a fun and active job. Multiple doors to load every night.  Many opertunities for advancement and other positions.
good,The management team was very supportive and fun to work with. It was a nice competitive environment. What i really enjoyed about working here was that they worked with my school schedule and would offer solutions to any conflict with work and lifes occurances.
good,The management team was very supportive and fun to work with. It was a nice competitive environment. What i really enjoyed about working here was that they worked with my school schedule and would offer solutions to any conflict with work and lifes occurances.
good,"Provide positive service to customers"
good,"Management makes sure you are comfortable with your job, good training. They also make sure to let you know you are appreciated. I learned a lot about great customer service skills here as well."
good,"Day started with standup meeting and continued with the days work and document preparation, coordinating with the team as and when needed, managing offshore and onshore teams, arranging meetings with the client."
good,"I enjoyed my short time at Kohls and was sad to leave. I think that that its a well ran store and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Every day was always a good one. I learned several new things including price changes, stocking, inventory, on line orders, etc  I think the management ran a good store. The employees seemed very happy with their jobs so i feel that is a good reflection on the company and its store managers. I think the hardest part for me was running the registers. For some reason I get nervous. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers out on the floor. I'm a huge people person . I like how all the staff work together like a family."
good,fun workplace with a lot of opportunity to advance. Lots of great incentives and benefits to work here. Hardest part is the busy season   and having to work holidays.
good,Took care of customers purchasing jewelry in the jewelry dept.  Helped ca.  sh customers out if cashiers were busy.  Helped out in other departments if needed.  Management was great to work with. Loved being able to help customers
good,"Awesome benefits, flexibility and opportunity to grow and learn as an individual. Starting here out of college has been a great gig getting experience in many types on digital tactics as a designer."
good,"I worked stock during the holiday season. I made displays, unloaded trucks, stocked shelves, and tagged merchandise. Everyone was nice, customers were usually pretty nice as well. Overall a pleasant work atmosphere, and paid decently well. But not the most exciting either."
good,"Good retail job: lots of cardio, department heads are knowledgeable, management is very capable and friendly, work is never too hard or too much and can be completed in plenty of time. I looked forward to work and the people that entitled. Kohls employs friendly and supportive people."
good,"I'd usually work in the backroom, unloading freight off of trucks. After unloading the trucks we would push the freight out onto the floor and back stock whatever wouldn't fit on the floor. My favorite part of the job was talking with my coworkers and the calm pace of the work. Management was very friendly, always encouraging you to ask if you had any questions. My only complaints with the job would be with the training I received, as I essentially had to learn everything myself or ask others how to do it."
good,"Working at Kohl's is relatively simple: you follow the instructions of older, more experienced employees in order to figure out what to do. A typical day working here involves coordination between your assigned area and the people who work around you. For example, if you are put in Housewares, they need you to assist customers, keep an eye on levels of stock, manage freight, and replenish inventory when needed, all while following the directions of your superiors. Overall, the experience of being a part of Kohl's unique team far outweighs the challenge of learning something new. The management is helpful and reliable, and the co-workers easily become really good friends. Rough patches are common in their system, but I'm happy to have started work in a place like this."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,It was a not so good job. At that times was making low money. No to mention low hours. The workers were nice. They helped me with my tasks and treated me like everyone else.
good,"Loved the enviornment the only issues that I ever had were with a couple of the managers, but some of the managers are quite nice. I made a lot of friends and it is a nice place to work"
good,"This particular company is a great starting out job i learned so much from this place and also how to run a cash register, management was great, my coworkers helped in anyway they could, the hardest part of the job i would say would be dealing with unhappy customers, the best part of the job was making people smile and helping them in any way i could"
good,"Keeping busy during the late hours staying awake."
good,"Everyday was almost similar for the most part, put clothes away, help customers and over all provide excellent customer service. I learned a few things from my experience at Kohl's like operating a cash register and effective ways to provide great customer service. My co-workers were all fun to work with and provided a friendly atmosphere."
good,"I enjoy supplementing my income working at department stores, even though my career focus is health care administration. I try and give the utmost of customer service, as I desire the survival of these unique retail establishments, so rich in the retail history of our country."
good,Kohl's was my first warehouse job and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I had good co workers that were all about getting the job done. I enjoyed working here. I learned how to do multiple to things while working here. Nothing was really hardabout the job but I did enjoy getting two 30 minute breaks.
good,"I was always doing something, or helping someone. It was very active, always keeping me on my toes, as well as requiring me to lift. I learned how to manage my time to get everything done by the time I was off, as well as how to help customers the most effective ways. My co-workers were helpful and always there for me, whether it be with an odd question or helping to accomplish a task together. The hardest part was not knowing where everything was yet, and having to search for a longer amount of time than I intended. The most enjoyable was all the people I met along the way."
good,typical day was good with management being accommodating. scheduling hours was some what annoying at times with not enough hours to work. great employee benefits.
good,I learned a large amount about how a department store works. I would typically clock in then asks department managers what they would like me to do and if they had nothing I would go find things which needed to be folded or sorted then did that until i was needed or required a break. Management was reasonable and did not expect anything above anyone's pay grade and they were nice. The co-workers were kind making me look forward to work daily. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people find what they needed.
good,"grate place to work at, since working here I have learned a lot of new job skills that I know I will be able to take out to another job if needed"
good,We always had a good team and an achievable goal for the day. I learned how to deal with angry customers and how to work in register. My co-workers were good people and had good collaboration which made our work easy.
good,"the typical day at Kohl's was just as simple as Marshalls, you come in and want to leave out after your shift is over. What I learned is that Kohl's does a lot for charities that help children in desperate need for a cure for a disease as diabolical as cancer or a home. Management wasn't pretty bad. I loved the Associate Managers, but the store manager not so much. Co workers were the same like my current position at Marshalls. They can be friendly and then turn around and give you an attitude that you thought that you never had. Hardest part of my former job is that it was hard to deal with customers and there lack of respect for expired coupon rules. The most enjoyable part of my job was that it was very close to my house and that it gave a me a small good amount of income to put in my pocket."
good,"Unpacked merchandise, helped customers find merchandise,set up display cases, reprice items that goes on sale, merchandising, back orders, customer service"
good,fast paced task oriented job requiring constant attention towards customers and tasks at hand continuous attention towards sales goals and potential regular customers
good,"Working here was great ! Everyone's super nice and they have a great management team. The employee discount is amazing, especially during holidays when you stack up discounts."
good,"it was a seasonal job, so i did not receive the full job experience but it's an overall good workplace. for the time i was there, however, the work was not so bad. fast pace sometimes and easy slow days other times. i learned more about the shipping a receiving process."
good,"While it can get fairly busy during the holidays and back to school time, the work environment stays calm and everything that needs to be done, gets done. Managers and supervisors are always ready to help and the Yes We Can policy makes handling customers very easy. The hardest part of the job might be the long lines and the amount of returns but given time and assistance everything always gets completed in time."
good,Shifts varied it's a typical warehouse job picking and packing diverse groups of people. Gets really busy around peak season.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"You would have to be really into retail to want to move up, and very very patient when working on the floor."
good,I lreally like working at Kohl's distribution they are very nice people I just wish it was longer and not a seasonal job definitely will work there again next year.
good,great company to work for. There's always work to do. Great environment to work around. Awesome discounts maintaining records on incoming and outgoing shipments.
good,"Very  professional ....one of my favorite jobs.  They work with you & was very friendly. Loved everything about kohls, even had employees discounts for employees & family days."
good,"Days at kohl's is usually fast based when you first start the job you learn the ins and out on sales and what it means to be an associate. The managers were great, they give you the training you need to get started. and from there if you need help they will come to you. co workers were really friendly and help full. The hardest part of the job was dealing with certain customers. My most enjoyable part of the job was gaining new experience and meeting wonderful customers at kohl's."
good,Constantly moving with always something new to do. Resets are fun and easy. Management takes your ideas into account. You even get to be a part of the decision making in your area.
good,"They hired me when I need a job while the children were at home/school. "
good,"I have learned more about time management, how to work more stress-free in a fast pace environment. Coworkers are amazing along with managers."
good,"Most experiences will depend on the store, but for the most part Kohl's is a much better place to work.  Great communication is encouraged throughout the store, the managers are always reachable, and for once they actually make a visible effort to implement improvements.  Personally, I loved working there for the time I worked there more than any other retail job.  It's nice to *actually* feel like part of a whole store team."
good,"They would always schedule me extra hours when ever I asked for them. Even if that meant I had to learn a new department. That meant I learned how to stock, run the register, set ads, unload a truck and customer service."
good,Checking into work was all mostly automated and  for someone that likes a quiet day it was nice. I would get to my station filling orders to be put on a conveyor belt to me sent. We was at the time allowed to listen to music which made the days go by a lot faster. There wasn't really a hard part to the job if you just listen and know what your doing. Really liked  working there and hoping to get hired back on over there.
good,Job was fun to be at but for the amount of work that you have to do you do not get paid enough money. Minimum wage is too little to be paid when you are constantly walking around and straightening things as the customers are messing it up.
good,upbeat work environment great staff and friendly helpful management shifts can seem long at times but there is always something to do
good,I loved to work with people and have regular customer I would have like more then 10 to 20 hours a week but overall an amazing place to work credit greeting was a great idea as well
good,"A typical day in my last position I fulfilled tasks of keeping my department neat and organized according to the layout at that time.  Throughout the day I completed various duties like greeting and helping customers, putting out new merchandise, and keeping my fitting room neat. I have learned about retail, customer service, merchandising, and more social skills. My manager was very experienced, she liked her staff to be able to work independently and I had to learn quickly to become independent about analyzing problems and finding solutions. My co-workers were all very friendly and fun to work with they made my experience at work more exciting. The hardest part of the job is trying to help an unsatisfied  customer. You want all your customers to leave the store knowing you did all you could to help them. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet new people everyday and knowing that you helped your customers."
good,I enjoyed working at Kohl's.  It was close to where I lived.  Co-workers were helpful and nice.  I learned how a store gets ready for customers and what all is involved.  The hardest part was pulling the baker's rack to the area it needed to be at and getting everything off of the racks to the area the clothes needed to be and organized according to sizes before customers came in.  The enjoyable part of the job was doing a variety of tasks -- sometimes I would come in and be asked to do something else.
good,I loved being a Khol's associate. Friendly and welcoming environment. I would definitely recommend this job to others. By far one of the best jobs I have had
good,Kohls is a terrific company to work for with flexible hours and cross training. The company is a great company to work for in the ever changing world of retail.
good,"Very excelling,working for Kohl's and becoming a team member was a good and positive experience for me! Many options and opportunities,A good and beneficial,place to be!!!"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Working at Kohl's was a good choice for a first job; however, credit was pushed heavily by the supervisor in my location. I loved my job as an MJM and sales associate. Interacting with customers was very enjoyable, but the routine was a bit boring at times. Register training was great and the manager who trained me did an excellent job. Men's, Juniors, Misses training was horrible though. The person who trained me left me by myself with a full fitting room the first time, so I was running around trying to put things back with no clue where the specific brands were. That was a frustrating day. I was only there for the summer of 2016 because college started back up in August. I ended up learning everything on my own fairly quickly. I also trained new hires regularly because my managers and supervisor thought I did really well at the tasks at hand. We received bonuses for every credit, but I wish the pay was higher than $9/ hour. We do so much everyday. Another issue that I noticed was the scheduling. If an employee did something small that upset the assistant in any way to make her dislike that person, their hours were cut. It never happened to me, but at least 8 people complained to the supervisor and nothing was done."
good,I love to go to work for Kohls because everyone there is like family. From all the employees to the managers! I love working with people because i know customers always come first and i love to see them leave with a smile on there faces!

good,"Kohl's was a pretty cool job it was just a seasonal position, but everyone was cool, nice, and helpful. I had some funny guys to talk to sometimes. The manager are great they make sure everything is going great once you walk into the building, and your greeted with a smile."
good,I had a great time at kohls. I met a large number of people who taught me the ins and outs of how a large retail store works. I also had the opportunity to deal with customers face-to-face on the daily that not only improved my communication skills but customer service skills.
good,exciting  place to work very strong on training. Provides associates all tools needed to perform job duties successfully on a day to day basis
good,"Liked the employees I worked with, but the hours sucked and it doesn't help when you are not being payed very well. As well as high expectations and demand to sell stupid credit cards."
good,"Typical day would consist of helping customers, running a cash register, and straitening up the department that you are working in.  Can be a little hectic at times but over all a great place to work"
good,"A very fast paced, non stop environment with price checking, unloading merchandise, taking items in bulk to the sales floor to stock while providing excellent customer service."
good,I loved working here for the 5 months I was there. Management and associates were amazing. Job required a lot of walking but the opportunity to have music kept me motivated.
good,"-Unloading truck, working mechandise and assisting customers"
good,"On a typical day, I would organize our merchandise and assist our customers with locating items or finding a size or style. If needed I would work the register also."
good,"very professional and productive, management was very good and overtime was always available and that really came in handy for me."
good,"Overall, Kohl's were the most easygoing job I have ever been employed at. The environment gets a bit frantic during the holidays but even during those time periods, work seemed very fun more than stressful. The attire and workload was very reasonable and manageable."
good,Kohl's is a typical Big box retailer. Kohl's gives it's managers the flexibility to service the customer in a positive manner.
good,My review is this was easy filling out and hope to hear from kohl's. I geel the managers will help deal with your problems and try to work with your home problems as well.
good,"Kohls was very fun to work for. They played games to earn credit and it made so every employee wanted to be apart of it. I also liked how it was a team there wasnt much ""I"" or favoritism going on. Kohl's was flexible with work and made it so you looked forward to going to work. All the employees were super sweet"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"you can pick up other peoples hours and they have great discounts. They pay is not great and the raises are horribly low, but besides that it is a good company."
good,Enjoy working for kohls for it being my first job. I was able to lear many things in the 5 years that i been working for them.
good,"Worked in Bay Parkway Store, the weekends are tough on the Cashiers. Constant customers, but Kohl's did have a good system for getting the customers out. The supervision and management treated the workers right."
good,"Its a very busy retail store. From the time it opens til it closes. I love working with my co worker. They make my day go by fast. "
good,i have never been in retail before an once i got to Kohl's they where able to teach me an and i enjoy my time there an wouldnt trade it for the world.
good,"loved the discounts, but I hated that customer felt entitled to come in and destroy the departments and then complain about the tidiness.  That's why I left the clothing retail business. I also didn't like pushing credit cards on people."
good,I really like to work in this company because I learn a lot of things such as have a great customer service.
good,the job was in a seasonal retail job  so working through the holidays was mandatory. The manager is always asking for you to work longer hours because of people calling out.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of satisfying all the customers. Customers come first throughout the whole day no matter what. It is a great feeling knowing you have helped someone with anything. I have learned more of how to manage time wisely, more of how the receiving of products work for a big company such as Kohls, and my customer satisfactory rate has improved. The management team and full staff are all hard working. The managers do a good job of hiring partners to work with and get them  through training so that the new employees have a direction on what the job consist of. The hardest part of the job would be when you have to help everyone at once and your running back and forth to have every customer satisfied, that is the most enjoyable part of the day."
good,I worked on the trucks and then worked in the store. I learned how to organize and prepare the store for the customers that would come in to shop. The management was very friendly and would always be there to give a helping hand if you asked them for advice. The hardest part about the job was the early morning hours. I enjoyed the co workers that I worked with.
good,The company Kohls was wonderful. I dearly enjoyed management and the strategic way of organization. The company is designed to make all employees feel some since of ownership
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work if you're looking for a friendly atmosphere with great co-workers and good management. There's frequently free food at events held for the associates at the store, as well as volunteer opportunities if you would like to help out in your community."
good,setting up and getting ready for the grand opening was a huge challenge. Very busy store. Lots of new things were learned
good,The job isn't hard. I love my managers and my co workers. My only complaint is that we don't get paid enough. Some days I won't have enough money to pay for the gas to get to work.
good,"customers are always great, no one yells at you, and you get a lot of breaks. Obviously you only get a two week notice of your schedule, so that's pretty annoying."
good,"Repetitive work ethics - cleaning out fittings rooms, folding, and hanging. Attaining to customer's needs and questions."
good,"great staff an managers, friendly an productive work environment. good pay , flexible hours, thisis a good part time job as a sales associate & many opportunities for advancement an training."

Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"When I first started, it was great. However, poor management as the years went by led to my departure. Fun environment, but a particular manager was a bit unbearable to say the least. If not for her, I would still love to work there, even for just the great discount!"
good,A typical day included checking out customers and offering a kohls card to everyone. The managers were reasonable and always worked with you.
good,I worked in the shoe department assisting customers with shoe questing as well as talking to them about the product. I also would assist at the cash register when we became busy.
good,"Day to day was always a challenge due to changes that occurred."
good,"This was one of my favorite places to work starting from the staff and just over all environment. Very fun and friendly. Nothing required strenuous work, most of the things were very easy"
good,I enjoyed working for Kohl's.  Kohl's is a great company to work for and offers room for advancement if you choose to do so.
good,i started on black Friday and it was nothing but unorganized but after that i got placed with the overnight team and have enjoyed working there since
good,"A typical day interacting with customers and having a smile on your face. I've learned that some people are hard to deal with but its worth it when they are satisfied. Management is good, and the bosses are nice and easy to work with. The co-workers are helpful and are there if you need help. The hardest part is it gets really busy and sometimes hard to keep up. The most enjoyable part are the co-workers."

good,At kohl's I learned the value of hard work and what it takes to work in the fashion industry. It was also a very fun and exciting environment to work in.
good,I loved working at Kohl's. My co-workers were nice but some of the assistant managers had their favorites and would be rude to the other employees. I wish I could've stayed
good,"You don't have Work/life balance, awful schedules during the holidays (they close at 12pm but you can't go until 1am)"
good,"I started the job over 10 years ago, and it was like any retail chain. Still, the quality of the clothing was good, the people I worked with was good."
good,i honestly enjoyed working there even though it was seasonal but i met a lot of fun people and i would wish to work again. it was on black Friday but it was very fun
good,"Working here consisted of many tasks; oftentimes though no one could finish their work in one shift. I learned how to effectively handle any customer situation, how to work P.O.S systems and some other software. The management there wasn't great at first but improved over time as adjustments were made. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep your area neat, folded and clean while at the same time helping customers and assisting at the registers."
good,"Every day will start off work, we will have our start up meeting and then stretch, As a trainer I learned to be calm speak loud and clear and to give orders in a nice way, and i understand some people wont get the hang of it right away and ill have to trainer longer. As far as co/workers I try to keep conversation about work and thats it. My most enjoy able about work was gift wrap being a leader helping others when they need help."
good,"A typical day at work was no less than fun. It was more like recreation than work. I learned to operate and wide range of heavy industrial equipment such as forklifts, walkie-riders, cherry pickers, and more. The management was fair. The co-workers were nose-to-the-grindstone, which I like, though they did not lose that friendly supportive edge that made the workplace enoyable. The hardest part of the job was the 12-hour shifts. The most enjoyable part of the great co-workers."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"	Managed and assisted team in shelving and display of products and items."

good,"Coming to work was fun and days seemed to go fast. you really learn how to deal with people and try to make a good store experience for the customers. willing to work around scheduling, good co workers, and solid management."
good,"Willingness to adapt to change."
good,It was a good job and I worked with awesome people. I just want something more physical. I liked how they accomidated to my working style.
good,"Typical work place need to be more organized. Need new management on overnight shift. Great for second employment, not for long term employment."
good,you always felt welcomed working at kohls they are always telling you how much you mean to the company. They always know how to have a good time. We are always having some kind of activities going on at work and outside of work.
good,"Working retail in khols was my first job and It kinda surprised me how much I liked it. There came a satisfaction from organizing things sort of felt like cleaning my room. Between that and helping customers locate things, most of the time when there was atleast a moderate amount of people in the store I wasn't bored."
good,"kohls is a great place to work but there is no room to move up. And i feel that i need a place to move up.My co-workers are great to work with, but the only thing i dont like is that im always away from my son.."
good,"I worked at Khols the longest and it was the best general experience I had. I learned a lot about time management, we had to prioritize tasks if places were too full and messy or the floor was unorganized or there were massive lines at the registers. It was a great learning experience. I had no trouble or any issues with any of the staff, the management was great and my co-workers were fun and inviting people. I would have worked there for a long time if not for the problem of hours. During the summer of 2015, I got very little hours, usually only 4 a week which wasn't enough. So I had to leave to find better work. I am very sad I had to part with Khols as that was the best place I have worked."
good,see how much product we had for the day. Management would give order and updates. Then we would divide into groups. Most of the co-workers was easy to get along. I learned to scan jewelry the last couple day I was there. I really enjoyed that a lot.
good,Personally kohl's is my favorite retail store Iv'e worked for so far. It puts a smile on my face when you see the employees and customers working together and making everyone's day easier.
good,greet customers as they entered the store and wait for customer. Ring up items and try to get them to get a Kohls card. If they would like to sign up proceed to show them what they needed until they are approved or not then give them a discount and send them off with a smile.
good,The job has very flexible hours. The managers are great and the people I work with are very friendly. Sometimes it can be busy but then other days we can be slow which is nice to get things caught up.
good,"Cleaned the department. "
good,"Worked as a cashier, checking out customers, some customer support, keeping work area clean and organized. The work was good, good hours, good breaks, fair treatment, and staff was nice."
good,"Initially started out as a cashier, then I was moved to being an associate in the different clothing departments of the store. I learned how to hang/fold merchandise, price it, mark it for weekly sales, and do store inventory twice a year. There was room for growth and advancement. I was promoted to supervisor over the shoe department. A typical day would be to come in overview the clothing department for misplaced merchandised and adjust accordingly. Make sure sale signs are in the proper area and legible. Do cashier work when a co-worker has to take a break, go to lunch or if the customer's line become too long and assistance is needed."
good,"While working at Khol's, I found I had a steady amount of work to do and was learning new tasks every week. I learned quickly and was able to move about my job with no problem. Sometimes there would be times when I would fix a section, leave to check another and come back within a minute and have to clean it again but that was part of the job. My managers were fun to talk with while working through the store. They helped me understand what I needed to do in order to get the job done right. Like all jobs, you're not going to like everyone but there were no real issues working with others than slight annoyance from time to time."
good,"The company was great to work for, because of its structure, training,pay to the work type and hours. most of all a family setting."
good,"Amazing work environment, Awesome management team and they play by state rules. They respect the employee and they do not take advantage. The pay is moderate. I work a lot of hours away from home but not enough on the compensation side."

Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"It's not a bad place to work as a part time job for extra cash, very laid bad, very fun environment. The coworkers and management were very friendly."
good,Great place as a summer job or seasonal. You are surronded by beautiful items and automacticly qualify for a 15 percent employee discount.
good,Kohl's is a very fast paced employer. They ship thousands of items a day. With the type of work the shifts went by quickly. Everybody was given their tasks and expected to keep a quota.
good,I learned the keys about fashion and the taste of clothing my customers had. I would enjoy the runway try ons in the dressing room I managed.
good,This was a fun and competitive work place. It was like being around family. Good management and organization. Always gave back to the community and had amazing events to attend.
good,"I love cashiering at Kohl's, the customers are the best!  My shifts go quick and there is always something to do.  On really busy weekends Kohl's will provide breakfast and lunch for all employees.  Since many of us only get 15 minute breaks this helps to keep us running."
good,Kohl's has a great atmosphere to learn and communicate with so many different people. you learn time management skills fast. sometimes handling difficult customers and situations can be challenging but it feels great when your able to make someone happy.
good,Kohls has the best Loss Prevention program. I started out in the bottom of the ladder and worked my way up the ladder with lots of help. If I was given the chance to work there again I would.

good,Great company but need to  increase pay rate  for employee. This company offer great discounts to its employees. Great place for work for college students.
good,"Dealt with customer complaints, returns, and exchanges, answered calls and direct calls to correct department, open Kohl's charge cards, cash handled, balanced cash drawer."
good,"This was a really great part time job, while going to school. They were very flexible with my schedule and understood that i was still a student."
good,I loved working for Kohl's. It was a fun place to work and the employees were all team-players. I miss it there but I am not looking to make a career in the retail industry.
good,"On a typical day all associates work as a team to provide the best customer service possible. I've learned that when they teach their associate's their motivating quote to all customers, that they really mean it. Their quote is ""YES WE CAN"" to ensure that all customers receive nothing but the best shopping experience.All associates working at Kohl's are very friendly and highly helpful. The management team always makes an effort to bond with associates."
good,A typical day changes daily. I come in and work in the department scheduled to work in. I have learned customer service skills along with managerial skills. The managers and co-worker are great. they are willing to help each other. The most enjoyable apart of my job is being around the public.
good,"A typical day at work includes many different areas and opportunities to experience different types of work. Depending on what department (ex.- sales floor) I start of by walking over to my department, determining how to take a plan of action. I clean out and empty all the dressing rooms, and make sure the dressing rooms are clean and presentable. I then organize all the clothing that needs to be delivered back onto the floor, and put them back in their proper places. Once I'm finished with running everything back i start to pick up the floor and fold all the clothing that are on the tables. While doing so, i confront customers asking if they need any assistance and provide as much information as possible. The hardest part is when I just can't keep up with all the clothing coming out of the fitting rooms. The easiest is when everything falls into place and you leave your department looking spotless."
good,At this job everyday was the same came in clocked in looked at my placement and I proceeded  to my register. the hardest thing about this job was being able to make and keep angry customers happy andd satisfied.
good,you clock in and then get your walkie talkie and you go to the section in the store that you are in. You clean and fold the cloths on the tables and youu take back returns and put them in the correct spot. You clean out the dressing rooms. You also help customers find thing they are looking for and if we dont have them you show them how to use the kiosk in the store.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"As a whole, Kohl's is an amazing company to work for. They strive to keep their employees with many perks, onsite and off site, including associate appreciation weeks, wearing jeans to the office every day, flex-time work schedules, fresh hot cookies once a week, wonderful cafeterias that have non-GMO, grass-fed, organic foods, bike share program, shuttle service, onsite banking and ATM, onsite postal services and partnerships with companies for dry cleaning, car services and much more."

good,"fold clothes "
good,Fun place to work they work with your school schedule and are very nice co worker. lot of standing on your feet. You do go backs make sure everything is organized and make sure you ask people about opening credit.
good,"A typical day working at Kohls would usually consist of helping anywhere from 25-100 customers in my department. Everyday there would be a different focus whether that be putting out new freight, moving items around, recovering my area and helping customers find what they are looking for. I have leaned many new things from this that i can use in the future such as; time management, communication amongst associates/customers, training and guiding new associates, how to use certain electronics, new insight on corporate functions, monitoring sales goals. My co workers and managers were amazing and almost always were there if i needed any assistance and i would say that is the most enjoyable part of the job because it made for a positive environment. The only hard part was on occasion when it was busy i was not able to get what i need to get done, done."
good,this job was really fun to be around and always keeps you busy the people are really nice and has good service and the managers are the best

good,GREAT PLACE TO WORK! I had a lot of fun working there. It was a very positive experience throughout the Christmas season.
good,I love working at kohls! THE employees and customers were great.Thew customers love the sales that kohls offer you with credfit card.
good,"Some days are better than others, as in any job. I have learned how to handle angry customers and to always leave my bad mood at the door. Always smiling and greeting every customer, finding what they came to the store to shop for and offering assistance where needed. Sometimes building or taking down sets, constantly folding or re-hanging clothing, occasionally early mornings or late nights for price adjustments or new clearance marks. It is always a team effort in such a low staffed store."
good,I enjoy working here i love helping people with what they need. I just enjoy it. it is amazing and fun place to work at. The employee's there are nice and it is easy work
good,"When I first started I loved the job. I was in the first training class, so I was so excited about working for such a great company. Kohls is wonderful, they try to help you find the work life balance with an onsite wellness center, a onsite EAP person, and not to mention a Cafe on site. The buildings are beautiful. Did I forget weekly pay plus monthly bonus? I loved working for the company. I can actually say that it is one of the best companies in DFW. The only real con is leadership. Some of the leaders have no real life work experience and are very short and rude. They are people that just graduated college or have military backgrounds that can never seem to look at things from different perspectives. Other than my run ins with those people it was great. I left only because I needed to handle some personal things and my leave of absence ended."
good,I dont work for kohls corporate but I do know that they do not know anything about the rules and regulations in the store.  But they offer a lot of jobs.
good,I had never worked in retail before and it is fun. I enjoy working with the public.  I take pride in keeping my work area clean and neat.  I have very reliable employees.
good,positive work environment. I enjoyed the day to day details that come with the retail field. As a suporviser I was responsible for opening the store and passing on any related duties to the other employees.
good,"A typical day at work is to manage 50+ associates and being able to multitask."
good,"Fun to work at, the envierment was very happy and motivating always around positive people . Makes meeting your companies goals easier"
good,"I worked there since 2005 and now since they moved the truck to the early morning, I am not working there for a long time.  But most of the staffs and managers are very friendly and listen to us."
good,"The team was very fun to work with; always had a blast. The only issue was the constant maintenance you had to obtain. Customers were very filthy left merchandise throughout the store; shopping carts, stock rooms, and counters. Overall, the company is great to work with; they work with your hours, provide various training, support charities, provide incentives, etc."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work, especially if you are out going."
good,it was a wonderful company to work for with awesome chances to move up in the company. the discounts are awesome also. They have very flexible scheduling.
good,It's pretty much what you would expect from Dept store retail. My location was nice since it was an experimental store it never got too bad.
good,A good day at kohls would be a slow day but it made the time go by slower. i learned to load trucks and stack boxes properly on the trucks. the managers were good and always kept an open mind and ear to what you wanted to do as far as takin time off or anything issues you were having on the job. The best part of the job was the work to me.
good,Great place to work if you like working at a fast pace. You gets lots of exercise. Friendly environment all around. Love all the merchandise it carries.
good,"A typical work day is fast paced and exciting. I have learned to handle different situations with various customers. i have also learned how to deal with customers who are not happy. the management are open to helping me learn new things and making sure I am properly trained on how to do my job, I help new co-workers learn their position by giving the proper buddy training. the hardest part about the job would be coupon situations, as rules to using them have changed. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the discounts tat are given  to the associates."
good,"A great work experience, fast place learning environment. I would recommend anyone to work here. Apply the discounts are awesome and the people as well."
good,Kohl's was a fun place to work. They work with your schedule and have a great discount for their employees. If I had the time I would work for this company again.
good,"everyone was happy, and glad to be there, was able to stay motivated with the great attitude that everyone had throughout the workday."
good,very flexible. work around your schedule. fast paced and wasy work. fun people that genuinely cRE about your wellbeing

good,"Great Store Management and Co-Workers... Very supportive... Good Work life Balance... Great Customer ""YES YOU CAN"" Policy... Employee development encouraged..."
good,"A typical day is very customer service driven. Handle cash, credit, debit purchases. The management is amazing. They truly care for their employees and the employees are very kind. The job is not hard, the hardest thing about it is getting customers to sign up for the Kohls credit card. Overall the job is very enjoyable. The customer interaction is the greatest."
good,"KFC was a simple and fun job. I was a cashier, and I provided excellent customer service. I would clean up the dining area and sweep, mop the floors."
good,I Loved working for kohls I just absolutely loved it. I Loved going to work I learned a lot of every department. Hardest part of my job was just keeping up with the area while busy other then that I loved it. I got to see new items before everyone else :)
good,"During my shift at work, I manage the fitting rooms insuring that all clothes are ran and put away. I assist any customers that may need any helping with merchandise in the store. Also, maintain a positive and friendly attitude to make the customers and associates feel welcome. Reply to any backup at the registers to assist the customers and my co-workers."
good,I enjoy assisting customers with a certain department or telling them what outfits and parts of clothing goes great with each other.
good,"A typical day consisted of keeping the shoe department clean, and tidy. Helping customers with any questions. The management were strict. The most enjoyable thing for me was dealing with shoes. I love shoes."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Kohl's is a great place to work.  Perfect if you like doing something different every day and always being busy.  The team atmosphere is great and the people I work with are amazing.
good,"In my six years working for Kohl's, I have thoroughly enjoyed it. We work as a team daily to complete tasks and to ensure our customers and their needs come first. They appreciate our contribution to the company and we are rewarded for a job well done. We are rewarded with days in which the company provides food for us to eat, days where we can wear jeans, and they actively acknowledge us when they observe us doing great things. "
good,"Unload trucks, organize merchandise pallets, and place items on shelves."
good,"Typical Work Day is fun, you learn something about the customers everyday. I became close to my co-workers within 2 weeks. Managers would answer any question you had."
good,Kohls likes to volunteer to help the less fortunate and help with the community.   Always helping animal shelters.  All supervisors are willing to help each other when needed.
good,A typical day at this job was fast paced and motivating. It was a work place where team work helped meet store goals on the daily basis.
good,"I have worked there for 8 years and I love the people I work, my fellow employee are like a family we look out for each other. I think that when you are dealing with the public it's the hardest part about working there."
good,I liked the early morning hours as a stock clerk you have the rest of the day to do what you want to and they pay every Friday.
good,I enjoyed my time at Kohl's. Just wish they could have offered me more hours as 4 hours a week does not allow one to survive. Kohl's was probably my most favorite of Black Fridays to work! I enjoyed that there was always something to do! I don't like having to just sit around and wait to be told to do something so having that freedom to just find something to do was nice.
good,Very good place to work as a college student. I've been able balance school and work because of the great management Kohl's has.
good,I really enjoyed this warehouse. The people were great and the hours were pretty good. The only thing bad about this specific wearehouse was that it was too crowded anda little unorganized. The schedules were sent out via telephone and you had to confirm your hours for the next day.
good,its a fun place to work. some of the managers are down to earth and funny. my co works are really nice and helpful. i have learned a lot working there.
good,Keep are clean and help customers with anything they need assistance with whatever they need help with and always stay busy
good,"Worked hard"
good,I loved working at  Kohl's.  It was an amazing environment with great management and coworkers.  I loved the atmosphere and working with the company.
good,This company provides associates with the proper tools and training to be successful in whatever job assignment may be given.
good,"I take care of the kids section at work, occasionally I work on the register. I work with a lot of good people and that makes it a nice place to work."
good,Working at Kohl's has provided me valuable knowledge on working the register and taking different forms of payment. Great place to work.
good,Kohls cares about people and has great customer service. Fun fast placed place to work and many locations to work full or part time.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I had a wonderful time working for kohls. I was a packer and worked with other fast energetic people. I had a good strong team and a great manager.
good,kohls works with you when it comes to scheduling issues and family issues and they care about what is going on with you and their willing to help out of your busy.
good,Wonderful place to work.  I have been working at Kohl's since October.  I was hired for seasonal work and they kept me on.  It has been a great experience.
good,The co-workers are helpful. There's always something to do. You learn how to solicit and to multi-task more. The hardest part is not getting everything done in one day. The most enjoyable thing is helping customers.
good,Your typical retail job. Kohl's was a pretty decent company to work for. Team was great! Flexible schedule was easy to work with.
good,"enjoyed working here.great location and the pay was acceptable, friendly and dependable staff. The only downfall to the job is the lack of hours"
good,Stocking new clothing. Great co- workers there were no hard parts on the job. I love the environment very fun. It was a good part-time position.
good,"Kohl's is an excellent company to work for.  "
good,"This was a part time job I did in the evenings/nights which involved putting up and taking down add signs.  This was a fun environment, this company was going to electronic pricing so my position was going away so I needed to move to another company"
good,"Arriving to work on time. Clocking in, grabbing an RF and a headset, checking your department for anything out of place, on the floor, and in the fitting rooms. You learn something new every day no matter what your job is. Management is pretty good, but then you have those managers that want nothing to do with you and make your life miserable because they just don't like you. All the co-workers at Kohl's are awesome, but you have those they like to be the bosses pet and in return, those are the ones that get higher up in positions. Some of us though like to be recognized for the work that we do on a daily basis with out being tight with upper management. The hardest part about the job is not being able to move up when other jobs in the store become available. The most enjoyable part of the job, is knowing that you did your job in helping a customer out and that customer going to management on a job well done."
good,The coworkers are always helpful and kind the customers are patient and easy to talk to. I definately reccommend as a firsr job or second job not as a full time thing
good,"When the store is busy, hours goes by fast. Everyone is friendly. Each department helps the other out. Scheduling is also flexible. You can switch hours with other people but only if they are in your department or trained for your department."
good,I learned mostly how to deal with tough customers with skill and poise . The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to put a smile on a customers face as they leave the store each day.
good,"I worked for Kohl's for a few years. I mainly worked there when I was on break from college. I worked the cash registers during the hours I worked there. The work environment was healthy, but there was a lack of communication on occasion. It is a great company for someone to work for and I would recommend Kohl's to other potential employees."
good,"•	Lead multiple sales floor departments."
good,"Amazing atmosphere, helpful co-workers, great work/life balance. Company is always looking for development from within."
good,I worked there shortly after high school and it was a very good place to work. There were multiple areas to work if you like to be well rounded.
good,"good place to work, but no hours for associates to work with liitle chances for advancement. excellent place to work with great discounts."
good,Busy working days.I learnt management skills.Good co-workers.Hardest part keeping schedule for several projects.Enjoyable part working on contracts and tenders
good,"The typical day at Kohls was very fast paced. Always on the move..I found there was never enough time in the day."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"it had good management, very fun environment to work in, the people are fun to work with, I really didn't have anything bad happen in this job"
good,"I was thrilled to work in the fine jewelry department. Customers wanted to complement their outfits with that certain piece of jewelry, or ensemble. It was a fun place to work."
good,The kohls team is very fun to work with and at the same time very productive. They are willing to teach you and allowing us to grow with the company.
good,"Normally everything is very fast paced because we want to be quick and efficient while checking people out. Some times it can be frustrating when we have a long line of customers at check out and customers can get a little impatient as they wait for another register to open up. My favorite part of the job is when I can please a customer whether it's by helping them find a product, saving them money with a discount, etc. I also enjoy the people I work with because most of them work hard and as a team."
good,"Be on time, give great customer service, enjoy what I do. The hardest part of my job is dealing with customers that are not happy. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to meet and satisfy customers request. Management loves me and wish that I could be cloned because what ever task I am giving I complete in a timely manner and ask for little assistance in the process. All my co-workers adore me, many of them said I should be management because of my work ethics. I would make a great ASSET to any company I work for."
good,The managment staff are all very supportive of employees when it comes to work hours or home life. They work well with your outside schedule and activities. It is a job that I enjoy very much.
good,"A typical day at Kohl's involved customer service, changing tasks and working to the best of ones ability keeping the store clean and well stocked. I learned to move in both a fast paced and well organized enviroment and a multi-tasked situation that showed up more than once a day. Co-workers and management encouraged one's best abilities and supported each other when required to assist in more busy situations. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to assist a customer and working well with other co-workers."
good,"Worked at Kohl's during the Holliday season as a temporary employee. Since I was a seasonal employee, training was limited. Management offered assistance to assist in completing tasks. Operating the cash register was the most difficult aspect of the job. I did enjoy assisting customers in choosing items in the Jewelry Department."
good,Kohl's is a great place to work. If you work hard you can grow and move up with the company but it is not easy. The only down side is the lack of benefits for majority of the employees. It is a fun place to work if you keep a smile on your face and truly care about pleasing your customer.
good,"Goals for work were to have customer sign up for store credit card. I was able to meet positive, fun, and honest co-workers."
good,My time at Kohls would have lasted much longer were it not for the inconsistent hours.
good,"typical day at work consists of stocking shelves and making sure customers can find what they need. Management is outstanding, the co workers i have are very friendly hardest part of the job is telling a customer that we are out of an item they have been looking for. most enjoyable part of my job is making peoples shopping experience great"
good,Love working there and do what i made to do and when a customer is happy it makes my day....
good,"Each day I worked with providing good customer service to each and every customer."
good,"A typical day is helping my customers find the right merchandise to brighten their homes. I work mainly in home and kids deparment selling items like rugs, cloths, bedding sets, bath goods, and so on. I have learned how to match colors for a beautiful presentation. My management is great to work with and I couldn't imangine a day at work without my awesome team. The hardest part of my job is working the customer service desk where i have to tell customers i cant help them with their problem. Most enjoyable part is watching my customers leave smiling."
good,"Kohl's was a great place to work for, the discount was good too."
good,A great company to work for the people and love replenishment.
good,"great place to gain employment, but you will always start out seasonal, no guarantee for permanent employment. but i do enjoy working here."
good,Have to be a people person and a excellent multi-tasker. I love working here I have learned alot about customer service and merchandising retail products.Remember to keep a friendly inviting smile and to always be helpful to all shoppers.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"A typical day at work i would come in greet other employees, get geared up , and start cleaning and putting away clothes in the correct departments starting by size. I've learned retail skills in many different work areas in my job, such as how to handle jewelry, making phone calls and answering phones and ringing out customers on the register system. Management just says hi and makes sure that you know what department to work in for the day/evening. The hardest part of my job i'd say would honestly is dealing with the other co workers , but i've learned to just say hello and do my work and not worry about every one else's social life. The most enjoyable part of the job i would have to say is being there to help the customers and getting the job done correctly."
good,"co-workers are great very team-happy "
good,Great for a college student not looking for a lot of hours. Time off when you need it.
good,typical day included unloading company trucks then reporting to the overnight supervisor and find the specific task for the night.
good,"Good place for advancement, caring and laid-back company culture"
good,"Kohl's provides a wonderful environment to learn new people and utilize skills. A typical day included processing payments, purchases, and returns. Co-workers make Kohl's a wonderful place to work. Management was kind; however, favoritism was rampant. Soliciting Kohl's credit cards was a very important aspect of the job."
good,I worked at a khols they were just opening and it was ok for the first couple of months but some supervisors were crazy! I watched one knock a whole line of sweaters down because the employee wasn't folding them right. I stayed for a few months then was gone.
good,"assist customers with cash and credit transactions, while meeting the credit goal."
good,"My department had a great rhythm, which resulted in accomplishing a lot of company goals"
good,every day was a new experience. A lot of price changes and good deals.
good,"Good place ot work, pay was not the best. Good palce to work pay was not the best."
good,"I love the shopping perks you get as a KOHL'S employee, however calling people to collect money is not designed for me I've learned after being with the company for over 6 months."
good,"great place to work"
good,cash register handling help to meet customer satisfactory
good,Great place to work for friendly.fast paced environment active and engaged management.
good,"Learned proper costumer service, good management, flexible hours"
good,Working there was as expected. The co workers were nice and pleasant.
good,"fun work. can be stressful at times. pay ok, decent chance of advancement."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Good management, great co-workers. Not guaranteed 40hrs, no overtime, hours very every week from shift to shift,"
good,"I worked as a supervisor of various departments (at different times), so my experience varied from month to month, but much of it involved helping customers with specific problems. I learned how to provide great customer service while ensuring that I make my company look good and make our clients happy. Management changed frequently; for the most part the store was managed well, though occasionally certain managers seemed to crack under the stress of managing a large store. Co-workers came and went as well (as is common in retail) but they usually had a good attitude and made it a fun work environment. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep everyone (employees and customers) happy during the difficult holiday season (also being forced to listen to ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"" over and over again throughout the season). The best part of the job was meeting and cooperating with many people, and having a store large enough that there was plenty to learn."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of ringing up customers, cash counting down drawers at the end of the night and light cleaning. "
good,"Working for Kohl was definitely a great company to work for. Each day you meet new people, and help them with the yes we did policy. Management was fair, hardest part of the job was sometimes the customers but I loved helping people and having customers leaving highly satisfied."
good,I  worked for Kohl's for five years and I love my job because I get to help someone other than myself.  My daily routine consists of restocking the main floor and checking price tags to make sure that all merchandise is properly labeled and helping customers in and around my assigned area when needed. In five years I have learned different managerially skills on how to be a better individual within a team.  When I began working for kohl's I was a part time shoe associate while going to school. Kohl's has helped in developing my communication skills and made a better team player of me.  The hardest part of a days work is not enough time to complete task when given  assignments. What puts a smile on my face is helping someone when they've had a trying day at work and I can put a smile on there face.
good,"A typical day at work would be clocking in, and then grouping up to hear our numbers from the previous day. After this, we are assigned a door/trailer to unload. We sometimes work in pairs as well. It was really a great experience and an amazing work out if you got heavier boxes. My co-workers were great people and really down to earth. The hardest part of the job is probably not to watch the clock on a slow day. The easiest and most enjoyable part would have to be that we are aloud to have headphones and listen to music."
good,"Typically, I would clock in, and report to my department. I have learned, how to work an inventory gun, and how to pace my events. Management was very organized. Except- when invalid points were being added.The hours and flexibility gave me the ability to work at Kohl's Warehouse. My co- workers worked hard. The hardest part of my job was working in the Pick- Mod because, it is hot. As time went along, the benefits of working ""Part- Time Flex"" decreased, and the times changed. Being that I am a full time student, the flexibility was the benefit of working Part- Time Flex. Along with, the work hours given when I began working at Kohl's. I loved when Kohl's surprised associates with dinner, and lunch."
good,"Most work days you have lots of interaction with different people."
good,I really love meeting customers and getting to know there faces and get to know about there lives. I love helping people in the work place.
good,"I was hired as a part time customer service associate and after one month I was promoted to the full time Administrative Assistant position. I processed payroll / attendance daily, scheduling, managed workload distribution for 100+ associates and executives, and  maintained associate and OSHA files according to state and company  guidelines. I kept a high level of confidentiality, selected applicants/ set up interviews, aided in training, prepared/ administered disciplinary documentation, and practiced conflict resolution when necessary. I am highly proficient in Word, Excel, Assets, Kronos, etc. I also organized several “Employee Appreciation” events, such as themed food days and holiday parties to boost store moral."
good,"Between working on projects, answering phone, helping customers, and checking people out at the register, you get to learn several different skills with this company. At Kohl's you learn how to merchandise properly, set up displace, and greet customers with them being the number one priority. You learn register skills and other computer skills."
good,"A typical day at work involves a lot of customer interactions and lots of walking and standing on your feet. I have definitely learned how to work quickly and refine my multitasking skills. Management is okay, they're not always on the same page when it comes to delegating tasks from most important to least important, but the ""Yes we can"" culture is supported when it comes to most customer interactions. My co-workers are very friendly and take their work seriously while on the clock. The hardest part is trying to complete other tasks that are not customer oriented (i.e. restocking and recovering the sales floor). The most enjoyable part is interacting with different people and personalities."
good,"greet customers as they walked into the store, help with any size they needed, fitting room, picking up items off the floor to have a safe environment for the customers."
good,"Helpful managers, fun atmosphere and lots of training!!! I did have a difficult time advancing in the company. That was the reason I quit."
good,I really made a lot of friends outside of work when I worked there.  Emplyees were trated well and I really enjoyed working threre.
good,"Open registers, count money, daily deposits, audits, research shortage"
good,Typical day is making sure the visuals of the beauty and jewlery department are properly displayed. Assist consumers with product purchase and knowledge. Ive learned to always assist in every department and be helpful in any area I was needed. I was pretty much a floater. My managers could use me anywhere but my main areas where beauty and jewelry depeartment
good,great customer service. team work was outstanding.Answer phones and handled Customers returns and exchanges.
good,"Kohl's is probably the best overall part-time job I have ever held."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,A typical day at work is always providing customer services. I have learned that I have a great passion in helping others which has lead me to purse a teaching position in the near future. the management is great and they all try their best working environment for their employers. I have some of the greatest co-workers ever. Each individual is a enjoyment to work with. The hardest part about working in a department store is he busy holidays. The most enjoyable part about my job is to see customers leave satisfied about choosing Kohl's as they're choice of shop.
good,"good working environment"
good,A typical work day for me was bagging. I learned how to better deal with upset or angry customers. Management was very nice but could be very stern. Co-workers are very nice. My job was not very difficult it was bagging. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting my check at the end of the week.
good,"I liked how there was always something to do, and also how managers were so friendly and encouraging."
good,"My typical 6-8 hour day usually consists of maintaining fitting rooms, relieving others for their breaks at jewelry or at the registers. I have learned quite a lot working at Kohl's, such as merchandising, opening up and talking to random customers, and using a cash register. I love all my managers and I feel as if we all get along great. Also, I get along fantastic with most of my co-workers. I have made many new friends. However, the hardest part of my job would have to be maintaining everything by myself on really busy days. I love working alone, but on            busy days I feel that not enough help is provided. Then, the most enjoyable part would be meeting people and helping them find new clothes that make them feel good and give them self-confidence."
good,"A typical day at work for a register associate involves checking out customers, keeping your station clean, and recovering the surrounding departments while working with your fellow associates and managers to provide the customer with the greatest shopping experience possible."
good,"	-Cashier"
good,Awesome culture! Great management team! Fun people to work with!
good,from the customers to the management there is always a demand for work
good,such a good place to work at. Fellow co-workers were really friendly making me feel welcome and happy.
good,"•	Responsible for the upkeep of my assigned department.                              "
good,"The great thing about working for this company was the fact that there was always something to do! If recovery in your department was clean, there would always be at least one other that still needed recovery by the end of the night. I would be in charge of usually the juniors department and would have every piece of merchandise sized and color coordinated by the end of my shift. My coworkers and management team were awesome for the most part and were a pleasure to work with. Though its been quite a few years since I was employed there, I still keep in touch with those I worked with."
good,paid well and worked with great employees. never had a problemthe time that i worked here.
good,I would show up to work go to the semi trailer i was working on for the day and start to unloaded it unto a conveyor belt
good,"When I worked at Kohls I genuinely enjoyed the experience. The employees were friendly and helped me to acclimate myself to the working environment. I was properly trained and my managers made sure I was completely sure of myself before leaving me on my own. The hardest part of the job would have to be learning about the sales that were going on, but I eventually came to memorize them all. The most enjoyable part of the job was being a cashier. It involved working with people up front and time tended to go by much quicker. Overall I enjoyed working at Kohls and I wouldn't mind working there again."
good,very good place to work if your young or in high school.  your always standing on your feet for long periods of times
good,I enjoy working their great emplyees and manager great benfit and discounts
good,"Typical day at work for entry level part time employees is either working at Check Out or if you're on the truck team Unloading frieght for the first half of you're shift and then merchandising product on the floor or back stocking product in the stock room. As far as what I've learned I'd say primarily retail basics like how to properly interact and help customers, how to work as a cashier, and how to stock and back stock merchandise. Management has been for the most part very accommodating, however I feel like employee training is rather lackluster and aside from core work concepts a lot of what you will pick up about the job will come from fellow employees. This also causes you to have to have some awkward encounters with customers when they ask you to assist with something and you can't because of you're lack of knowledge, this makes for an unfortunate situation where both the employee and customer can end up feeling dissatisfied. The co-workers are often very helpful and as said before can be more helpful in learning the ropes then the management team even. Hardest part of the job for me are night shifts which seems to have a general malaise to it and morale isn't very high and everyone just seems tired and wanting to be at home already. Most enjoyable part would probably be breaks with co-workers once you've been able to meet a few you have things in common with. My main complaint would be that the hours you have a week and days that you work fluctuate week to week and it isn't ideal if your going to school or have some other important hobby or activity to attend to."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Point of Sale and Customer Service Associate-Assist customers with purchases, returns and any questions they may have. Additional duties at times included making sure everyone’s breaks and lunches were covered along with helping push to meet our credit and email goals for the day. I also was a certified jewelry associate."
good,Like the work that i do here and hope to move up int he company.
good,A great place to work at and everyone gets along. A great work management and great customers.
good,I enjoyed spending time with my fellow employees during the short time I worked there. I learned a lot about myself and my work ethic along with how well I work with others. Management was fair and gave me decent hours even though I was only seasonal. Hardest part of the job was taking my break and bagging clothes was the most enjoyable part.
good,"Coworkers were very nice and friendly to work with.  Customers wer nice and friendly. Assisted with keeping the produce depatment clean, putting out fruit and salads for the food bar as well as run the register"
good,I  mostly  work  two to three days a week from 5am to eleven am unloading and merchandising trucks. I learned how to work fast paced and how to adapt to my work environment. Coworkers I work with  are fun and loving are amazing to work with. My most enjoyable part of the job is putting the merchandise to the floor for the customers to enjoy.
good,"Kohl's has versatility in hours - very flexiable on that. Great discount for employess. Also, they sponsor Kohl's cares programs which we all play a part of by volunteering our time for every event we work"
good,Great working environment. The staff was awesome. I learned how to refund the customers money as well as any returns they may have had.
good,"It's great to work here. I have no problems here, the people are great, and everyone is open for new ideas."
good,"I enjoyed working at Kohl's. the hardest part was waking up and unloading the truck in the morning. it was a minor work out i enjoyed. "
good,I had a blast working here. The best thing was talking to the clients and being able to clam them down
good,You're always busy. Management organize the your work hours.Good work environment
good,"Talking to customers everyday, I enjoyed that because I am a people person. Cleaning up the departments. Sometimes it would get messy but, with some help the mess gets cleaned up fast. My co-workers were helpful they helped with whatever I needed help with. The best thing about this job was help customers, I loved helping them and bringing a smile on their face."
good,I got hired on right before the back to school sales. this time of year was very busy.
good,We would work together to unload the freight and processes it to prep it for the sales floor. Then work the freight to the shelves and customer service. Management was good. The hardest thing to do was to wake up early. I got payed and worked with a good gourp of people.
good,open up the registers. i was the head cashier i got the most people to sign up for a kohls credit card. I learned definitely my customer service skills from here. i got moved around a lot whenever they needed someone in a different area. i answered phones and also dealt with returns. some customers came in angry but my goal was to always try to get a smile or laugh out of them knowing that i did something right. my manager who was a girl was amazing she showed me the ropes to keep moving me up in the company and teaching me new ways to do things such as when i moved up i had to learn how to count out the registers make sure the money in the registers was correct and how to close them down also train the new hires on how to treat customers and make them feel like youve known them forever always carry on a conversation with them.
good,"Working at Kohl's was an experience. I learned that all of the Kohl's Company's compete. A typical day would be standing at the register and just checking out customers, plain and simple. The most enjoyable part would be when it got busy."
good,"In a position to make decisions that help."
good,Kohl's has given helped me improve in my customer service skills as well as communication and team building. They enable me to give whatever it takes to satisfy the customer without hesitation.

It was fun participating in the remodeling of 4 stores and i enjoyed the responsibility with some work projects. My fellow coworkers were wonderful and gained close friendships with good people."
good,"This was the job that put me through school. I unloaded trucks, stocked merchandise, set the ad, and customer service."

good,Great place to work. Structure with in management is strong.
good,Some co- workers are good to work with. The work can be fast pace but it makes the time go by fast. I think its good that we have two 22 minute breaks.
good,a typical day for me would be i come in go back to the break room to clock in and put my things in my locker. after i clocked in i would then find the manager on duty or the supervisor and find out where they needed me. after i got to my position i would then begin checking costumers out and send them home happy.

good,"We come in and get started working right away. A lot of times we always know what we are suppose to and get right down to work. Everyone is friendly many of the coworkers are close friends and a lot of times the management allows us to do fun things based on performance. I.e longer breaks, lunches, money compensation based on soliciting credits or rewards."
good,"A typical day at work is normally fast paced and fun!"
good,"Well managed and easy work environment. Many of the employees are elderly or young. Very consistent labor and hours are a bit sporadic, but overall a good place to work"
good,Typical days included supplies were ready for display by supervisor and help was available when needed by co-workers and supervisors. The hardest part of the job was standing for a long  period of time. The most enjoyable part was being able to work by myself at my own pace and being able to see the upcoming sales before the public.
good,On a typical day at kohl's I cleaned out the fitting rooms. Kept the store looking nice and presentable. I backed up registers when needed and gave great customer service. The hardest part of the job was telling customers that we don't have an item in their size that they really wanted. The most enjoyable part was working great as a team with my co-workers to keep up the hard work.
good,"As a manager at Kohl's corporate, I feel empowered to make decisions, to partner with associates to brainstorm ideas to streamline processes and improve workflow.  My co-workers act as a team and redistribute work as needed to meet deadlines. The most enjoyable part of the job is to ensure the office runs smoothly, all the associates have what they need to do their jobs and, in the end, to see the quality work we create printed and used by our customers.  It is also important to know that our company contributes to the community.  The hardest part of the job is the work / life balance. The consistent 10 - 11 hour days does not align with my personal goals."
good,"Friendly atmsophere"
good,loading the boxes in trailer till its full. also scanning and sending items down the line for loaders. management very helpful.
good,learned alot of cashier things friendly co workers always moving never steady in a place
good,I love the relationships that Kohl's workers have with each other.  Everyone works for a common goal and there is a true team spirit.
good,"Everyday was a balancing act, but enjoyable. Engaging customers, meeting new people all the time - both customers and new team members. Managers work with you and do well with recognizing your efforts. Associates work as a team in and out of work as we spend many hours a month doing volunteer work for children's organizations."
good,"Most days consisted of working in one's given department of the store. One would be asked to stock merchandise, assist customers, and occasionally working cashiers up front when they were backed up. Both management and co-workers were great and made the environment much easier when things were stressful. The hardest part of the job was working weekends that would get very hectic."
good,"Friendly atmosphere."
good,My typical day at work starts when I come into the store and i see the smile of my coworkers. I greed and smile at customers and have the attitude it will be a great day. My manager will go over with me for the daily goal of credit cards and sales that are for that day.The hardest part of my job is that I had to learn as soon as I enter the work place to leave my personal problems behind that door. My most enjoyable part of my job is to learn every day something new.
good,A typical day at Kohls was I had to go in very early to unload the merchandise off the trucks and organize them in the designated rack or shelf and then take the merchandise out to the sales floor for display. I learned better organization skills and the layoout of the store as well as how to properly organiz things out on the sales floor when laying out the merchandise. My co-workers were fast and fun to be around and talk to especially helpful for me when some of the workers who had been there longer than I had would assist me when I had trouble finding the correct spot for some merchandise. The hardest part of my job was to remember where everything went as Kohls is a big store it takes some getting used to when laying out merchandise. The most enjoyable part of this job was the customers and the satisfied feeling of helping them find something they could not locate.
good,"I enjoyed working for kohl's as a company, the people I worked with were very nice, and I feel this company is wonderful."
good,A typical day as a dept. supervisor is coming in checking your department and freight.  Keeping the sales floor and fitting rooms clean and organized. Always making sure the customer is highly satisfied!

good,They didn't not give enough hours to support my income need each month.
good,Kohls is a great place to work and I have learned great work habits.
good,By working at Kohl's made me wish I would had started my career path workimg in retail.
good,"Helping customers with picking out merchandise was a typical day and i learned that you have regular people that shop are very helpful as well.Management was okay for the short time i was there and they was pretty much on task,I was not from Winston Salem, NC so i got to know a lot of new people.The hardest part of the job was having customers you could never please,No matter what you did.The most enjoyable was being able to shop when the big sales hit."
good,"Over all working when I did work for Kohl's distribution center was a good experience, I was a strong team player, they would have morning stretch before the work started on each shift, would have monthly meetings with different members from managers, supervisors and leads, felt that everyone one was on board with the work at Kohl's."

good,"Unload the truck and put stock on the floor. Great people. Good hours, and flexible with scheduling. "
good,"I enjoyed working there, because the environment is professional, but not much room for advancement."
good,"Other than holiday work days a typical day is slow. We are supposed to constantly maintain a working pace, but most of the time there can be absolutely nothing to do but pretend to clean what's already done."
good,"Wonderful and friendly people to work with. Very flexible schedule."
good,"Very busy especially around holidays, but relatively easy. Most of the managers worked hard and helped a lot. Overall a good work experience for a dept. store."
good,"Work as a sales associate and work keeps you busy from assisting customers, fulfilling stock both on sales floor in back, keeping department neat looking, you put in a full day. Store management is fair to me but sometimes need to crack down on those not pulling weight or are poor workers. Co-workers I get along fine with and enjoy most of them. The one's I don't are the ones who don't pull their weight. Hardest part of job is number tasks that are sometimes put in front of such as completing projects, keeping department clean and providing quality customer service. Most enjoyable is helping customers out."
good,"Typical work days were stress free, customers were great. Management was great and easy to reach when i had a question. Very friendly and supportive staff."

good,"To assist Kohl's customers with decision making about purchases, returns, and soliciting Kohl's charge credit cards. Kohl's have taught me how to multi-task and give great Customer Service. Kohl's management allow the me to make desions without pejudice. I enjoy working with my co-workers because of the different cultures and personalities and backgrounds. The hardest part of my job is not being perfect becuase I am a perfectionist. The most enjoyable part of my job to know that the customer was very satisfied with the outcome of our conversations or my suggestions. "
good,i enjoyed the job. the pay left something to be desired though
good,A good place to work very understanding when it comes to your family and flexible scheduling
good,"I've worked at Kohl's for six years now and I have never had to worry about losing my job. I love the people I work with but hate the job I have to do. Management doesn't tend to listen to input, but things have been getting better lately at my store. I have learned to respect people and take time to listen to their needs and wants. The hardest part of the job is cleaning up after other people. The most enjoyable part is the co-workers."
good,slow at times but for the most part its fast paced good people there
good,"This job can get rather boring if you are a POS (cashier), but it is a good job for those who like consistency, great benefits for a retail job, management is very nice and treats workers with respect, fairly typical schedule even though it can change from week to week.  "
good,"A typical day of working freight is good physical activity. You take pride in your work stocking the merchandise, and it makes the time go by rather quickly. Management is part of the team and on the floor working with you. It is a great way to experience multi-tasking and heightening your ability to complete given tasks while having a few interruptions. "
good,"oh so wonderful. actually it's terrible. I'm being forced by Indeed to fill out this form in order to verify my email address. Just goes to show you, people don't like being tricked into doing things. Don't work at kohls."
good,I enjoyed being a supervisor at Kohl's. I was in a leadership role that allowed me to mentor others and also gave me responsibilities over my departments inventory in which I always met and was recognized for my accomplishments.  
good,"Great co-workers, flexible schedules and lots of freedom.  "
good,I enjoyed my time at the company and would love to work there again if the opportunity presents itself.
good,"A fun company to work for and one that tried to do what was best for their employees.  Your input was heard and taken in consideration.  Questions were answered in a timely manner if you had concerns. They took care of their employees as far as benefits, other concerns employees may have had that affected their job.  ex...childcare issues, problems on the outside that might have an impact on their employment.  Had weekly meetings and kept employees involved with how things were going with the company, etc."
good,"Awesome management, very understanding with school, great employees and customers. Around Christmas customers will get a little mean but that's a given with retail. Most of the time Kohl's is a great place to work for college students."
good,"I don't remember to much, but I do remember having lots of fun with coworkers and management when working there. Everyone is friendly and helpful. It was very easy to make long lasting friendships."
good,"I worked in the Misses, Juniors and Mens clothing department, I would clean out the fitting rooms, return merchandise back to appropriate area, and backed up as cashier when needed. I had the best co-workers, they were there to help when things got to hectic. Hardest part of the job was Christmas season and it was sometime chaotic. My favorite part of the job was working with my co-workers, the teamwork was just fantastic. There were a few management issues, but overall they were helpful."
good,"Stocking trailers for 10 hours a day is not fun and can be very tiring, but it was pretty good money."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Seasonal job. Was glad when it was over. It was kind of boring as well.
good,Typical day at work is when we reach our high sales and everyone is happy.
good,"A typical work day at Kohl's for a sales associate is doing a service lap to help any customers in need or have questions, then making sure all the fitting rooms are cleaned and empty, which means getting all the clothes hanging them and filing them back onto the floor neatly.This is the repetitive part of my day because when I take clothes out of the fitting rooms another customer may come in with 10 other clothing items and then I have to do the same thing with those. Also backing up at the registers if the lines are becoming too long. Then running errands for the cashiers that can not leave the register. Afterwards I start organizing the floor and do rack recovery which is being detail oriented on what supposed to be on certain racks."
good,"Kohl's was a great place to work if you are interested in retail. I was a part of the management team and as a team we worked very well together. We had a common goal of reaching certain sale numbers everyday and we all worked together to achieve this goal while enjoying the prescience of each other. The responsibilities include managing the operations of the store from the time it opens to the time it closes. Working with the corporate office and making sure their business plan is coordinated with what is happening in the retail floor. The hardest part of the job is the randomness of the hours. You will work some nights, some mornings, some afternoons and during the weekends. It makes it hard to plan for things and you have to be willing to sacrifice time. It is also fast paced and you have to be really work with the customers."
good,"great team, and atmosphere but at the end of the day it still isn't enough to take care of living expenses"
good,I worked here part time for a year and enjoyed many of my coworkers. There realy wasn't anything hard with being a cashier - just help meet the goals set by the company each day and management loves you.
good,"Good Job, Hard Workers. Unloading Trucks As A Team, Taking And Putting Up Parts Of The Store. Good Management."
good,"Fast paced, had to be organized, friendly and work well with others."
good,Great company to work for in a fun environment. Work with people who enjoy their jobs and to have fun while still being productive. Ability to learn every aspect of the job that I wanted to learn.
good,This job is good for your first job or as a second job. Don't depend on this job for only income.
good,"Recovered Women’s, Men’s and Kids Department."
good,"During a typical day at Kohl's, I was consistently straightening and re-folding clothing on racks and tables. I have to always be available to help customers find a certain item or size in the section that I was assigned to that particular day. I was on my feet for the majority of the day but it was bearable because I was always moving. The staff was big, so I didn't know everyone but they were all very nice."
good,"A typical day at work would be working in the Home and Kids department. Recovering anything that needs to recovered, making it neat for the customers. There would be times managers would ask me to work on the register also. Doing so I learned how to ring up customers, and actually got pretty good at it. My co-workers were very friendly and gave me great advice. The hardest part of my job was not getting as many hours as I wanted but, I also take what I can get and work even harder to get more. The most enjoyable part about the job was the fact everyone worked together to get the job done and went above and beyond to make the customers happy. That is the number one priority."
good,"I enjoyed when we had busy days with long lines of customers because it kept me busy and on my feet. I liked interacting with the customers and being able to ask questions to my co-workers , they were very helpful and we were able to help each other accomplish goals for the day. I learned a lot about how to use the cash register and how to interact with customers and make sure they found everything they were looking for and that they had a positive shopping experience. The hardest part of the job was when customers had a problem with the policies we had to follow and did not believe me when I told them certain things about coupons, and trying to get them to believe me but I usually had to get a manager or someone else."
good,I grab one of the U-boats and go out to the floor and stock things. I learned how to stock many things at one time in a fasted paced. The management there was very well organized. My Co-Workers were very helpful and fun to work with. Making sure I completed all my tasks throughout the day but I usually always finished. The new people I got to meet.
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work. Awesome people, great environment"
good,have a great working relationship with co-workers
good,"On a typical day, I would change batteries and watchbands, restock the display cases, keep the area clean and orderly. I learned how to change a watchbands and batteries for the customers when they need to be changed. I got along with the management personel and my co-workers. the hardest part of the job was to ask for help with a watchband or opening the back of a watch to change a battery. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the look on the face of a customer when they found the item that they were looking for."
good,Management is awesome
good,"A typical day was maintaining the department and assisting customers. I learned how the logistics of a retail store very well at Kohls. Management and the co-workers were great, friendly, and hard workers. The hardest part was department maintenance, but the enjoyable part was simply the atmosphere with the customers and my co-workers."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Working a day at Kohl's was challenging but fun. I enjoyed being surrounded with many new task and friendly co-workers. I was glad i served as a seasonal cashier for Kohl's and have gained experience with customer service. The hardest part of this work environment was trying to keep the store shelves well organized from the holiday shoppers. I was very pleased with the outcome of being an employee of Kohl's because I helped make sales.
good,Great retail store with a family environment.
good,"Kohl's always has opportunities for advancement and strong communication between managers and supervisors. Work involves merchandising and filling the department, keeping fitting rooms and sales floor clean, and completing paperwork. The hardest and least enjoyable part of the job is putting back the clothing from the fitting rooms. The best part of the job is when you are able to assist and help customers so they leave happy."
good,I enjoy working at Kohls for the most part. You need to be ready to work though because it is fast moving and there are high levels of expectation at least at my store. I also feel that the benefits for part time employees can't be beat. I work with a lot of good people and we try to make the best of every situation.
good,"I learned more about the retail career, also customer service. Co workers were enjoyable as well as the environment. Hardest part of my work was to clean up after customers, but it made the time past by."
good,Worked part time as a cashier. I was able to take on many other positions when needed which made the job more interesting.
good,i got to meet a lot of people. i learned how to be neat and organized. my managers very firm but fair.
good,"My typical day at work is indeed great, I love what I do.."
good,"Generally at work we unload freight from trucks, load them back up with defectives, returns, and recyclables, process the freight, and put together as well as break down fixtures for the sales floor. My immediate supervisor and co-workers are great hard-working people and we all have a lot of fun working together as well as motivating and educating each other. The hardest part of the job is maintaining areas in the back-stock of the store and the sales floor because there is no personal accountability and it falls on the freight team to pick up the pieces. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the people I work with, they are really fantastic."
good,"Running cash register, greet customers, clean out dressing rooms, put things where they belong, make sure departments & sales floors were presentable & clean, customer service."
good,"I usually start out by checking and cleaning the dressing rooms , then make sure everything is off the floor. After thats all done i begin to refold the shelves. My co-workers are pretty hard working for the most part , they do what is expected . The hardest part of the job , in my opinion , would be dealing with rude customers. i havent gotten many rude customers but ive seen some of my co-workers deal with them and it looks frustrating , but its nothing that can be handled with a smile and a positive attitude ."
good,"A typical day at Kohl's consisted of customer interaction, customer service, sales techniques, cashiering, and of course having a decent sense of fashion helped all of that as well! I learned a lot about promoting sales. My manager and co-workers were very friendly, positive, and customer oriented. The hardest part was using the sales techniques when I first got hired because I was nervous and shy at first, but once I got use to it, it was a piece of cake. I very much enjoyed interacting with the customers and talking about clothes and sales all day!"
good,The management staff dont really talk to each other but they are nice people to work with. The breaks are flexible. I enjoyed working with my co-workers.
good,"I enjoyed working at Kohls. I only worked part time,but it was a fun learning experience,and I had really nice coworkers."
good,Ive only been employed three weeks.Learning a different style of management.My assigned time to work is the pm shift and i dont have much people contact.AD SET is new to me and it dose not give me the privllage to show my years of mnagement skill`s and great customer service.All retail seems to take on a new approach.It`s like the days of the old penney candy store has come to a end.
good,A typical workday at Kohl's Distribution Center was great. I learned how to perform Material Handling duties. Management was great; very respectful individuals. Co-workers were great. The job was physical but not hard. I enjoyed Kohl's almos everyday the atmosphere was positive.
good,best job I had. I loved working there and this was usually where I shopped.
good,Change requests for POS personnel
good,A typical day at work would take a lot of patience considering one is working with the public. The company is very flexible and family-oriented. I have had an overall great experience working at Kohl's.

Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I really liked Kohls distribution. the co workers were great and the mangement with the company was very understanding of the associates needs. The company started a big construction and the hours were being cut and couldn't survive on that so moved to job with more hours.
good,I ran the intimate apparel dept. I was in charge of putting up ad sets for uncoming sales and when I wasn't busy I would help out the cashiers if they got backed up with customers. The most enjoyable part of this job was corporate would compliment on how organized and clean the dept. looked.
good,"fast pace, customer service is number 1, nice staff, 2 weekends off a month"
good,Job is relatively easy can get stressful during sales events.
good,even though it was short lived I had fun and recommend others to try
good,"A typical day at work would consist of me being on register, helping an abundance of customers, and helping keep the departments clean while it is not busy. I have learned how to interact with customers properly, professionally take care of problems, have a good attitude, and how handle money quickly and efficiently. My co-workers, for the most part, are friendly and self sufficient. I wouldn't say that any part of the job is really that difficult. It really requires basic skills. You just have to be able to keep up! The most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with the happy customers, and making them happier by doing things such as offering coupons."
good,Kohl's is a fast paced working environment that has provided a variety of knowledge in multiple working environments. They have allowed me with the opportunity to expand my knowledge.
good,i do alot of packing take my two breaks and work very hard my co workers are great the manager are very considerate and friendly
good,"A typical day at Kohls requires flawless customer service. Since the customer is ""King"" at Kohls, it is never acceptable to display anything other than top-notch customer service. As a jewelry sales associate, this position requires a high level of security, getting in and out of locked cases and managing inventory of thousands of dollars of fine jewelry. My coworkers are cordial and I enjoy the ""family"" atmosphere that Kohls provides to its associates. The most enjoyable part of the job is pairing a fine piece of jewelry with the right customer and seeing the customer delight over their new purchase. The hardest part of the job is being restrained to the jewelry department. Due to the high security, you are confined to the department until another associate relieves you when a break is necessary. Sometimes breaks are delayed due to another associate's workload. I have learned to be more tolerant and controlled in the presence of adversity."
good,Most of the time I was assigned at 3 o'clock in the morning. And I tried to adjust to such a time because it was a management prerogative.I learned the following: unloading and stocking of merchandise; to get along with people of another nationality;office policy on reporting to and from work;online viewing of salary. As far as my job is concerned I did not encounter any hardest part of it except that there was a little struggle in its time of reporting. I enjoy meeting new people and getting acquainted with them and learning new job.
good,"A typical day at work while on the register would be to greet customers the just entered the store, check the customers that are ready to be checked out with their items, and lastly bag their items. The management at work is very great! The managers are understanding and have great patience with their associates. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work with people you like and also insuring the customers leave the store satisfied."
good,Kohl's is very fast pace every changing day by day growing company

good,"Process packages for shipping, Picking, Packer, Putaway, Inventory, Cycle Counts, Data Entry, Warehouse Maintenance"
good,"Great environment, very flexiable with my school schedule. Managers were understanding with pratically anything! Staff was great!"
good,"as a cashier at Kohls, count drawer in the morning, handle cash/credit transactions, fast pace environment, good co-workers that were there if had a question, great supervisors. Hardest part of the job trying gain new credit card applications. This job I really enjoyed."

The hardest thing is when its slow and theres nobody to watch. The most enjoyable thing is being number one and beating my peers."
good,"Kohl's is a really good place to work at. People there are great; kind, sweet etc. Just by being there for a short period of time, I saw what people do there, and I wish I would've stayed longer to learn more. There wasn't any difficulties while I was there. I enjoyed doing work there."

I would scan the stock that was to go back to the vender, pack,and once the skid was built lable, then it was taken to ths shipping area.Managment and my co-worker were always working together .

I have learned to train employees, assist customers with purchases, exchanges, and payment of their bills.The management is wonderful and very flexible and encourages us to do our best. My co-workers are very friendly, helpful and we work great as a team. The hardest part of the job is when we can't help a customer with a problem. The most enjoyable part of the job is to see a customer leave with a smile on their face and hear that they love Kohl's."
good,Working for a retalor is not that bad of a job. It takes time to learn where everything goes. Just have to make sure yu have patients and take time to keep the store clean.
good,"Assisting customers with their needs, helping associates"
good,"Work is fast-paced and when it is busy the day goes by extremely fast. When it is not busy, I start a big project which gives me a sense of accomplishment. I learned great customer interaction, and I love my managers and most of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is that it is very demanding. The most enjoyable part is the extreme sense of accomplishment one can feel."
good,"Kohl's prepared me for a new challenge and am accustomed to a fast-paced environment where deadlines are a priority and handling multiple jobs simultaneously are the norm. Continual interaction with clients, in addition to all levels of management, has strengthened my interpersonal skills. I approach my work with a strong sense of urgency, working well under pressure and change. Throughout my work history, I have demonstrated for my employers a strong work ethic, which enables me to be a key productive member of your team.

good,it was a good place to work the hours kept changing and sometimes they would work you like crazy and you would be there all hours
good,"Open availability is a must if you want to advance, cross training is available and encouraged. These two things directly led to my advancement within my store, from an entry-level associate to a multi-departmental associate and eventually an area supervisor. The management team believed in cross-departmental cooperation which allowed for great teamwork. They always encouraged empowerment, to make decisions on your own and finish a job given all the training that was given. Lots of fun people to work with. Holiday season last almost 4 months, and typically November and December are blacked out for paid vacation time off. Earlier mornings and later nights from Black Friday through Christmas. You meet a lot of fun and interesting people, both co-workers and customers alike."
good,Plenty of room to grow. There's many different things you can do working for this company. Their very flexible.
good,Enjoyed working at Kohl's. They were very flexible with my family and making sure that I had family time.

good,Its a good environment with a really flexible job schedule although its very random your hours vary big time and the work is way more than what you get paid for
good,A typical day at work is well paced.
good,Since I've been with Kohl's I have successfully move up the chain in Management however there are many times I have not agreed with their Standard Operating procedures in some areas.
good,I only worked at Kohl's for a short time but in that short time I was showen respect and patience. They throughly train you and take the time to explain the procedures to you.
good,"I loved working at Kohl's. The managers were amazing, very helpful to their customers. I loved cleaning and working on the cash registers."
good,"Work place was clean,management was great,and employe always got reconized for something good they did."
good,I enjoyed working for Kohl's as Part timer for past 5 and half years.

good,"I have nothing but good things to speak of about Kohl's. Friendly staff, good management, good scheduling, and willing to work with you on a day to day basis."
good,"Overall, Kohls is a wonderful workplace but I wanted more hours and more responsibilities and unfornately I had to relocate."
good,"Kohl's is a great caring company. They host charity events and do events all year round. The managers have an open door policy, which is great. They work around your schedule, great if you’re a student. They are always encouraging, every morning there is a huddle of what is going on, you’re always kept up to date and informed."

good,"Fair company with good associate discount, always room for advancement, cross training for multiple roles and departments. Excellent management with most associates having several years experience."
good,"Employee-wise I enjoyed most of my coworkers and the day usually went by quick. Although they don’t give very good breaks to anyone working under 8 hours. The customers are a lot to deal with, which yes is part of the job, but it’s mainly our fault. The system isn’t very good with inventory and stating the actual sales price which misleads customers & then they tend to complain.... a lot. Our signs in the store attempt to show you where certain kiosks are, but they tend to be misleading as well, some customers don’t even see the signs."
good,"For students, they will be flexible with the hours and will help out if you have another job. It must be very active because it can get busy. But all in all, they care about you."
good,Seasonal employees are treated as part of the team with all of the training needed to be successful.  Rewards and recognition are part of the culture here.
good,"Pay much less than competition, advancement process is not clear it seems to be a popularity contest with who likes you and who doesn't. I enjoyed my time working there but, found it very frustrating  for the ability to advance. I resigned because being offered much more money doing pretty much the same job."
good,"Pros- the discounts, the work environment, and flexible with your schedule"
good,"Nice and clean work environment, good people. The store gets very busy on weekends and the closers should probably get more help then what they get most of the time. Kept me busy during the holidays and was a blast to get the experience"
good,"Nice place to work with good culture, friendly co-workers and understanding management/HR. Opportunities to move around positions and fosters proactive training environment."
good,It was a decent place to work if u like getting maybe 32 hours a week the management was great they just lacked hours for employees full time got 40 PT got 32-36 hours a week
good,some managers there are not very good and some co-workers were rude but worked well with schedule. I was seasonal so training wasn't that good and wasn't well informed about what to do when something happens.
good,"Everybody there was extremely nice and always helped me if I needed help. I can call everybody my friends now, and I am glad that I got the experience to work at works."
good,"The work environment is fast pace. The staff is very friendly and full energy. They are flexible with your scheduled, and for the most part you get the time off, if requested. My overall experience had been great, however, the pay was not based on my previous experience. Everyone to my knowledge is brought in at the same amount, which I disagree with, but it’s a great part time job for me."
good,"A lot of different people work at Kohl's from ages 17 to 60. You are able to meet a lot of new people and create life-long relationships from the people who work here. Not only are they great associates to work with, they will look out for you as well."
good,"Given the size of Kohl's corporation, there are many people there to learn from across departments. Each department works together well and there is a lot of opportunity to grow and branch out with your skill set."
good,I had an awesome experience at Kohl's.  Good pay hours and benefits.   I would only leave because it takes a while to move up and I need something making more.  No regrets working for them.

Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Kohl's is a great job to work for. Managers were very friendly and understandable. Plus they gave you a very flexible work schedule. I would say go for it if you really love retail.
good,"I’ve been working with kohl’s for 5 years since I was 17 and I love it still! All the managers at my location are incredible. They have worked with me on my busy school schedule and have always been interested in accommodating their employees."
good,"It's a good job flexible hours and good pay. On a normal day time go by smooth, when it get rough they coach us on how to keep the task up. Making the customers happy is our main point of interest"
good,"Fast paced environment , where seniority rules as in the more years you put into the company the more you'll get from it. Benefits and leave time is very good there."
good,I was an Administrative Asst.  So I had the best of both worlds.  I was able to work in the office and work with the public.  It was a good mix for me.
good,Most days were spent recovering different departments and cleaning up areas. Organizing freight up to company preferences. Management was easy to work with but hypocritical as times. The hardest part was deadlines and being understaffed. The most enjoyable part was accomplishing deadlines early and allotting more time for department recovery.
good,It is a very good place to obtain experience on cashier. Unfortunately  too many employees but not enough hours.  Employees are team players. A very nice place to work.
good,"Nice break rooms, shift bids every six months to a year, high call volume, business causal, fun activates and incentives, monthly bonus based of score card"
good,Great place to work. Everyone is friendly and always there to answer questions. It makes you feel good that you have helped the customer and they leave with a smile.
good,Omni Associate is a part time/ seasonal job in which you handle online orders. It is a 4 to 6 hour day when working and find/ pack items for shipping.
good,"A typical day  handled extensive inbound calls. Service levels, meetings. Learn each other personalities and opportunities for growth. POD decorations. Updated information such as system updates"
good,"This job is for people who maybe want a temporary job like a summer job or seasonal position. To make a living, the pay is not enough but that isn't  complaint. Days can vary from so slow-paced to where you are bored out of your mind or fast-paced running around with multiple tasks to do (which I prefer personally). The one really cool thing is your employee discount that you can stack upon others. 15 percent isn't a lot but it makes a difference when your'e buying something. The managers are all fun and likeable but the way some of them manage doesn't make sense and makes it harder for everyone to get things done."
good,"I learned many skills at Kohl's, such as product organization, managing a register, customer service, and phone skills. They will have you trained on a variety of skills so you can be flexible and helpful all around the sales floor. It did become tiring cleaning up after all the customers, but I did learn a lot there and my coworkers and managers were helpful and fun to be around."
good,"Great place to work "
good,Kohls was a wonderful atmosphere to meet really great people and even better customers. I hate that the Dallas location closed. I really enjoyed all the last friendships
good,"Was a nice place to work at, does get slow at times but there are things you can do to past the time. The Manager and supervisors are very nice and friendly people."
good,Very friendly staff a pleasure to work with . Customers are our first priority make sure they get what there looking for and are satisfied with the product also making sure we give them great customer service.
good,"A typical day at work includes stocking shelves, setting up displays, and unloading trucks of new merchandise. Work can be physically demanding, but time goes by fast."
good,"I enjoyed working at Kohl's because they hear you out, your colleagues are always helping and the work environment is well structured. The supervisors are very understanding in many cases and are always there whenever we need help."
good,"Great company. If Loss Prevention is what you enjoy, Kohl's is the place. There is a great work life balance as well. Management appreciate their employees. Always room to grow."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Enjoyed the learning experience. The majority of the customers were very appreciative when you went the extra mile to help them. Down side is Sales/Cashiers are started with minimum wage regardless of your experience.
good,Great managment and staff. Good pay and great teaching for all staff. Fun durning the holidays. Great employee discounts. Grwat family discounts on certent days.
good,"As a whole, Kohls is a decent company to work for. The pay isn't great for what you are asked to do. But the discounts make up for most negative things you may deal with. It all really comes down to the management at each store and how its run though. A good amount of free food and district competition with credits and sales."
good,"Had a good time working there, co workers were very open and helpful when needed.Management was very personable,willing to help as well.Culture was a friendly atmosphere."
good,It is a fun environment. It is face-paced and competitive. If it's your first job or you have made it a career you wont be disappointed. The staff is friendly and willing to help with whatever question you have.
good,It’s a fun and productive place to work but I feel like they don’t pay enough for the amount of work we have to do. I wouldn’t recommend it to people that aren’t willing to constantly be on their feet.
good,The management overall is very nice and understanding.  The company is great about working with you on any problems personal or professional.  The benefiits are very good.
good,Great place to work for the holidays. Great holiday incentives and positive work environment. Seasoned and Friendly co-workers and quick to help when needed.
good,"At Kohls, the most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers.  I maintained a wonderful working relationship with almost everyone that worked there.  For the most part, we all had a good work ethic, which is key to enjoying your job and your co-workers.  There was an attitude of caring about your workplace, the neatness, the presentation, that supplies were maintained and our interaction with customers.  I thoroughly enjoyed my time there because of these people."
good,"Cashier is pretty mellow unless it's Black Friday."
good,"Easy job for easy money as a CSR. The managers are always kind and understanding to their employees needs. You work as a team and everyone is very friendly and willing to help. The workload is usually light unless it’s around school shopping season, Black Friday, or Christmas."
good,"It was okay, felt like I eventually needed to branch off. The management was occasionally very pushy with getting credits. Made some of the employees frustrated or uncomfortable."
good,"Kohl's provided a welcoming environment to work in and gave me the flexibility I needed with school. Although training was lacking in some areas, the job was pretty easy to do. There were a lot of employee appreciation days with food and other little perks. Associate discounts on merchandise was convenient as well."
good,I really liked working with the people now there were a few that I don't miss but the rest I kinda sort of had like a family bond with them and I miss them. I loved my job but I'm not a kid and I don't need someone to stand over my shoulder watching my every move. Just let me a lone I can do this.
good,"Greet costumers, operate cash register, clean aisles and put away go back merchandise. I kept my area clean, offer credit applications to costumers to open up a Kohl's charge. Folded and organized clothes and put clothes, toys, shoes and other items in their correct spots and departments."
good,"It was an amazing environment to work in however, there were no promotion opportunities, the pay was very low, and people would do so much more work than they were paid for. The people were absolutely amazing. The managers were just phenomenal but I was paying off school books so I had to leave. They also taught me many skills."
good,"Loved the job, and the people. Felt welcomed and a part of the family from day one. Was hired after full disclosure of criminal history. Two weeks later my supervisor called me in and told me corporate needed more information about my background. Two days later I received a call from corporate separating employment. My supervisor stated that he hated to lose me, and I hated to go. I don't hold it against my supervisors, it is what it is."
good,I really enjoyed working at Kohl’s. I felt like I was paid fairly. Great hours I wasn’t over worked. It could be stressful at times just due to it being holiday season. Management was understanding and kind.
good,The management worked closely with each other and communicated constantly with each other and supervisors to ensure customer satisfaction. The hardest part of the job was not being able to adjust my hours to fit my home life. The most enjoyable part was the store was very close and it was almost like a second family.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Its a retail job, so you will not have a set schedule. Your not guaranteed a certain number of hours unless you are full time.This can be seen as a pro or a con depending on your schedule and choice. It great when you need that flexibility. "
good,"Help customers, clean, ring registers stock floor. Unload trucks, price changes, ad set link electronic tablets work with management on day to day dealings."
good,"I worked nearly 30-40 works a week as a part time associate. Our store was always understaffed and the turnover is insane. I wouldn’t work at this particular store again, but the department store as a whole is a fun environment to work in."
good,"Always learning, Open door communication, Ongoing performance feedback and coaching, Great place to work, Awesome PTO, the Upper Management very approachable."
good,"Overall having a job here was nice, the pay was okay for a first job. You can enjoy your time there while you can and the people are not mean just do what your supposed to do."
good,Kohls is a great place to pick up part time work. They are flexible and work with your needs. As for my store the associates were awesome and true team players.
good,Good Place to work. Managers are Great!! Friendly Employees Kohls  take very good care of their Employees during the Holiday the provided food all day long and entertainment in the Break room .
good,"A typical day at Kohl's includes recovering messy or unorganized areas, working on stocking the store, managing the stockroom, running a cash register, and responding to customer inquiries."
good,I enjoyed working for Kohl's it was seasonal the employee's were friendly and very helpful. Waiting on customers I learned a new type of register. The Management was great. Their wasn't any hard part of my job I enjoyed helping the customers and showed them how to use there app on their phone to check if they had any discount.
good,Great place to work. The management team is very helpful and hands on. They are fair and will help you climb the ladder. Plenty of room for advancement
good,I would have to say the most enjoyable thing about the job was the discounts I received for items. I like the people I worked with I just wasn't getting enough hours
good,"You're given a lot of personal responsibility and choices at Kohl's. You're given a department to organize and stock and clean, and it is up to you to make it work. I really enjoyed this about Kohl's because I could work at my own pace, and prioritize what I found to be most important, while still making time for any problems or separate tasks that came up. The managers were also super friendly and understanding."
good,"I have been with Kohl's nearly 15 years and will remain as long as I am capable of doing the job. The employees are a great bunch of people (most are part timers like me), Management has a fairly high turn over rate but I assume that is common in most retail settings."
good,So I got this job around the holidays back in 2004. I was looking to venture into a different atmosphere than the grocery store I had worked at previously. After the holidays were over the company didn't need me anymore so I was out of a job for at least a month.
good,I enjoyed working at kohl's. It was relaxed and fair. The people there was nice and always asked if you wanted to stay after and work for more hours. You get about 4-5 days every week.
good,As a seasonal position i only got to be there for a short time but i enjoyed every minute of it. Every one was friendly and very helpful. The employee discount stacking was very great as well.
good,"Working at Kohls is not the greatest job but certainly is one I would recommend. The management has a poor time communicating with one another on your job for the shift you are doing that day but other than that they are all friendly and easy going. As a fulfilment associate I am incharge of keeping inventory and pushing it on the sales floor. It is a pretty relaxed job and the customers and not hostile but rather friendly and approachable (at least from my experience). The hardest part of my job is getting things done in a timely manner. What the management requests and what is actually completed in your time slot are more often than not unparallel to one another. I do enjoy the atmosphere tho, the employees are treated nicely and the coworkers are all great people. The worst part about my job is its borderline seasonal. After Christmas, you are lucky if you even get one day a week in my department. It goes on like this until about March when things pick up again. If you are looking for a steady job year round this is not your position."
good,"I was hired for temporary seasonal work.  It was late in the season, so it was baptism by fire for the training. However, when i needed help, someone was always there to assist.  Store manager is very understanding, flexible, supportive.  After the Christmas season, I was kept on for part time work.  I would recommend Kohls.  Easy, relaxing atmosphere, the employee discounts are awesome!"
good,A very team oriented fun place to work for. Were very flexible with my school hours. Management was some of the nicest hard working people I've ever met.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Very good place to work. Good management. Very relaxed job depending on your department. Just make sure when there’s work, you’re doing it. Lot of down time. Able to use your phone on the floor. Nice people."
good,"everytime i came in to work, i am prepared to do my duties, helping customers needs. I learned how to deal nicelly with people. a fun place to work, every employees are smiling. And i enjoy most if there are sales in the store."
good,It was a great partime job I worked at the jewelry counter.and in other departments and worked the as cashier.i just needed fulltime hours. Great discounts good managers.
good,Great place to work but the pay could be more based on industry standards. They offer some great benefits as well but again the benefits do not compensate for the lower pay compared to companies that offer the same perks.
good,The job itself is super easy. 95% of the work is machines. Pay starts at 13.50/ hour. There is an on site medical center that is free to all employees. Its offers things from flu shots to gynecology issues to physical therapy. The management is very friendly.  You also recieve a 15% discount. For holidays and sometimes for the heck of it they will provide everyone with lunch from mostly Subway or Chick-fil. Overall it is a great job to work at. The only 2 downside are there is very little training. The employee that is suppose to train you just shows you the very basics and leaves you to figure the rest out. The other downside is some of the other employees are very rude and just unpleasant to work with.
good,All employees work as a unit to get the job done the right way. Managers are always available to provide direction during projects if needed. I thoroughly enjoyed coming to work in the morning.
good,Retail is definitely a hit or miss. There’s good and bad days. The customers and the deals of the company makes the job a little more complex than what it should be. But overall a good beginner job!
good,"Working at kohl's was a learning experience plus workout when it came to manual labor. I enjoyed working there just wished that the pay was better, that they had a serving cafeteria."
good,"Being able to multitask, such as merchandising and being able to still help customers with any questions about coupons and discounts.  Keeping fitting rooms and the sales floor clean."
good,If you want to make money for Christmas then this is the place to work.  Seasonal employment is available starting in October and lasting beyond January.
good,"Wonderful atmosphere, great people, great managers. They work with you and understand that life is not just about the job. They serve meals every holiday and work around your life schedule."
good,"It's a good first job to have, there are cool managers and the people at the store I worked with were mostly my age as well. However, it can be quick paced, stressful and competitive at times but you really just have to remember that all you can do is your best and not to beat yourself about it too much especially if some managers chew you out."
good,Kohl's offers a great working environment for all employees. The company gives off an easy to get along and helpful vibe. Great place to be for all levels of employment.
good,Great place to learn about customer experience and working as a team. There are many different departments with different skills to learn. fast - paced!
good,I earned $9 an hour as a floor associate. The hours were never consistant. I loved my managers and teamates but i also think they gave us huge tasks to complete in a short amount of tim
good,Kohl's was great I just had school taking up too much of my time so I had to quit but I have graduated or else I would still be there. It was enjoyable since the staff was nice.
good,Good job for anyone who is simply able to stand for a decent amount of hours. Great team members awesome atmosphere. Good money and great employment benefits and discounts
good,"Easy work and a happy environment. Everyone is very helpful and makes you feel like you fit in. Everyone is treated as one, and no one is treated better than others."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I was in a popular area for shopping. Slow days were a bit rare. I really loved my co-workers. Never any drama and they were very helpful with any tasks we were given.
good,"I liked working here. It was fast paced and I was always busy. We had good supervisors, but unfortunately sometimes due to them or employees we wouldn't make our daily goal and would have to do overtime.  The benefits and pay were good and there was room for advancement."
good,"It's a really fun environment, but you're pushed really hard to sign people up for credits. Other then that, it's a great place. I only worked part time tho."
good,"Kohl's was an absolutely amazing place to work. For someone who was trained as only a cashier in her first job, I was quickly transferred to the floor within a month of me starting here at Kohl's. The atmosphere was light and fun with the associates that we had at my store, though there were times when it got incredibly stressful during busy/holiday times due to the lack of hours being able to be given for coverage. Went when I started from 10 hours a week up to an average of 26-27 hours per week, but suddenly drastically dropped to almost 4 hours a week for several weeks in a row for nearly two months straight-- and that was through a holiday season! Despite this, management was great for the most part. A lot of the managers there are really supportive and have the back of their associates. Would highly recommend to people who are looking for a little extra money but not looking to make a living/make bills. Would recommend as a possible second job as well as many of the associates I worked with used it as a second job."
good,"In my store specifically, people were a little rude. They were not fond of new people coming on board because they all knew what to do and having to teach someone new is tedious. Some co workers (the older ones) got annoyed very fast and were harder to get along with but the younger ones were so so nice. There was a lot of work to do for big departments and during holidays there were 2 people in each rather than one. The managers were nice too, never yelled at anyone or made accusations, they respected everyone equally and knew what they were doing and helped you out on the floor if things got too chaotic rather than yell and blame. The only problem I have is the pay. We got paid 9.50 an hour, which is not enough for the amount of work that needs to be done. 10 or 11 at least should be given."
good,"The work is simple and nobody expects more than you're capable of giving, which is a huge plus, and the supervisors and managers were great. The only actual complaints I had were the lack of advancement options (higher positions didn't come around very often) and the frequent hard-to-satisfy customers that come with the line of work, but if you're only looking for a part-time job, those really aren't issues. The pay wasn't super high, just over minimum at the time, but it was definitely adequate for the job being done."
good,"Opening & closing manager shifts with duties to perform. Daily tasks to accomplish. Able to adapt to last minute work duty changes. Adapt to schedule call ins. Learned how to step over from being a PT Sales Associate to Management status. The culture is to do your assigned tasks, and do it well. Ask questions was encouraged. Assist customers, greet them, have fun with everyone, and keep the store free of clutter. Utilize corporate directives. Keep on top of refilling stock & getting new stock out. Hard part was keeping up with the work flow- very heavy one week & the next week basics to do. I enjoyed the customer interaction and the associates too. We were a big family atmosphere. So many stayed because of this reason, not because or the pay."
good,"I worked this job for the holiday season for extra money and it was not as bad as I expected it to be. Retail is retail, but I found this place to be a lot more structured with a lot more flexibility. Coworkers and management were generally pretty nice and supportive. The tasks were easy and most customers were great overall despite the few irritating ones who think they are entitled to everything under the sun. Not sure if I'd want to make a career out of this place, but definitely a good place to work for a side job if you need extra money."
good,"Steady, comfortable work environment. Focused positions with steady scheduling. Overall good management with friendly supervisors. Opportunity for advancement if so desired."
good,a typical day was to remove clothes form dressing rooms and put back where they belong . Help customers and other departments when they needed it . I learned all about team work there . It's a fun place to work at . The managers were always willing to help out with projects . The projects were the hardest part of the job . I really enjoyed helping the customers and the other employees when they needed it .
good,"Most of the time I was at the registers, which was not my favorite position, but it certainly was not bad at all.  Sure, I may have had some customers who were, well, crazy to say the least.  But most of the time I got customers out the door in a quick, but not rushed, manner."
good,There is an awesome team of people working at kohl's in Cookeville. I have learned to work as a team member and to take responsible for my actions. I have also learned to help customers and how to solve any issues they have.
good,"I really enjoy the people I work with and the community and inclusion factor of Kohl's. As a #PrideAtKohls business resource group member I feel like I am an accepted part of the team without judgement.I do believe that as a Designer there wasn't much movement in the fields and positions I wanted so I got ""stuck"" after a certain point."
good,"Kohl's is not a bad place to work. There is high turnover and nobody really loves working there, but it is bearable and can be enjoyable. My managers were all pretty good except for one of them."
good,"Must be hardworking and enjoy a fast-paced environment.Even on slow days, the dressing rooms can fill quickly, but the more flexible you are about learning other skills/departments the more hours you will have. Management was fantastic when I was there but I do know it has changed since then so I can't speak for the current state."
good,"I did like working here with the management team. But over all the company was blah. They only wanted things done in a certain way, and there is nothing wrong with that, but doesn't give much room for a person to use their creative skills, especially when they are a visual merchandiser."
good,Great job and place to work. Pay is okay but not a lot of job advancement. People are fun to work with but you are expected to do a lot of multitasking and multiple person roles.
good,I really enjoyed my experience as a customer sales representative at Kohl's department stores. The management was very friendly and extremely helpful in assisting with customer issues and problems or questions I had with what my job entailed. The discounts were a great addition to the work experience. I would definitely recommend this store to anyone debating to apply or anyone debating on becoming a Kohl's shopper.
good,"I LOVE working here. They are very flexible and willing to work with you on hours, and they put very little pressure on you to push the store credit card. The management could improve in some aspects, but are fair."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"As a company, Kohl's was a fun and enjoyable place to work at. At the location I was employed at, the job was demanding and often stressful due to a large amount of employee overturn. The working environment remained safe and healthy, and the managers made additional efforts to show employees they were valued. While I did not sign up for the benefits I qualified for, the benefits offered to employees were very helpful. It was also easy to move up in positions and pay due to the way employees are trained. The cross-training employees were required to go through gave us the opportunity to exhibit our skills in differing areas of the company."
good,"this company provides great job experience for those entering the work force. In particular, those right out of high school and that do not yet depend entirely on the income they receive here because of the large amount of employees and the lower amount of hours given."
good,Kohls is a good place to work for a first time job. Not too good on giving hours during the non busy season. During holidays give plenty of hours. Job place for advancement in the company
good,"I enjoyed working at Kohl's. The managers were encouraging and helpful, though they did focus too heavily on opening credit cards. Very flexible in terms of shifts - time of day, days off, etc. They allow you to request off just about any day that you need, except during major retail holidays where everyone is required to be available to work (Black Friday, weekends before Christmas, etc.). The hardest, and also the most enjoyable part of the job for me was the customers. Most of the customers were great and understanding when something happened that was out of my control. However, there are some customers who are unreasonable and would yell at me and other associates when something happened and we couldn't fix it either because of a policy or because of miscommunication or whatever. The managers were great about stepping in and helping these customers so the other associates and I didn't have to suffer being yelled at for something that was out of our control."
good,"The work environment is great and good people to work with (sometimes)."
good,"Fun, upbeat environment, never boring, offered a great selection of products and attire. I immediately felt like they had a great family atmosphere, especially also with how many military families are employed there."
good,"This company has really built my confidence and my multi-tasking skills. The opportunites were great. I started as a cashier then working in the customer service department, jewelry, visual, and later becomimg a specialist. There was never a dull moment. Although it was a high-traffic environment, it really is a learning experience to handle pressure and becoming more patient. The best times usually involves a lot of healthy teamwork."
good,Kohls is a fun and exciting place to work. You meet a lot of people everyday. It is good for a person who has a family. You can work the hours that are suitable for you. It was a good transition for me. When I had children it was very flexible for me to work and spend the time with my kids that I had to. If you are interested in a fun fast paced job kohls could be where you might want to work.
good,"The working environment would only be challenging if you make it. The workers there are friendly and love to help you when you need it. Management is also friendly to their employees, though the only problem is when they are short on staff on certain days. Its like a big family at Kohls. The benefits there are also pretty good."
good,"I worked in the distribution center for over 2 years and really wish I could go back. The management was excellent, and the team leads really knew how to help you when you had questions. The pay was fair for the work you did and they had great benefits! Yearly trip to any one amusement parks that the company chose, all paid for! Lots of time off, very serious but not very strict attendance policy! Fun environment, great hardworking people, easy to move up!"
good,Kohl's is a fun place to work at because of all the wide variety of people you get to work with. All of the managers that I worked with legitimately cared about my well being and are genuinely interested in being your friend.
good,"I really have enjoyed working at Kohls so far. They have a great employee discount. It’s also a fun work environment so far, and the management at my store is super nice. My co workers are super nice as well"
good,The workday at kohl's was pretty relaxed. I learned a lot about how to audit items and make sure online orders get packed and shipped correctly. It gets fast paced when you have a lot of orders to pack and the store is full of customers. The managers are all good people.  The workplace was an environment where everyone could get along with no problems. Truck days can be tiring if you are not accustomed to working in a hot environment.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with all different kinds of amazing people.
good,I enjoy my job. Very little stress. A great team to work for. I enjoy the paid time off. And the peaple on my team. Myy manager is a very peaple friendly person and makes it a pleasure to work for.
good,"Even though my position was part time with the option of full time hours during the holiday seasons, the hours weren't enough and could barely pay what I needed to. Management was amazing except maybe one or two that just seemed to be in a bad mood."
good,"I basically work alone, which is fine as I can focus on my responsibilities.  It is very nice to have the workers all seem very friendly toward each other."
good,"While working at Kohl's, I never felt stressed to do my job. Even during times it was busy, the people I worked with were always happy and friendly and made for a non-stressful day of work. Good break room too, with lockers."
good,"Go to work, make money. There are a lot of seasonal employees so you shouldn't be surprised when a boss asks you what you're doing when you go to get a drink. They want you to stay busy. The hardest part was when the system crashes and there are no orders. Sometimes they send you home without notice when that happens. Other times you may have to sweep floors for 10 hours even if you'd rather leave."
good,the job wasn't hard at all training for cashier was pretty simple sometimes they would be slow hours as a cashier it was boring so i would go tidy up the store meanwhile. Work was the best when the store was crowded because I would actually go back to being a cashier than a sales floor associate which I thought was funner
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Kohl's was one of my favorite retail jobs. I learned a lot about origination and the importance of being on time. The job was very laid back and I got to interact with some amazing customers. The managers are patient but want you to get it right.
good,"Kohl's was my first job in the warehouse setting. They gave me the opportunity to be crossed trained in multiple functions throughout their operations. Such as picking, packing, replenishment, receiving, inventory control, and order consolidation."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of cleaning out all of the woman's, men's, and juniors fitting rooms while putting the clothes that were cleared from them back onto the sales floor. I typically answer at least three customer question phone calls a day and assist many in store. The workplace culture is very high spirited, and rewarding. The hardest part of the job is meeting my own cleanliness standards on a very busy day, but the easiest part of the job is having your managers and boss know that you are only one person and they commend you on your work any day."
good,"Kohl's Corporation is a fast-paced, competitive store. Of course we want the best of the best and that's what we strive for. To be number one. "
good,"I enjoyed my time there, even if it was just seasonal. It was hard work being in shipping and receiving but I had such a great time working there and getting to experience a job for the first time."
good,"Aprendí a dar servicio al cliente en ingles, a trabajar  bajo presión, a entender los diferentes acentos en ingles, manejar el sistema de khols para levantar pedidos, resolver problemas del sistema etc. La cultura laboral era muy buena ya que se conviva con gente muy abierta. lo mas difícil fue el comienzo ya que nunca antes lo había hecho y lo que mas me gusto fue crecer profesionalmente y superarme."
good,"I did receive fair hourly pay, they have a package of great benefits, it was a good schedule-3 12 hr shifts, 4 days off every week, would recommend it"
good,"From the beginning everything seems chipper and happy. Almost to good to be true, but the entire stay was exactly like that. It's a very low stress environment and I would love working here again."
good,"Great management, worked with minor health concerns easily; allowed me to pick up shifts. Community out-reach programs available, which helped the Canton community in many ways."
good,"For the holidays the store is bananas, everybody is scattered around the store, cash register packed with customers. At the end of the day the store well be a hot mess. But it was still fun and I've learned how to work in fast paste environment."
good,Great atmosphere to work in as well as the type of people to work around. The company does a good job making the workplace environment more fun and inviting for its workers.
good,i like the atmosphere for the most part hours were nt bad when i did get on the schedule. my only thing is im not te pushy type so selling kohls cards was hard and that puts your job in jeporady
good,"When I started I just planned on staying for the Christmas season.  The managers did a great job selecting employees.  I loved the workers so much I stayed for 10 years!! It's like a family now.  The problem is that the pay goes up very slowly and now as a single parent it wasn't working for me financially. It's great if you just need a extra spending money. The opportunities to move up ""job title wise"" was good. They are always offering opportunities to move up to different areas of work if you are a good, dependable employee.  That helps you get a lot of experience that you can carry on in future careers.  The one thing I think needs to change is the very top management has too many plans that don't work in every store, mostly because the store sizes are not the same.  They need to leave more options up to each store to do things the best way. There really should be more workers because of the store size and the busyness.  Some days workers are just overloaded, we all helped each other though. Teamwork was important."
good,"Typical day would be nine hours of more. There is a lot to handle in one day, besides the daily operations of the building. There is the over seeing the daily buy on line and pick up in store orders, as well as buy on line and ship to your house orders."
good,"Typically , short days consists of helping and ringing up customers, answer any questions.registers,MJM as well as customer service are always available to help with everything"
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work no doubt. The managers and associates are all super friendly and very eager to help. The managers and other people higher up also try their hardest to please everyone, which can be good, but it will ultimately leave someone feeling dissatisfied. "
good,The scheduling was very flexible with school and other life activities with the other associates being very friendly and helpful. The management often had break down in communication which caused some frustration for the associates.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"A pretty easy place to work.  Training was good and straightforward. The trainee went over most scenerios.  If working as a floor associate there were sometimes every job didn't get fully completed, but you were able to finish it the next day.  Management and leads always had shift huddles to start the shift which was always great it kept the team focused."
good,"I thought it was a great first job. Management and co-workers were easy going and fun. It gave me a little insight on retail and how competitive it can get. It also teaches you to manage your time wisely within a certain amount of hours; such as, maintaining an area clean while helping out customers. It was a bit challenging at times but always enjoyable. Patience is key when you work in retail."
good,"Overall a good place to work, it may vary depending on store location but for the most part they do a good job of accommodating to their associates needs and schedules."
good,"Easy work"
good,Do a job that you love and you will be successful is my philosophy and I have many years of experience that will allow me to learn quickly.  I have grown and expanded my computer skills and love working with customers
good,"I was a seasonal employee.  Had a good experience working there.  Was cross-trained in several departments.  Management team was excellent, the best I worked with."
good,"The beauty section at Kohl's is EXTREMELY slow, so a typical day at work mostly consisted of light cleaning, and backing up the cashiers at the front of the store. Not your typical beauty adviser job."
good,"Fast paced and exciting. Hardest part of the job is the customers, but at the same time they are also the most rewarding. It's simple and easy. There is room to grow some but not at the rate I would prefer."
good,"Depending your position, everyday is different. On the most part, you clean up after customers and help them find what they are looking for. I often rearrange new products and try to drive sales. I learned a lot concerning what customers want according to age range. I also learned about rotating fashion and how quick they come and go to the point that I can tell what is going to sell quick and what will not. They management is pretty effective by giving me the tools that I need. The hardest part of my job is having to work with some people who aren't as detailed and work efficient as you so that tends to slow your process because the atmosphere is more of a team oriented place. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with that make it fun as well as the really good discounts and flexibility of the hours."
good,Kohls was my first job and I loved the environment. Everyone was kind and nice and even the customers made the job enjoyable. The gave us time off when requested and the schedule was flexible with school hours. Its a great first job and it's a great seasonal job as well. I would definitely go back.
good,"I love working at Kohl's. It is a great and friendly place to work. The only complaint that I have is that I do not get near enough hours. I have open availability and I still only get around 15 hours per week. Overall, Kohl's is the best place that I have ever worked, I just wish I worked more."
good,"Fast pace work environment. Given a section of the store ie. woman's, men's, jr's... can be very stressful during busy days. Great coworkers and if your a good hard worker very easy to move up in the business."
good,"kohls is a fun place to work. Its more for people right out of highschool or for people doing a second job. However if you work extremely hard you could move up, it just takes a while. Extremely low pay."
good,"I loved the environment and management when I worked at the Plainfield, IN Kohl's. It is a great company to work for with the right management of course."
good,Overall I enjoy working at Kohl's because of my managers and coworkers. I feel like I have learned a lot and have gained a variety of skills in the workplace that help me in every day activities. Kohls as a corporation is very good at holding true to being an equal opportunity employer and working around associates personal lives and primary work schedules.
good,Loved working at Kohl's for the most part. Love my co-workers and the discounts but pay was very low. Didn't seem like much room for advancement......
good,I thought working at Kohl's was great. The managers there are awesome and treated people with respect. I definitely would've stayed on had I had more hours and more reliable transportation.
good,"It was very fun working at Kohls for my first job ever. The starting rate was pretty low, however it was a little something to have on the side as I was a full-time student at the nearby University. The best part of the job were my Co-Workers and the E3's (Supervisors). Everyone was extremely nice, with an exception of one Supervisor who just always had an attitude with me. If you are working at a department like Home&Kids, you need to be able to handle 1/4 of the store alone and still be able to run and help out at the registers. Despite being hired for the department, you get trained to do multiple tasks, and you're expected to be able to just drop your task and get the line down at registers. All in all, its a great place to get some work experience and build your resume. Super easy to learn all the tasks that are needed to be done, but the only issue is that you get asked to do a profusion of other tasks that isn't even in your job description. Not worth the 90-day starting rate of 11.25 as a real job, but I'm glad I worked there."
good,"The work isn't hard and the managers are incredibly helpful with anything. Being busy is never a problem as there are plenty of other things to do around the store, making the atmosphere productive and fun."
good,I either open or closed the building. There was constantly something to do. Being a manager there was always something to do. There weren't enough people towards the end of the night.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Working at kolbs was very organized and calm place to work. The co-workers were amazing people including the managers. They have good benefits and the work place was clean.
good,"I enjoyed working for the company the entire time I was there, overall. The environment was very welcoming and seemed as if the company is a big family."
good,Working here is like gold I've never worked at a place where there friendly area. Time with benefits & Paytime-Off. Have never had such a big pay bump went from 10.75 at HEB to 15.00 so I like it.
good,"I personally enjoyed my time with kohls, very easy job to get the hang of. Many customers & you have to catch the pace of the the job but it is very easy to handle. Management from my time their was very helpful with anything I needed them for."
good,"As soon as I came in I was greeted kindly at the door. Everyone was welcoming & seemed to want to be at their job. The environment was very laid back even if the store became busy, it was as if we had everything under control."
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work if you are looking for a part time type of job. they do not offer a full time unless you apply for top position jobs. most of the people I worked with were very kind and gentle and so was the general manager. the hardest part of the security job was that sometimes there were customers who got very angry to the registers for returns that did not get to me the store policy and they were very offensive to everyone. when we the security could not reason with them we called the manager and, they started blaming their problems on us when we only tried to do whatever was in our reach to satisfy them."
good,"I was there during the Christmas season, so I had a lot cut out for me. Luckily, I only had to bag when lines got long, as well as be line monitor, showing other customers where to go for the next open register."
good,"Its an hustle and bustle kind of job,many duties and responsibilities most of the time its fun to meet and help people with their purchase.Help the customers find exactly what they are looking for,helping them get the best sale advantage,helping them with the on line pick up as fast as possible ans cashing them out as quickly as possible."
good,"Great people, very challenging work.  Good culture that is trying very hard to adapt to the ecommerce trend. "
good,"Overall nice experience, some departments could use a little more training, but I enjoy it"
good,Pay is great and the job is really easy going. There is no employee loyalty from the direct managers and supervisors but the company itself is pretty cool.
good,"Working at Kohl's has been a great experience for me, widening my skills vastly in the customer service world.  Both the management team and the associates all work together to execute wonderful customer service."
good,"It's pretty easy job. You don't move from your station much which makes your feet hurt after working for 10 hours a day 5 days a week."
good,"Working at Kohls was an excellent idea, It had many benefits and an awesome staff/team. I am very happy to have been of help during the season. "
good,It was a great and professional environment. The management keep your personal performance level very confidential and assist you with improving it.
good,"This is a very well rounded workplace, not only do they provide great benefits but they're willing to work around your daily personal life."
good,Working on the registers requires a lot of patience and customer service. Kohl's really pushes you to sell their credit cards. It's very goal- driven.
good,"Kohls is a great company to work with, it's just a bit overwhelming for those who enjoy more hands on work. If you enjoy interacting with tons of people throughout your work day, kohls is perfect for you."
good,"Everyone is friendly, from supervisors to associates. The teamwork is great as everyone helps one another, regardless of who works in the department. The break times were also reasonable in accordance to how many hours you would be working that day."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"A Productive and a enjoyable place to work, great coworkers, open door policy, knowledgeable management team, and learned to be patient with customers"
good,"management is always willing to jump in and help with whatever you need. everyone is a team at this location. a typical day you come in depending on what department or where they have you, you go to Customer service and get the returns and take them to put them back where they belong. if you do truck you go and get the dock/get the line ready for truck to be unloaded."
good,"Loved working for Kohl's corporation, and learned so much about retail and myself while doing so. Felt I was a part of a great time with supportive co-workers and management that pushed me to do my best in and outside of the workspace. Hours were rough and sparse at times, yet overcompensating during other times. My most enjoyable part of the working for Kohl's was being able to help others and brighten up someones day when looking for clothes to make themselves feel and look better."
good,"You get to interact with customers while assisting them with returns,exchanges,payments.and online orders. Process daily paperwork, process defective and damages and cash handling."
good,"My typical work day consisted of clocking in on time & completing all my duties & helping others complete theirs. I learned how to interact with the customers & how to get things done in a fast, organized manner. The employees & management where very nice & friendly. The hardest part of the job was re-arranging the store for the up-coming holidays in a short period of time. The most enjoyable part about working there was meeting new people everyday & helping customers find what they needed."
good,Management was great and provided a good work environment. Loss Prevention Team was also great and really provided help when needed. I had the opportunity to work along with Management which helped me grow as far as learning the business.
good,"I did not like the management there. I'm a hard worker so I didn't let that get to me. While working there, I was in charge of handling the home décor dept, kids dept, and shoe dept. I also unloaded trucks with shiptment and worked in the front as cashier."
good,The number one priority in our store is to deliver the best customer service which in turn drives sales and loyalty. We are known by many customer's to be 'the friendliest store'; we prioritize our customers needs over our workload.
good,"My first time working in retail, and it is a pleasant experience with a ton of benefits.  The way Kohl's treats us employees outside of our direct work environment makes me want to come to work every day."
good,"In the short time that i was employed at Kohl's, it was great. The management was exceptional, the co-workers were thoughtful and helpful, and the tasks and work environment was nice."
good,Kohls has a very worker friendly working environment. They allow you to work on your own pace. once you walk through those doors you fell welcomed.
good,Usually we start of with recovery then fitting rooms. You will be asked to go to the resisters and help check people out often. You might stay a couple hours after closing
good,"The position, Sales Area Supervisor, is a unique one in the retail industry. As a liaison between the Department leads and the upper management, the SAS is a member of both the sales floor and the management team. Endowed with the majority of the responsibility of a manager, yet accessible to the staff, the SAS can develop a more personal rapport with the staff, as they work closely together."
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work at. Everyone is friendly and you gain a lot of experience in customer service, inventory control, cashiering, and merchandising."
good,"A typical day at Kohl's was nice, it was rarely slow and always had great customers. Management was overall helpful and kind, a few weren't approachable though. Coworkers were easy to get along with and helpful."
good,"Some long hours required but when they were, they make it feel like home, everyone is so nice and overall good job. nicholasville ky kohls"
good,"I was very strict on time. I learned how to work the register, and organize. The management was pretty good. I loved my co-workers. I feel that there was nothing hard about the job. I enjoyed meeting new people everyday."
good,"In the total time I've worked on site, I've had a mix of very wise and intelligent managers and some supervisors who make me question how they advanced in the company in the first place. Other than that, it's a wonderful place to work, and they pay VERY well!!"
good,"Kohl's is a great place to start working for young people. The most impressive thing about Kohl's is that they work with you and try to accommodate for work/life balance. The atmosphere is not too demanding and the work required is very reasonable."
good,"Management never overworked me, peers were kind and helpful, attention to detail and customer service was excellent."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,i loved the team work and also the environment. I enjoyed learning new things around the store. I really do think that the customer service is fantastic.
good,"This company is young, daring, and very creative when it comes to sales and advertisement. This company also advocates teamwork and lives by it. Great Experience and great Leadership!"
good,"The job is very satisfying. Day to day there are different tasks and I am rarely bored with my job. Management is great and the company is very close and supportive of each other, The only downside is the pay is minimum wage and raises are hard to come by and are very small, about a quarter dollar each. Unless you are full time, hours are very sparse."
good,"Very busy place to at. Work consist of folding clothes, talking to customers, and putting clothes back. The co-workers were great to work with and management was great."
good,the people you work with are good at what they do and are always wiling to help you with anything. You come into work knowing you are going to help some leave happy. I had the chance to learn more than one job and those kinds of things help you advance. The managers are really nice and easy to talk to.
good,"Very flexible, managers are great. Everyone enjoys their job. I enjoy working there. Energy is great for retail environment. All my co-workers are extremely friendly and helpful."
good,"Greeted customers and ascertained what each customer wanted or needed"
good,I enjoyed working at Kohl's. Working with a great group of people made me feel like part of the team. I worked early morning merchandising and customer service. The management worked with every employee on scheduling around family. I would still be with Kohl's if my family and I didn't move.
good,"customer service skills is a must, and management has requirements you should help meet. fast paced and friendly environment with your co workers makes it a good place to work."
good,It's a great starter retail job; the management is very supportive. They make sure you have all the tools you need to have a successful and productive day at work. It's pretty slow usually thats why I would say its a great starter retail job.

good,Kohl's is diverse and offers growth at all levels!  This is an amazing organization to work for!  Kohl's offer a family-friendly environment and really strives to fulfill the lives of associates.
good,Kohls was a fun diverse place to work. The team would come in every night and prep the area by removing merchandise to the floor or to the upper stock room. Once the are area is clear we open the truck and unload everything. After that we tag items and move them to their proper places on the sales floor or in the stock rooms.
good,"I was always able to work my work around my school schedule. This was my first job, and I am very honored to have the opportunity to work here. It helped me gain so many skills."
good,"I love Kohls. Kohls is a great job. A typical day at Kohls will be lots of sales with lines of customers. I learned more about customer service and being patient. Not all customers are the best and can get very rude but I've learned how to smile through it all, to keep calm and help as much as I can. Management is amazing there and is always on the go to help you. Whenever there is a problem they'll fix it right away and they're also there to talk and are very understanding whenever you're having personal issues. Co-workers are kind hearted, helpful as well and easy to talk to. The hardest part of the job I will say is standing up all day, but I manage very well on my feet. I enjoy that everyone in Kohls are willing to help without giving you a hard time. Team work is key at Kohls. The team work makes the dream work as they say."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Fun place to work. I enjoyed my three years there. I tried to advance within the company being cross-trained in several departments and fields.
good,"my days at Kohl's varies  because being a full time supervisor requires lots of different skills and tasks. I have many responsibilities such as, overseeing two departments, merchandising, replenishing, setting, organizing, recovering, cleaning and making sure every piece of product is available to the customer. I also have one helper with freight, merchandising, and replenishing. my supervisor will also assist if needed. There are also few part-time associates who help with the area during kohl's business hours. I oversee their work and delegate projects, communicate, and train these employees so they are up to date with any department changes that I may do.  "
good,I stocked shoes on sales floor and in backroom.I assisted customers and gave advice on style. I assisted customers on using the kiosk to order products. I worked cash register. Educated customers on deals and kohls charge.

good,"Its been over 25 years that I worked at Kohls,  what I do remember is that they worked with me in scheduling my hours to fill in with my needing to be home with my son, and the experience was enjoyable working in retail with co-workers and customers."
good,"A typical day at work is basically observing customers and associates for 8 hours. I look for strange activity, how they select and hide merchandise."
good,"Kohls is a demanding job....In a store that size there is always something to be done. I was over the softlines which included Mens,Womens,Juniors and Jewelry. I had anywhere from 15-40 people under me at any given time depending on season. Its all about time management and planning there. Delegation to your team is also key."
good,"Worked in a department that was always necessary to keep neat, folding clothes, go backs from dressing rooms kept me busy.  There was always organization involved with clothes, folding, placing on racks."
good,Every day at my job I had the chance to learn something new.  Every day I was doing something different.  During my time at Kohls Ihad the chance to work in many different departments and  to work with the majority of the associates in the store.  I got to work very closly with other department supervisors on a daily basis.  The hardest part of my job was working during the holidays.  My favorite part of my job was that I always had the chance to learn something new and I never had to do the same thing two days in a row.
good,"A great learning experience, I'm going to apply these skills in the near future. What I specifically learned the most was customer service. I was really getting the hang of it until me and fifty other people got laid off."
good,"I have been working at Kohl's part time as an MJM.  It can be frustrating at times with a lot to do via maintaining wellness of the store, but with the help of positive managers and employees my days aren't bad there at all.  It's a positive environment :)"

good,This was a nice I work through temp service so I wasn't getting the right pay of but overall a good job
good,Requires a lot of Strength and Energy. You'll stand on your feet most of the day. You will  get a twenty to thirty minute break. I learned how to use the register. The management staff is great. The most enjoyable part of my job was assist customers.
good,"Start off by clocking in in at 9pm. Then going to your manager and check up on him/her and ask where they want you want to work at. Then take lunch and the go back to work until 6am the next day. "
good,"Payroll Management"
good,"Kohl's provides a nice corporate culture, and good work/life balance. Management is nice and treats everyone with respect."
good,I worked at Kohl’s in Yulee for nearly two years with no problems with any of the employees in any way. Location was close but the hours were erratic and sometimes caused conflicts with carpooling other times I would only work 8-12 hours for the whole week.
good,"I enjoy working here. The employees are friendly and much like family.  Although the pay isn't that great, they are very good about letting you schedule your lifestyle around them."
good,"At Kohls, the customers were always considered a huge priority at all times. While at the company, I learned how to operate and function with the advanced Point of Sales system, how to recover items that were a part of the store's merchandise, and how to always communicate with customers to leave them satisfied with their visit to Kohls. "

good,Working at Kohls has been a great experience overall for me. They are very flexible with your hours especially if you are going to school. I never had a problem with any of the management team and the atmosphere is very pleasant to work in. If you are a student I would highly recommend this as a place to work. it is a great part time job and it offers chance for growth and advancement
good,Kohl's is a very family oriented place.  They care very much about their employees and maintain a job work/life balance at all times.  The benefits are amazing and they make sure that their employees needs are met.  At no time do I feel like a number.  The hardest part of my job is learning to not take some of the things our customer's say personally.  I love the appreciation events that Kohl's have monthly for their employees.
good,Love working there. The management team is great and the other associates are great as well. Hours are hard to come by but they tell you that before you start so you know. Nothing hard about the job if you pay attention to detail.
good,Learning experience and a productive company. It is a wonderful growing company
good,"Kohl's is a great company to work for, the environment is great and there's really a sense of teamwork among the employees. I love that Kohl's is a company with a progressive mindset, they are very proactive in their approach of new procedures and polices to drive sales and help customers as well as associates. I also feel a great deal of support from management and fellow associates in not only my professional life but my personal life as well showing that they really do care."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Managers were always willing to work with me and gave me a lot of hours (which was great). "
good,I enjoyed working but resigned because medical issues. Coworkers were really nice and were very helpful.
good,A typical day at work can be very busy assisting customers when needed and maintaining the upkeep of the sales floor.
good,"Kohl's Department Stores (EFC Fulfillmet Center) is a task-oriented organization serving customers via Internet orders. Associates are asked to perform at certain levels throughout the day depending on their job function. Naturally, the level of production is increased drastically as peak season arrives (Christmas), ensuring customer orders are being served with the highest importance. The business process is still a work in progress. However, associates are well compensated with pay, and company lunches, picnics, and prizes throughout the fiscal year."
good,"My day began at 9pm with the review of any and all dayside communications to Overnight team. Truck nights began with the review of the manifest again and the set-up of the workload planner to establish unload and merchandising goals."
good,"I got along with my coworkers. Atypical day for me was cleaning, straightening items and department, and helping customers. I really like helping people, so I would say that was the best part of my job. I really cannot think of a worst part. I really enjoyed working there."
good,"I love my managers at Kohl's, they are very helpful and clear with what they are expecting. There are times during the busy sessions when I feel overhwelmed, and they always know how to help me so I don't feel this way anymore"
good,"What I liked about this comaphny when I was employed is that it was job security. I think the most difficult part of this job is that they did not really listen to the sytem issues that would arrise, you really had no choice in the changes that where being made."
good,"The typical day starts with cash management - counting/balancing tills and getting the store ready for the day's business. Once complete, there are multiple tasks to keep you busy when not directly assisting customers. The work atmosphere is very pleasant, as the employees get along great with each other. This has not always been the case with other companies I've worked for in the past. The management staff empowers employees to make business decisions that benefit both the company and its customers - we are not ""micro-managed""! The hardest part of the job is handling issues that occur very rarely (such as ""lost"" gift cards). Remembering the correct process for something you do so infrequently can be difficult, The most enjoyable part of the job is receiving a sincere ""thank you"" from a customer when you worked very hard to resolve an issue for them."
good,"While I was working in the company there was a lot of managerial changes, so as a whole store we faced a lot of new challenges. I did however enjoy my time there. I really loved my coworkers and they were the reason I came to work everyday. The one thing I didn't enjoy was cleaning up piles upon piles of clothing from customers, but that's clothing retail in a nutshell. Just not what I imagined doing as a career the rest of my life. I'm appreciative of the skills I learned during my time there and will use them towards my next chapters in life."
good,"alot of room for advancement, friendly atmosphere. good hours, alot of lateral moves for employees"
good,"Great company to get involved with. I learned about retail services and the ability to get acquainted with customers, how to complete transactions, and how to maintain a business casual appearance. Most of the coworkers were very welcoming and offered help if it was needed. There wasn't much about difficulty besides if there was an upset customer."
good,"I enjoyed working with the public.  Found that to be rewarding. "
good,"I have never had a boring day with Kohl's.  My management team and  co-workers are a great group of individuals that bring so much excitement and experience to my day.  My day requires use of my strong planning and prioritizing skills.  Lots of flexibility and knowledge.  My people skills are used on many levels by customers, associates and management alike."
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work if you don't mind being flexible and hard working for getting paid exactly minimum wage. If you are a floor associate you are pressured to recover the floor (folding, organizing, stocking, etc.) and also clean all fitting rooms and put back all returns of your department. Childrens department includes young boys, little boys, young girls, little girls, infants/toddlers, and toys. It's a big department for one person to get done so at times it can get stressful. Every once in a while you will receive help from other associates. If you are having a slow day can often drag on so you will have to occupy yourself with very tedious jobs such as organizing socks, underwear, baby toys, and then you go on to organize the whole toy section, along with clearance. If you are on the register managers pressure you to get credit and loyalty sign ups. We have a quota you must meet everyday and managers guilt you if you do not complete those."
good,"The day at Kohl's started at 6 am. This was my first time behind the scene in retail. I give it up to the unloaders of every company especially in the winter months. You might as well be outside during a snow storm with a summer outfit on. Besides the cold, working at Kohl's was fun. We found ways to entertain our selves while unloading the merchandise, with all kinds of conversations, plus our manager was always with us and we all listened to music. So it was a very fun and relaxed environment. I loved my co-workers, we had a divide and conquer attitude and it was very effective we almost always got our job done about an hour in advance. When we did, our manager would have us replenish and that's how I learned to work the sales floor of a department store."
good,Work was very laid-back. But it does get hectic at some points. The management and co-workers are very friendly.
good,"Kohl's is a great company to work for.  My store was always very accommodating, I worked there during college and they gave me a lot of leeway with time off and worked around my always-changing schedule!"
good,"-No day was the same, you could expect to learn something new everyday."
good,"A typical day at work was interesting , everyday would be a different experienced . I learned how to sell Kohl's credit cards . The hardest part of the job was on black friday , there was alot of people but i enjoyed it and it showed me how to be very fast . My co-workers and mangers helped me at the being then i had it ."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"The management at this company really makes the difference. Along with the rest of the co-workers, they are great people who really enjoy their jobs. Having supporting leaders and co-workers really creates an environment that supports personal growth."
good,"The people are easy going and easy to get along with. Typically the day includes merchandising, preparing the department for upcoming sales and offers, displaying merchandise in a way that is pleasing and catches the consumers attention, and providing excellent customer service. I have learned through these experiences how to manage others, work in a team environment, provide excellent customer service, and multitask with frequent interruptions. The hardest part of the job is being able to accomplish all your tasks for the day while still providing excellent customer service at any time it is needed, but knowing that you are helping people find what they are looking for makes the job enjoyable."
good,"Typical day greet and smile. co workers was very welcoming to me outgoing, management was very understanding outging and also welcoming. The hardest part of my job was being called out my name while working. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people."
good,"Over the last sever years I have worked customer service, cashier, freight and credit greeting, and I enjoy it all. "
good,I have the best coworkers and that makes a world of a difference in the workplace. Friendly and understanding managment. 
good,Started the day off with helping unload the delivery truck and restocking the shelves. Making sure that all departments in the store were in order. I've learned time management and getting projects done in a timely manner. 
good,"I always stayed busy everyday at work assisting customers, I learned that you have to bite your tounge when dealing with the public, most of my co-workers were very friendly but some not so"
good,awesome people and awesome company to work for. The store is clean and the people are nice to work with. A Majority of the staff is older than your average 21 yer old associate. 
good,Kohl's is a great first job for a high school person or even collage. Management really works around your schedule.
good,"The managers were nice and always made sure I was able to learn new things and advance in my position. There really wasn't a hard part to the job, but the communication between associates and managers was a little off in the beginning. Once managers became aware of this problem, they did their best to make sure communication between associates and managers was flowing properly and every one was free to express their ideas and opinions. Overall, I really enjoyed working for Kohl's."
good,"A typical day at Kohl's includes cleaning the departments, assisting customers and making a team effort to close the store. Hardest part of the job would be the late night hours that you have to work. On the flip side, the most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the people you work with and the customers. "
good,I made a lot of friends at Kohls who were always helpful to me in learning more about retail. It was always a joy to come to work. I just wish that I had a more stable schedule.
good,"Kohls has a great work life balance, the partnerships between kohls loss prevention, law enforcement and thee executive team is awesome. "
good,"Some days are hectically busy and others you twiddle your thumbs, but most were pretty steady, got to know regular customers on a one on one basis, helped some who weren't sure which product to buy based on needs and wants, able to almost as much as a manager could at registers to help customers with most issues about products, and helped them understand differences between various products."
good,"In Kohl's, I feel like every co-worker is part of the family, and we are all working together to meet our credit, monetary or email goal of the day. The managers are helpful, and if you have trouble understanding any task, they will help bring you up to speed."
good,"Work was really fun, everyone was nice & really helpful. The hardest part of the job would be knowing where everything is because Kohl's constantly moves around the merchandise, & the most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers out."
good,"I absolutely love my job and going to work everyday. A lot of great people and great managers. They will answer any questions and teach you how to do things if needed. Everyone works well together and gets a long great. The hardest part for me would have to be walking around constantly, but I manage. The most enjoyable part is dealing with the customers."
good,A typical day at work would be serving Customers with smiling and greeting them. I've learned providing an excellent Customer Service. Management is not that great. Co-workers are fun to work with. The hardest part of the job is to put all of the clothes back from fitting room. The most enjoyable part of the job is team work
good,"A typical day at work is unloading trucks and putting products out on the floor. if given an afternoon shift, i would be on cashier or on the floor cleaning and folding clothes"
good,I worked for Kohl's during the Christmas season so my opinion is based only on that time period. Christmas is usually very busy no matter what kind of company or job position.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,We take better care of our customers than just about anywhere else. I actually notice the lack of customer service when I go other places now. Management is very supportive. Full time jobs are lacking though. Many people are part time and most likely will never find a full time position there.
good,A typical day at work was just working in customer service and helping customers. A couple days a week it consisted of unloading the truck. Truck was probably the hardest part of my job but at the same time the most enjoyable. It was the hardest because we always tried so hard to reach our time goal and while unloading the truck you have to make sure you are putting all the merchandise onto the right carts so everything gets put out on the floor correctly. It was also the most enjoyable part of my job because we were able to talk to each other and become a really close team. My managers were awesome and always fixed a problem if there was one and they were always there to help. All my co-workers were very friendly and treated everyone like family. I learned so much about merchandising at Kohls and loved every minute of it. I would have to say this has been by far my most favortie job i've had.
good,"A typical day at work is very fast, and competitive. I learned an enormous amount working at Kohls including: money management, customer service, floor clean up, store restocking, and working with others. My management team was an outstanding one everyone worked as a team and that was very much appreciated. I worked with many co-workers and became very good friends with some of them, everyone worked together to get the task done. The hardest part was working black Friday I did not enjoy doing that. I loved interacting with our customers they kept us going."
good,Loved the people i worked with wasn't so crazy about the random hours staying late then coming in early. Wouldn't have been as bad if i was not pregnant. I still go in to see the people that work there.
good,Helpful staff willing to help you
good,Typical Day:
good,I go threw the store with a small team and make sure that all the signs are correct for that day or week's sale. I make sure that all of our sign's are put away and they are in the correct spot so they are easy to find the next time we go and use them. A small team and I make sure that our loading dock is clean and safe.
good,Working at a warehouse was both fun and challenging. I really enjoyed meeting different kind people from all walks of life. I also really enjoyed being promoted to trainer (where I trained new employees) and to HR (where I manifested reports) because I got the opportunity to experience different aspects of the job.
good,Kohl's was a great place to work with great people to work with. In my job I learned how to interact with customers and handle customer problems and ways to solve any problems they might have. The hardest part about the job was probably the overall time to finish projects. I would go into work and get x amount of projects only time enough to finish one or two of them. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the customers. I get to meet all kinds of interesting people.
good,I loved working at Kohls. Their values were great. They cared for employees. They took the time to train employees which is a huge plus. The most enjoyable part of the job was having new oppurtunities to learn everyday. The hardest part was keeping the store tidy when understaffed.
good,"I loved the fact that Kohl's was always involved in charities for children. Even though most of the customers were returning merchandise, they were regulars and very friendly and some would wait until I was working to come in to see me. I make wonderful friends while I worked there."
good,I had the opportunity to work with such great people as well as the customers.
good,"I learned alot with this company.They gave me a chance without knowing alot about working on vehicles,and trained me.I enjoyed helping the customers that came in to pick up their vehicle."
good,Nice steady flow of work. Great customer interaction. Always a task to complete and great coworkers with a good sense of teamwork.
good,"good benefits,good people.I like the flexability in working the hours giving,incase of emergency,they understand,and your job isn't on the line."
good,"Typical work day could start off hectic, especially during the holidays. I learned to how to operate a cash register and become friendly with the customers. I had a good manager she made up to 30 mins checks or so to see how i was doing .I had very nice co-workers they helped me if i needed assistance. The hardest part of the job was closing. the most enjoyable part of the job was that i got to meet different people."
good,It is a great company with great expectations. With this store being a new store it has come along greatly. The team is great and the people i work with are wonderful. The hardest part of my job is when i don't feel well. Was just diagnosed with IBS and they have been very understanding with me. My co-workers are amazing and great people to work with.
good,I have worked and learned from very supportive co-worker and management.
good,You get great hours here but very lonesome sometimes. Very hard to get accustomed to the cliches and groups.
good,"Everyday I first check the communication from previous day including sales, goals, and workload priorities. It is important to stay knowledgeable with daily goals, project information, and task deadlines. I then make sure all associates understand what they are assigned to do for the day. I follow up every so often to answer any questions and offer my help. I handle customer and associate questions, accidents, praises, and complaints every single day. I ensure the customer service standards to the store are being met and communicate to the team what needs to be done to improve."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I enjoyed the benefits and the structure they have as a company. Also, their genuine focus on customers."
good,"If you can get in on a permanent basis, it's a great company to work for. There is plenty of room for growth. The only issue I had with them is that while they strive for a ""family"" type environment with the employees, networking is next to impossible and you're generally working by yourself."
good,My work day here was just always amazing because the people i worked with and got to know was great they taught me a lot of very useful skills that i could use in the retail field. My hardest moment for me was selling the kohl's credit cards. The best moments that i have had working here is that I've accomplished so much in this store alone then i have in any other job combine
good,To inventory merchandise.Tag ticket and discount merchandise.Hang sale signs .Backstock merchandise at the end of shift.
good,"Great place to work, plenty of job security. Management team overall was delightful however there are always one or two bad eggs that slip through H.R. It is retail and retail hours."
good,"In taking calls daily you can deescaltion skills. The management team was supportive,and tried to give speedy help on questions.The co-workers were the best part of the job, the support,and friendship( which is also the most enjoyable part of job). The hardest part was on the low call volume days when you did not have much to do, i like to stay busy."
good,Daily workload is heavy
good,"I would come in to work and I would be greeted by the cashiers, As I made my way to the break room I'd clock in and head to customer returns to let the manager know I was there. The manager would then tell me what needed to be done for the day,"
good,"Days are typical 8 hours days. A lot of work is given to to you everyday. You can learn quick management are open to training any associate. Co-workers are freindliy, and manager are helpful. Best retail company to work for period."
good,"Typical work day is very busy. Always on your feet and doing multiple tasks throughout the store. Management is supportive and friendly, as are co-workers."
good,"A typical day at work includes, giving breaks at jewelry, customer service, and at the registers. I merchandize the Misses and Juniors departments on freight days. I lead 3-5 people in price changes, merchandizing, and floor coverage."
good,I have been a part of the Kohl's team for six years now and I really enjoy working with such a growing company that is understanding and is very flexible with my availability.
good,I would come into work and know exactly what was expected. Many opportunities to excel/help fellow employees. Great rewards for being a decent employee. I'd recommend this as a retail position
good,i loved working at konls . management was very nice and always had someone to talk to . i loved working the different departments
good,"I love the store Kohl's itself. The associates and management are all great. However, I worked for Loss Prevention and I loved my job, but I didn't care for my boss because he was unprofessional and not trained properly."
good,"Kohls is continually introducing New Brands which keeps them extremely competitive. Customer Service is #1. Very fast paced and ever changing work environment keeps things interesting, to say the least. There are often opportunities for advancement, especially if you are willing to relocate. Expectations are high and compensation if fair."
good,"I love this place! I love my team and the jobs are pretty easy and there's always a fun project to do. There aren't many hours however, which for me is fine since I out my time towards something else but I can see others struggling..."
good,"Originally I loved working at Kohls, it was a very positive environment and was easy to do, but some managers forget what it means to teach and expect you to always do everything perfectly."
good,It was a pretty open environment.I met lots of new people and Retail was very fun and something new to try . I would love to work in retail again because it was always something to do while at work.
good,I worked for Kohl's Department Stores for many years. The holiday season was the most challenging but still enjoyed working there. It's hard work and fast paced but I loved my managers and my co-workers!
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I really enjoyed being part of this company, it was my first job ever and they were really flexible with my schedule since I was in college too. Overall, I believe it is a great environment full of opportunities to grow and be successful."
good,"I really enjoy being at Kohl’s. They are generally flexible with hours, everyone is friendly and easy to get along with. For pretty much every holiday we have food they bring or we’ll all bring in a dish. My only true complaint is the pay is not the best. Most are at minimum wage, so a lot of people at my store have to have more than one job."
good,"Great place to work. I really like working at Kohl's, the managers are very nice and understanding, co-workers are friendly and easy to get to know. The only issue is the hours as a part-time employee you only get 4-10 hours a week, during the holiday season you will see 20-32 hours a week. The job is not hard, just have to know to deal with angry customers. Also, the pay can be better."
good,Each day brings a new challenge.  It takes great leadership to maximize your team to exceed company goals.  You have the pleasure of working with great people each day and creating a cohesive team is key to success at Kohl's.
good,I think kohls is a great places to work if its your first job or you are looking for a part time job. There is room for growth and promotions but not many.
good,Kohl’s is new and exciting most Kohl’s stores have added new additions like an amazon drop off which customers loved because it was convenient. Also Kohl’s has everything from clothing to accessories and technology
good,Minimal hours here.. if you need something to do/hobby this is for you. This job(part time/seasonal) is better used as a second job. Discounts are GREAT definitely something I used.
good,"Working at Kohls is a fun and respected place to work. The management is very helpful and if something is ever wrong, they are quick to give constructive criticism and help you learn the ins and outs of the job."
good,Kohl’s was willing to work around my school schedule and gave me days off whenever I needed it. I would definitely work there again or recommend it to anyone interested in working there.
good,Great company proving to remain competitive in an increasingly difficult retail industry.  People are valued for their innovation. Recognition is provided for individuals that are not in management positions. They care about the community and work life balance is good depending upon your leadership and role.
good,So I was a seasonal employee which means my experience was probably extremely different from the full time employees but with that being said I had a decent time at Kohl’s the only problem I truly had is that there was to many people on site at the same time which made work hard to do at times and that also made it so there wasn’t a lot of work most days but other than that it wasn’t a bad time
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work for a part time job.  It is a fast place environment, where you'll learn almost all aspects of retail. The staff is diverse and are willing to share their knowledge with new hires. "
good,Kohl's was a very productive and fun place to work. The employee's are respectful towards each other. We use teamwork to get tasks finished in a timely manner
good,"My experience at Khol’s warehouse was horrible , the people there were miserable and didn’t know how to interact with others. There were a few people who made the job easier."
good,Great place to work. The management is very supportive of the security staff.  I relocated to Texas and decided to take some time off work so I didn't transfer my position.
good,"At Kohl's the managers made it a point to help out and care for the associates as much as they could. A typical day at work involved me assisting customers, back up on the registers, assisting at the Amazon return Desk if help was needed. and helping out wherever else need help. It was a very fast paced job which never left me bored. I really enjoyed working here."
good,"Kohl's has expanded my knowledge in retail by a lot. I've learned not only the basics, such as customer service or cashier, but I've also learned how to complete online orders and jewelry consultants. The workplace overall was always busy and the management is well. The hardest part of the job would be truck days, being a cashier or floor associate on the busiest days and back stocking items. Overall, Kohl's is a good job for starters."
good,Working for Kohls was very exciting. The people were really nice. It was never really any issues from my experience. The hours were nice and the pay was good too.
good,Business casual. Standing and walking long hours. Friendly managers. A lot of gross customers. Was exhausting and you can be scheduled late even as a young student.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I enjoyed working there because I learned I really enjoyed retail. You experienced all types situations, and learned new skills with Kohl’s cash and coupons."
good,"It is retail. However, it is a great starter job. Management works very hard to create a ""family"" environment, which is difficult to do when turnover is so high. You're able to set your availability to pretty much whatever you want. If you have more open availability, you're probably outlast many others and get the opportunity to move up."
good,"Excellent management structure provides room for self-motivation, potential job advancement, and teamwork.   Customer service is highly promoted and encouraged from the top.   At times, the load seems heavy, but teamwork is available most shifts to lighten it.   Pay is relatively low,  compared to other retailers, but after all, it is retail."
good,Kohls was a great starting point for me. They gave me the opportunity to get my foot into the real work place and I'm glad about all the people i met.
good,Kohls is very fast paced they ask a lot of their employees for little pay if you're just looking to get out of the house or a second job to just make a little extra this is perfect. They offer the best flexible schedules I've run across.
good,While working at Kohls I have learned to manage my time better and how to efficiently help customers in a orderly fashion. I have learned to be more opened minded when working with other employees.
good,"Kohl’s is a great place to work. Very family oriented and try and work with you and your schedule the best they can. Unfortunately Kohl’s does not pay the best, especially when you’re working your butt off there. The other competing stores around pay 11 dollars an hour while Kohl’s pays 9.50. However, you get a really nice discount on things you purchase there. Overall, great place to work but sometimes you second guess due to the low pay."
good,I had a lot of fun working at Kohl's and I was there 5 years. But I did not get paid enough and worked enough hours plus working with all the managers and coworkers. Plus signing customers up for credit cards.
good,Very flexible on hours. Great culture to work around. The hardest part of the job is dealing will difficult customers. Would recommend working here you're wanting to make extra money.
good,Had lots of employees perks and rewards to boost employee moral and productivity. Easy to learn and fun to work for. Lots of benefits and great place to work. Flexible with scheduling and lots of opportunity for advancement.
good,"Fun place to work at, with friendly people. "
good,"Associates are encouraged to learn and grow.  Okay to make mistakes, just learn from them and move forward.  Very nice physical working spaces.  Plenty of opportunity for individuals to grow and explore positions outside of their primary team.  Excellent HR training and development team that understands the business units and how to bring value to teams and individuals."
good,"you can learn a lot of different positions at Kohls, the management is very helpful and the work environment is very pleasant, you can also advance pretty quickly."
good,"Team members are family. The Kohl's I work at has an amazing team, and management often recognizes that. Everyone is recognized for what they do, and we are constantly having little competitions, which often come with rewards. We all work together well despite having a very diverse group. This job has absolutely taught me what a good environment looks like. It feels good to have complete trust in your management, instead of having the typical ""i hate my boss"" mentality. The worst part of the job is the downtime (this is only applicable to cashiers), as a cashier, you must always stay near the registers for obvious reasons, but this leaves little to do during slow times. Another thing I must meantion is that Kohl's pushes credit card applications HARD. On an average cashier shift, you'll probably have a goal of at least 2-3 credit apps. It has always messed with my morals to push so hard with every customer to sign up, but it's part of the job, and ultimately you have to trust your customers know whats best for them, regardless of your/Kohl's pitch."
good,"Kohl's was a great place to work. I really enjoyed my time working there. Management was great so were my coworkers. Very flexible with hours, great place to work if you are a student."
good,"Honestly, I don't have anything negative to say about Kohl's. It's a great job for University students and it has helped me to afford school and this job has worked with me on my many occasions. The work isn't difficult."
good,"I had a good time there, wish i could have stayed longer, everyone was really nice to me. the hours worked with my schedule around school to the point where i never had to call out and i was always on time"
good,"Everyone is so nice, always helping and encouraging each other to do better and advance. Flexible schedule and very understanding managers. Also, they teach you as much as they can."
good,I only worked seasonal.  During the holiday season you could get pretty much all the hours you wanted but in the off season you may be lucky to get 10-15 hours week.  They were always pushing you to sign people up for credit cards.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Kohl's contained many opportunities for new skill advancement,  and was willing to promote from within. There were many opportunities to learn new skill sets and department requirements"
good,"Worked there during winter seasonal, and it was fairly smooth. To work here, you need to be able to stay calm even if there are upset customers. You are on your feet most of the time."
good,"The daily responsibilities performed consisted of constant organizing, assisting customers, stocking merchandise, and trash collecting around the store."
good,"Kohls was a fun workplace and all the associates where nice. It sucks that you start off with a little bit of hours, but when it comes to the holidays hours start to pick up. Once, the season stops you are back to less hours."
good,"This was a physically and mentally demanding job. Attendance was extremely important ,as this was pertaining to point system . A typical day at work involved being assigned pick tasks, as well as being cross trained to work in other areas as needed . Management were well trained in the fields relating to operations on a daily ,week to week basis.  The one thing I learned about this job was the ability to problem solve situations , mostly to make sure customers were getting their orders on time . Workplace culture - that's kind of a hard one to describe ,as some employees felt it was better to slack off on their attentiveness to meet customer satisfaction , it was just a paycheck to them . The hardest part of the job was a lot of walking on a daily basis ,on a good day I probably walked more than 14 miles on any given day . Another aspect of this being the hardest part was underlying health issues with my heart , diagnosed in the ninth year of employment , mostly attributed to family history . Rest assured ,I'm in a better state of health now , but with approaching the age of 70 within eight years , and working since I was 10 years of age , it will be time to retire before the age of 70 . So, with that being said, I still had it in me to continue working despite the health issue obstacles that lay before me , meaning I was very dedicated and devoted to my work , and to helping Kohl's accomplish their yearly goals of being one of the top 10 companies to work for . I would say in closing that the most enjoyable part of working for this company was getting to know a lot of inspirational,"
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work. It's fast paced but very well organized. Also, your hard work never goes unnoticed. Although it is not an obligation they compensate their workers for efforts and hard work,"
good,I loved the competiveness when it came to kohl’s charges. We were always fed there. The management team was so kind and were very good on solving problems.
good,Kohls has a great culture and really do care for their associates and customer.  I was blessed to get the opportunity to work in this organization and with the team that I had.  The employee benefits were exceptional and the discount was awesome.  If I didn't have life changes I would still be there.
good,"Kohl's preaches an atmosphere of inclusion and work life balance. As a HRS, one is expected to work 40 hours but nothing over. Not much opportunity for Over Time. Lots of added perks and spirit events at location to give back to team for hard work."
good,i worked overnight for printing signs and unloading the truck. for the most part you get good break times and the night goes by fast. the hardest part of the job was staying up and on your feet frequently from 10p-6am.
good,Started my career with Kohls. 12 hour days 4 days a week. Associates first mentality. Workplace culture is very important. Would highly recommend Kohls as a place to work.
good,Kohl’s was a great environment with ability to learn different parts of store with good flexibility. Good environment and not too overwhelming work. One of the best jobs I’ve had.
good,"A typical day working at Kohl’s is 7-8 hours in a day with a 15 minute break and then a 30 minute lunch break. Overall, working at Kohl’s was relaxed, but also very competitive with sales on the Kohl’s charge card. The managers were very flexible with the schedule and were always concerned if something was going on in your personal life. I worked in customer service, and dealing with unhappy customers really took a toll on me, but most of my coworkers were very comforting."
good,"A typical day for me is ensuring consumer satisfaction and working the sales floor. I am provided with tools such as a Bluebird which helps us check what owe have in stock or using the register to help customers get their purchases quicker if theres a long line. Other days are different, having to come in early to do price changes or freight merchandising or balancing those with being on the sales floor. I have learned better at dealing with people since being at this job and having the opportunity to move up in the company as well."
good,"It was an amazing experience working there. I honestly had a blast, the team was fun to work with. My schedule was very flexible due to my being a full time student. A typical day at work for me was checking in on time, cleaning up the register and getting started on ringing up items for my customers. Other things I did besides ringing up items, I also interacted with my customers and offered them to join in on the Kohl's membership. I would offer discounts that were going on that specific time of the week to those who were already members. The hardest part of the job was during holidays and special weekend sales, the store would be too busy but also a fun challenge to face on. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with an excellent team, they were like a family to me and we were always in syn with one another. if one needed assistance on something, someone would always be there to help them get through a specific task. There was never a dull moment working at Kohl's."
good,"I loved it, never thought I would leave, but due to a car accident I had to resign. I miss all the bonuses & discounts. The Work/Life balance was a major blessing while working there. I've heard it has changed a lot after some upper management moved on to greener pastures"
good,Working here seasonally during my first semester of college was great! I got a lot of hours and got decent pay. The coworkers were really nice and it was overall a good environment.
good,standing for more then 10 hours and stocking picking packing store orders preparing for shipment to customers' locations. people coming together as a team to make the job flow alot easier its not a one man job when we are target as a group to meet the quarter.
good,Very team oriented experience. Working on the merchandising crew was a great experience. Everyone was so kind and agreeable even though it was 4 am when we began. Great experience.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Enjoyed working for Kohls. The headline gives a few good reasons why. The company worked well with me, trying to offer ways to keep me employed when I needed to leave.  Co-workers meshed well together. Night shift was great, they had benefits that overcame their cons. Managers were wonderful."
good,"I know management and workplace culture differs from store to store, but the Downer's Grove location is an absolute joy to work at. Everyone is so kind and welcoming, and is willing to step in and help if you need it. A great first job or summer job, and they provide amazing long-term positions as well!"
good,Easy going just check in people at the register. Fold clothes. Learn how to be persuasive. Communication skills got better. Bagged up products quickly. Put products where they belonged.
good,"I had a great experience overall at kohl's, but the management wasn't  always on the same page. I also hated waking up to get to work at 4:00 am some days."
good,The makeup counter was very slow a lot of the time and I had to help in jewelry a lot because there wasn't anyone to cover the breaks for jewelry. They were super organized with the break scheduling which was great.
good,as a sales associate you will be able to learn the department youre in and have to keep up with the cleaniness while costumers shop. you will have to clean out the dressing rooms and fold clothes while getting the clothes people are returning to the store.
good,"Straighten clothing and make tables with clothing neat and presentable, check out customers, encourage customers to open a Kohl's card for better saving."
good,"I loved the job and people I worked with.  No set schedule. Back-and-forth days and evenings, must work every weekend.  This schedule doesn't work well with having young kids in sports."
good,Great work environment. Managers were good at handling busy times. They looked after employees first. Great comradery between employees. I learned customer service patience while working black Friday.
good,"During my 6 month employment with Kohls I met with many great people, both customer and employee. The management understood where improvement needed to be made, and made the proper changes. Really good place to start your Customer Service career!"
good,"I expected Kohl's to be a simple job out of high school that I'd stay at for maybe a season or two. After a few months I had found myself in a sort of work family and was happy staying as long as possible."
good,"Being able to communicate and work with management and other coworkers was always fun. We did take our jobs serious, but we had fun with it. There was never a day where work was boring."
good,"i was a cashier at kohl's and the work envionrment was great ,customers where very kind and nice and every one treated everybody with the up most respect"
good,It was fun working in something new. the best part was black friday even though it was so hard it was super fun working with everyone and keeping busy all day.
good,"You always had a job and was face paced. There are more pro's then cons in my opinion. The co-workers were the best people I've ever worked with, I had no problems with none of them."
good,Everyone was pleasant to work with. Supervisors worked well with all employees and answered all questions when I started. During the Christmas season everyone was willing to help out in each section to keep up on the areas looking clean and dressing rooms being cleaned out and ready to go for the next person.
good,I like Kohls. I've been in many retail places and I've learned retail is retail. But Kohls seem a little bit different. Every job has its stress but I tend to maintain balance because it's critical in life. The managers are very hands on. Even the employees help assist new coworkers whenever help is need. Sometime without even asking they come and help just by the look on a person face.
good,"Kohl’s has a very easy going atmosphere, but the management sometimes is not great and they will treat you as if you are unimportant. Area supervisors are always great to work with."
good,I love working for Kohl's. I have been there for over five years and have been trained in several departments. I love that each day I come in to something different. It is wonderful that they allow us to work and train in different departments to advance your position.
good,"Busy work schedule"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Busy atmosphere especially during the holidays. Great deals that customers love. Outstanding store manager and managers! They're very helpful and informative.
good,"I’ve worked here for seasonal position, and honestly, it was a fun job. I worked with the most nicest people. It would always be an easy job everyday. The managers would help you as much as they can. This job was the most easiest job I’ve had honestly. The bad thing about it is that you don’t really get that much hours. You could be working all week, but only have about 3 to 4 hours a day. Which wasn’t that bad, but people would want more."
good,"Performance- driven administrative professional with experience in facilitating support service and office management. Strong organizational, customer service and communication skill with the ability to independently plan and direct business affairs."
good,"I started  in July this year after leaving Manufacturing and I love it there. The management team is outstanding, supportive and caring about their employees. "
good,Working at Kohl's has been a good experience. Just to me it's very stressful and competitive and very busy. I would recommend this job to a friend if they were interested in finding a job.
good,Great workplace and great pay. The managers at Kohls are very knowledgeable and they are great people. The job is laid back and isn't too hard. I would definitely recommend it.
good,Overall Kohl’s is a great place to work at. Everyone is really friendly and respectful to each other. Its a good working environment so its easy to learn new things as well.
good,"Working here was a great fit. It gave me fantastic experiences outside of work. I always felt welcome and comfortable at work. While we got our work done, we were able to have fun."
good,"Kohls is a great place to work as a manager, with a ""yes we can"" job culture. It does require longer hours through the day, but with great benefits. There are big opportunities for advancement."
good,Great place to work with friendly co workers. the pay was not great and the chance to move up is there but its a long line to wait. overall the customers were awesome!
good,"This was my first time ever working in retail, and it gave me an eye opening experience. Unfortunately, I noticed through working there that many people do not respect retail workers as much as they should."
good,"Start off early in the morning, then straight to da locker room. Then i go to the cafeteria to get a cup of coffee. Once i drank my coffee, im off to the floor to clock in and get the dat started."
good,Nice co-workers and good job management. I had a great time working cultural and respectful co-workers. I've learned a lot and their experiences were very professional
good,"Learned effective ways to learn the layout of a store and to assist customers with questions/concerns. "
good,"My typical day is customer returns and purchases.I have been cross trained in all departments learning how to restocked inventory, merchandise sets, price changes and recovery. Enjoy working with the employees and customers."
good,Kohl's is a great place to work if you have a Manager that supports your role.  the culture is family oriented and the benefits are amazing compared to other retailers.
good,"Lovely helpful staff ,"
good,Great place to work. This was pastime thu there busy season and once January came it's was slow.but I learned A lot and was blessed to have made good friends there.
good,"The job requires attention to detail, but is not difficult."
good,"Most days you show up and go to the area designated by your schedule. I learned better conflict resolution because of the occasional frustrated customers. The managers are, in general, very understanding and helpful. Everyone helps out  when needed and everyone is rewarded when we do great. Hardest part is how monotonous everything gets after a while, but that just makes the new stuff more enjoyable."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I loved working in customer service, you got to meet different people. Other positions I wasn't as excited abou, not because of them but myself......."
good,"First things first, I am writing this review over one year after leaving, so things may be different here now."
good,"The biggest issue I have is the lack of hours, However I love almost everybody I work with and the management is always open to hearing out what you need to say,"
good,"Amazing work life balance, good leadership teams, continued opportunity for growth.Work Culture is amazing from working together with different team members and leaders."
good,"Decent job with decent pay.  Fairness and freeing really.   Plenty of opportunities and pay raises.    Hard work and long hours,   very fast pace and heavy lifting."
good,I do like it here and I enjoy the flexible schedule and I get along with my management team.  That being said my only complaint is that sometimes I get scheduled against my availability.
good,"A nice place to work as a part-time employee. Everyone is helpful, friendly, & you feel part of a team. Management is always looking for new and efficient ways to improve the morale of their employees."
good,"lack of hours , I left because of mental health issues, great place to work management well knowledgeable , calm and work well employees good at problem solving stress free environment"
good,"Great place to work, has friendly co-workers, and is very accommodating with the scheduling. Is a good place to go for a first job, and also good for later jobs or for a career. Pretty easy to learn specific job requirements, depending on which department you work. Definitely will help with improving customer service skills."
good,"A typical day at work for me involved taking care of customer and customer transactions, ensuring quality customer service and a friendly attitude. I also processed credit card payments, and credit card applications. I learned the benefits of having the stores charge card, and the repercussions as well. The management goes above and beyond to ensure a well managed work place for their employees, and the culture of the work place is business casual. Hardest part of the job is not meeting a certain quota, but the most enjoyable part is when we do obtain that quota."
good,"One of the best things about working at Kohls, was it was a team job, but each person had a specific task to complete so it was also independent. Each manager had a different style of directing associates which made it confusing on what tasks needed prioritizing. At the store, there was a very relaxed feeling within the store and all of the associates made the customers their first priority."
good,Kohls was a standing place to work for. The management made you feel welcome.  They made holidays a blast they go all out for there associates and it was a pleasure to have worked there.
good,Really great work atmosphere. Great management team. Always something to do. Really big on customer service and kohls credit. I learned patience is a must in retail and customer service.
good,For my years spent at Kohl's I delevoped a family. They were so amazing and hard working and deserved more pay than what we were given.
good,"Kohl's I admit was an utmost fun and wonderful experience, I was a part of the shoes department but I also volunteered for other departments, such as housewares I certainly will go back to help them out again for the holidays"
good,Working at Kohl's the management teaches a lot by working seasonal  the experience they give u  prepare u for the next job or stay at job and grow I wouldn't mind if  they call me cause a quick learner
good,Great organization to use as a foundation in business. Opportunities for growth and development if you put in the time and dedication.
good,great place to work but limited in hours. you will need to know many positions to get hours. Make sure you have great walking shoes.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Overall my experience with kohls was nice! The staff was friendly. what I learned was to be quick and focused on the register. Always be super kind to everyone. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I had the cashier position and was not in fitting rooms because I felt cashier was pretty awesome. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers.
good,All i can say is it is a pretty good place to work. It being retail does make it a little difficult at times but the company itself is good enough to keep me coming back everyday i work.
good,"Great for full time students and part time job. Always meet new and great people wether costumer or co-workers. Management is tough but fair. Just focus on your work you have nothing to worry about. The toughest part of the job is during the holidays such as, Thanks Giving and Christmas."
good,Working at Kohl's was nice because they were understanding and it was a great team to work with. The managers really tried to make it pleasurable instead of just work
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work, I was only a seasonal employee, so I was assigned to a couple different jobs around the store. Everyones nice, the schedules are changing every week, but always posted in time."
good,"Your day will always busy, meaning you will always be engaged. "
good,It was a great experience working somewhere with the type of clothing I love. I love customer service and working as a cashier let me connect with customers. I always wanted to see my customers happy and when I would see them I would do my best to put a smile on their face.
good,"Kohl's and a very fun and unique place to meet people and experience a friendly and fast paced environment. It can get stressful at times, but manageable. It's a job where if you aren't full-time, you aren't able to keep stabilized if you pay bills and don't have another job sadly."
good,Kohl's was a fast-paced and friendly place to work. It taught me a lot of good social and customer service skills. If I wanted a career in retail it is the perfect place to start.
good,"I enjoyed working at Kohl's. You work hard but are well taken care of. The pay is what made me give it a 4 out of 5 stars. Being on any team at Kohl's whether is the Freight team or the Merchandising team, you work very hard and very fast paced and the pay just isnt fair to the amount of effort you have to put in."
good,"In every given day, I always felt welcomed at my job. When walking in the building I was greeted warmly and always felt that I was a valuable part of the team and store. The most important lessons I learned was how to deal with customers in a gracious and friendly manner. My managers helped my professional and personal development in many ways. They allowed opportunities to advance my problem solving skills and troubleshooting. Many of my co-workers became my friends out side of work which made my job environment that much better. The hardest part of my job was the hours. The hours were never consistent and it was hard to plan activities out side of work. The best part of the job was feeling valued. I never felt unwanted."
good,Great people and fun working environment. There was always something to do while working there. Everyone was always there to give a helping hand.
good,"My co-workers are cool and exciting people. Customers are understanding. Management does a good job to try and make work feel like a robotic 9 to 5 shift by having fun activities to do in the break room and on the floor to encourage to get credits. The hardest part of the job to dealing with rude customers, but it helps you build patience at the workplace and also helps with controlling how you react to certain situations and not to take things personally."
good,It can get pretty busy. I learned how to count the registers and make sure all items have a UPC. My managers work well with the employees. I like my coworkers.

Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Fun fast pace place to work at. The hours available could be better but if you are in school or looking for a second job this is perfect.
good,"Kohl's developed talent from within the organization, allowing staff to challenge themselves, develop cross-functional skill sets, and grow their careers."
good,"Clearly, like other retail businesses, Kohl's is a major corporation that keep a strong interest in making profit. In my opinion, More importantly, they are an establishment striving to more emphasis on their customer service. Our management consists of many lower and higher levels in charge, but ALL persons in change comprehend on the importance of effort in satisfying the consumer and employees within. Customer engagement is a rating that has raised all employees' efforts of concern."
good,"Shipment, Sales, Merchandising, Customer Service"
good,Usually I have to load boxes faster as possible inside traillers. I learn a lot about safety and some simple techniques to make my job become easy and safe. The management at Nkohl's distribution center is the best I never see. Co-workers in majority like to help. The work is someday difficult when the majority of boxes have heavy stuffs. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that you always feel like in family. All the management staff take good care for the workers.
good,The other employees are very nice and the staff is overall very great.  They do take care of you as long as you do what is needed of you. People in the office stay on top of things and make sure everything gets handled as needed.

I have been able to progress with the company to become a district visual manager. One of the more frustrating parts about my job is the mixed communication that comes through the corporate offices, as I'm sure this is common in other big retail stores, it is hard to keep everyone on the same page at times."
good,"Working for Kohls helped me out a lot on communication skills, being a Post Sales Associate our customers always come first  making sure their wants and needs are met. Its a fast paste environment and you have to keep an open mind to anything. The managers are all great and have their own ways of doing things.

good,"I'm either helping customers find something they are looking for, doing price changes, putting clothes that were left in the fitting rooms away. (making sure the fitting rooms are clean at all times) working on the truck early mornings (6-11a.m) or I'm on the register ringing customers up, helping them redeem their Kohl's cash/ price check, or do an even exchange."
good,Those who I work with are very friendly and easy to get along with. Management is always on top of what they need to do. The most enjoyable part of my job is just being able to have fun and interact with the customers and help them.
good,"Kohls is a great place to work, they just do not pay enough for what a person with knowledge of the day to day operation should earn.  A supervisor should be paid at least 2 to 3 more dollars an hour, for taking on the responsibility of a department. If a supervisor, is the person that management comes and have them execute different policies, they should be paid a little more."
good,"Friendly and helpful co-workers and managers, knowledgeable and eager to help me learn and grow. My co-workers were happy to tell me about the city and where to go when I first moved here. Enjoyed being able to go to work and have fun. The commute was difficult to work with."
good,A typical day at work for me is walking speaking to everyone before i get clocked in all employees were really friendly and are always excited about coming into work. When i first started at Kohl's the store was not even open yet. I help put the store together building shelves and stocking all appliances into store. I cant say anything bad about this job because it was an amazing work environment and I'm sure if I wasn't leaving for school i would have stayed longer.
good,"Busy at work from the time I clock in until the time I leave.  I am a go to person for technical equipment and various other questions.  I love working in this type of environment."

good,This was a great company to work for. They were easy to work with and get along with. The management team was great and everyone in the store worked as a team to meet goals and deadlines. I would highly recommend this company!
good,"On a typical day I greet every customer that walks thru the door, I also help them locate a department area. I help find sizes and also provide information on where to find the item at. I cashiered when i was needed to do so. What I've learned put customer first and always use the yes we can policy.  Great store Management and Co- Workers, everyone is very supportive and just amazing. The hardest part is dealing with rude customers and getting people to sign up for credit cards. The customer interaction is the best part, OVERALL the job is enjoyable."
good,"Kohl's is a fun, fast-paced, and joyful environment to work in. The people there are kind and very friendly. A typical day at kohl's over night is the unloading of truck, replenishment of merchandise, and getting the stockroom clean before clocking out. Due to the time I have spent at kohl's I have learned what it takes to be a great leader. When you work at kohl's if you have any kind of question your co-workers and/or manager will give you the best answer they can to solve any issue you or someone else may have. The most difficult part of the job has to be the time frame I work in, because instead of being up in the morning like i'm used to instead I had to re-adjust to working from 9:30/10pm-6/6:30am. The thing I enjoy the most at Kohl's is the friendliness of the co-workers/management."
good,"I did a lot working for this company. Most of my retail experience came from working at this company. I did customer service, cash office, merchandise sets, inventory, and much more."
good,"Kohl's has good life work balance, and as a consultant there I can say that employees seemed happy in there jobs.  There are two great cafeterias, and team building events.  The company itself seems very forthcoming, and employees seem knowledgeable and informed."

good,Work everyday was amazing. I had the best co-workers who became family to me. We worked together on numerous projects and built an awesome bond. The hardest part of working for Kohl's will only creep up on you if you are lazy. It's retail! Be nice. Ask every customer if they need anything and work on that patience is a virtue thing.
good,"I enjoy working at Kohls because I get to help people and we are like a big family. The teamwork is one of the best things about the job. We all work together to accomplish what needs to be done. The management is right there to let us know how much they appreciate us and help out if that is what it takes."
good,"I worked there for just a few months but the time i hadd there was great, managers gave you plenty of space and left you to be independant but once you needed help they where right there."
good,"A typical work day at Kohl's for me will be that of course we are very busy. I am sales floor associate so they always calling me up front to help a customer find something. I check prices, run to the back and grab something for a customer. I check customers out. I work up at the customer service desk. If they need help in other department they call me to help out. I learned that you always have to put the customer first in retail. Meaning making sure your job is done. For example having the fitting rooms clean making sure nothing is on the floor. Asking them do they need help with anything but most of all completing your task. I set goals for myself on a daily. It keeps me exciting and going through out my day. I love my co workers we all get along and have a great time together. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the customer leave happy and knowing for sure that they are going to come again."
good,I have been at kohls for 3 years. yes it can be very stressful and irritating working with different personalities but I honestly wouldn't change it. I have different different things I do at work all the time so my day could turn little hectic at times. The best part of my job is making the customers satisfied and my coworkers.

Kohl's has always been very good about being flexible in balancing one's work/life schedule as well."
good,"I believe that when your a team it should matter what everyone has to say that may improve the company. Instead of dismissing them, you need to hear them out."
good,My work day has always been pretty relaxed but very busy at times. management always letting us know what should be done during the shift. I have learned that I like working with the public and how to work better with money. The people that I work with are amazing they made the job fun and a little less stressful.

good,"Kohl's is a great place to work due to flexibility in scheduling, having the opportunity to advance interpersonal communication skills, and a fun environment with great people. I am now able to appreciate the value a great customer service. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unhappy customers, but only added to my problem solving abilities.

I was a little of everything with them. Management I know them since I was working at Mervyn's they call me to go back and work with them. I didn't see anything hard with Kohl's I think I knew a little of everything already. My most enjoyable part of the job was when we would get together as a team and do volunteer. ( associate in action)."
good,I absolutely love the people I work with. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. I've learned so much here and am so thankful I had the opportunity to experience Kohl's.
good,"I enjoy talking to the customers and get what they need. I may be deaf but I can still help them to find what they need and they will leave being happy. I am a very people person. I show people that being deaf is no different and it may be challenge sometimes, but I am up for challenges."
good,Was an awesome place to work. Great management and co-workers.
good,I enjoyed working for Kohl's and learned about the behind the scenes of retail.  I worked with a great team of ladies and looked forward to going to work each day.  Management is very supportive in helping you advance in areas that interest you.  The hardest part of the job is leaving the company due to our jobs being outsourced.
good,"The job and tasks was pretty simple and quick to learn. The co-workers were really nice and helpful especially when they know someone's new at work they really help out. The nice part of this job was that when you don't have any customers there's always something else to do like emptying the hanger boxes, putting merchandizes back where they belong and checking fitting rooms for clothes left behind. The hardest part was when it gets really busy and you get an angry customer and there's no manager to help out."
good,"(1)Greet co-workers at customer service, clock-in, prepare for work and put on badge, grab and sign-out specific tools, check fitting rooms and customer service to hang and display clothes. Greet customers around the area and ask if they need assistance."
good,a typical day at work for me is to log into my register and treat my customers like I would want to be treated. have them walk away from my register happy they came to my register and I will come back to the store because she knows how to do her job. I have learned how to make the store look presentable for the day to start. my management team for my shift was always helpful. my co-workers who have worked at the store before me were helpful when I had a question about something. the hardest part of the job probably had to be not being able to help a customer with something they wanted because I didn't know the answer. the most enjoyable part of the day was when I did my job and helped a customer and they told my boss that they are glad that I had helped them and that I knew what I was doing.
good,Each persons job overlaps with another persons so that everyone was able to help each other and work towards a common goal.
good,"At Kohl's, i work in Sales and Retail everyday.  I check customers out at POS or Jewelry.  Since i have started working in April, i have open over 260 credit applications. I help customers with decision on outfits to try on or buy."
good,This is a great company to work for and I would be willing to recommend it to anybody that's working for part time work.
good,my days at kohls were always fun I had amazing co workers who I became close friends with. I learned so much from kohls learned how to do every department. management was not the best nor did he ever do much. hardest part in the job is always getting annoyed at the end about credit and sales.

good,"After interning for the last few months with Loss Prevention, this is a great company to work for if you are interested in LP. All management is very personable, and easy to contact. I have met several times with the District Manager and the Regional Manager, both love their roles with Kohl's and have nothing but good things to say about their careers. "
good,I work more on the floor as a sales associate but whenever the lines get crowed i hope on a register and help. I mostly clean out the cleaning rooms and maintain a clean sales floor. From time to time i do overnight shifts and mark down items that go clearance. My coworkers are awesome so kind and willing to help. We had an amazing manager but just recently left thats the bad part about my job because now the store isnt running so smoothly as before and i feel i am being overworked and underpaid. i do enjoy seeing my employers and helping my customers in any way shape or form
good,"Always busy, theres always work to be done. Not a lot of group work "
good,"You will immediately check emails and updates from the previous day to be on task. You support and solve solutions for the sales teams. In general, the management team all have degrees. The hardest part is learning all the names and building early respect with employees. The most enjoyable part is interacting with fellow executives, employees, and everyday customers."
good,"For the most part I really enjoyed working at Kohl's. The managment is very flexible with hours, they only require that you work at least one day during the weekend. Everyone is really nice and they do an excellent job at choosing who works for them."
good,I really enjoyed working for Kohls. They offer great benefits but the hours of retail no longer were working for my family/personal life.
good,I would make sure everything was picked up off the ground. Everything was folded the right way and was neat and perfect.
good,"I usually worked in the mornings so i would work the cashier for most of my shift. Towards the end of my shift i would restock the tables and racks and make sure the stores looks nice and presentable. I've learned while i was working to smile more often to everyone, it can really help. My managers were great, they were happy, helpful and just a great team to be apart of. My employees were nice and always smiling, they kept you up and motivated to have a great day at work. I would have to say the hardest part of my job was working 3rd shift. We had the most work, to restock the whole store for the next day. The most enjoyable part of my job would have been the holiday partys, and just the way were like a big family."
good,"Ive realized that as a part-time associate, Kohl's was one of the better jobs Id had. As a full-time associate however work has been very stressful, very time consuming with a not- so flexible schedule and although Id say its a great place to work not enough time in the day to do what you have to do."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"When I worked for Kohl's, it was a great learning experience! It was only my second job, when I made a simple mistake, everyone helped me, and was so kind about it. Working there during the holiday season was crazy, people everywhere, unbearable messes; but everyone worked together and made it through and still accomplished our daily and weekly goals. I loved working with them, I wish I could have stayed if high school didn't interfer."
good,"$9/hr in Wyoming for about two shifts a week, but up to 60% discount during Friends & Family events. Regular 15% employee discount all year round. Great work environment and very enjoyable. Not enough pay for the work though."
good,When working at Kohls as a Point of Sales Associate it is typical that you will be working with a customer most of the time. You need to be able to answer and help customers to the best of your ability. If you've never worked in a Point of Sales position before I feel that the management here at Kohls will help you prepare to answer customers questions and concerns they might have. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to talk to the customers and get their feedback about how well we've been doing or how we can improve.
good,Greeted with a smile when you walk through the door. Employees are energized and ready to help customers. Communication is not an issue because there a walkie-talkies to commute at all times.

good,Great place to work if you need to have a balanced life. Great environment and benefits! Would definitely recommend working and seeking further opportunities.
good,"A typical day at work would be clocking in, looking at the schedule to see which department you are in, and do that task. If you get a lot of credits, expect to be at the cash register, so you can meet everyone's credit goal for the week."
good,"I really enjoyed working here! The management and most coworkers are great. I had a flexible schedule and it was easy to get days off when I needed so long as I have enough notice. My main complaint is that there are a lot of rude customers, but that comes with any retail job."

Great training at corporate level for customer service associates.  Handled inbound customer and store associate concerns to assist with resolution of concerns.  Great benefits, community involvement, work-life balance. Awesome associates.  I learned to have a better relationship with all customers internal and external.  Great training to learn different skills necessary to assist customers in all phases of account issues.  Account resolutions, inquiries, application processing, order processing and follow-up.  Collection efforts for first stage late payment issues.  Policies and procedures very well defined and administered for compliance of banking and governmental regulations.  I started a process by which I helped to encourage other associates to remember the going green incentives.  I also assisted other associates with best practice ideas to improve customer contacts interactions. The autonomy permitted associates with conflict resolutions.  The trust given to associates to handle store issues in a timely and efficient manner to address any and all concerns."
good,The managers were nicer to the older ladies that worked there and the older people were rude to the younger people. I honestly felt like the job was to easy and I deserved a raise because $9 is really nothing getting paid $198 every week.
good,Kohls distribution center was a very friendly environment everyone was easy to get along with the work was easy also the managers were very nice & helping.
good,"A typical work day at kohls was very fast paced and was enjoyable based off the workplace being friendly and inviting for everyone, I learned to be considerate and respectful to everyone while providing great care for the customer. The hardest part of the job has to be the inconsistency with the scheduling, however I enjoyed working there because of the coworkers and the job I had was to my liking."
good,I was always treated well and had a good amount of freedom as long as what I was doing was productive and helped the store overall. The managers and all of my coworkers were great.

I learned to respect and understand my Managers/Leaders. I also learned that no matter  what you always make the Guest/Customer feel like they have had a Fun, Fast, and Easy shopping experience. You always help the Guest/Customer with whatever questions, comments, or concerns they may have pertaining to the store/business."
good,I like working at kohls because it gives me the option to still have free time when I get off work. Also the work her is very simple and easy and the pay is exactly what you work for.
good,I was not employed at Kohl's for a long period of because I opted to take the DSW position because of more flexible working hourly shifts. While I employed with Kohl's I did believe that it was a Good company.
good,Kohl's department store is productive and fun we have drawings goals to accomplish on store sales customer service is the key for success I also recommend for any of my friends to work for Kohl's because they have great sales and coupons to offer.
good,"The internship was a great experience. As an intern, I was given enough autonomy to learn and develop new skills on my own but I still had a safety net to fall back on. This kind of environment allowed me to be comfortable with taking risks."
good,i loved working here . i just did not make enough money. the management was great my team members were great. the customers were even better. i just wish they paid a livable wage.
good,"Great place to work!  Especially if you shop a lot because they have great discounts for their employees.  "
good,I've been able to strive in my customer service skills. Management was amazing and very friendly. There is really nothing too hard about the job. The  most enjoyable part of the job is all the friendships you make and ways you can move up.
good,"Work was a combination of helping customers, helping other departments, and taking care of your own responsibilities. Management was great and they were helpful."
good,If everyone would work together Kohls would be a wonderful working place. I don't think its fair one person to have full responsibility for a department that needs six hands and expect at least a 4 mans hand work to be done.
good,"Nice company, discounts to employees.  Would be good to have a traditional role at he company as the greeter was hired for 4 weeks and most of the shoppers comping in after week 1 and 2 were the same people who had cards or applied and it was hard to get additional applicants for daily goals"
good,I loved working at Kohl's. It was a very fun and exciting workplace. The other workers are very friendly and inviting. They were very helpful. It is a great place to work.
good,"A typical day included unloading the truck in the morning and then stocking the shelves after.

Besides that, the job was pretty easy and the coworkers were all pretty nice so overall it was a good job."
good,"Kohls was an amazing place to work, As soon as i walked through the doors I felt so welcomed and everyone helped me learn what was needed. It was a true team environment and a great first job."
good,"It wasn’t as great as I thought it would be and they made it seem. Some of the managers chose favorites. The breaks were great, on time and 10 minutes. Co-workers were normally very helpful."
good,"Greet customers and let them come to my register it was pretty easy being a cashier there."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"When working at Kohl's there would be a lot of work to do, however it wasn't hard work, but there was nonstop work. It was an enjoyable work environment because the management was superb, and the customers weren't difficult to help. I learned good communication skills as well as learning how to develop a good routine when at work. The hardest part about the job for me was memorizing where things go because memorization has always been a struggle for me. I enjoyed working here, I only left because I left the state for school."
good,Working at Kohl's was a great experience as a  cashier the hardest part of the job was putting things into the correct places when customers did not want to purchase their things. The management team was really good. The most important thing about was meeting new people and experiencing new job skills and getting the feel of a job.
good,Kohl's is a great place to work if you like being in a team environment. Not a day goes by that we don't work our cross functional teams and internal teams. There is a great work life balance as well.
good,A typical day included waiting on the trucks to get in unloading them and putting the items in the corresponding boxes or racks. After they were completely unloaded we put the items in the back room or out on the floor depending on where they were supposed to go. On days that I worked when we didn't have trucks I was out on the floor putting away stock. There was only one time I had to bag things for a cashier. Management from I remember was good. The workplace was relaxing. The hardest part was lifting the heavier items on higher up shelves because I'm short. I actually enjoyed putting out stock.

The only downside to working there is the days when it's horribly understaffed and busy, and dealing with customers who really don't care that you've spent your entire shift cleaning your department.

We had a lot company meetings. We also had several committees to join that allowed you to be heard and personally change how certain things operate.I ,myself was in the safety committee. We had an awesome team dynamic. We were always willing to help someone that had fallen behind. Management was exceptional they would address things directly and in a timely manner. Any and all complaints were addressed in private and would be worked out before end of the week if not the end of shift."

Management can count on me to cover their breaks. That makes me feel good. I'm always willing to help others. That includes associates and customers. I love it when we are busy.

The managers would come assist if anyone needed help. Overall i believe it was a good job an helped me with my communication skills.
good,"This was a high intense job that kept me on my feet the whole time. I learned a lot about customer service. We were always told to say hi to everyone we met and assist them in their needs. As an MJM I was responsible for making sure the dressing rooms were clean and the clothes were put back on the racks. We also performed recovery at night were we made sure all of the racks and aisles were clean and ready for the next day. I loved working with the other employees to accomplish our tasks at night.

good,"A typical day of work at Kohl's was overall very enjoyable. There was a lot of work required of me but it was not strenuous. The people that I worked with were fun and upbeat. There was never a dull moment. The management I believe is similar to most places, there are some people that you like better than others. I never had any problems with any of them. The hardest part of the job was the very early mornings or in an overnight shift, 4-6 a.m. Staying functional was at times difficult, but my co workers made those hours bearable.

good,"A typical day for me is getting to work on time. Saying Good Morning to everyone on my team and starting my first call off with a smile. I have learned that when you show human feelings that are genuine it's not a job anymore, but a connection with your cardmember when collecting money from them. My co-workers are extremely friendly and quick to help you out if you have and problems. The hardest part about the job is getting off of the phone and having doubts on how could I have helped this cardmember reserve their account. The most enjoyable is waking up wanting to help resolve an issue and learn about a new issue that a cardmember has."
good,"A typical day at work for me is to clean and maintain a given department, such as men's, junior's, or misses, sometimes more than one at a time. My responsibilities include clearing the fitting rooms, running go backs, maintaining the go backs at customer service, answering department and register calls, helping customers, backing up at the registers, fixing signs, replenishment if necessary, and recovery of the entire department. The management team is great and very understanding, so completing my tasks is something I do with pleasure. It can be stressful at times, but the fast pace is what I love about my job and being on my feet keeps things interesting. The most enjoyable part of my job is when a customer tells me how helpful I have been and they leave the store happier than when they arrived. I love working customer service."
good,Work with money. greet customers as the walk into the store. Help costumers around the store. Keep store clean.

I learned how to manage my time with customers in line waiting to be checked out wondering how long it will be, I have become very face paced being extremely accurate. I have impressed almost all my customers by being told first hand being offered jobs at their company just from the few minutes they have met me at the cash register. My co-workers look up to me and ask me how to do things and that makes me feel amazing knowing I am the person they come to for help. My superiors have full faith in me and are extremely confident in my work to leave important responsibilities to me without a doubt. Most enjoyable part of my job is meeting my customers leaving them in high satisfaction in a laughing conversation. I can honestly say that there is nothing hard on me at work because I have been trained to great knowledge and work with friendly peers."

good,I loved going to work and put out items in the right spot and helping all customers that needed help finding there items they were looking for. The holidays were pretty busy but i loved it i didnt take a break because there was so many people asking bout items so i felt the need to not take a break and get as much done as i could and i felt good about it. I learned alot working at kohls and maybe get back on there one day!

It can really help when turning around a situation and making sure the customer knows you will do everything possible to make sure there satisfied."
good,"Being at POS, I had to maintain the appearance of the entrance to the store and the registers.  I would vacuum the entry way upon opening and organize shelves near the registers.  Throughout the day, I would help customers with any questions and take care of their transactions as well as solicit credit and email."
good,"Overnight shift is no joke, the hardest part is being unable to leave until end of your shift. A lot of your time is spent organizing freight and shelves so you must be quick on your feet to get things done."
good,"Overall it is a great place to work, everyone I worked with was like a huge family. Great people ,good costumers. It does get busy a lot of the time you just have to make sure you don't forget about the costumers and make sure they have been helped and always smiling and saying hi."

The best part would be on closing nights & i had my fitting rooms cleaned up & the floor recovered."

good,Working at Kohl's was a good experience. I learned a lot about the functions of being a store manager. I had to perform the MOD duties most of the time when we did'nt have a truck. The people that i worked with were nice and helpful.The hardest part of my job was that the hours i had to work changed on an almost daily bases. The people that i worked with were the best part of the job.
good,Typically go above and beyond for our costumers and then a little more beyond. The associates make the day go by smoothly. Management is accommodating if it's not the holidays.
good,"a typical day at work is, I would clock into work and every morning before getting started we would have a little meeting to get instructions on what to do, usually i would be the leader, we would unload the truck and put out new merchandise. From working at Kohls I have learned so much, merchandising, doing sets, visual, answering phones, helping customers, leading a team, being all that i can be. the hardest part about my job would be when i worked over nights we would have to scan everything in the store in two nights for markdowns and make numbers. I enjoyed this job because we were like a huge family everyone got along and if there was ever a problem we always could talk it out, no tension."

If I wanted to focus on one aspect of the department over another I had to the freedom to so. The staff was made up of some cool individuals at both of the locations I worked at. And overall, I would say the most enjoyable part of the job was the customer engagement. Especially at the Kohl's in Ann Arbor, I met all sorts of interesting characters while in at work."

good,They are very family orientated and employees are always first! Management always keeps the employees in the loop about what id going on in the company. Hands down the best place I ever worked!
good,"A typical day consists of meeting with associates and pushing engagement. Most of the day you are walking the floor or watching cameras. You also will walk the floor and review product protection. You will be responsible for assisting with inventories and making sure everything is accounted for and reviewing discrepancies. Loss prevention management is amazing, however store management really depends on the store manager. Loss prevention exists only to catch shoplifters and really do not have a hand in operational processes. Which I believe leads to problems with inventory."
good,Fun energetic and productive workplace . Managers are nice and friendly which provided a pleasant atmosphere for employees and customers. Great benefits and in store discounts for employees. The ability to progress is very easy with the right attitude and motivation.
good,"very fast paced work environment. multitasking is a very big part of the job. the type of job, if in supervisor position, associates can be very difficult to deal with. very challenging experience, but learned a lot."
good,"Either fast-paced or moderately slow, the store would fill with customers. With CBTs and about a half-hour of hands-on training, I wasn't too confident with what I was doing about half of the time. The management was great, though it usually was repetitive to be reminded of the goal of getting two credits. It can be a little tricky to not say the c-word but to make a charge card sound quite enticing. The workplace culture was helpful and encouraging. Some associates were welcoming, while others appeared not to be. The hardest part of the job is working behind the register immediately after ten minutes or so, of hands-on training. The most enjoyable part of the job were the rare, few customers who'd either ask for your name or even make small chat."
good,This was a great entry level job that provided experiences in sales and customer service. Good management team and training provided. It gets extremely busy during the holiday season.
good,.The hardest part of this job was it was my first property opening. I found out  later that these openings never go smoothly. The maintenance manager left three days after I arrived and I was promoted to his position. The management was fair and exuberant. The culture was fast paced but everyone jumped on board when a problem arose. I really enjoyed interfacing with the associates along with my great team of technicians. Opening three Kohls distribution centers definitely taught me a lot about the dos and don'ts. It also taught me how to develop and maintain budgets.
good,I enjoyed kohls. Very cool laid back environment. Great people great work place it was very huhe & clean wish i could've been there a little longer! Their very organized business.
good,Truly enjoyed my time working with this company. Though it's always busy the job wasn't stressful. Management was very good and understanding. Overall great work experience.
good,"The management team is very considerate of their employees, and are very hardworking. They are also very flexible with scheduling and work with employees to ensure that the scheduling that is most beneficial to them is provided."
good,I like working at my Kohl's . I don't like the customers ! But overall working has it up and down I guess. Still fun place if you working with the right people
good,"Schedule is based on call volume. Lots of overtime before Christmas."
good,"Great work environment, great leadership. The only issue I had is that work is only available during retail busy season, aka holidays."
good,you typically work in your assigned area unless the store is very busy. you make sure that the fitting rooms are clear and clothes are put up in there original spots
good,Actually I working for part time and feels not enough to earn money better. I've been patience and going to work on time but rare for late because transportation in San Francisco.
good,"Very professional and fast paced, especially in the seasonal times. Co workers were very nice and worked well with me. They really appreciated my schedule and were flexible. Hardest part of the job was most likely when you had nothing to do and the most enjoyable was probably during the rushes when you were constantly helping people; the time went by faster and you felt very energized afterwards."
good,"A typical day for me would of been me coming in and mainly working on the register. Ringing people up and giving them the best customer service. I learned how to use a register for my first time and speaking skills. My mangers were hardworking and motivated people, same goes for my co-workers, They were such very nice people and always helped when I needed assistance. Hardest part of my job was dealing with many racist customers! The most enjoyable part of the job is working under such a great management and always being in a clean work station."
good,"There were so many managers it seemed a bit unorganized trying to get assistance with customers, other wise it was great and it helped me with customer service which is in almost every job."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work at. They offer plenty of benefits for associates to utilize, great discount offers for associates as well. It is very easy to excel in the company if you're looking to grow. The co-workers are fun and every acts as one big family. The hardest part of the job is having a very flexible availability, you don't always get the Holidays off, sometimes the job requires over-time but that's what comes with working retail. Other than that it's a great work place."
good,"Another drama filled work place, but the professionalism out shines it. Its a comfortable place to work with flexible hours."
good,"A typical day at work looks like greeting my co-workers with a smile. As I walk to the shoe department, I say ""Hello"" to customers and any co-workers I may see. Managers always check up on the employees to see how the night is going, and if we need any additional help. Having a job in retail is really fun, but hard at the same time. If an angry or upset customer comes up to me, it's hard to stay calm and collective sometimes. I've learned that body language and facial expressions is a big deal when working in retail. The hardest part about my job is not letting those faces appear when a situation like that happens. I love the people I work with. They make my job fun. It's nice to have such a nice Kohl's family."
good,"Great Company to work for."
good,I greeted customers and helped them with there purchases. I worked well with others. I learned a new Point of Sale system. The hardest part of the job was selling Kohl's charge cards and the best was making customers happy.
good,Nice place as a first job or trying to begin a retail career. management is a little shaky at times and so are your hours. Lately its been good. But i love my job here and you get great discounts and get to see all of the items in the store first at times.
good,The people and management team really made my experience here fun. Everyday was something new and to be surrounded by people who truly care about you is something very special. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people and creating the best experience for the customer. The hardest part of the job was there was always so much to do in such a short time; some people might like that though.
good,This was a great experience. The work atmosphere their was great.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job at Kohls was that I truly believe in what Kohl's stands for and that the product(s) they sell are quality at a great price! I was proud to work for a company that has become a household name!
good,"Seasonal job, Learned how to fold clothes take care of customers questions. The most enjoyable part was it was a steady -paced  job, the employees were nice."
good,"The management is very open to creative suggestions, happy to hear any of your problems and its fairly easy to get time off if you request it."
good,I enjoy working for Khol's. It is a great company and has taught me a lot. Warm and comfortable environment. The other workers there are driven and good at what they do. Hardest part would be the hours (working overnight) but the most enjoyable parts of the job would be always doing something new and moving at a fast pace.
good,"I liked working there, the only bad thing was it was seasonal."
good,"Great place to work"
good,great funny comfortable place to work great mangments worl with on your hours just like one big family
good,"Working for Kohl's E-Commerce I would move about the warehouse and accomplish a diverse amount of task, from packing, to shipping, and even picking the orders to be packed/shipped. I learned how to be flexible and focused. My Co-Workers were pretty great they new how to be social but focused on work. The hardest part of the job was being on your feet on concrete for about 12hr shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interesting ways people would try to stay positive and focused."
good,Overall a very good cultured company. Great people and values. 
good,"Walking in through the doors every morning put a smile on my face. It was nice to work with people my age, doing something I liked to do. Being a cashier meant that i got to talk to people all day. I liked the fact that I was not only able to meet new people but I was also the first person seen to ask questions which really helped me develop my customer service skills. I loved the managers I worked with because they were always there no matter what we as a team needed. "
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"everyday stay at your point of sale registers,help the cashiers if they need help.I learned lot of customer services there! management was very good!Coworkers were good! Hardest part of the job was to handle difficult customers and solve their problems so that they go home happy and want to come back again! enjoyable part was again the customers!"
good,"I loved working for Kohl's. It's was a great learning experience and I enjoy the fast pace setting they have at Kohl's. I never saw a customer leave unhappy about their shopping experience and that made me happy. It was always busy but not enough where people didn't get the help they needed. The management was cool and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was remembering the new places the clothes were moved to, it seem like they were in a new spot everyday."
good,"As an overnight worker we were the jack of all trades. Our shift would start at 10 PM and end at 6 AM the following morning. Once you clocked in you be prepared to work. We would pick up the pieces of the day shifts. Though a typical night would involve the cornerstone of overnight at Kohl's, unloading that night's truck. We would unload all the merchandise. It would take roughly 3.5-4 hours to complete. One person would unload one person would cut boxes open coming off the truck and all the others would organize the merchandise coming off the truck. It was a busy night. With little downtime. We would then process all of the merchandise and unpackage what needed o be unpackaged You needed to work as quickly as possible. It honed a good work ethic if you did not already have one coming in. The management there were reminiscent of an NCO in the Army. They kept us motivated but never let up for a second. The co workers nonetheless had a good time and were easy going even with the fast and sometimes stressful under the gun atmosphere. By far the hardest part of the job were the hours. Overnight requires a lot of understanding from family and friends. You could not have a busy social life while working overnight at all. I learned a lot about working with other people and as a team. Working at Kohl's helped hone my work ethic and foster a better one. The friendships and bonds that are forged at two and three AM in the morning can be duplicated only in a few other environments."
good,"I have only been working there for a short while(2 months), and am aware that the experiences I have had at the Rochester Hills may not be the same experiences as those other people might have in other stores, but the people are friendly, the work is at a good pace, and the break room is clean. Every week or so there is food like pizza or drinks like soda available."
good,"Always concentrated on customer service, making sure all customers were taking care of and happy. Co-workers were always easy to work with and helped me out any time I needed it. Most management was easy to talk to and get along with, very helpful at times. The hardest part of the job was trying to satisfy unhappy customers, if they were upset over a specific product. Which they can not control how a product is made or put together. We try to make the customers happy, so when they leave the store we know they will come back. The most enjoyable part of working there was learning new information that I did know before, and meeting new friends and people."
good,"A typical day at work would be managing all six fitting rooms, helping out on the registers, the customer is always number one, and managing the juniors department. The management team works very well together, they have good communication, and have a very good work life balance with scheduling. My co workers are very efficient, take direction well, and work well with each other. The hardest part of the job is putting the new clothes out and making it all flow and keeping your area clean while helping customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is they people I work with and satisfying the customer."
good,If you are looking for a good part time job Kohl's is a good place to work.
good,"A day working at kohls is different every day you never know what will happen, i learned many things daily like how to work a register or where to put certain thing at when putting out stock, my mangers and co-workers are they best they are willing to go that extra mile o help others when needed"
good,"Managers  work with you, beside you and they care. Managers don't get into personal business but if there is a crisis or an emergency there support is there. Most of the employees that work there has been there 15+ years and will train you properly."
good,I just started working here. I can relate to my previous experience to this job. I like the environment and seniors behavior. They are very helpful and cooperative.
good,"Kohl’s provides me a good career I learned a lot about the warehousing careers gave me the opportunity to grow as a team member as well as individualy as a person and helped me gain a lot more knowledge and experience in my warehouse career. I think after working there you should at least know the basics of warehousing, fast paste environment. Working at kohls I learned how to become a great team member and reliable employee"
good,"Kohls was a very good place and I loved it but, it wasn't really for me. I love clothing but, I could never satisfy customers because it was very stressful to work there."
good,"Work well with your personal schedule, good co-workers, Training was quite slim but it was easy enough to learn how to do the job assigned by yourself."
good,"Helped open the store and it was excitingI've never seen what went into getting a store set up.  Learning the different department and I ended up at Customer Service.  I sometimes helped out and cashier also unloads the truck and putting merchandise on the floor.  I worked the floor and the dressing rooms and sometimes did inventory.  While in customer service I did exchanges, marked the items down for the floor. Counted the draws down and they had to have a certain in all three drawers.  The main draw I gave change to the cashiers up front."
good,"It is a really good place to work, you can do many different activities about your work. And the people here are very friendly. I think it's a good place to work and I recommend that it continue like this."
good,I liked working at kohls my day would go by really quickly and i was always on my feet so I wouldn't really get time to look at the time. I enjoyed getting discounts on cute clothes they had there. The only thing that sucked was that you couldn't get discounts on name brand clothes
good,Productive workplace everyone is really easy go get alone with. Good managers that help you with everything you need. Easy to get stuff done in a timely matter
good,Everyone is friendly and helpful. I stay busy everyday and always have something to do. I can get everything I need done quickly and still have time to organize.
good,Working as a packer things can get a little competitive. We'd have to keep up rates on how fast we packed boxes. It was definitely high paced but I enjoyed it.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I loved to work in big business you can grow and move up to the next level within months working for kohls.My attitude toward the company just made me better dealing with the outside world.
good,"management was great, very professional. Very sales driven. I learned about patience. A typical day is very fast paced, always have to be alert at all times. The hardest part would probably the go backs at the end of the night but its retail, can""t expect nothing else. The most enjoyable part would be the experience."
good,"Great place to work."
good,"The environment was amazing , job was organized also good paying I only worked here seasonal but I would love to work here again ! The job was perfect for me with in my Schedule of raising 3 children as well ."
good,"It a nice place to work and your co-workers are friendly and helpful, your gonna do a lot of overtime when their is a sale but everyone help each other so it will be OK."
good,"My typical day at work I would have to see  what department they have put me in and see if I was an additional cashier, working at Kohl's I learned a lot with the time of being there such as how to managed my time and how to get things done with the time being there and helping out other team mates when they need help with there department.Management was very understanding and helpful with any situation that you need help if its with a customer or you don't know how to do it  they are welling to teach you how to do a lot of things and i know for such they would make sure they you are good with everything  that you are doing. It really wasn't no hardest part  at the job it was very simple, but the most enjoyable part if the job is getting done early and making sure everything stays the way it is for the time being."
good,The environment at Kohl's was always pretty positive which made my overall experience enjoyable. The managers all were so kind and always worked with my schedule and needs.
good,"Loved it was one of my first major jobs and it was an awesome place for me to work I loved the co workers and, the store was nice and clean it was overall just an amazing place to work."
good,I really enjoyed this job. The people where amazing and the pay was great. A typical day at work was okay. The job was easy and everyone was nice.
good,I love working at Kohl's I love helping customers I love checking customers out anywhere that I could help them I love helping them when they couldn't find anything
good,"Great place to work I'm only looking to work elsewhere for advancement within the workforce. At Kohl's the management is very understanding when life happens. They provide flexible scheduling to meet your daily life. If you're looking to work full time I don't think this will be a place for you. Great place to apply for those looking for their first job, a second job, retired, or just some extra pocket change. I'm sad to leave and work elsewhere, but I have to make a living. I really hope to remain employed by Kohl's even after starting a new job. I will miss everyone I work with."
good,"Worked here for a year, enjoyed every minute of it. The managers work with you on schedules and provide th most understanding feedback as possible."
good,The environment is healthy and positive and a fun place to be. The customers are happy and the conversations a enjoyable I would definitely work here again.
good,I loved how everyone was friendly to each other and that it felt like a family. When i needed clothes for winter the employee discount helped purchasing clothes when i was short on money.
good,"This is my second job I have ever had, and I really enjoy the atmosphere. Everyone is so kind and the management happens to be very supportive."
good,good job like helping people the jog was fun.the job was enjoyable
good,"A typical day of work well i was seasonal and i was only called in to work twice but a typical day for me would include being trained with someone in my position they would just show me the basics then I would fold the clothing to make the displays look more presentable. whenever we were short on registers i would stop folding and putting away clothing to work the register also, if a costumer needed help i would stop what i was doing and help the costumer with whatever he or she needed. my coworkers were a blast to be around there was never a dull moment everyone got along great. The most enjoyable part was working the register and associating with costumers."
good,Loved working at Kohl's. Great Benefits and tons of opportunities to move up. The staff was like a big family. Management works very hard and always makes sure to show their associates appreciation and gratitude. The only downside is that after the holidays hours are typically cut down quite drastically.
good,"My co workers and I were all on the same page as to what the job entitled. We all worked for the same common goal, cleaning our departments, helping customers and creating a fun and safe environment for us and customers."
good,The Kohls Corporation is great place to work. There is a great working relationship between the managers and the associates.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"When working at Kohl's, I loved every moment of it. The management was friendly, easy going, understanding, and there was much room for job advancement."
good,This being my first job it was nice to work with people who were nice and ready to help you out with any questions that you had. I worked at the cash register and would ring customers out and would help them with their coupons.
good,"Excellent customer service"
good,"I really had so much respect for my managers, as a new employee everyone made me feel welcomed."
good,Felt like they didn’t care about employees. Constantly messed up schedules and we had to fix it ourselves by finding someone to take shifts that we were approved to have off.
good,"The managers main focus is Credit. Credit credit credit talk it up!! The store is always a mess, recovery should be held a priority over anything else which it tends to be the last it makes pulls(replenishment, and new freight stocking horribly difficult as well as ship to store) you’re always rushed to get everything done so people half a** the job which makes everything a mess. It’s suppose to be a team environment but it’s dog eat dog from Managers to front line employees. Too many clicks and favorites.."
good,Loved working here. Just not enough hours and it  was busy workplace. People there i work with was awesome and i would go back to work at a kohl's if their was one here that's how much i loved working there just not enough pay Management was great. i did learn fitting room there and love talking to customers
good,"Its a fun place to work, your co workers are great. You get an employee discount, You have goals too reach"
good,My favorite manager left after I did.The main manager was rude to me and made me feel I didn’t belong . When she updated my schedule she did not put it on line and it messed me up . They didn’t want me coming in the store to check my schedule but they never wanted to polka’d the online schedule
good,Dont work there for a while so I cant say so what ever you want me t say I cant . New management there and I haven't worked there in about 6 years and this is pointless
good,The management were lazy and always had snarky remarks. The store manager was the only one that was very proactive and friendly. Departments would be a mess at the end of shifts and they would pin it on one person. Security lacked sureness they watched the employees more than the store. I honestly wouldn't never work at this kohls again.
good,"Odd combination of unnecessary competition and unnecessary ""pep talks."" We were constantly told to do better, but rarely encouraged. Not a good place to be if you are too emotionally invested in doing a good job."
good,"when I worked for this company I never made it over 7.54 an hour after working with them for 5 years, I made one advancement for 1 year and then moved and relocated and the extra money I was given was taken away because that position was not available at my new store. I learned everything I could do in the store and yet never advanced even after being interviewed for positions. seniority had always taken over and even though I had a perfect interview like I was told I never advanced yet still did the duties for those positions."
good,"Kohl's is a great store to shop, but not to work at as seasonal help on the holidays. When I was hired in I had at least 4 days a week after about a week and the store continually hiring I was knocked to 1 day a week...... not good I quickly said good bye.... lesson learned."
good,just don't get enough hours don't get paid but 7.50 hour looking for something  better
good,Bad management. The most racist and discriminating place to work. The managers never take responsibility for their actions and their lying game is 100% they lie with  no conviction
good,"If it was a truck day we usually get there prepare everything all the equipment that we need, then just start opening boxes and putting the items where they belong until we finish unloading the hole truck it depends on how many people are there that's how long it will take to finish unloading. No truck day consist on getting there getting my equipment to check how many orders I have, pick them up then pack them and send them after that is done I check what needs to get done like back stock or pulling items we need in the floor. Time went by fast with all the time always keep me busy for sure."
good,"Typical day of work was spent merchandising. 'the most enjoyable part of the job was ymy coworkers It was not the best job I ever had. There was a lot of preferential treatment of some employees, they got the best schedules. One associate who was a department supervisor did not have to work weekends for the first year she had the position. My schedule made it very difficult to take care of personal business. There was no time before my shift or after to even make calls to doctors and other professionals. I was not allowed to have a phone while I was on the clock."
good,They make you watch videos on how to treat eachother but all anyone does is fight and argue. They will cut your hours if you don’t make enough credit. And that’s all they care about. Unless you like working 3 hours a week
good,I was a sales associate working in the Home/Kids Dept. I loved working there & loved my immediate supervisors. My co workers were wonderful. I loved helping the customers! 
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Poor pay, underpaid and overworked. Even full time associates don't get 40 hours, poor benefits, bad catering if associates are lucky to be catered to, management is below satisfaction, upper management overlooks associate concerns, no respect or acknowledgment given to hardworking employees, unsanitary work environment, clothes are treated poorly (sometimes even defecated on) by customers, theft problem is taking a dent from our payroll, no strict regulations in the dressing rooms (causes theft problems) corporate office would rather terminate employees with problems then hear them out.a poor discount with no rewards concerning hardworking employees. Overall, a terrible place to work."
good,"I worked for Kohl's seasonal, FIRST JOB BTW, and cashiers trained me ONCE and was given so much attitude by the top cashiers for not understanding fast. Oh, then I was switched to do Kiosk, and when i asked the supervisor to be trained, he told me to figure it out on my own. Last thing, I got threatened to get fired by a cashier supervisor, only wanting to use my associate discount %"
good,This job is fun at times but most of the time the managers are mean. Con is dealing with rude customers and having customers treat you like dirt and sometimes the managers do it as well
good,"I was trained in many department's,  Shoe's, home store, Ad set, Cashier, Men's, Junior's, and Misses, Set freight, Softlines, Some what trained for customer service."
good,"Cashier"
good,"its good for me just to have it as a seasonal job, worked around my full time job and hockey scheduling. The shift managers were all very different and never wanted to do their own work, they had other people do it for them while they sat at the counter and talked with employees their whole shift or just sat back in the office."
good,I learned how to fold a shirt properly i never knew there were proper ways to fold a shirt.. interesting! Employers were very respectful. Customers enjoyed shopping in such a peaceful environment.
good,"Greeting and conducting transactions base on the limit and approving checks for deposit based on"
good,"Can be a great environment, continuously improving operations and customer driven culture."
good,"during Christmas, everything was hectic, was hired for the early morning stocking, due to my school schedule, but was put on the floor without being asked that was what I wanted."
good,Perfect job for first time job seekers thare between the ages of 19-24.... very quiet and slow pace until black friday and christmas....That's All I have to say.
good,I worked MJM so the job was pretty relaxed during the weekdays constantly pushing product back onto the floor & helping out on the cash wrap when needed.
good,"Loved interaction with customers. Company was well organized and I enjoyed my time there. Associates were great loved working with them."
good,"I never worked with anyone who wasn't willing to help so it was a nice environment to work in. I only worked seasonal which meant my training was short and so was everything else but because of how helpful everyone was, my experience at Kohl's was rather wonderful."
good,"The store is kept clean an neat. Co-workers are for the most part friendly an will to help, if needed. Managers let you do your job without standing over you. Like the independence you are given as a worker."
good,"Long shifts (10-12hours) with only 2 very fast breaks. Always either too cold or too hott, not very reliable if your looking for a stable job."
good,"My typical day at Kohl's was going in, going to my department to see if the fitting rooms looked okay, and if they were I would go look to see how the floors looked, or go fold clothes that were out of place. I would also clean up the fitting room, ask how the customers were, and see if they needed help."
good,Very welcoming and friendly company to be apart of. Very big in growing and new challenges and experiences. Job is very chill self explanatory with great help from others employees around.
good,Need to be Professional not in my private  Business just more caring about my needs and my metal Status not always Torment of my mind trying to get me to give up my face and go to leave
good,fun place. The kohls cash just makes you keep going back for more. They will give you a pay advance which can be very helpful if you're in a bind.  Overall pleasant experience.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Any type of retail isn't my type of job. I admire Kohl's for hiring me without any diploma or degree. When they put me on the ad-set team   on the overnight shift, I grow to love my job. I became very good at the ad-set that my supervisor even remarked on how I get done so fast, and when I wasn't scheduled one day he covered my department. The next day I went into work, and he told me he did my department, and I had all the signs right. For some reason I never get a chance to move up. As my store were starting to lose the male managers and gain the female managers I never got recognized for what I do. My co-workers recognize my work, but the managers don't.  The ad-set moved to the day shift and one of the managers took me off the ad-set team and scheduled me to clean up a department without consulting me if I wanted to keep my position with the ad-set team, but change my shift to mornings. Now that they have me as a sales associate, I never know what department I'm in until I see a manager. I'm never in the same department every day I work. I feel like a substitute for someone who is not scheduled or called out. I have to say I did make a lot of great friends at Kohl's which a few became my best friend, and using the Kohl's Charge gave me such good credit with a score of 754. That's the only charge card I own, and Kohl's alone gave me a high score. I knew I had no credit, and I didn't think that a retail store would affect your credit history until I went onto Credit Karma and all the other credit collection sites."
good,Kohls overall is a great place to work. very customer service oriented and I love it. They truly care about the customer and the satisfaction of their visit
good,"Enjoyed working in this position, although there is little room for advancement. I was part of the truck team, as well as worked at customer service and on the sales floor. The most enjoyable part of the job was was working with the rest of the team."
good,"Enjoyed working here, unfortunately was laid off due to lack of work."
good,A typical day is checking out people at the register. My co-workers were very fun to work with also.
good,it was fun but I was tring to get a position after.they didn't hire any one like they say they would. I got 2 differant answers from management. there is no communcation.
good,"Stores great. Management not so much. Management is ran by favor, and unfortunately the reality is not everyone has the same positive mindset, and it makes harder when management makes that known. 2017 talking... Hope it’s changed since then :)"
good,"I really enjoy working for this company, fun, fast paced and lots of interaction with customers.  Once you apply yourself great place to advance to different levels"
good,Management plays favorites and they suck. Management runs all the good employees out of the store. The slow ones are left to stay. Place is a dump. Tragic
good,Good place to work but manager told me I had a job and that next day told me I was only hired as seasonal. I was disappointed and I’m unsure if that manager remains at Kohls.
good,I worked as a shoe sales man helped stocked or fold clothes and clean  and find shoe sizes and sold a few things. didn't get to do that much I even asked for more hours and they said no.
good,The store manager is a very sincere person. He realizes there are things in life that may occur and he does his best to work with you around those occurrences to give you a fair schedule. They appear to hire within on some of the levels of the store.  I enjoy merchandising and improving the look of the departments.  Most of the associates at Kohl's appear to get along.
good,"Kohls is a great place to work."
good,The employees are very helpful if you are new. I had no problems here. This place does a good job at working with customers. Holidays are the busiest times here so if you are considering on applying at that time then you will definitely get in your hours.
good,"I was a cashier at Kohl's for the Christmas season, this lasted from October to January. I was always on time for my shift, which usually started in the morning. There was not a lot downtime during this season, but if there was we had to organize our station, organize the clothes in the nearest department, or bring back any unwanted items to the stock room. Kohl's often gave out discounts and coupons to the work staff and their valuable costumers. Also, the cashiers had to offer a Kohl's credit card to any customer who did not have one, whether they were accepted or not, the customers were allowed a discount. The workplace culture was very diverse. Every staff member was kind to the newer staff. The hardest part of the job was trying to work at a fast pace so the costumes wouldn't get upset with the long wait."
good,"I loved Kohls, I worked there for many years. I loved showing up to work everyday, and seeing all the happy people. It never bothered me if I had to stay late, or come in for extra shifts. I was heartbroken when I moved and there were no kohls job offers close."
good,Kohls really cared about our well being. We had continuous meetings on safety and being aware of our surroundings.  Safety was extremely important to kohls and I admire and  appreciate that.
good,"was very happy with position and schedule flexibility.  I enjoyed working with other employees and assisting holiday shoppers."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Everybody would help each other. Having to keep workplace clean when down time. Walking sections of stores to make sure aisles are clean and neat. The latest i've worked was to 2 am.
good,"It was okay. I enjoyed my job when I worked the employees that are nice to you and that are willing to help. I left because I was starting college, I have am attending school and I have tried to get back on with Kohls but no luck."
good,kohl's is a fun place to work except the managers are always breathing down your back making sure everything is done right. Sweet people though. An its a pretty cool place to shop.
good,"this was a temporary material handling position. I would have liked to continue employment, but s seasonal position is all they offered."
good,Delivering customer service and have immediate satisfaction for my effort.  Enjoy technical interaction as a cashier and cash office processor
good,"In my employment at this distribution center I have learned many new observation skills an  other useful techniques such as packaging and handling of materials , and obtaining better communication skills"
good,"Every morning when I came in I would check to see how many orders came in from ship from store. I would then proceed to fill any orders that were in back stock, and ship those orders out. If all the orders were shipped out I would pull and stock any items not on sale floor. At 10 am another employee would come in to help complete anything I needed done. I learned a lot working at kohl's. How to manage different types of people with out over or under managing them. I also learned that you will not get along wit hall of your managers or co-workers, yet it is still important to how respect for them. I was lucky enough to work with people who i truly cared about as a worker, and a friend."
good,"Shift started at 10pm punch in get my assignment, I learned how to be a leader, how the receiving department works, management was a bunch of people who had no clue, co-workers were fine some worked as hard as me others did not have work ethic enough to care, hardest part of the job was accepting when the shipping sorter was out of order to do other jobs in the building without proper training, most enjoyable was looking at the shipping numbers and leaving the day satisfied with the results"
good,"I loved working for Kohl's, good people fun work environment and the customers came to shop with an great experience and theres all ways away to make some type of money by getting more hours, learning each section of the store."
good,"Working at Kohls can be a great job just not a career in the department store. A typical day at work as cashier  is only part time if its busy then you will stand in the same place up to 8 hours with short breaks between. I like my customers and getting to know new people often. Some of the managers are friendly and easy to talk to others aren't often they don't have a clue of what's going on. The people I work with were great hardworking individuals. The hardest part about my job is actually the funnest part, its when its the holidays, fast paced lots of customers and makes your day feel quick even if its long. But having great customer service skills comes easy to me, and working with customers nonstop, its my job to provide the service that I do to each and every customer, I am good at what I do and I do it well."
good,Fun and easy going people never to slow always busy. Supervisors were not so bad and the hardest part of my job was fitting rooms .
good,"Love working at Kohls, but when they cut your hours it makes you want to look elsewhere for a job that you can at least expect a good amount of hours for part time."
good,"Great place to work and meet people."
good,"The company is great, I have just moved on in my life and need bigger better things"
good,*Fun helping the customers
good,Kolh's as a whole company is an exceptional retailer. There policies are second to none. I experienced adversities which was handled smoothly by cooporate. The staff with the exception of a few might benefit from sensitivity and personnel trainning. I still consider most of them my family.
good,I was only a seasonal employee and was unable to finish out the season. There is a lot of walking and heavy lifting depending on the section your in but overall it would make a good living for the region. You just needed to be able to keep up an be able to make your quota to be eligible to be brought on full time permanent. If I had not had to leave the state because of not having a permanent residence I think I would have still been there.
good,Management is rude no matter how hard you work it’s not hard enough they are in fair when it comes to pay they hire new people in more than what people already work there make. The job is easy and fun relaxed I liked it but management needs to get their stuff together as well as the pay you can make more at target that’s where most people go anyway
good,Good to get retail Experience. Flexible schedule. Nice environment. Very professional. I like that they value our work and have respect for the employee's.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,It's a part time job and has it's benefits. Can be stressful at time. Customers can leave the store a mess and we need to clean up after them and can be frustrating. We say that everyone should work in retail for a month and maybe they'd take better care of what they try on and help us out.
good,This a great place to work. Find what you are good at and apply it in the warehouse  job gift wrap was mine so that is where I started. Then i learned more task from there.
good,"Kohls is a great place to work but very hard if you need alot of hours."
good,Typical cashier and customer service job nothing out of the ordinary. Decent environment in the work place. Good job for students. Would recommend to others.
good,"I eould love to eork for this company again. I eished that they offer the same benefits for part time associates as well..especially for expecting mothers. Offere paid time off for expecting mothers or leave of absence with pay etc. Better health, dental, eye etc benefits for part time associates."
good,"Kohl's is the best place for work. Teams are nice.sincerely the schedule is flexible, teamwork, friendly, fast-paced learning news things challenging and with opportunity for carer advancement."
good,"•	Loading and unloading of the trucks"
good,Overall I feel it us a fun job but not a job to pay for a living unless you are in upper management or higher. It is more a temporary job until you find another.
good,"It is a great place to work, the people I work with are great. The customers are nice. The benefits are helpful. Flexible scheduling and hours. The managers are nice."
good,A typical day would be just heading to the cashier. I learned good customer skills. Management was rude and didn't care. The hardest part was trying to get hours. The most enjoyable part was my co-workers.
good,"I enjoyed working at Kohl's. I felt like my work was contributing to the overall quality there. Normally, I worked upstairs in the storage area. I would pull items that needed to get put back out on the sales floor. I enjoyed doing this work. Unfortunately, management asked me if I could ""help them out"" and work in other areas. I am a team player and did not mind helping out when they were stuck. But, management then put me on these areas all the time, instead of the replenishment position that I was hired to do."
good,"This is a good job if you're young. This is a low salary job. I liked it because I had no responsabilites at the time and I was young. But if you have never worked and this would be you're first time, go for it."
good,Kohls is a great place to work. Everyone that works there is very nice and works well together. They are very competitive when it comes to soliciting for credit.
good,"very busy store especially on Fridays and Saturdays, i liked working the registers time goes by so much faster, and you get to meet different people and spark a conversation while ringing there merchandise."
good,Kohls is a American department store chain headquartered in Wisconsin. is a big clothing company throughout the world nation wide everyone shops at kohls.
good,"If the store manager's inconsiderateness ,insecurity and easily bruised ego didn't get the best of him the experience would have been more pleasant for me"
good,Great job not enough days to work and didn't pay enough. Breaks are short and they rarely hire you full time. Not a long term job for some one with a family.
good,Very hard working environment sometimes for long periods of time with there mandatory OT. inconvenience getting to Kohls because of where it's located.  More of a job for people with cars but nice work environment.
good,"loved working hand in hand with some of the best makeup advisors in the state. They didn't sell the best of products, however as an assistant manager I found ways such as specials, gift bags, parties and more to increase sales."
good,its not a bad job a lot of walking you can listen to music which is a up but i like to keep to myself and me being a picker made it possible
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Basically I liked my job at kohls the only thing I can co plain about is being a new employee everyone around you is trying to be in charge as long as you stay to yourself state that you understanding everything get to know evryhting then the job will be a cake walk
good,"loved working here, just needed more hours. didn't offer a lot. always low on staff because of scheduling but coworkers are lovely and make your day. s"
good,"general maintenance of store, cash register, mainly cleaning store"
good,Continuation of my employment at Kohl's distribution center  I have better my communication skills with management and other co workers. I have also improved my  observation and problem solving skills.
good,"Kohl's managers have been very nice to me and given me freedom at the register with customers.  I am ""above expectations"" when it comes to opening credit accounts. I am responsible for my register and it's surroundings.  I keep my area perfectly clean and neat.  I have a great relationship with all of my customers, who always leave my bay as happy and satisfied customers. I earn extra breaks by getting credits cards opened."
good,I learned that you really do not get that many hours as you want which was not good for me. The management was great and so were all of the employees at the company.
good,"learned new cash registers, sales, co-workers were friendly and always nice, the hardest part working there was diffidentlythe cash register, enjoyable part was seeing new customers and talking with them"
good,"Working here as an intern was very fun and fulfilling."
good,"i enjoy work for the company it could had pay more with all the work they have you do the best part is they get pay weekly there. "
good,"Some days was more fast paced than others."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers, they bring life to my work day and fun to the time on the clock. I value my intimate customer as much as they value me. Overall the managers are good people but have a hasty way of talking to their associates. patience is a virtue in this building."
good,"It is a very hard job for the little money I get paid, it seems like not enough people are scheduled. The store gets really messy and there is not enough time and people to clean it up so it stays messy."
good,"Kohl's was a very high volume department store. I liked that I was always busy but at time I felt that the staff was spread to thin. Learned how to manage such a high volume of customer service, and I learned that I enjoyed assisting customers."
good,"it was a fun place to work and meet new people, wheather it was employees or customer coiming into store."
good,kohls was a very nice job they worked with you as far as flexibility
good,Very standard retail work day
good,I sold clothing in a commission based environment. I was the top seller and enjoyed fashion and influencing others to do the same. the hardest part of my job was being unable to find a solution for customers.
good,Great People Not great benefits not enough hours available
good,"At kohl’s you are put into a field we’re you won’t be told what to do, or hovered over to make sure your doing the right thing you will be thrown out and given a chance to show you know what your doing."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,it was very busy and competitive. there is always something to do. As a cashier you had to keep the front end and fitting rooms clean. getting customers to get a kohls card was a must and that was my least favorite part of the job.
good,I have developed a second family working at Kohl's. Over the years I have developed professional relationships and friends. I could say my experience at Kohl's has been nothing short of wonderful.
good,"Good company to work for. Many opportunities to advance. Discounts"
good,This is a great place for part time work for a college student or second job. Discounts are great because you can stack employee discount with all other. Early morning truck shifts can be rough and pushing credit on customers can be annoying.
good,"I worked at Kohl's around 1-4 times a week. Most weekdays are slow and manageable, but weekends were always crazy but fun because you and your co-workers stuggle together."
good,"Kohls as a company is greta. The management is what drives people away. Other than that loved the discount, loved that you could stack discounts and I actually really like having my kohls card."
good,"like any other job, kohl's had its pros and cons. for the most part, working at kohl's was fun. I met many people from different walks of life. its a good place to work and get to know different people"
good,Working at Kohl's was a pretty fun place to work. It was simple to learn the system and the Point Of Sale system. Management is very upbeat and fun to work with.Po
good,It was okay. The pay wasnt the best. Long hours. Not the best shifts but the management was really good and they were good to their employees.  Overall okay
good,"Was a great place to work years ago but being in a corporation, everything goes downhill. Little to no advancement depending on who you are. Great benefits for fulltime. New management as of this month so maybe things will look up"
good,"Many employees return each holiday season, so many of the employees knew each other from prior years, very clannish.  Employees were friendly and tried to help you because they knew once you were fully trained that would help them as well."
good,"Good place to work however, it's sometimes hard to keep up with the fast pace environment. There's a lot to learn super fast and can get overwhelming."
good,"Fun workplace, learn people skills and organization skills. Very repetitive as if you are a robot. There are community events that are really fun. And you feel recognized."
good,"Once upon a time they cared about employs now they make it all about the Almighty dollar"
good,"Kohls is a great company, their managers are experienced in the field of retail. The company has quality products, and trains their employees proficiently. This is a high end type of clothing store whose products are priced high."
good,"Kohls is a good company but I did not get chance to be full time . Good Management."
good,Typical work day would be working fitting room while helping with check out and customer service. Management is very positive and encouraging. Coworkers have a positive attitude and seem happy with their job.
good,Typically when we first get to work we pull freight from the dock out to the floor and someone will process it. If we are short handed then we will process the freight as well. I have learned that everyone should at least work a retail job at least one time in there life. The management I work with I have no complaints on as well as the co-workers. The hardest part of the job is the physical labor and still its not to bad. The most enjoyable part is the employee discount.
good,"Leave along and stop asking for reviews on these companies."
good,I liked it because it was fast pace and ut seemed like the day went faster that way I like my co workers they were very friendly I didnt like that it was hard to ask the managers questions they weren't very helpful or friendly I do miss working there the pay was good and they were very fair about breaks.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Management would get angry at employees if customers would not open our store credit card, even when we had no control over that aspect.  It was nice because I was strictly cashiering, and got to talk to lots of people who came through my line."
good,"Excellent experience in Customer Service.  "
good,"Love working here, it is a great part time job. You feel like part of a team and that you make a difference."
good,it needs some work in management and not enough workers ever. The holidays are a living nightmare due to this
good,"i typical day at work is fast pace and busy"
good,Interact with customers on a daily basis. Help manage inventory. Hard work leads to advancements.
good,"Unhappy environment to work in."
good,I believe that this place could have been better if there was better management and compassion for their employees
good,"Putting out stock, ad sets, & ringing register, customer service."
good,"I actually loved working at Kohl's. It was hardly ever a time when I called off unless I absolutely needed it. I was able to make friends, learn how a Kohl's charge card works, and to strengthen my customer service skills. I decided to pursue military interest in the Navy so that is primarily the reason as to why I resigned. "
good,clock in and out and set up my cash Register.
good,"Kohl's is a very exiting company to work at, as soon as I walk in to my my working area is a none stop multitasking environment such consistanly greed and check out customers offering them to open up a kohl's credit card and letting the customer know that it benefits them thru out the year, answering a high volume phone system and answering any questions and concerns they might have, I keep my area clean and organized and deal with customers thru out my shifts. Thru out my time at Kohl's I have learn how to problem solve under olot of stress and communicate have a good relationship with customers and keep my self together when I am in a confrontation with a upset customer. The management are our friends love to work with them, they make our job much easier and stress free, same as co-workers we learn from one an other and get olong and make our shifts enjoyable. The hardest part of this job I'll say is having to deal with upset customers, overall my job is easy to ring up customers, answer any questions, multitask locate for merchandize in our system, answer a high volume phone line, and clean my working area."
good,"Enjoyed working at Kohl's, employees were enjoyable to work with. Management easy to get a long with. Enjoyed helping customer and meeting their needs."
good,"The Victorville Kohl's store was fun to work for. The overnight crew was friendly and helpful in helping me learn the job as per company policy. The manager was nice and very profesional when she told me that I wasn't going to be kept beyond the Christmas seasonal position.We stayed busy all night,there was no time to slack off. If you weren't busy you weren't doing your job."
good,"It was a very good job, and also a great environment... Enthusiastic employees that will not only brighten up the customers day/shop but yours as well."
good,"I liked my 3rd shift job there, The days aweek i had also. Couldnt of asked for a better shift and hours per night i worked. I was part time and it worked out great for me with being a mom of 3 kids."
good,"This job was an amazing job, especially with how it stayed pretty busy, I loved interacting with our customers, and they liked it as well I had got really good reviews."
good,One of the best jobs I have had in a while. Great work environment and great people make make the days better and go by. There is always work to and always a way to improve and that’s what I love most about the job.
good,Great work place understanding and helpful if you like easy and slow this is the place for you. Nothing anyone can’t handle. It might be your next future
good,"Its an easy job to learn, its not difficult and as i said very flexible specially if you are in school they work with your schedule. Great customer service and teamwork"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Good work environment, really fast paced always have something to do, not just stand around. Good management never had any problems. Great coworkers that work as a team."
good,Big break room. Great discounts benefits. Good management very understanding! Local vicky’s bakery! Meeting great new people. Holidays aren’t that bad
good,I really enjoyed my time working at Kohl's. It was a great way to make money while I was in college. I would recommend working here to any college student
good,"They work hard"
good,I love being in charge of the work flow of the day. My ability to come to work and walk the sales floor to come up with a solid plan to get as much done as possible.
good,fun place to work you  are always busy and theres always hours to pick up. Day goes by fast because of the fast paced environment. hours were hit ot miss though
good,"I knew I would get fired and I'm glad for it. My personality was way to big there. No management person came to help with some thieves. One of the supervisors was aggravating and annoying to bits. HR can't schedule right, knowing you have class about 30 minutes away. Retail ain't for everybody."
good,it is a great place to work part time. The staff is friendly and helpful. The discounts are always nice. You get to interact with all walks of life and there is never a boring day.
good,This is a great part time job. I would reccomend this job to people that are in school or retired and just looking for an extra source of income. Great Benefits.
good,"Showing jewelry,answering questions ringing up product. Doing damage defectives on jewelry for call backs. Working with customers and getting to know them. The one thing I could not stand was closing every Friday,Saturday and Sunday."
good,I liked working there because it was an independent job and the customers was always nice and the management was always there to help when I needed it
good,"I don’t think every Kohl’s is the same, but the structure is. I think it is good and definitely a team place. However, If you don’t want to sell Creditcards, maybe consider a stocking position, there is a strong emphasis for the Kohl’s charge, that can make working there be a hit more stressful. But, also very rewarding if you even just try to get one."
good,"Working for Kohl's has been one of the most wonderful experiences I have had with any company I've worked for. The work environment promotes a high degree of efficiency and positive interactions. Not to mention, outstanding leadership and flexibility. I highly recommend a position at Kohl's, whether you are considering working full-time, part-time or even seasonal. It can be an enlightening experience, and provide important professional skills in diligence and service."
good,Kohl’s was my first job straight out of high school. It was a really fun and good Environment and very friendly people. Awesome place for a first job after high school.
good,I feel I enjoyed working there and would honestly return.  I really did enjoy working with customers and staff.  A typical workday would include spending time doing job and helping customers.
good,I gained a lot of work experience while at kohl’s from dealing with customers to dealing with technology such as the registers. This is a very good company.
good,I really loved the job . The employees was very helpful & kind. The workers at Khols were educated & outgoing. It was a good experience to clean there .The manager would have cook gathering for us every month.  The hardest part about the job when it was dirty some days & we would have to really be on point & clean every single thing so that the workers wouldn't complain. Overall it was a Great experience there .
good,"For a 2nd job, they do help you manage your work schedule."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I enjoyed working for Kohl's. I learned a lot but the company's schedule was not student friendly. I had a lot of issues just because I was going to uni as well.
good,"The management was very friendly, but training could use some work to be effective. For those working at the registers, focus is placed on numbers-- how many new credit card applications are submitted by customers. It's basically a competition. During non-holiday seasons, hours are very limited. Overall, not a bad place to work."
good,I loved working at Khols worked with your schedule and made sure all employees had even hours. Fast-paced type job moving around a lot and helping customers looking for an item or returning item. They always made sure to give customers the best experience they can.
good,"Kohls was a nice place to work: friendly people,  good managers, but pay was only 9 per hour and no time off for even part timers like me. Hence why I left the job.  The only draw back was there were 3 managers asking me to do different jobs at the same time, there was no line of command or respect for my immediate supervisor."
good,All the workers are so nice and willing to help you find whatever you need. The environment is very friendly. Everyone is so welcoming. And the store is always clean.
good,"Though I was only there for seasonal, the experience was great and if given the chance, I would go back. The environment was relaxed, managers were helpful and the trainers were always willing to help and answer all questions."
good,Kohl's has great opportunities. The people are very friendly. Great pay . Weekly pay. Training is proper. Wonderful place to work. Every work day was productive. Safety procedures are very simple to follow . Over time is offered . We learned new skills everyday.
good,"Contracting out maintenance/cleaning staff to avoid liability exposure, etc. is one of those... 'little you can do about it' corporate moves that is a sign of the times, but my local store staff was a pleasure to work with while it lasted at least. Wish I could have stayed."
good,A typical day at Kohls Department Store is so much fun when we receive a truck and have to unload it and then unpack it all and get it to the sales floor for the customers to shop it.
good,"When working at Kohl's it was a really good opportunity. I learned a lot from customer service to one on one training. We had some really great trainings, fun educating meetings and just great involvement to learn each other as well as the company we worked for."
good,"Kohls is a great place for employment. I think anyone seeking an enjoyable and fulfilling occupation, kohls is the place for you. You will get what you put into it."
good,I loved working at kohl's. I loved being around all the people. I loved working not just as the cashier but making sure the shelves and racks look neat putting things in there right place and working in all the different departments they had. I loved always having something to do.
good,All my coworkers were great and helpful. I also had incentive to do well at my job to make sales. I enjoyed the management and the culture was extremely helpful to success.
good,"This is a great company to work for with good operating and organizational framework for a retail company.  The retail store was located in the Hamburg Shopping Center, Lexington, KY."
good,"It creates a great space of environment; meaning that you will enjoy yourself while working and getting the job done. It’s not like it’s rough job, it’s something you can relate to cool people and take advantages of the networking you have."
good,a typical day is assisting customers at  a fast pace.  Keeping managers informed of any problems.  I learned to be extremely patient.  I love the associates that I work with.  My manager has an open door policy.  Always willing to work with you.
good,I'm on the recovery team I go to what ever department and help to re cover the department. Restoe department. The hardest part of job is having to clean out fitting rooms at times they are a disaster. That can take a very long period of time. the enjoyable part of working at Kohls is that it is not micro manged. I learn to work we'll independently
good,Kohl's is fun to work with and you are encouraged to do you best everyday. The environment is competitive but easy going. There are many different positions you can apply for.
good,"Working at this location I always enjoyed going to work. Coworkers and managers were in great moods and definitely cared about their colleagues. My job was fast paced and majority of the time rewarding, only issues i ever had were with customers but you'll have that in customer service at any department store. They would offer shifts up to any colleague when there were call offs. If you were trained in one area they would try and get you to learn the other areas of the store so you would have more options to gain hours for the week. Over all one of the best places I worked and perfect for a colleague student in the area, always flexible with the schedule."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Kohl’s was my very first retail job title and it was also very easy to learn how to help and work with a lot of new people and it helped me gain aspect on my future careers in retail.
good,I have been working freight at Kohls for 2+ years and it has been a great experience. The work environment has always been good for the most part. Management is great and I love my co-workers.
good,Great place to work. It was a new building when I worked there. Everyone there is so friendly. I worked third shift and it was so long. I couldn't take it
good,"Working at kohl's was a good experience in my life, it was my first warehouse job and I always felt welcome and appreciated. They let me use my headphones to listen to music and that made my work day much better."
good,I believe out of all my jobs I've worked at exclude the one I am currently at this is one the best jobs. It was my first time working in a retail and I really enjoyed it you learn a lot of things working in a retail. I thought I'll never be able to learn the job but the dont leave you hanging you always have someone by your side teaching you hands on. But you have to move fast once you have folded a table for instance the customers will come and rearrange it but you have to folded back up fats so it can look presentable for others a clean and presentable store brings more customers more customers more business and we can get paid. The most enjoyable part of this job was walking around with the walkie talkie. The only hardest part of this job was the store was so huge so you will be doing a lot of walking.
good,The management is very kind. They are there anytime you need them. They did not mind showing their appreciation to their employee's. We always had a huddle in the mornings to let us know what our tasks needed work on.
good,Good place to work. Pretty fair management. Not enough coverage in other areas around the holidays. Pay is ok. The hardest part of the job would be around the holidays with not having enough coverage for all store areas around the store.
good,I had a good experience working at Kohl's.  It was a good environment and customer were always treated in a fair and respectful manner.  Very good place to work and go with the family.
good,"I have worked for Kohl's for over a year now. I have worked at a different Kohl's in a different state and now the one in Gilbert, AZ (which is currently where I work). Both Kohl's is a wonderful atmosphere, employees are always willing to help out, great management, great company, and overall fun to work at. I am cross trained on pretty much everything, and they are flexible to move you around to fit your liking. Dress code is business casual, and weekends jeans are allowed. The hardest part about working here is the customers - they like to bicker about coupons and prices, but other than that it is a great job to have. The discounts and saving are so worth it too."
good,Everyday is a typical day at work i meet all types of people with all types of attitude but the one thing i learn dealing with people is that i have to be twice as nice to them as they are to me and i learn to treat people the way i want to be treated my work environment at khols s are very safe and friendly. The hardest part of my job is seeing everyone not getting alone with one another. The most enjoyable part of my job is Christmas time.
good,The position involves a constant regard for customer satisfaction. Whether at the register or on the floor it is a priority to make the customer happy.
good,"Absolutely loved this job, the only bad thing were there weren’t a lot of hours for me to work. I worked there for two years and never had a issue with management."
good,work is really good the pay is ok its just some of the people employees and customers im just really trying to either have a better job or this job and another job that fits in with my life and studies.
good,"The items are nice. I shops there. The jobs feel like you want to work. The customers that shop at Kohls are allthe nice kind of crowd,which makes the days go by happy and easy."
good,It was a good job till it wasn't. At one point my hrs were completely cut and had to go to workforce and after that the manager gave me 10-15hrs a wk.
good,"I love my job at kohls but it is only part time and i need a full time job i wish i was full time there but it is not offered. The employees are fun to work with everyone does thier jobs, my managers are great and understanding people."
good,"having 5 different managers is not a bad thing means tget dont get over worked but when you have 5 different managers that dont talk or share controll wqually you run into problems. I worked great with most of the managers and with me knowing all departments in the store i was a little more flexible with where i worked in the store, but even though i was trained in certain departments they would still have new people cover needed shifts that werent trained, because the manager likes them in the position better with no training in the position."
good,"It is a very high energy, fast paced work environment. Hours can be a bit inconsistent, but overall good hours. Not to mention the fantastic people you would work with"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,days r good pay was good Learnd to sort I liked management different people from all parts of the world the job was easy nice break room lots fun getting there on avon roads wrecks all time l like the people at kohls
good,Good. Keeps you moving and keeps you going never stop unless your on your break. Keeps you busy always have something to do. Help in different area's.
good,Absolutely loved working at the Kohl's distribution center. Had great coworkers and enjoyed unloading the freight. Worked my hardest each day and was recognized for it.
good,I had a wonderful time working with several of the employees. I made ever lasting friendships with co workers and management alike. Co workers were lively despite early morning shift.
good,Great management. Willingness to work around your hours. Great team to work with. Pay is minimal. Discounts are worth it! Clean store. Great experience!
good,"I love working at Kohl’s. The managers are professional, nice and more than willing to explain or answer questions. Scheduling is pretty much as you put your availability. I love the interaction with the customers and the given opportunityfrom the management team to learn more and do more."
good,"seasonal and permanant sucks to little hours"
good,"Kohls is a good spot to work at.. I would go back, just waiting on the call back to get my job back. Great pay for call center... Perception is everything at Kohls"
good,Typical retail there is no loyalty but as a store worker I really enjoyed working here the managers staff all awesome I get the pleasure of helping to open the store still look back on those days with fondnesss
good,"Very friendly, laid back work environment. Peers are easy to work with and have high energy. Sometimes lunch is provided and usually very tantalizing."
good,"I did not know anything much about retail when I joined. It is my first retail experience at a workplace. I learned a lot from the managers, how they handle customers, employees as well as build teamwork. I love working there on days without much customers as well as days when discounts or cash is going on. Enjoyable part of the job would be the discounts and employee appreciation and exclusive offer days."
good,loved the job not mich i wouldnt change but it was lost paying an not a career opportunity i wanted to pursue . if you need a job with decent pay an good hours id recommand ito
good,"I am so blessed to be working for such a GREAT company.."
good,"Really just a job to make some money on the side, while I also worked at the casino. Unloaded trucks. Fellow employees were really cool and we had a good rapport that made working somewhat fun."
good,"before employment I wasn't really a peoples person, but with my experience I discovered how to interact with customers/employees, and the team helped me fully understand the meaning of grat customer service"
good,Great people to work with. Customers were always nice even during the holiday season. Management was great. It was a fun seasonal job. I would work another Christmas there.
good,"While working with Kohl's I was able to come in 5 minutes early everyday, once I started taking calls worked flowed and was fast paced so the work day went quick. The lunch room was amazing and the people i worked with were always polite and respectful. The hardest part of the job was making sure my hold time for calls went down, when there was a tricky situation resources were not always around or attentive. "
good,"An average day was pretty relaxed.  The management was alright.  The biggest thing they push are getting customers to apply for a Kohl's Charge.  Unfortunately, they rarely close during inclement weather, so there have been times I had to drive to work in a heavy snowstorm.  Overall, the experience was pretty good."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I learned a lot. management was ok. was a fast pace overall. Had a good time there. The staff was very nice to me, they also helped me a lot. Its just been a long time."
good,"I worked nights. My night would start with a short meeting to let us know how much product we had to get on the floor. If we needed to do ad setups, any if we needed to get any displays ready for the next week. I learned how to read diagrams for displays. It is a fast-paced environment, because of getting product out, and doing ad setups and displays when necessary. I enjoyed the crew that I was able to work with."
good,It was a cool place to work I had fun and the people that I worked with was cool helpful and there when you needed them but overall it was time for me to move on in my life
good,Kohl's is a great place to work. It has been a great secondary income for me and they have been very flexible with my crazy schedule this past year. I would recommend them to anyone. They also do really well with customer care. They truly are like a family there.
good,"The reason I titled this as 'Incredible Reviews' is because our store constantly gets incredible reviews. I used to follow the Kohl's motto to the tee: ""Expect great things""! The Kohl's store is keen on making the customers absolutely happy. A typical day of work for me was at a register or if the store was not so busy, to put away clothes from the fitting rooms. Through my time at Kohl's I learned how to use a register and how to sell well! Management was incredibly kind and until this day, I am still asked how I am and how my life is going. You will not find kinder people! Workplace culture is competitive at the registers. The hardest part of the job is simply standing on your feet for hours, but that comes with the nature of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with friendly customers."
good,Typical day: Unloading the truck of merchandise. distributing them to eat department. cleaning up departments. helping customers. Cashier duties. inventory
good,The culture at Kohl's is very modern. You work on a real project throughout your internship. You gain valuable corporate experience. Overall great place to work
good,"I generally have to work at a slower pace for my own safety and accuracy. The pace was a little too fast for me to keep up with there. But nonetheless, I would have stayed but it was only a seasonal position."
good,I was not so satisfy with the job at that time the reason  why I didn't like how that treat us worker and work us so hard with low pay I'M not so happy
good,I learned time management skills. How to cope with stress and fast paced environments. Organizing was a big part of the job as well assisting customers.
good,Offers great value to their customers.  Great sales and rewards program.  Great executive training program and place to grow your career.  Attracts top talent.
good,I have learned a lot in my Marketing career at Kohl's. I highly recommend it to anybody who wants to learn about Marketing and retail. They have great benefits as well.
good,"I have worked at Kohl's for many years now and working retail has given me the great skills I have now with people. I am always told that I am great with people and that is all thanks to Kohl's. I have worked in other departments besides the beauty department, I have worked at the customer service desk many times and I have developed great skills doing so. Working retail has also taught me to handle difficult situations with ease and help customers leave happy instead of angry."
good,"very warm and welcoming co-worker, it got crazy in there for the holiday. when there was a lot of people the time went by very fast, just mind manners"
good,Khols is a good place to start working but not the greatest place to stay. You can get a foundation and learn some valuable skills here. Then you can get involved in better positions at companies that don't require working weekends and holidays.
good,"Awesome managers, very humble, and fun. Always going to ask you about your day and mean it. I've seen them all personally compliment someone and it puts an extra pep in that associate's step."
good,It was a great place to work I really enjoyed the people I worked with and I enjoyed working in the store I was stationed to work everyday of the week.
good,"great place to work, great manager, good people I highly recommend even seasonal is a great option!!!! I would definitely Apply if you get the chance!"
good,"seasonal job.  busy during holidays and peak seasons, but after that time passes, once it slows down they have to layoff several staff, some that are good"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Kohls was a great place to work at. I loved working there & having different kind of managers were great because you have like 3 great ones & then you have 1 telling you to quit.
good,This was a one day job so there isn't much I can say about it. The company was nice as well as the work environment. The pay was above average for the work involved
good,"Though I was only working at Khol's as a P.O.S for a seasonal time period, I was able to enjoy being able to be orientated with the customers. Whether it may have been by making sure they're visit was excellent or providing them with some good sales that could benefit the consumers in any way."
good,I enjoyed working there for seasonal. the employees were kind and the managers were respectful and efficient. the only horrible  thing about working there would be standing on your feet all day long.
good,Working here was truly a delight. I was kept very busy while working here and that is something I very much enjoy. If I am at work I want to WORK. I have no complaints about this place.
good,"Great company to work for. However, the upper management was not so great.  This is my hometown and was taken back to experience a setting that encourage mistreatment of employees.  I can not comment on CEO that I have not met.  But I worked in another store and was treated well.  The management at Bland Blvd store  is not what Kohls practice or a part of their training."
good,Got to travel to other stores. Fast paced. Learned a lot on the computer about what needed to to do that day. Management was very helpful. Best part was the customers and co workers.
good,from working on the floor to being behind a register you see it all. employee bonus for customers opening a charge card witch also benefits them. very fun and good team work
good,"Good place to work with benefits, great managers and co-workers. There's opportunity to grow and people encourage you to give your best."
good,"Very nice workplace , manager always helping us and answering our questions when needed , "
good,I loved the environment set at Kohls. People here are very friendly and as long as you do what you're suppose to job wise all will be very smooth. The hardest part of the job was getting through long shifts since a lot of standing is required.
good,Kohl's is a nice affordable and decent upscaled department store that has mostly what u need. the only bad part is that you have a lot of responsibility of up keeping the fitting rooms that can consume  most of your day just working on 1 room on a 8 hour shift.Great discounts and friendly associates.
good,"I absolutely love working for this company. I genuinely look forward to going to work. The staff is great, it's a relatively low stress job that is a lot of fun. Unfortunately, it is very hard to get adequate hours. Outside of the holiday season, I'm averaging in the teens in terms of hours per week. But at least there's almost always free food in the breakroom!"
good,this job is for people who love to work. a lot of production is expected out of you. management is very easy going. employees are helpful and will help you learn more of your positiion
good,Kohls is definitely a fun place to work. They offer flexible schedules and great company discounts. Very friendly and family type of work environment.
good,Met new people and made new friends. It was a laid back atmosphere where you could work at your own pace. It was also an interesting and unique place to work. Goid place to work for costumer experience
good,it was a good experience working at kohls i always helped the customer first and remember the customer is always right. i use to stock the store and front
good,"A typical day at Kohl's  varies on the day of the week, Kohl's make the customer want to come back with enticing deals on Clothes and other miscellaneous items. As a cashier you are most likely ringing up customers, folding near by, or engaging with the customer to ensure they have a good experience. The pay rate would be the only con as they should pay more to associates."
good,It was at your own paste kind of work it was all about doing it right. Supervisors were very nice and patient. team members were very friendly they help you out in anything you ask or having trouble in.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,This place is a very friendly spot to work for. They treat their employees with respect and make it feel as if you are really important to the well being of the company.
good,I learned to put up with difficult people in an environment that was rude and judgmental.  But the busy pace was good and made the day go by very quickly.
good,"The Part-Time work opportunities at Kohl's are very flexible, and I would recommend anybody who needs a part-time ob, or a second job to apply with this company."
good,"loved working at kohl's, would definitely apply there again. got an incredible discount, was able to interact with so many different varieties of people as well as helping them find what they were looking for"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Khol's and believe that it was good work experience for me. I don't believe that retail is the industry for me, but the people I worked with and my managers were very nice and accommodating."
good,"From the store manager to your fellow co-workers, everyone is so nice, like family. I love going to work. Only downfall for me is I am part time so the hours fluctuate, except for holidays when you can work more, and the pay is low. But the job is great besides that."
good,All i can say is just love ur job..u will love the friendly people that work there.U get good discounts on good stuff.That job really touch me.. Kohl's keep up tha good work.
good,When working in my department you would clean the fitting rooms making sure customers had access to clean fitting rooms. Would put the clothes back on the sales floor to keep access for the customers to find what they are looking for. Fold the tables to fix the merchandise on the sales floor and straighten up the rails. Help customers find what they are looking for if they cant find it on the sales floor.
good,It was a fun job. Really wish i was still there.Everyone there is really nice. I would love to go back if i had the chance.The hardest part of the job was nothing. I actually learned you can get a job no matter what your age is.
good,Great place to work.  Excellent part time job.  There really isn't much more to say its your typical retail job.  I hope you have a great day. Live long and Prosper
good,I love the people I work with they make it worth it. It’s so amazing to work with people that have great attitudes. The managers are nice and helpful at all times.
good,It was a nice job around the holidays but after the holiday I only get 16 hours a week the pay is good when there are hours but in there downtime it’s not enough to live off of
good,in kohls we use to unload trucks . it was fun while it lasted . it was pretty much fast pace because we would have to unload trucks before 9 am . i loved it because i got along with everybody
good,"For the most part working at Kohls has been great, however, for the first 6 months hardly anyone talked to me and a few of the people in Management were very cold and distant, it almost felt like they didn't like me for some reason and i'd never even had a real conversation with them. There are weeks that i've gotten only 4 hours and there was even a week when I wasn't on the schedule at all, with that being said, when that happened I went in and had a conversation with management about what I needed my hours to be and why and there hasn't been much of a problem with my hours since. they are very understanding when I have to take time off and do their best to accomodate me. there are options for even PT employees to enroll into the health insurance plan they offer and there are awesome employee discounts that are higher than the standard 15% from time to time. If you end up working at Kohls and experience the same thing I did with the other employees and mangement being cold and distant, just hang in there and eventually they'll warm up to you. I just chalked it up to the fact that they have such a large turnover rate that they wait to see if you're going to stay before they get closer to you."
good,Kohls was wonderful place to work especially if you like to work long hours w/o drag and good pay. Fast-paced environment and a steady work flow. The 12 hours you worked passed by quickly
good,"Working at a place where customer service is driven so much, it teaches you a lot patience. I enjoy seeing customers smile or relieved when they can use or are eligible for discounts on their purchases. Most of the time, people are kind towards employees."
good,I loved working here over the holidays. The hours were great and the discount was fantastic for holiday shopping. I learned a lot about retail while in employment and I learned a lot about customer service.
good,Kohl's is a great place to work. the hardest part to get used to is being on your feet all day. The best part is meeting new people. Management is patient and helpful.
good,"I would check the bins to see if there were any ""go backs"" to my department. If so I'd put them where they belong. Then I would start organizing the clothing racks so that they were sorted from color to size. I would make sure the dressing rooms were cleaned. I'd help check out customers when they were all done shopping. I'd open up credit cards for them if they wanted to apply for a Kohl's Charge Card and save them a percent off their shopping purchase for the day. I really enjoyed my coworkers. They were fun and great to hang out with."
good,"Though I was only a seasonal helper, my experience at Kohl's was one of my best. The place was clean, the people were friendly and understanding and willing to work with me. They really know how to make one feel at ease. The holidays weren't even that bad. I had a few rough experiences with some impatient customers but even then it wasn't that bad. They offered me time to recover from the incident if needed. The only thing that I'd have to say was difficult was covering so many areas. I've heard that on occasion there's only been one associate to cover all of the soft lines but I've never had to experience that myself. Overall I just really enjoyed working for Kohl's. It was such a pleasant experience."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I worked at the kohl's Distribution Center for about a year and 2 months and it was a good job but I made the mistake of getting a second job back in February and couldn't take the working 18 hours a day, it caused me to be late too much so I had too many late occurrences so they told me I'd be fired soon so I left, nothing wrong with the job, I just messed up."
good,This is a an ok job for someone looking for a part time job. During holiday season the hours are extended and if you close you could be at the store until 1 am.
good,"I enjoy working with Kohl's. The best part if the flexible hours. The discounts are great too! The hardest part is trying to meet the daily credit goal. I do not like the mandatory holiday schedule, but it is retail so that's to be expected."
good,I enjoyed working in customer service. The atmosphere is great and the products we sold were amazing. I loved making people's days with all of our discounts that we offered.
good,Its a good company they have incentives and pay raises and best of all paid weekly. Nice place to get alot of overtime. Nice employees for the most part.
good,this job was seasonal I didn't work long at this job the hardest part was the hours was varies ... i worked very well with others the production was good accurate packing an prepping for shipping
good,"Kohl's Corporation provides a very good opportunity for the beginners . It also allows you to grow withing the company if you are dedicated. Overall, it is a good job."
good,A typical work day at Kohl's would vary depending on what was going on. If it was Kohl's Cash weekend or Power Hour weekend then I would have to work at a faster pace. I learned how to deal with customers in a timely fashion and handle customer problems the culture of the job was good. The hardest part of working at Kohl's was not being able to please every customer all the time. The most enjoyable part ot the job was being around my friends that I aquired
good,they always treated everyone like family and could not ask for a better team to work with even at christmas and back to school when it was always bussy
good,"If you enjoy having a hand in many roles or prefer to help out in other areas on a slow day, you will find much to do whether a cashier, supervisor, or customer service representative."
good,"I really enjoyed the company and the people around me , very supportive and the company always finds ways to support and motivate there employees great benefits ."
good,Your hours vary each week.  One week you might be scheduled for 30 the  next week 4.  You stay busy and never slow down if you do your job. Hardest part of the job is trying to get your break.  You can work 5.5 hours and you get a 15 minute break.
good,"Fully understanding, try super hard to make sure that the atmosphere is friendly and uplifting, encouraging supervisors, understanding of all situations, flexible and will accommodate to you"
good,"coming into work everyday is always different. interacting with different customers and enjoying working with awesome co-workers, great food if you love Italian cuisine."
good,"Overall workplace environment is spectacular. The people you work with are easy to get along with as well as the managers and supervisors. There are many events to participate in whether it's for fun for the work place or it's for a cause. I learned great team work, on a typical workday I would cash people out help out in certain areas that need help in the store like customer service and on the sales floor so there's always room for moving around. Overall I don't think there was anything remotely hard about the job nor the position I was given."
good,"This was one of my favorite places to work, Kohl's is all about creating a happy work environment which then overflows into successful customer service.  If you are looking for a retail job, but are afraid of the ""retail"" stigma, you should consider Kohl's!"
good,"Customers are messy, so there is always something to do. I enjoyed assisting customers. I was responsible for providing break relief to the customer service desk which duties included answering the telephone, responding to inquiries or connecting the caller with the appropriate department. Also merchandise returns, credit card payments and retagging merchandise price tags. Replenishing racks and shelves."
good,It's Easy And Fast Paced But The Stress Does Build Up Pretty Quickly. I Appreciate At The Amazing Opportunities I Was Given There And Would Work There Again At Anytime.
good,This was one of my favorite jobs I have had. I actually enjoyed going to work and worked as much overtime as I could. I would definitely recommend this job.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Needed better communication to find out and work out issues.  Liked the team approach because the job is fun when that approach is used.  Company take care of employees.
good,"I honestly like to work at Kohl's because I had the opportunity to work in every department. The only thing I did not like is that this type of jobs only offers  part-time work most of the time, unless you where a manager or supervisor!"
good,been working there for over 7 years they really don't give much hours... even if youre a supervisor. that would probably be my only complaint. everyone if usually very cordious
good,"I was hired for a Christmas seasonal worker, and I was also a student. The management worked with my school schedule without any problem. The hardest part was leaving when the season was over."
good,"•	Providing great customer service while training two to three associates per month"
good,"I was only there for about four weeks. I was hired as a seasonal worker and if I was able to sign up a decent amount of people for their credit card, I would be kept on. This was my first real job and i had zero experience in retail. I learned how to use cash register and how to use the phone to call other departments. As this was my first job, I wasn't very good at handling customers. I worked there right before Christmas and customers would get very cranky about prices and boxes, and the stock we had. I don't remember too much about working there as it was almost 7 1/2 years ago, but I do remember it being a good starting place."
good,One of the best retail establishments I have been able to work in and actually enjoy. My day would consist of making sales and ringing  out customers. that is probably the most rewarding part of my job
good,The people I work with are great people to work with. I work in an office where reports are sent out daily as well as monitoring the processing systems there. It is a good environment to work in but the company does not compensate for hard work and there is no room for growth from within.
good,This work environment was very comfortable and welcoming. There is a true sense of caring and charisma amongst the employees and management. Very well structured and very affordable clothing .
good,"Great working environment, Customers are friendly, managers are very easy to get along with, Co-workers are very friendly, hardest part is dealing with the angry customers."
good,"i always enjoyed showing up to work because it was such a positive environment to be a part of, i just wish selling credits wasn't such a big deal because it took away from the enjoyment of being there"
good,I liked working at kohl's the short time that I worked there. I worked over the holiday season when it was always busy and had a good experience because they had a good system and worked everyone and everything equally.
good,Working here was so fun. A typical day at work for me being a cashier would be just checking people out and helping anyone with any questions. The management team is the best one around.They work around your schedule and everyone is just overall really nice!!
good,The atmosphere is so loving and supportive that it is difficult to not enjoy your time there. The employee discounts are also a great benefit of working there.
good,"Kohl's is an amazing place to work, everyone is very friendly and the managers are great. I loved working with the customers.  The only problem was the hours, after the holidays the 40 hour work week turned into a six hour work week."
good,Kohls is actually a great place to work!  You have nice and fun managers and the pay isnt too bad. But scheduleing is awful if you work part time and pay role is cut you wont get hours.
good,Kohl's is a really great place to work and grow. Everyone from the CEO down is great. The pay is okay and the bonus varies. There is always something exciting happening to keep you motivated.
good,I loved working there..The coworkers are like family and the customers to. everyone is so nice and friendly and make you want to work/shop there. The hardest part of the job is the return policy.
good,"This position had me on my feet most of the day. I got to spend a lot of time on the floor doing new sets, It was so nice seeing my ideas take light on the floor."
good,"There's always something to do, they keep you busy and this makes the day go by faster. Training is very detailed so you get the job done the right way."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"The environment and the people were great, always smiling. However, the management did not properly make the schedule and I often found myself working the floor on my own"
good,great place to work. kohls really cares. it was seasonal but the pay was great and they threw overtime at you. would definitely recommend this job to anyone

As a part of the Customer Service team, I enjoyed the privilege of being on the floor interacting with and assisting our shoppers by informing them of our great sales and additional ways of saving with both our Yes2You Loyalty Rewards Card and Kohl's Charge Card. I would readily answer any additional questions or concerns our customers may have had, walking them through every aspect so that they would be well-informed shoppers. Informing customers that a product was sold out was the toughest part of the job, but taking the time to order that product through our kiosk or by telephone to ensure our customers left our store with that merchandise purchased and a smile on their faces was quite rewarding."
good,"I enjoyed working here very much. After the seasonal position was over, I was asked to join the team permanently. I excepted and then we relocated and was unable to transfer being that I hadn't been there for a year."
good,"The management was awesome always willing to help and the co-workers was willing to help, if they had one in the town that I live in now I'd still work for them."
good,Fun place to work with bonuses included. Staff was very supportive and enjoyable to be around. They are a major retail store that gave me so much more opportunities in the retail field. The most enjoyable part of this job was working with the customers and building relationships with my employees.
good,"Always greating customer coming in store and leaving"
good,"We would log trucks in and out, and data entry along with vendor compliance audits to make sure things run smoothly.  We also do inventory control to make sure all product was accounted for."
good,"I have really enjoyed working for Kohl's over the last (almost) 5 years. Besides offering a generous employee discount, they have always been very good about working with my schedule-which as a student has changed at least two to three times a year with an ever-changing school schedule to rely on. My other, and perhaps most favorite thing about working for Kohl's, is the fellow associates and co-workers. It may seem cliche, but they really have become like a second family over the last several years and I really appreciate that about them, and about Kohl's in general. By providing a welcoming and inviting atmosphere, I have been able to become close to co-workers and customers just by representing the environment of Kohl's."
good,"I enjoy working for Kohl's Department Store in Neenah.  I typically work in the jewelry department, helping customers find what they want, making minor watch repairs, and working with products in markdowns and replenishing."
good,"Training programs to further you career, values your personal development.  Fast pace productive work environment.  No consistent work schedule. Must work holidays and weekends. Long work days required regularly."
good,"I make sure everything is in place and very organized."
good,"decorating during holidays, work community events, prizes, great managers, fun co-workers, the hardest  part of the job is selling the credit cards"
good,"I would stay in one stop through out the whole day, management was okay, they wernt the best, my co workers were mostly the best part of the day"
good,A typical day at work was never typical. I could be on the floor one day selling merchandise and in the warehouse the next day. The hardest part of the job would have to be constantly fixing the clothes rack after the customer. While the most enjoyable part would be getting the job done correctly.
good,Only worked there for a short time was not cut out for retail. my time there was fine and dont have much more to say other than that.
good,Energetic people in a fun work place. Not a lot of room to move up in the company unless you work there a long time. It is an easy job to catch on to.
good,This job is what really taught me work in customer service. I devoted a little over a year to this job. I was taught how to notice what customers really need and really want out of the store I was working
good,"The night at kohls was a great learnig process, loading product on to the floor unloading trucks and bieng able to finish the job before time while working with a great team."
good,"I work with customers on a daily basis at work and learned to keep good relationships with my coworkers but also be a leader around them by making sure we all work together to create a clean, friendly, and inviting environment for customers."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,It was a great company to work for. The best part of this job was interacting with the customers. Making sure the customer was always satisfied with their service.
good,Work schedule fit my personal life.  Employer worked with their employees.  It was fun to help the customer find what they needed in the store.
good,Great position for working part time and getting through college. I made so many new friends and learn life long lessons and ways of living.
good,A great place to work for college students and high school students. Part-time employment 20 hours or all the overtime you may want or need. Very flexible. Management will work around your schedule if you are a single parent also.
good,"It's an interesting place, but some of the managers were far far too serious all the time and didn't relax once or crack a smile, not even for the customers."
good,"A typical day at Kohls was very unpredictable. One minute the job is slow with some cleaning downtime, the next minute you're ringing up customers and your shift is over in what seems like a heartbeat."
good,I have worked at Kohl's for at least 9 years. It has always been part time. The people I work with and work for are friendly and motivated.
good,Kohl's works you in all areas of the store with or without the training needed. They work you as long as they can legally as long as they need someone to work. I liked the job and all areas of the store.
good,I made lots of great friends. I didn't like the fact that they would keep hiring people when the associates they did have would get 10-15 hours a week. I learned a lot and there was a lot of training that helped keep us informed and keep learning.
good,On a typical day I help customers find their size in shoes or provide them with information on where to find them. I also work with some of the best co-workers out there and try to keep everyone positive as we put the store back together at the end of the day. I enjoy helping people find the things in the store they need and love to see them smile. The hardest part is dealing with the customers who are just plain rude. But my management is decent so it balances out!
good,"A fun and great place to work"
good,"I loved how detail-oriented I could be in the work place. My favorite part of the job was organizing, replenishing to company standards."
good,"I enjoyed working at Kohls because we were like a family and always worked together to accomplish any given task. We all were working towards the same goal, to deliver excellent customer service to everyone we encountered."
good,Khols is a fun place to work. All the people are very nice and helpful. Not a bad one in the bunch. The managers are approachable and not intimidating at all. The work is easy and simple and makes the time go by very fast.
good,Kohls has been a great company to work for over the past 13 years. It has allowed me the flexibility to maintain a great work life balance.
good,"I start my shift by always knowing what the task at hand is and performing various customer service tasks during the shift.  Kohls is a great place to work. I have been with the company 11 years for a reason.  Management has always worked with me during some very personal times in my life, allowing me to take time off when needed.  I've worked with a lot of great associates along the way.  Recently transferring to another state has allowed me to see that the same great customer service is maintained at all stores.  There is nothing hard about my job I love going in and taking care of business. The variety of daily job performances allows me to never be bored with what I do."
good,"During my two years there, I enjoyed myself alot. I learned many skills that I would forever be grateful for. Customer Services was the best part for me."
good,"check out customers was a typical day at work. learned all about retail and how it runs."
good,Very good department store to enhance your sales or customer service skills. Enjoyed seeing the merchandise first and being able to use the wonderful staff discounts giving to the employees. The incentives given when opening a store credit were awesome.
good,"I would come into work, go to my cash register and start checking out customers. Then I would be asked my managers to consistently ask customer to apply for the Kohls Card."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I would say my over all review with my time working at kohl's was that it was a great. The most enjoyable part of the job was the managers and coworkers all worked as a team to help one another.
good,Fun and enlightening environment. I always enjoy getting up and going to work because of my friendly coworkers. Overall I really enjoys getting to interact with customers everytime I work there.
good,They are a wonderful company who cares a lot about their employees. Every day the managers were welcoming and motivated their employees to do a great job that day. I learned a lot about working customer care service.

good,I was able to strengthen my people skills and allow myself to grow in my social aspect. Enjoyed all of the people I worked with.
good,Pretty chill job until the holidays come and becomes extremely busy closing hours can be up until 3 am at times during holidays
good,As a seasonal employee I had experience at a high volume store during the peak holiday months. The management was really supportive and easy to work with.
good,Perfect job just rude team leads. Nice Clean work areas. Very Nice Co-workers.Bonuses are great but depending on your team lead can be very hard to get.
good,What I loved the most about Kohl's was that it was so flexiable. You could pick up more hours from coworkers that couldn't work them or give up hours that you didn't want. A typical day for me would be working hard and quickly while always trying to pick up more hours. My time at Kohl's really gave me an understanding of the true meaning and value of customer sevice.
good,"I miss all of my friends. A typical day at work was just making pizza. I Loved the management, Shannon and Tim. I could work here again definitely."
good,"This postion was a lot of fun.  I worked in a very busy store and the customer base was great.  I was only part time, but if I wanted extra shifts they were available.  My work days were full and the time went by fast.  The hardest part was staying up on fitting rooms during peak hours."
good,The company is great no complaints very flexible. I really enjoyed my time at kohls worked there primarily through college very low stress job.

good,"Kohl's is a very clean and nice place to work. The staff are great; very friendly. "
good,Fun job working for a fun company. Executives and Supervisors really care about the associates working there. It is hard to obtain a full time position only because people love working there and don't leave very often.
good,Working at Kohl's taught me many great skills that I hold today. I learned the importance of customer service as well as working in a team with coworkers. I enjoyed coming to work and giving customers the assistance they needed. Working seasonal during the holidays taught me how to work under extreme chaos and pressure.
good,I had a great time with company I worked for this company foe ten years. I learned how  to manage and lead a successful team.

good,I loved Working at kohls! one of  my favorite things was the fact they care about the community! I Spent a couple days volunteering with Kohls! They really do care! their benefit were great as well!
good,"A typical day at work is when there is always customers or we are out folding and cleaning up for the next day.  I learned how to take care of customers above and beyond what was required and help them check out and help them with anything they needed.  Management works as a team and helps out as needed.  Coworkers all try to reach the same goal.  Hardest part of the job is the constant  ""newbies never wanted to do our jobs.""  Enjoyable part is each day is different."
good,I loved my time at kohls. I learned so much and my fellow associates where very pleasant.
good,"I absolutely loved working here, but became ill and was not able to continue employment"

good,"In my short years with the company, I have learned so much about leadership and fairness. I have many great memories with not only my coworkers but my managers. They have a greta back bone and do a lot of community service. Their benefits as well as pay may not be the best out there but I would go back just to work with the people I did have have the respect from my managers that I experienced."
good,"A typical day working at Kohl's was making sure that every customer was helped to the best of my ability, so they could leave the store wanting to come back. I would make sure that the main sales floor was kept clean and organized, as well as the fitting rooms. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with incredible people and supervisors. The hardest part of my job was not being able to find what the customer was looking for."
good,"I would come into work , greeted by my co-workers and managers so it was a warm place to come into. I learned different ways to communicate with each customer as time went on, I would watch my other co-workers and try different techniques that they used and the advice they had given me. The hardest part of the job would be trying to get across to an angry customer. We didn't have too many problems with this because Kohl's is what they call a ""yes"" store and basically the customer's need or want was met at all times. The most enjoyable part would be coming into work, meeting new people and pleasing customers."
good,Working at Kohl's gave me the chance to meet amazing people.

good,There is no typical day at Kohl's.  It is a very fast paced environment.  The associates are engaged and focused on customer service.
good,A typical day is good because you greet customers and help them while you clean the store  and maintain a good environment for workers and customers. I've learned that a place like Kohl s may not be the best place to work at but it does build character to make you a better person either at work or not at work. Management is good because they may not pull through all the time for some request the employees have but they give a valiant effort to always do the best they can for Kohl s associates to make it fair. The co workers at Kohl s are great and we always have fun working together and helping each other out. The hardest part of the job is being consistent on credit or sale goals and being out on time for truck. the most enjoyable part is working with my co workers.
good,"A typical work day may vary depending on whether it is a high or low volume sales time. You learn how to work as apart of a team, increase your sales skills, and customer service skills."

The hardest part of the job was dealing different personalities when it came to the customers. The most enjoyable part was making a customers day and seeing them smile and say they'll be back."
good,"To sum it up - every worker in the establishment is friendly, and focused on helping. I normally assisted on cash register or worked in my own department and kept the area in order. Getting to work with customers was eye-opening because I got to learn how to handle different situations with customers and how to approach each task or challenge."
good,it was a good job. a lot of room for growth. managers always seemed to help out with any problem in or outside work.
good,"A typical day at Kohl's starts with me clocking in saying the my co-workers. Speaking with my managers about what our sales goals, credit and rewards goals are. The management team is actually really great to work with. They are a lot like family and they make the customers and employees feel that way, again my co-workers are great as well, all hard working and willing to go out of their way to help anyone that needs it. The hardest part of the job I will say is selling the credit cards. Because we offer so many great discounts people without the card usually are not interested in opening one. The most enjoyable part of the job in this store is my co-workers and management team."
good,"Enjoyed friendly and welcoming environment. Management at my store was great, co workers were pretty friendly. The hardest part of the job was standing for long periods and having too short of breaks."

This position was one where interaction with customers was almost 100% of the time. My co-workers and managers at Kohl's were very easy to work with and were very helpful and understanding and great at answering my questions. I very much enjoyed talking with all the different customers I would encounter daily this being the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who did not always understand our return policy and in turn would get angry and in rare cases hostile. Overall the job was a great one, one in which I would do again in a heartbeat!"
good,I love to meet new people. I enjoy working with my co-workers. Most of all i enjoy being able to help people/customers.

good,Enjoyed working here for the Holiday season. Great customers and employees.
good,"It was fast pace at all time. Each day brought about something different. I learn so many different things at Kohls, the whole process of getting out orders in a timely manner to their customers. My former co-workers were great!!!  We had some good and not so good days. The hardest part of the job was getting everyone on task. I did some training for the new hires, which I enjoyed a lot. Overall Kohl's is a great place to work. I was just a seasonal employee, but greatly appreciated being treated as an equal."
good,this was a seasonal position. I unloaded merchandise and stocked the sales floor
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was making the customers happy and seeing the smiles I brought to their face. I learned to master my customer service skills to the fullest by working in all the different departments such as the ""Customer Service Desk"". I always knew the answer to every question a customer asked me and if they were frustrated at all, I would always know how to calm them down just by talking to them, resolving their issues and making their day. My co-workers were very friendly and I got along with all of them very well.

good,"I've been working for Kohl's for over two years and it's been the best two year of my career.  I always look forward to coming to work. When I was first hired I started off as Point of Sales (registers) and quickly learned to work in customer service, in the first couple months of being hired.  I accelerated with customer service and learning to work with counting registers down at the end of the night.  My work environment is always pleasant with my coworkers and getting along with all my store supervisors. The only hardest part of this job is to accumulate hours on a weekly basis."

However, a typical day at work was always busy from the time the store opened until the close of the day. The holiday seasons are the most enjoyable time to work for Kohl's; the customer's and co-worker's are very cheerful.  Several incentives are offered for the employees during the holidays.  I have had the opportunity to work in two locations, Omaha, Nebraska and Tallahassee, Florida during the holiday seasons.

good,"At this company I was a seasonal sales associate during the holiday season for Misses, Juniors, and Mens. Being a sales associate means that I was also an occasional cashier when they got busy and needed help. Management was very friendly and helpful. I only came across a couple of ""less than happy"" co-workers, but I only worked with them once or twice so it wasn't that bad. The hardest part of this job was that I never seemed to have enough time in a shift to completely refold everything on the shelves and make it all ""look good."" It seemed like 10 minutes after you would fold something another customer would come by and mess it up again."

I had to be aware of the products and their locations to provide great customer service. I would have to run the cash register at busy times and solve customer needs. I had to have strong communication skills.
good,"Opening and extracting mail. the importance of processing tax information in time. Management was outstanding, they were always readily available when we needed assistance in any area. My co-workers was always pleasent and great to be around. We were more of a family group, everyone was caring and concerned for each other on and off the job.

good,"This was my first job in retail. After being with the company for 2 years I was cross trained for every department. I was the ""Go To Girl"" if anyone called out or didnt show up for work. Normally I was the person that would always come in. The management team was tight knit and very friendly. It truely felt like a family"

I loved being able to help them and enjoyed talking to them every day!
good,hard work and fun to be a part of a great team. cleaning fitting rooms and being a cashier
good,"When school is in its not bad we can get our projects done. Weekends are crazy with earlybirds, kohls cash and the 30%, 20% and 15% off discounts. You will never met a person who cared about how juniors if it wasnt for me. My store has favorites if you dont suck up you wont get attention. Some stores are probably like that too. Managers dont always post when our store needs a supverior and everyone wants to apply for it then just gave it to people who dont really work as hard as most people do. Hardest part is the holiday season. I love how i made so many new friends working here and they help me get through the day!"

good,"Very interesting place to work, I learned alot from how to use a rf gun etc. Cashier, and excelled my use of customer service"
good,"It was a fast easy paced work environment. Always loved being busy. The worst part of my day would probably be when customers get mad because of you going on break, or your off work. Very friendly coworkers always helped. It was always hard trying to balance the register and help someone else at the same time."
good,I enjoyed this job more then any. They take care of their employees individually. Everyone has equal opportunity to do anything they need and want to do to progress. If I could go back I would.

good,The most enjoyable part of the job as a Beauty Advisor is that you get to work with makeup. If you are a makeup person and love playing with it and just like the art of it than you’ll love working as a Beauty Advisor.
good,I really enjoyed working for Kohls. All the employees there was really nice and friendly. I enjoyed meeting new people. It was nice to know that I could switch shifts with a coworker if I needed to instead of just calling off work. I hated the fact that they let me go after the holiday season
good,"Working at kohl’s in foresthill is great , managers and other associates make you feel very welcome. Very friendly employees. Easy going environment  ."
good,Great place to work! They’re all helpful when you’re new there. Great work environment to be in. Flexible work schedule if you’re part time. Not sure about full time.
good,"Although sometimes it is slow, time passes by quick while you clear out the fitting rooms. Fun place to work, kind people, good deals. Nice break room."
good,Great place for a seasonal retail job you work really hard but try to work together as a team as much as possible.  You do not get micromanaged which is very nice.
good,"It was a good experience. I liked everyone I worked with. Management was always there to help out. Truly enjoyed this position. I wish I had been chosen to stay on, but was told to reapply in April."
good,A typical day at Kohl's is pretty fun. The environment is friendly and the tasks are simple. Overall a great place to work seasonally or after retirement. The biggest issue for me is that during holiday seasons (Black Friday especially) no matter what emergency you may have they would try to convince you to stick around to help them deal with the hecticness of the season.
good,It is a great place to work as a cashier.  The cashiers are friendly to each other and the workday goes fast.  Hours are too long for the holidays but otherwise good.
good,"Hired as a cashier for holiday help.  It is fast paced retail work during the holiday season. There seems to be a lot of emphasis making sure you ask all customers for their e-mail address.  Kohl's has a good return policy. Some customers seemed confused about their ""Kohl's Cash"" because the coupons have an expiration date on them and a lot of customers forget and then they expire.  During the holiday season however, the store was willing to honor expired Kohl's cash which had to be over-ridden by floor manager. I don't know if they have changed the policy on that or not."
good,"Loved it. Was fast paced so I was always busy, which I prefer.  But my co workers were laid back and easy going. Overall love working there,  really did."
good,"I have worked at Kohls for three years now. I started as a Sophomore in College and since then have graduated. This job may not have paid well, but it was a relatively stress free job. It was easy for me to balance this job with being a full time student and having other jobs on the side. Although holiday season is very stressful, I always stayed because I enjoyed the people I worked with."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,This was about taking care of merchandise whether or not it was already on the floor or coming of the truck into the warehouse. Certain plans had to be followed to display the merchandise and signed correctly on the floor.
good,The company is an amazing retail distrubutor. They really take care of their employees and make sure they try there best. Management could be better but Im sure youll hear that from any job.
good,Very laid back job. A typical work day is fast and busy and selling charge cards.Helping people shop will be my fav part of the job. the team members are great and always will to help
good,"Kohl's store is a nice place especially for people to work part-time. I am a full-time student, hence, very busy with studies. I like the work culture at this particular Kohl's store."
good,Cashed out people buying products and worked with customers on returns and purchases.. Helped straightened up the clothing areas. Cleaned up the customer service area by putting things away.
good,"Working at Khol's was a great experience in retail. It was only part-time during the Holiday season. If I had a choice to go to work there again, I would."
good,"This job was fun, although you had to solicit credit which would be stressful, but you are required to do it. You have goals set for the day and if it is not completed, it could result in lower pay."
good,Lack of staffing make a work day both fast and stressful However the staff who do work there are both helpful and nice. The hardest part is the lack of staff and the way some mangers talk to their staff.
good,"Smooth workday, management very friendly. Managers provided an enjoyable experience including fun team building activities and displays of appreciation."
good,"Kohl's cares! Great place to work. I enjoyed it. The team members are very helpful and warm. I learned all about shoes, and emptying trucks. The hardest part about the job was the trucks needed to be emptied in the early early morning."
good,Friendly atmosphere and happy people.  No set schedule for working.  Hours were not compatible with normal home life.  I have a child in school and had to find a babysitter at odd hours.  No overtime or full time employment offered.
good,"Very slow paced but you get the job done with other team members  , working here showed me how to  cooperate with others on and off the job site . Showing how to do jobs most people don’t know"
good,Overall a great place to work and great people to work with. Great atmosphere to be in. Always willing to work around your schedule. Held to a high standard when working there.
good,For a seasonal position it was alright. I would've stayed if they offered to keep me on but they didn't. Kohl's busiest time is the seasonal time because of black friday and the holiday season.
good,The typical kind of day at Kohl's is that you have to be able to deal with the good transactions and the bads one. Definitely need a backbone to work there.
good,It was a great job that was really a benefit to work stand grow as an individual. I also applaud them for studio 6 careers diversity.  I think that Kohls is a top notch organization
good,"My position was just a seasonal job but I had a good time working at Khol's.  "
good,"great company to work for, but the management is not always interested in advancing those who are interested in it. It is better to have a full-time job, though."
good,"Cleaned my area, helped anyone who needed."

Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I love working at Kohls. I wish it was a fulltime job but unfortunately that isn't offered to associates. It will always be a high turn over rate because of the hours. Pay is above minimum but hours aren't guaranteed.
good,They job is easy and the time goes fast. Everyone is always so nice there but just like any other place there’s always gossip. I loved working here and I wouldn’t mind working here again if they paid more!
good,"It is a big company, provide benefits and vacations, the payment is low compare with the workload. there are career opportunities available in some locations."
good,"Unfair treatment with schedule depending on performance "
good,"If you don't mind being on your feet all day walking on hard floors, getting paid minimum wage, while dealing with messes left by customers, this is the perfect place for you."
good,The environment is welcoming but the people I worked with were not always. And management made it tough to get in contact with them and even try to request a day off.
good,"I considered everyone I worked with at Kohls as family. I love the people, and the environment. While it was a laid back job, it was very detail oriented. And I hated leaving."
good,I like the people I worked with and learned a lot I enjoyed my managers they always worked with your schedule they made it fun around the holidays lots of sales all the time love the cash back.
good,"Job is flexible with my personal life, benefits are great and managers are very friendly.   Just hard standing in one spot for more than a few hours at a time but break time is fairly given."
good,"Fun place to work, but too many managers with different rules.  Part of my job or every P.O.S. employee is to ask people to sign up for a credit card.  If you have a hard time getting people to sign up, you lose hours the next week all the way down to four hours a week.  This is crazy, if you only get four per week, that's not much help trying to get people to sign up!"
good,This place is so fun to work at. You get a range of different customers to help out and they train you hands on so you don't get stressed out. Very good management and there's always something to do. I went from being just a cashier to working on the sales floor to working on the loading docks in the morning. Time flies when you work here and the pay is a plus. My employees felt like my second family and my boss was a true leader. I've proudly met the CEO once before and they certainly know what they're doing!
good,Khols is a very competeitive work place. they always try to be on the top with sales and other things.They have great customer service and evrything is alwaysin place.
good,"When arriving at work the management will give us the goals set and targets for the day."
good,Kohls is a friendly work atmosphere. However there is some dowm falls. Can't move up unless someone quits. You get special treatment when soliciting a charge card and the customer applies but not for your hard effort if customer says no. Pay is decent but raises are a joke.
good,I enjoyed working at kohl's. The work environment was great and the boss I had was very nice. I just wish it was a full time job to get more hours in.
good,Kohls was pretty fun to work they had a lot of cool people that work there and it was fun to help customers with things and overall pretty easy job. Recommended!
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management.

good,"I had a good experience working there friendly environment,we always worked as a team to get things done faster . We also always had group meetimg when we got there we would do streches for the day ."
good,As a cashier you deal with multiple cash transactions daily. I learned how to effectively communicate with customers who had concerns and questions. I learned how to calm and clearly explain issues to customers.
good,I was the Operations Area Supervisor here and was responsible for many things. I opened or closed the store and supervised the entire staff. during truck days I was in charge of the freight offload process and training/supervising the merchandisers on the sales floor.
good,A typical day here is very busy. Management is a lot of fun with a great sense of humor. Everyone there is very helpful and have the willingness to teach.
good,"I love working for this company and love the people that I work with. The hours that are required of their salaried employees do not provide a positive work/life balance. "
good,"Needs more work life balance time, the hardest part of the job is being stressed knowing that you cant care for your loved ones"
good,"Kohl's is a good place to work. The management is okay, but those that are fellow associates are great people. They are fun to work with and make this very enjoyable."
good,I loved working one on one with customers. Management was great to work with. Hardest part of the job was soliciting credit.
good,The environment is very fast paced and fun. The interaction with the farmers gives you great diverse people skills. Many of the farmers are great friendly customers. Very friendly environment.
good,this job is for young people who are just getting out of high school.The pay was horrible but the people are really nice. It was a nice job but that just was not for me.
good,"-The management was very nice and always willing to help"

good,I love working for Kohls. Great company and family oriented. everyone embraces you and welcome you to the company. They promote within and also from outside. They reward hard working and team building.
good,"I absolutely loved working for Kohl's. They kept us motivated and we always had a good time, even during the stress of the holidays. Sometimes you will get those challenging customers, and the managers I had were always stepping up when needed. I honestly can say the only down fall with this company was the lack of hours and the health benefits package. Other than that I loved it!!!"
good,"I have worked for Kohl's for about two years and although the experience is been good I want to keep ahead with my career. I learned a lot about my limits as a Point of Sale Associate to deal with customers, management and co-workers. Overall Kohl's gave me the skills to be able to work under pressure and still be able to give a positive face to every task."
good,"A typical day at work here would be to unload trucks, cashiering, recovery, and cleanup. I have learned alot here because I helped open this store. Management here was good. Co-workers here was great. The hardest part of this job was to get the store back together at the end of the day. The most enjoyable part of the job was to be able to help customers and also my co-workers."
good,"Working here is great experience, everyone is goal oriented and hard driven but we still have our moments were we have fun together as a team. I learned supervisory experience which is very useful to me on my job search. The management team very responsible. In my opinion there wasn't a hard part to this job, I'm a fast learner so most things came easy. The most enjoyable part is striving for the best with the company and all my experience's that I'm going through."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,you can be rehired very easy.The staff very friendly and helpful.
good,Management keeps you on your toes. You have to ask every customer that comes through your line and ask them if they wantyed to save 15% for opening a Kohls Charge..That is the biggest thing!
good,Only downfall in this job choice was ambiguous job security.
good,Management is very flexible with working with availability for people in school or who have children.
good,I loved this job. It was the best job I've ever had. It didn't pay very well and I didn't get a lot of hours in the off season but it was such a great atmosphere.
good,"Working at Kohls was pleasant. It was a part time job so, I had time for college. The management were all nice to work with. I believe working at Kohls helped me grow thick skin. Customers are not always happy with some of the store policies therefore, you have to tend to the customers wants. I always had to remember that the customer knows best."
good,"This job is not for anyone who is not a people person, but very fulfilling and enjoyable."
good,"I many skills that deal with customer service. It taught me more on how to deal with disgruntled customers, and how to meet quotas."
good,"I absolutely loved this job because of the environment I walked in to everyday. Working in the jewelry department I did it all from merchandising to customer service, to organizing etc. I drove about 30 miles to work everyday but it was worth it because I formed a strong bond with many coworkers and loved the interaction with customers. Once I got in to my work and felt comfortable, I accomplished more then even required each day and had fun while doing it."
good,"A typical day at work begins with a start-up meeting to find what department you will be working in."
good,"Seasonal job for integrity staffing: Inventory, packegeing, stocking at Kohl's warhouse"
good,"I learned how to use a pallet jack and a scanner gun as well as loading and unloading trucks. I use to stack pallets on top of each other for most of the people working on the second floor around me when I would get done cleaning my staions because I am really strong and it was hard for some people. There was not really anything that was hard for me, im a really quick learner so it did not take me long to figure out what to do. I liked working there becaue it was hard work and I enjoy it."
good,"I liked working at kohls, i enjoyed working with the people there. i like talking an welcoming people so i did really good with the customers. i would help them out as much as i can. I went above and beyond for them."
good,keep the fitting rooms clean
good,When i unloaded the trucks i enjoyed it it was a fun place to work sometimes
good,I liked working at Khols. It's a nice place and the people are very friendly.
good,"The employees are fun to work with and the managers are fantastic. On a typical day, I usually clean up the fitting rooms, make sure everything is picked up off the floor, and help out at the cash register. I learned how to get along with everybody and how the customers should be treated. Another valuable lesson I learned was how to price tag items. I learned how to operate a cash register. The hardest part of the job was to maintain your good nature with a hateful customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I got to help customers whenever they need assistance."
good,"It was a good job , but if your a sales associate you have to climb your way to the top to get the desired hours u want beacuse your schedule looks different every week."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I started as a seasonal worker and became permanent. Great position to work the floor and in touch with customers. I enjoyed quantity counts and truck unloading.
good,"I worked for Kohls for 1 year and I enjoyed helping the customers and getting credit for the store. Most of my colleagues I got alone with.  My managers were nice to me,  they always ensure  me hours. The reason  why I left was because i was offered a full time position and I did not have a car to get there. But if I get an opportunity I would like to go back and work a couple of  hours a week."
good,"The employees and leadership team is extraordinary.  Every retail store has its share of good and challenging customers, Kohls is not different in this respect."
good,"I am a seasonal employee but I would stay, I like that I can work the hours I need to balance my home life, it's a lot walking and some times very busy,exspecially because I hired in for the holidays,but even my longest nights go by very quick."
good,"Kohls was amazing. I was a seasonal associate but it was amazing while I worked there. It was just always a nice time, everyone was nice and helpful, managers would make sure we were ok, they would also make sure that we were braked. Only downfall was you HAD to get credit cards, if you didn't in a certain amount of time they would coach you, and watch you to make sure you were asking everyone and if they did not have one that they you were selling and it shoving it down their throat every minute until they get mad, leave, or just apply. They were super flexible of schedules and if you got scheduled when you weren't available they would make sure they helped you get that shift covered and give you another to make up for hours. Also a downfall and good thing is wherever they want to put you is where you will be all the time, I was only ever on register. And if you were on the floor that would be the only place you'll be."
good,"Long  time  relationship with kohl’s as a most valuable customer, great customer service.... now I’m glad, I am a part of this great company (Kohl’s)..."
good,I loved how my manager was very understanding & flexible. My coworkers were very nice & we always worked as a team. We were a great team until it went under new management.
good,A fun easy job lots of college kids work here. But it’s a mixture. Gold watch someone destroy your fixture and fold again! Replenish your department and hide in the dressing room when you can !
good,Lots of benefits especially during the holiday season. Plenty of new staff coming in and out because of temporary seasonal positions and they allow different positions when available.
good,"Most days I ran a cash register and straightening up the cloths on different racks. Whenever I had a question there was always someone to answer them, if it was a fellow employee or a manager."
good,"Pretty easy and laid back."
good,Kohl's worked with my availability as I worked full time and was also taking classes at a university at the time. They were also aware of their employees' personal lives and that the employees needed time to spend away from work. The work was easy. Pretty straight forward after being trained on their software.
good,Great place to work!  Worked at corp for 20 yrs and had many great opportunities.  I would highly recommend working here given the chance.  Thank you.
good,"I loved working at Kohls. It was very rewarding during my time there. I worked to replish the store and find orders customers placed online and ship them out or set them behind customer service for customers to pick up later. Most of the employees and management were wonderful to work with. There was not much advancement though. I was able to be a holiday lead during the holidays one year though. Pay was horrible for the work I did, but the discounts were great and there were not any benefits for part time employees and it was hard to get scheduled hours after the holidays. But otherwise, I loved it very much."
good,"Kohls was a great place to work at.  From the dress code, to management to the hours. I enjoyed working here. Each day was always different. I would recommend to a friend."
good,"Good team to work with."
good,During the cold months it’s the best time to work there. Get trained in more areas and you’ll get more hours. Can dress nice. Not a hard system to learn. Managers were nice
good,"My hours were flexible. I  was told what areas to work in and left to do it. Sometimes you are moved from one position to another,  but I  like variety. You are kept busy. There is always something to be done . I liked dealing with customers.  Being a cashier was my least favorite thing."
good,kohl really sharpened my warehouse skills and really taught me most of everything I've known about warehouses. I really love the warehouse environment and could definitely could get use to that.
good,"I enjoyed working at kohls with the time that I was there, I was seasonal when I first started but after the holidays they hired me on as part-time and that really let me grow into the retail industry and I got to accept responsibilities I never thought I could do."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Nice big clean placeto work. Very cooland work isnt that much. Great people to work with & semi great supervisors. Paid time off. VTO available. PTO available as well
good,Kohl’s was a fun and fast paced place to work for.  Management was great and very helpful and easily approachable.  Definitely recommend this work experience
good,"It's okay to work there...sometimes not enough hours. If you are hired you will get a lot of hours at first, but after that, you really don't get a lot. The people that have been there gets all of those hours and you just kinda fill in. That was just my experience."
good,Loved working here so much. Thinking of re applying as a full timer associate instead of part time. Coworkers were amazing and the environment is just wonderful!
good,"Great company to work for, offering benefits and job advancement. Fast paced work environment and hands on training. Company offers a lot of incentives to their employees and has outstanding employee discounts."
good,"flexible hours and schedule, however some of the managers are hard to get along with they sure do over work you for minimum wage. Fun place to work in"
good,"Great place to work, especially if you're a first time worker or going to school. They start everyone out as a seasonal employee and if you work hard you get to stay. Alot of weekends and dealing with customers constantly. Coworkers are always friendly! But, pay is terrible."
good,"Its a great place for younger people to work but not as a career, I enjoyed it when worked there but standing in one place for a look long time I'd uncomfortable"
good,"Kohls is a great work place. It's fastpaste, productive, and discount benefits are great. Sales are amazing to shop and the coworkers and management make working there more pleasant. Kohls also gives back to the community."
good,"Good job, could use better pay for the standards they expect. Enviornment is friendly but i dont know much about the retail side. Working as loss prevention is fun and enjoyable."
good,"I liked the people I worked with they were almost like an extended family. "
good,Kohl’s is a great starter job for anyone who is a student or is just coming out of school. Flexible hours and works around school and day life. Very nice management.
good,"Okay place to work, but if you need more hours stay on top of them to give you more hours otherwise you'll never get them, you can pick up other peoples shifts though which is always nice but make sure a manager knows whos shift your taking and you write it down for your own records to make sure you're paid for it"
good,The environment and the job description made the time clocked in go by. The fact that it required brand knowledge as well as strategic communication skills was a good thing for me because I gained valuable experiences.
good,Kohl’s need to give employees more pay and more hours I loved working for kohl’s the management team is great and fun to work with. This company just needs to give more hours and better pay
good,Typical day consisted of showing up and doing your work and leaving. The manager was fine. Everything was fine. I don't like that I have to leave a review.
good,"The job was good, environment was good, and team members were always encouraging. The only down side was the pay was not enough for the amount of responsibility that was required."
good,Managers cut hours of those they aren’t close with so their favorite associates are able to get as many hours as they want. They also threaten your job if you call out sick.
good,"I worked at the Kohl's at The Loop is it was fine. It got busy in the evenings, and in the morning and afternoon there isn't much to do. Wish the pay was a little better. Coworkers were nice and management was okay. I worked here seasonal. The only annoying thing was picking up the phone is a customer had a questions on where an item was. They'll call the store and customer service directs the call to your department. They should have a better training system. It was a more of ""figure it out along as you go"" type of job. They also push you to sell their company credit card."
good,"I worked at Kohls in Oregon and it was one of the best work experiences I ever had. Then I moved to California and the managers there were unkind, demanding, rude and disrespectful to their employees. They pick and choose who to be kind to, then set up ways to trick their employees. They even gave everyone a raise early, not a raise biased on performance. The annual 'raise' only put everyone to the new minimum wage in California. So that employees of over 8 years were only making the same as someone who just started. "
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I really enjoyed my seasonal position at Kohl's. The pay was decent. Management was on point. Great coworkers.  I was hoping to be hired on fulltime after my seasonal assignment was over, but unfortunately they decided to not hire anyone in."
good,"Good place to work I was mad how long peak season lasted.  Good weekly pay, I was able to work as much as I liked during peak season.  Huge place to work, I've meet some good people there."
good,"I started there for seasonal work, I can say that it has been a nice experience, the work was not overload nor hard to comprehend, once i got the hang of it, I enjoyed it , Im still there,."
good,they will work you to the bone. they see that you have high numbers and keep pushing you to do better. which is fine but they should extend the same to all employees.
good,My review of the company is it was fun each year temporarily. It was amazing benefits and fun to work whatever hours I desired. Overtime was always an option
good,"Fun positive workplace environment"
good,At the specific location I have worked for the store was a bit disfunctional. There were people who constanly called out so they would put pressure on the employees that were there to pick up the slack. They almost never call the associates with few hours to see if they would like to work. Customers would complain about the store being unorganized or prices being placed incorrectly. The getting paid every week is great. The discounts are good as well. Somewhat friendly environment.
good,Fun environment. Loved working with the others. Huge discounts on family and friends days. Didn't want to leave but had to due to pregnancy/fiancee problems. Didnt really ever talk to higher ups unless there was a problem and I need help.
good,Working for Kohl’s is a great work environment from managers down to crew members everyone has great attitude and people are willing to help others . .
good,"I really like my job at Kohl's. I love meeting new people and helping the customers. It can get busy and crazy at times, but it's a lot of fun. It's a great place to work."
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work, it is usually not to stressful and it is very clear what is expected of you. You enjoy going to work and being able to interact with employees and customers."
good,The mangers are awesome and great they helped their employees encouragement by giving pizza on Fridays giving over time anyti.e.so.eone wanted.to work more.
good,"Very nice job, just not nice people. Wasn't trained properly, had to figure out things on my own. People had little cliques and would be mean. Not always organized . Free food some days. Proper breaks."
good,very fast paced workplace it had a lot of energy and everyone stayed on their feet we were always hiring new people because of the amount of business that we just kept on getting
good,I worked in the Jewelry Department.  It was a joy to sell jewelry.  The management was great.  The workplace culture was consumer friendly.  The hardest part of the job was standing for long periods of time.  The most enjoyable part of the job was customer satisfaction.
good,A typical day at work would be to work the cash register while asking customers if they were interested  in opening a Kohl's account and/or  opening a Yes to You Rewards Account.    I also worked the sales floor in the lingerie department assisting customers and getting the department in a presentable condition.
good,"good people to work for. "
good,"Start the night off with going to get the product that we had to put out for the following morning. Our team got the planogram and we set up the products in its correct place and placed and took down any sale signs that needed to be set up. We really didn't any have any management there at night shift it was just the shift leader who was just a title but just doing the same work as us. But for being a small team we would get the whole job done well before our shift ended, so we did more work that did need that extra push."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Improved my retail experience. Learned how to be a productive team player. Loved the interaction and smiles and the new people I got to meet on a daily basis
good,Good company to work for and some times slow .... They give you the opportunity to work and get hours . Not too many off days some times 8 and 10 hour shifts the bosses are nice people !
good,cool place to work nothing really to complain about left only because i had school and couldn't do both because it was too far  i would definitely recommend this to someone else
good,"A typical day for me can be a 4 hours shift if I am lucky an 7 hours shift.I have learned a lot about the inventory process, picking, packing and shipping customers orders. The management team is pretty great team to deal with, The hardest part of the job is insuring that the product is on the shelves at all time. The most enjoyable oart would me meeting new people on a daily basics."
good,"Loved the job was always doing something different every day, from cashier to freight to online orders. Just wish I could have been full time. Being part time they would work you 4 hr shifts unable to even get a 20 hour week."
good,"I was just there temporarily, but I thought that it was fun. I met a lot of nice employee's, and made some friends. I enjoyed the work that I did for them, which was putting clothing  away."
good,Productive and fun work place. With great discounts and even greater sales. Very friendly staff that will go over beyond to help any customer. And team work among the worker.
good,"I truly love working at KOHL'S, unfortunately, the hours are not as easy to obtain. If I had more hours I would stay put and no have to look for other employment or a 2nd job."
good,"Open cash register once arrived place cash and coins in the proper cylinders. Complete customers transaction using cash, check, and credit cards. Asked and shared information about the pluses of having a Kohl's credit card. At closing counting money with manager. Made sure area was clean. Managers were nice. They are really concerned about the numbers involving the amount of daily Kohl's credit card sign ups. A bit overboard to where your job depends on it. The hardest part was getting the customers to sign up for the Kohl's card. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the latest clothing."
good,"I enjoyed working at Kohl's and really appreciated their scheduling flexibility with my crazy availability. However, I think they could improve on how thorough their training is of associates considering there is such a high turnover."
good,"I enjoyed this job immensely. The co-workers were great, the hours good and the pay very reasonable. I didn't like working weekends because it wasn't as busy on Saturdays and Sundays but I loved the various job tasks I was assigned to do. I especially enjoyed working with Microsoft Excel."
good,Working for Kohl's was fun and competitive. If you sold rewards and credit you got more hours. E-3s verified from the best to pure ego. I did enjoy my time with Kohl's.
good,"Kohl's is a great job for people who are in school and need a part time job to pay off some bills. The only"
good,I really loved it. Was fast paced always running between customer service and cash register. I learned how to use a hand held radio to communicate with other employees and management. Some times there was very rude customers but I loved being able to help them smile and be happy with their experience at Kohl's.
good,My position was great until they dissolved it. The position had gone to an upper manager and then my hours then got cut in half.I tried to hang on but needed a full time job.
good,"This was a second part-time job while I was in school. It was not a career job. The atmosphere was fun, and enjoyable. The people I worked with were like family. I really loved what I did, but I could not do a career job and this job with a family and all."
good,There is always something new to learn. Enjoyed working with the customers and was able to stay busy. Hardest part of the job was working overnight for trucks.
good,"Kohl's taught me how to deal with racism face to face. It was a lot of racist customers that I had to face, but I survived it. There were some racist employees too. But I survived them. I was there to do a service as a cashier, & I was the best at what I did."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Great place to work,multi crossed trained , really enjoyed my manager at the time Blake he was awesome worked with employees to better advance them .If you are open to working both stations as I did hrs. go by quicker, you will also be offered to work jewelry ."
good,"Fast pace, around great people, get to help customers and brighten up their day. Hours are flexible they always change and always work with school schedule."
good,"I worked here for about a month and ahead during the Christmas season as a customer service associate. I would say it is a great place to work, and I enjoyed my short amount of time there. It was a little stressful at times because it would get really busy and sometimes people were rude, but for the most part it was a good job."
good,"Working at a department store was a lot of fun, but it is very fast paced with lots of deadlines that have to be met.  The store has fantastic products and is laid out well and easy to shop and work at.  I enjoyed working there very much."
good,"At the time it was a job, but after a while we all became family and still to this day are in touch. It was like a revolving door of managers. Very hard to get a chance to move up."
good,"unload truck for freight, put clothes out on the floor following floorset, greet customers. I learned customer service skills quickly. The most enjoyable part of working for kohls was engaging with customers and giving them 110% satisfactory!"
good,I liked giving good Customer service. I bagged merchandise. Helped Customers out to their cars. I also replenished the floor. I also restocked merchandise when needed.
good,Enjoyable job. Friendly co-workers. Everyone tries to help one another for the most part. Changing shifts in fairly easy. The dress code isn't too strict either
good,Nice place to go to with remodeling.  I didn't agree with the people working there.  The managers were too stricked.  There were nice items selling there.  Too much damage with people trying things on.
good,"Unloading the trucks and putting merchandise on the sales floor and"
good,"nice managers, work with schedules, fast paced environment, overall store cleanliness is great, you don't have enough working days only bad thing, associates are nice people"
good,"I enjoyed this place,  the people are great and the managers were always there to help you.  All of the workers got along great and it felt like a second home."
good,Kohl's is a fun place to work. Both customers and employees are nice and nice to be around. I only wish that the pay was better and benefits were offered.
good,"Company was great, they care about advancement, training you, and retraining you until you feel comfortable and confident.They did not micro-manage, but give you your assignment in the beginning of the day and hands off unless you needed supervision or had a question."
good,"Every day brings different tasks. I perform my duty at the requirement of my boss and other supervisors. I am easy going person so I work and flow with my colleagues. As an employee, i believe in union performance to help the company grow."
good,Everyone was easy going and made going to work fun. I always looked forward to it. I learned how to handle customers and have patience with people. The work was different everyday and allowed me to learn customer service and to think on my feet.
good,"A typical day was exhausting but yet productive. You feel as if you accomplished a lot. I learned on how to engage guests and learned more social skills, and how to deal with those who don't get what they want as well.  Management really did a good job with keeping everyone on the floor intact and on point. We had a daily goal and they were a big contribution on whether or not we got to it. The hardest part of the job was hat it got stressful at times due to not only the customers but the amount of the workload that came with it. I mainly enjoyed how social the job is. Most jobs your doing your job and on your own, but with this job you have people to talk to and there is something very satisfying about helping someone out. And you get that in retail a lot."
good,The management team and coworkers are very involved in making sure you're learning what you need to learn. It has a very comfortable environment and everyone is so friendly.
good,Working here on a typical day in Jewelry is a steady pace depending on the time of year it is. I lacked having a lot of stuff to do and there were times when I completed all my tasks and was out of ideas of what to do next.
good,"It isn't the highest paying job however, the culture from my location is you feel respected and appreciated.  I like the people I work with. Team environment for sure!"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I love working at Kohls. I am happy to say that Kohl's has taught me leaps and bounds since I've worked their twice. I am forever grateful to be a part of such a caring staff group and to be able to help customers find their purchases. It's a great way to learn about people, clothes which I love, and about psychology of life in general within a microcosm of a store that sells a wide variety of paraphernalia. I am so happy to say I work at Kohls."
good,"i worked at kohls in brewster ny for 11 years"
good,"I absolutely love working at Kohl's, unfortunately, the compensation does not match the work load."
good,"Day goes by quick"
good,kohls was a rewarding place to work. Friendly people and customers. Really easy to deal with very fun catchy music. Managers really understanding and nice. The most enjoyable part of the job was the departments i worked in i have a passion for beauty so that was great and register was fantastic during christmas time i loved seeing the customers happy purchasing christmas gifts.
good,"I enjoyed this job period, it was a great experience for me.  I learned how to sort, receive, pack, box and find orders. The pay every week was something I liked also, but sometimes the ten hour shifts were horrible.  Especially when I first started working."
good,The employees were fun to work with and got the job done. I am very satisfied with how the company was run. I would definitely refer this company to a friend.
good,Great place to work at for part timers. This job is very team oriented and the job is flexible with your availability. It's also a face paced job so expect to stay busy.
good,"the only negative was limited hours and not much opportunity for permanent status or advancement.  originally hired for the xmas holiday season to unload trucks and sort and classify merchandise. I was retained after the new year, but my hours were still limited, so had to search out other employment"
good,"1.Good environment"
good,Working with Plan-o grams helped to open the new store. Worked in Jewelry/cashier and other departments as needed.  Promoted to Supervisor of shoe department.
good,I love the staff they are awesome I wouldn't trade them for anything I hope to find a dental staff that works as hard and as well as they do in a team environment they are all hard workers and that is a grerat team
good,"Great work environment, everyone is friendly. The customers are lovely. Not enough hours, to get by. Management is fantastic."
good,"Wonderful working environment"
good,I love this company.  I learned so much in a short time.  The people and management are great
good,Loved my job.  Not much room for advancement.  I needed to move on.  Received a lot of knowledge working here.  I still see many of my former employees.  The hardest part of the job was the Holidays and how crazy it was.
good,"This job was great to work at, I like the continuous physical activity to do the job. The managers and supervisors were very team oriented and the best i worked with. Although, the pay and hours were horrible because I was only part time."
good,I enjoyed my time at Khols but retail is demanding work. Customer service does not come easy to me but i developed some great skill in communication at this job. It has helped me become a successful salesmen for my franchise business through College Pro Painters.
good,"I worked at Kohl's for the Christmas season 2013, and was very happy with it. I was trained in all departments."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management.

good,I really enjoyed working here! I like working with people! I wish I could have stayed longer!
good,Enjoyable place to work. Learned many things about retail and customer service.
good,A typical day starts with checking your assigned station for the day and then checking your recovery for your department. I have learned that  a good work ethic is always the way to live by. The hardest part of the job is on busy days like holidays and sale promotions departments are covered with much recovery and departments need much tidying up. The most enjoyable part is vacation time paid off and discounts.
good,"Greet customers, help them with what they maybe looking for."
good,Some days the truck need to be unload and we worked as a team to unload the truck and made sure that all inventory shipped to the store. We put the merchandise in the the proper place so that it could be unpacked and put on the floor or in storage until needed on the floor. Some days we worked on the floor to put merchandise out or helped customers to find merchandise and even at times cashiered and tendered money.
good,Learned great customer service skills and there was good career advancement. Great co-workers and good management team. Most enjoyable part of the job was the people you meet.
good,Writing & marketing items for the website on a daily basis.  Macro management helped productivity.  Co-workers are always positive.  Job security isn't there.  Contracts on a month to month basis.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers. Being patient with people will make your day and their day more efficient and enjoyable.
good,kohls is a great place to work. its friendly and they are always willing to show you new things. very well organized. you can always find what you need to complete your job.
good,"Good place to work wonderful place, I would go back anythime and hope they keep pushin"
good,"A typical day at work is usually fun and energetic."
good,"While in the process of moving from Indiantown, FL, I took a job at Kohl's with the knowledge that it was a PT job, although I was and am currently looking for a FT job. "
good,"I looked forward to going to work."
good,"I haven't worked at a job where the manager of the store was hands on. I applaud the management of Kohls at parmatown."
good,"Loved working at such a fast paced store and at Christmas time, at that!! Hard work with a huge pay off. Great employee discounts!"
good,"i am a part time flex associate, which my hours vary every week which really is unfortunate cause i need a good consistint job and its really competitive to get a full time job there they rarely have postings for them but overall pretty good place to work at some of the shipping manager is just terrible though. The people that have been there the longest seem to get away with murder"
good,I had alot of fun working here and it was very organized. I would push the shoes out and deal with alot of customers in customer service
good,"The management staff are open-minded, fair, and great at what they do. They perfom their jobsabove and beyond expeciation of a typical boss. A typical day at work is routinely above average. All of my co-workers are friendly and always willing to help others. There really is no hard part to this job, and for the most part everythng about this job is enjoyable."
good,"Typical day at work is I am always on my toes unloading trucks,stocking, merchandising and customer service."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"It's great working at Kohl's, the management is very helpful and the co-workers are friendly. They are good with working with school schedules and flexible with hours. They really recognize a good employee."
good,"The co workers were a good team to work with everyday. "
good,I loved my time with Kohls and I appreciate every chance I had within that organization.
good,Working in a somewhat comfortable environment with employees and manager. Uncomfortable with apprehensions and monitoring potential shoplifters.
good,I work with a lot of great people but its hard to balance life and work.
good,I would go in to work and update and maintain and print sale signs. We were on a schedule but it was easy for things to get mixed up and fall behind. I had to be on my toes and really pay attention to what i was doing so I could get it right the first time.  My co-workers were pretty friendly and so was the supervisor. 
good,"I worked for kohls for 3 years and I love the company. They take very good care of their employees. Unfortunately for me I transferred to the flint location and the management is very poor. There were a lot of favoritism, unfairness, no concern for employees and the store manager would come to work in a bad mood and be unapproachable more times than not. I didn't feel welcome nor appreciated and after 3 years with the company, I sadly stepped away from my job. "
good,i liked working here wish i never would of quite this job i was stupid for quiting.
good,Didn't like the way they gave my schedule to someone else without telling me and how they are only allowed to give you so many hours. Then you are not full time unless you are a manager or supervisor there which really sucks also.
good,"It was great to work there but I didn't like the pressure of having to sell credit cards. Meaning, we had to pressure or talk customers into getting the Kohls credit card. It might not have been spendy but it was dependable on your hours. I wasn't happy with that. If I wasn't able to get people to sign up my hours were less."
good,"Working at Kohl's was definitely a different experience. I worked with different people everyday and learned new things on a daily basis. Majority of my co-workers were pleasant, while others were a different story. I enjoyed working with the customers and being able to see happy faces when they left."
good,I love that work always had a great vibe it was a great place to work.
good,"Kohl's, Secaucus, NJ"
good,"A typical day at work would be deal with about 75- 90 customers a day. I do a variety of returns, even exchanges, deal with customer complaints, and I also answer phones."
good,"Kohls is a company that understands customers and employees needs and wants. This company try to help others not spend too much of there money with in coupons and big sales. I really like making the customers and team members happy here. Only problem is im not geting enough hours here, because they hire too many people here. I really think they should consider giving others that take this job serious a chance."
good,"a typical day at work consisted of putting merchandise on the floor, assisting customers finding items or on the register, relocating merchandise and back stocking extra merchandise. the most enjoyable part of the job was knowing your effort was acknowledged and appreciated by the customers and management."
good,at my store i had amazing management and great co-workers it was like we were our own little family there
good,"love helping customers and providing great service to all of the customers,kohls is a great company to work for."
good,"everyone there is friendly, i loved helping the customers. also loved being organized in the different department and dressing rooms."
good,i enjoyed working here. it was something new. The co-workers was easy to get along with and the managmet team was great. There was room to grow with Kohl's.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Clean and maintain shoes department appearance. Stock shelves with Shoes. Handle cash sales preform additional task as required
good,"My typical day starts with greeting the customers. My duties at te shoe department are, making sure the shells are full up and sizes. Evertime I cme towork at least 2 hours as backup at regisers. The most enjoyable think about my job is meeting people ever day."
good,I love this job. You can work independently and the management isn't always on your case as long as your doing your job. Flexible scheduling makes it easy to balance life and work. Customers can be the hardest part but it is also what makes the job interesting. I have learned how to be patient and how to work with others and on my own.
good,"I loved working at Kohls, however their management seemed disconnected and disorganized."
good,"I enjoy working with the people that I do. I am able to help coordinate the front floor to make sure that things get done. The management has been questionable lately. I am just needing to get a break from this place. Overall, I have enjoyed my time here with the other associates I have meet there."
good,Room for growth but stressful work place. Coworkers are far and wide so you are bound to have conflict.
good,"i really enjoyed working at Kohl's because the people that i worked with were fun and easy-going and kind. My managers were funny and nice . A typical day at work would be cleaning the fitting rooms and putting away the clothes, along with helping the customer find what she needed."
good,"operating the cash register, receiving and disbursing money as will as recording the totals of transaction. Processing customers returns and exchange, taking credit cards, checks for purchases and provide excellent customer services, answering customers questions and maintaining a clean and orderly check out area. From the time i was there the co-workers was nice."
good,Fun and high energy fast paced work around the holidays. Seasonal Only. Also get a discount on everything in the store!
good,"Fast paced job.  Great customer service skills necessary for Sales Associate position.   Ability to communicate effectively with Customers, Superiors, and Co-Workers.   Attention to details needed."
good,It's a great paying job and environment although it's so many long hours you have no time for yourself just work and some people dont seem to appreciate all people do for this company
good,Great teamwork and support from managements   They were very flexible with scheduling. The only bad thing is that a lot of people call in or are no call no shows which puts everyone in a bind
good,"Our managers are wonderful. They check on you to see how you’re doing throughout the day. We work as a team, not individually. I always offer to help, and receive help comes in a timely manner. "
good,"Great job just had RI quit for health reasins managers was great I had a good time unload truck put stuff from truck up great employees,everybody got along well,very friendly, everyone looked out for eachother,all ways got our work doe"
good,"I really like working here. Let's me make my own schedule, everyone I work with is great, and is relaxed fast paced. Management was great. Thanks Kohls!"
good,"Was only offered part time work, but allowed me to work another part time job. I was able to learn different positions. If there were more hours available to work, I was offered them. Great management and very flexible work schedule. A diverse workplace culture. Company was always offering catered lunches and dinners. I loved my job @ Roseville, CA."
good,I began to work there because I needed the money to help pay for my gymnastics and phone bill. Overall the people I worked with were amazing and very kind.
good,"I enjoyed both the people I worked with and the work environment. Also, great savings on items purchased with employee discount that could be used along with their other promotional discounts."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I was always working on something and always had other things to do."
good,"Kohl’s was a very positive and uplifting experience for me, it taught many skills from customer satisfaction while under pressure, to communication with coworkers to complete a task, among many others."
good,"I enjoyed working at Kohls. Everyone from management to staff where all welcoming. Majority of staff is part time, it is s fast paced working environment. Good benefits and discount offered. I had to take a medical leave because I became ill, but even then they were very accommodating and helpful. Hoping to"
good,Would recommend  this job to anyone love managment  very nice staff will work around your schedule  needs very relaxed place to work you come in do your job and go home always doing some contest or bringing food in on all holidays just a great place to work I have np complaints except maybe more pay
good,"I love assisting customers. The other employees seem friendly. Co workers are all very pleasant. The managers are great and help and support me in everyway they can. I hope to be promoted because the core values here stand true. I have worked on and off as both a part time, full time and seasonal employee since 1999 at their stores. Flexable schedules, and a great level of understanding the importance of what, both the customer, and employees need to make it a successful store!"
good,"I loved my time at Kohl's, though it was a holiday seasonal hire. I loved my coworkers and my customers. Great working and shopping environment. I wish I could work there again!"
good,"I loved working at Kohl’s it feels like a huge family and honestly I would stay there longer except for the fact that you can’t really “move up” very much and also you are kind of under paid for how much you actually end up doing in the long run...I am able and asked to do up to 5 other people jobs, due to the fact that the people they hire don’t show up or they don’t schedule the right amount of people, but other than just the organization side, Kohl’s has such an inviting atmosphere and I just wish that they really listen to their employees."
good,Micro management prohibits positive input or suggestions that could be given. Slaveship atmosphere. Communication is bleek which enables errors or incomplete tasks. The trust level is blur.
good,"I worked in The Enfield, CT store.  The staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  I enjoyed my time at Kohls.  I am planning on going back for the season"
good,"I've worked at Kohl's for three years, and I've grown immensely. I started as a sales associate working specifically on the floor in women's, men's and junior's clothing. Opening the store I check customer service recovery and try to put away as much recovery as I can before traffic in the store increases. Fitting rooms are a priority over folding the floor when theres lot's of customers. When there's about two hours left until closing, fitting rooms become less occupied and it's time to work on folding clothing on the floor. Usually I am placed in one area, but sometimes I'm doubled up on mens and juniors, or even all three. It can be hectic trying to get stuff done because I'm trained in so many areas and often get pulled from my position to complete other tasks. One of these that happens the most is working registers to get customers out the door as fast as possible while also encouraging credit and reward sign-ups. Through the years associates have been forced to be able to work in multiple departments as opposed to hiring one person to fulfill a position. I am trained to complete OMNI and BOPUS orders, back-stocking merchandise, purging merchandise from the stockroom, freight merchandising, and working at the customer service desk. "
good,"I started as a seasonal cashier and now part time cashier and customer service. My store has excellent management. We all get along and work as a team. The customers are nice for the most part. When they complain do what you can to make them happy or call a manager to handle. "
good,"Unfortunately now, the location is closed. But it was a great five years that allowed me to meet various people. There were some managers who were tough to get around because of their nature and the favoritism they provided to their selected people."
good,The culture was friendly and clean. Parking lot was well kept. The food in the cafe was good. The meetings were interesting and they gave out prizes for meeting standards.
good,"When I worked there, we had an awesome boss and management staff. I loved working there. Just didnt make enough money to support myself and family.  It was just a temporary job for me."
good,"I worked here before I had a child, which was a good thing. If you have children, they want to work you all these long, crazy hours, which makes it hard to be there for your family."
good,"Kohl’s was average when came to comparison of other retailers, however, they offered amazing discounts, flexibility, and were kind. Most of the managers wanted the employees to succeed. Kohl’s was great."
good,"The Supervisors were very helpful & kind , all around the employees were very nice and helpful as well.... I can honestly say I have no Bad experience ,  I caught on fast to my position and I loved It.. if i could go back to employment I definitely would...Just when season is over its not enough hours and pay rate was low... This job was great for a temporary or seasonal position..."
good,Knowledgeable management team is highly recommended with two college degree for the supervisor position upward. that will productivity more effective and human related environment to work.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I only worked there for a few months, everyone was really nice and helpful to the new hires. Wish I could have worked there longer, but needed something with more set hours and more than 20 hours a week. Management was great."
good,"My overall experience at Kohl's was great. I love working for my store (1094). My coworkers were absolutely amazing. And so were the managers. It was a real family. I only wish we were paid more. 9.09 an hour is practically gas money. You cannot make a living off of that salary. And it sucks when you love your job, but aren't compensated enough for all of your hard work."
good,"I enjoyed my co workers and managers.  I worked in online order"
good,"The experience I received from this store was amazing for a first time job. The people I worked with and my store managers were helpful and understanding people, I'd definitely be willing to go back. However, I feel like there's no chance of recognition through anything but credits, and that's very competitive on it's owner and even harder for floor workers."
good,Management can be rocky with the “yes we can” policy. Certain departments lack communication. I felt unappreciated at times for all the work I put in.
good,loved everyone I works with. great friendly place. everyone was nice and very outgoing. all HR managers were great and very understanding if anything happened.
good,"Everyone was nice and caring. Communication was nice, I enjoyed working there. Nice hours and very flexible. Management was strict but helpful. I had no problems while working there"
good,"I loved my job here. Just hard to bite your tounge when customers cuss you like a salor when you was polite to them, smiled and asked if they found everything okay. Not all customers are this way, but the few that are will ruin your whole day."
good,"For general labor, this job is a nice experience. Managers and co-workers are great people. Time also fly pretty fast in this warehouse, If you are into general labor i highly recommend it."
good,Good entry level job for some one in high school or college or some one needing part time work . Not stressful. Its nice to to work inside an air conditioned and heated building
good,"Although i was there a short period of time ,just seasonal,it was a great place to work. The managers were great,so was the co-workers.The hardest part was having to leave .Being able to help out the customers was the best."
good,It's a good company just not my style personally not for me I like more hand on work and labor work firs me more than retail it's a good place and j would recommend ut.
good,"The job is great for college students who are looking for a flexible part time job.  i would recommend for people to apply doing seasonal time. Also, the work isnt hard to do."
good,"I only worked there temporarily, but I liked the management there.  I helped out a lot there and it was fun. I liked working in the childrens dept  and accessories"
good,"Overall, it's one of the best places to work, I would recommend it to anyone who's friendly and can handle teamwork. The only downside is the fact that they're always telling you to open credit accounts and it gets annoying. But the employee discount is amazing and the break room is also amazing. Most managers are extremely friendly and you can talk to them about absolutely anything, everyone is like a family."
good,Theres always work to be done and the pressure of your supervisiors to get credit. I loved the people who work there. Can not explain how hard it is to find work w lovable people.
good,I loved working here in college. Hours are flexible. The atmosphere was pretty relaxed but was fast paced. Met many of my friends while I worked there.
good,Great work environment and good people work at this location. I would recommend working here to gain experience with how to work out problems and come up with solutions for customers.
good,competitive well balanced I loved this job but they did not pay enough for what you are expected to do the management team was very involved with there employees
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I love working here but it’s not much room to grow if you are looking to become a manager one day. The pay is decent, $9 to start with no experience. The management is decent."
good,"It was a Nice work environment, Quick pace and Well Paid. I would have loved to work there longer , Long Lunches and Great Employees. I enjoyed it .!!"
good,"Part-time employment, very low wages, no benefits, no overtime, hard to move up, management is great, culture is good. High employee turnover. Flexible schedules"
good,"Nice store with good prices, great selections and plenty of parking spaces. For every $50 purchased, they are giving you the $15 Kohl’s cash now. You can also find the extra saving coupon in their web site during this holidays. Staffs here are super friendly."
good,"My most favorite Job ever! Great people, Great place to work! "
good,Be respectful and patient with customers. Always be professional. Be productive and ready for anything in customer service. Be flexible with your work schedule.
good,"I loved everything about my job, but there is no room for advancement so I needed to leave. I have great relationships with everyone there and genuinely enjoyed helping customers."
good,My time spent at Kohl's was well spent all the employees were very cheerful but the bosses could be hard to talk to you at times. No matter how hard I worked I always felt that I never met their expectations. Over all my time spent at Kohl's was a good learning experience.
good,The work was fast paced but fun and rewarding. The supervisors were the best. The people that work there are so nice and helpful. The customers were basically nice.
good,"I really don’t have anything bad to say about Kohls except not enough hours and pay, l loved working there and would have stayed if I was given more hours and more money."
good,"most of the time i worked at customer service"
good,"I was an early morning stocker helping add inventory to the shelves in all departments. I assisted customers with any questions on pricing, availability, and location."
good,Great team to work with always busy have a lot of fun but keep it professional. management are awesome we are all like one big family a lot of respect
good,It was extremely fun to work with all those amazing people with colorful personas. Everyone there was so nice and they taught me a lot considering it was my first time ever working. They were nice and kind and always understanding.
good,I enjoy working with the customers and helping associates. The management team has always been exceptional. I was a top performer so I get to choose my hours and days I work. Work hard and you will be rewarded.
good,"Nice friendly environment professional managers worked from Black Friday till January, friends and family program flexible schedule was a great plus to working there."
good,"working overnight has its rewards and disadvantages its fast pace but take a little time to get used to and learn ,You get hour breaks but not all the time and the break room is not bad either."
good,Great company able to show growth. Able to become in high positions. Able to help each other. Freight Team was department to work for. Very Team Oriented
good,I liked working there.  They were fair and reasonable and flexible.  Their training was good.  I was able to work in several different departments.  Overall it was positive.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Everyone is nice and there is room for growth, however the hardest part of the job was working hard and maintaining perfect attendance. I enjoyed working there because the environment was friendly and people motivate you to be the best and are acknowledges employee's work ethics."
good,"The management is great and is very understanding. If you need to call off they understand and if you want more hours, they try their best to schedule you in. Incentives for credit applications and store surveys. Great employees discount."
good,"Pay was horrible and full-time jobs were hard to come by. Coworkers were great and made the day go fast. Had early morning shift, so was usually done by noon."
good,I enjoyed working at Kohls.  The discounts and flexible hours were a plus.  They had lots of incentives for their employees and made the job fun! Recovery wasn't always fun
good,"This was a seasonal position, I basically did it for Christmas money. I worked a lot of hours for about three weeks then it slowed down, but the money was great!"
good,"Definitly something you wouldnt want to go with long term. How ever work here isnt too bad untill you get to the holidays. Im hardly ever scheduled to come in, so i dont get paid much"
good,"My position at Kohl's is your 'Point of Sale' representative, that means I am the person that see when you are ready to check out. I learned how to be patient with people and how to communicate in different ways. The local management is fantastic, they treat everyone as if they are their friends. The work place is great to, of course I have days where I struggle of getting the motivation to go to work. Other then that I do not dread on going to work everyday. The hardest part of the day is when it gets very busy (around thanksgiving and christmas) and there is a long line of customers and you do not want to get upset at you. The best part about the job is the customers for the most part they are so kind and great and are really understanding."
good,"I love working for Kohls and I appreciate the opportunity to grow with the company and as a person. I intend on staying with Kohls for the long haul, if they'll have me."
good,"Management is very professional and staff friendly when training, full of patience and works with new employees. Easy to pick up cashier and training."
good,I enjoyed working there when I wasn't closing alone. However the team were all very helpful and management made sure everyone was comfortable as well as getting their jobs done too.
good,Kohl's is a very fun and exciting place to work. Holidays can be tough in retail but Kohl's management made you feel valued and appreciated. They were very flexible with hours.
good,"Always changing wall faces to promote new products, management was excellent to work with, customers were friendly, overall a nice place to work and friendly"
good,Great company to work for. Great upper leadership. Hard work/life balance and long hours. Lot to manage and multiple projects at one time. Company is very progressive and proud to work for.
good,i worked there when i was very young and enjoyed it till i started school then i didnt have time for a job. the staff was enjoyable and i really liked my manager
good,Great company excessive with coupons and promotions repetitive.  Same prices they just change the name of sale.  Company promotes community service and gives lots of donations.  Need to decide on site layouts trying too. Many things large sites to micro sites.  Should have figured out by now what works
good,Kohls has flexible hours/ there managers are amazing / awesome break rooms with snack machines and soda machines / free coffee / if you have a disability they are really sympathetic.
good,"It was a fun, relaxed environment with great managers and a timely schedule. You were always given a list of responsibilities and expected to finish them. The hardest part id the weird hours and always working holidays."
good,kohls was a fast paced fun place to work. you worked side by side with the management and where always appreciated. the time spent working seemed to fly by.no question was a dumb question and the management was always happy to hear a suggestion of doing something more efficiently
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I enjoyed my years here, getting to meet new people and different cultures. This company is a great company to work for, the president of the company actually interacts with his associates."
good,"Kohl's is a pretty fun place to work at. If you love shopping and if you love helping people shop and find what they are looking for by providing customer service, this is the place for you. As long as you work hard, you will always keep your job."
good,What I learned from working at kohls is that you have to be able to multitask at all times.  You never know where you are going to be working each day.
good,"Working for Kohl's is a great experience. Sometimes being on the registers can be difficult. Each guest is different, some can be difficult. Keeping your patience is not easy some days but can be managed. Management can be helpful when available."
good,Didn't give as much time to put racks and fold clothes. Had other peers and I take down all the folded clothes and refold it the way they wanted us too and didn't let us go on break until all the clothes were folded.
good,"I received a decent amount of hours as a part timer. Only sometimes when other employee's didn't clock in on time to relieve me did I have to stay longer then what I was scheduled for. That happened frequently with only one of the associates they would schedule to relieve me. Other then that I was fine with every once in a while being asked to come in early or stay a little later if they needed extra help on the registers. It can be demanding on heavy customer flow days but it's also a job that gives you plenty to do on slower days. In these cases you end up switching gears with work flow, multitasking, and sometimes assisting other associates if need be. The atmosphere is pleasant though working with such friendly people. The managers at the store are very personable and do try their best to make it clear about any new changes happening in the store. Every once in a while I was caught off guard by the system having issues but we worked through them. Pretty decent break times and the break room area has with a TV, microwaves, refrigerators, and sink."
good,Enjoyed my time at Kohl's and was a place where you could be your own boss. Enjoyed the people I worked with and strongly believed in what I was selling; which made it better/easier for me to sell.
good,On a typical work day I would come in about 15-20 minutes early. Then I would clock in and walk down to register. During the typical day we would have a goal to meet which is to enroll 2 cards a day from customers. I would normally met and excel the standards. The hardest part about my day is meeting those standards but I feel like it is an awesome feeling when I do and to push myself to excel. What I enjoy is working with others as well and interacting with the customers.
good,"The jobs they give are pretty easy, they don't over work you. The management is great and willing to help as much as possible. Its a great environment and the people that work there are helpful and make the work go by much easier."
good,Kohls was a great place to work. Only down fall was the pay wasn't enough. Loved the management team and felt like family!! I definitely have made friends for life!
good,"Love working at Kohl's. The managers at my store ALWAYS worked around my schedule for college. My coworkers were also amazing.  I got to meet a lot of really great people. There are fun days like denim days,where we can wear jeans or sports day, where we wear our favorite sports team gear. Trust me there are days where the job "
good,"A typical day at work were pretty good. During the holidays the work day got hectic but manageable. I learned how to multitask and it helped me with my people skills and taught me how to talk to people while on the job. The work culture was that of a family, in being everyone helped everyone and you could always ask for help. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet and converse with everyday."
good,"The coworkers are very fun and open. The managers are also very open minded and seem to be flexible. If you have anxiety or another mental health issue that hinders you from working properly, they are understanding and cut your hours down a bit. It does get busy but what semi high end store doesn't? They sometimes don't schedule enough people to work unfortunately but somehow always manage. Very good training and understanding of slow learners."
good,I enjoyed working for Kohl's for 4 years as a second job. The management was amazing and always building moral and rewarding associates with recognition on their accomplishments.
good,Kohl's is a great place to work. It has good benefits for employees and manageres. Each week there's activities for emplyees such as bowling. Someday it's busy and somedays it's slow at work.
good,"Amazing place to work, management is amazing, and the coworkers treat you politely and like family. Only downside is that customers has a ""I want it now"" mentality."
good,"The only problem that I had was the mangers was inconsiderate of personal life's, such as school, during the time I was working there i was in high school and they had me scheduled to work till 12:30am on school nights."
good,"I love the atmosphere, the customers, the employees were a pleasure to work with. Management were a pleasure, easy to talk to, straightforward and answered any questions or concerns I had."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Employees are treated with respect and like family."
good,"A Good job for people looking for a sustainable payment with available working hours at times managers could have shown better leadership. This would deminsh the departments production and morale, and lead to associates leaving the company"
good,"Cash Office"
good,"great work environment and very fun"
good,Kohls Department store really taught how to be a better supervisor and the company overall set the tone for my passion for customer service and how to service the customer.
good,Staff is friendly and willing to work with your school schedule.  Great work life balance. The management is willing to train and staff in different areas to expand knowledge of merchandising.
good,"On a typical day,I would do just about every job in the store is need be. I learned that the more versatile I was the more responsibility i was given. Our management team was good at maintaining good moral. Teamwork is the root of the workplace culture and is responsible for the positive work environment. The hardest part of the job is not being able to complete a project, and most enjoyable part is the interactions with the customers"
good,Loved my position and all of the people I got to meet while I was working there. Nice environment as well as most people. An overall good place to work.
good,IF you are looking for a company that promotes from within and values your opinion then this is a company worth looking into.
good,I enjoyed working at kohl's. I would have stayed there if there was more job opportunity. Great work atmosphere to work the managers were very sweet and kind.
good,I love the customers it was such a fun Environment new people And making customers happy. The staff and the managers were all so nice never experienced a bad day there and I wouldn't mindworking for them again
good,"Everyone was helpful and friendly.  I was treated as an equal, both with the permanent employees and the temps.  None of the jobs were hard, and the supervisors were pleasant.  I was usually an equipment operator.  I retrieved orders, or put incoming products on the shelves."
good,Great for people persons and great first job or part time job. Dislike the variety of hours. Pay needs to be alot better. Paying people for what they are worth and the jobs they do need to be put into consideration
good,Kohls corporation gave me the opportunity to start my new work experience in sales and it was great. managers were very helpful and understanding and coworkers became as a family. everybody works to achieve the stores goals with great experience for the customers and fellow coworkers.
good,"New Milford, CT Kohl's is a great place to work. Although the hours are extremely unreliable - You could have a week with almost forty hours and then the next week with eleven and a half hours- it would still be a great place to work. The associates are all so friendly and the management is great as well! They are for the most part understanding and willing to work with you for many things. You never stay in one spot for long!"
good,"Working at Kohl's in Vincennes, IN was one of my favorites. All associates were like a close knit family. Even after I left, I have kept in contact with some of them. Some of the best and worst of my work experiences have come from Kohl's. They taught me almost everything I know in Sales, building displays, and merchandising. Working here tested my limits, especially on freight/truck days, and showed me the I could push on and keep moving and work harder."
good,"A typical day as a jewelry associate was fun, always busy and moving. You can learn quite a bit of gems and product information while working the counter, and how to efficiently handle guests and product. Handling both at once was, I admit, difficult at times, but I got through it all nonetheless. I liked a few of the managers, but there was one I had to work with that simply wasn't having any cooperation with our teams. I believe she had favourites and such, but I digress. I wildly enjoyed my time at Kohl's simply because of helping people in person, and the incredible coworkers I had by my side."
good,"Clock and Log in at work computer, morning meeting to start the day off,discuss goals and updates."
good,"Working with customers is a daily challenge with new questions everyday. I've learned that putting customers first will not only help them quick and easily, but it also makes their day a little bit better. Management wise, the supervisors are always there if anyone has questions or needs help. The co-workers all work as a team and understand hardships to help out when others need it. I enjoy doing volunteer events to donate money for fundraisers and other institutions."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Management and staff is amazing! Even when we're busy its still fun to work. I love the face to face interactions with the customers.
good,"Always something to do where I am on my feet, and able to enjoy work with my coworkers and managers. There was nothing wrong with how the system worked."
good,I truly enjoyed working for this company. The general manager was around a lot and he was very helpful. Unlike other companies this company provided events regularly to lighten the workload.
good,Many work days were great although some were a bit unsatisfying. My co-workers were very friendly and outgoing even when the work and customers were tough and most supervisors/managers were fair and nice.
good,This is a seasonal position. Very different than working in a corporate setting.  Interesting working with many different people each shift.  Its a new teambuilding experience for me.  Everyone is very helpful to each other.
good,On Fridays we were able to dress up. It was interesting to see what people came up with.This brought out the fun side of work. Knowing that you can have this type of fun at work made me look forward to coming to work on Fridays.
good,"Stand at the cash register while chasing customers out as they join the line to pay for all their merchandise that they would like to buy in the form of cash, check, or credit card. Quickly scan and bag every item they place on the counter while being friendly and accurate. Use a paging system for page for any form of assistance when needed."
good,"Kohls is fast paced and fun, keeps you busy for the length of your shift. I unload the truck and you dont stop moving. I like work that keeps me busy and moving. I work under one of the best groups of management I have ever had the pleasure of working with. They are kind, they listen to you, value your opinion and want you to succeed."
good,Great environment to work in and the ability to bond with other associates and management made it very enjoyable to work there. Also the opportunities given to show what you were able to do in case of advancement were great.
good,coworkers and managers were amazing but advancement was hard to come by. my hardest part during this job was trying to keep my associates after they were offended by another manager
good,"Pretty steady environment. I worked through the fall and winter of 2014 through 2015. I was pregnant so the hardest part of the job was walking around the store since it's pretty vast. I however didn't mind it too much, it was an easy going job for someone in my condition."
good,"Definitely favorites and special treatment between the managers and also the associates. I learned a lot about recovering properly and effectively. My co-workers were okay but you don't always have to interact with them, you can do your own thing. The hardest part of the job is to count on the shift before you to do their job properly and effectively so that you won't be behind."
good,Helping customers was a number 1 for me. I was really able to advance with this company cause I was the head. Management was Pleased and they let you know how good you are. Co-workers really enjoy what you do for them. Hardest part was not being able to keep up when a co worker didn't make it in. I really enjoyed being here cause everyone appreciated what you did.
good,"Great and friendly atmosphere. If you like working with the public, this is a perfect job. The employees are so friendly and willing to help you at anytime."
good,It is wonderful that you get the opportunity to work in an environment where the managers are always willing to help the associate when they do not understand something.
good,I loved my time at Kohls. The team that I was able to assemble was just like family. With that being said everyone checked their egos at the door and we all came in and worked like an well oiled machine. It was such an awesome experience and a pleasure to work with such an amazing team.
good,I enjoyed working with customers and being around customers. I liked working for this company but i just needed more hours.
good,"Worked the registers,"
good,"management is awesome, good people to work with.  3rd shift supervisors and OMs are great.  Hardest part is working a full time job and full time school."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I loved my job because I was able to help people and work with clothing. I love to work on a register but have loved working on the floor. There is a new manager at the Orem Kohl's and she has made it so that I don't feel good and happy at work anymore. No matter how hard I work, I never feel good enough. I always put 110% into my work."
good,Everyone one on the management team treat people with respect its a great place to work for
good,they had great help for workers. We were trained to provide excellent customer service to our customers
good,"Cashier, & customer satisfaction at all times.. Helping my co-workers make sales and helping with returns..Also, I sign up new customers for  store credit cards. We get bonuses for each one you sign up..."
good,"Cashier greeted customer with a big smile and asked if they found every thing they needed. Asked customer if they had a Kohls charge and if not, ask if they would like to open one. I would ask if they had a Kohls rewards card or any discounts that needs to be used.  Then I would ring up their  items. put them in a bag and thank them for shopping at kohls. Then i would tell them to have a wonderful day or night depending on what time of day.    I also unloaded trucks of store merchandise. I worked very well with all my co-workers. The hardest part of job was getting people to sign up for the Kohls charge. The part i really liked about job was greeting customers."
good,A typical day at work depended on the day of the week. Weekdays were usually calm and slow but weekends were very busy days. All managers were very nice and always listened to their workers.
good,"A typical day at work would be helping customers, and doing the same routine, assist customers, organize different departments, reshop, and also clean up the dressing rooms. I learned a lot from Kohl's, they showed me how to be professional, how to talk to customers and how to assist the customers."
good,"Everyday was different, and always doing something productive (Unload & load trucks, Merchandise, Stock, and Customer Service).   I learned how to work as a team member in a quick but safely manner. Management was tight; a lot to get done (schedule). Every co-worker has different assignments to get done in time. The hardest part of the job... None. As long as your following directions and staying on tasks you'll do fine. Just don't slack off, or the assignments will stack up on you. The most enjoyable part of the job was... No matter how tiring or amount of assignments you have/had. You and your co-workers can make it fun. Fun working environment."
good,I enjoyed working here because everyday there was a new contest being held for the shift you work. I won a few times on how many customers would signed up Kohls Credit card and email. I enjoying helping out the elders find different things. Meeting new customers each day.
good,"A typical day at work is always busy and fast paced. Which I love. There are many new procedures that happen each day to keep up with other retailers, so not a dull day, any day. Learning new technology, and putting it in place. Management is on hand and willing to listen and implement the new ideas. My co-workers are the best. We are like family and  the respect we have for each other makes it easier to do our best every day. The hardest part of this job would probably be the return policy, because we take back anything for any reason without a return date; meaning 5, 10, 15 years...we will return it, and sometimes I feel customers abuse this policy. I really love the challenges and the unique situations I am involved with on a daily basis. Making a customer leave with smile on their face makes my day."
good,"Great Co-workers"
good,"Employees get along well together,  They are very flexible with you on your schedule. Great place to work for some extra money."
good,Cashiering in a timely but friendly manner. Up-selling credit apps. was really the hardest part of my job.
good,"I really liked working there, I got along well with management and I loved getting to set up displays and doing floorsets."
good,"I worked the weekend shift as a seasonal picker/packer for the warehouse and I absolutely LOVED IT!!  It was an experience that I would definitely do again! The hours were perfect, I could still work during the week and then come here to work the overnight weekend shift. And since I worked the overnight shift, I was paid for the one hour lunch that I was required to take, that made a total of 33 hours in 3 days!"
good,I would like to continue to work for the company. It was great for the short time it was a real learning experince. The hardest part was the plant was so big it was alot of walking. A day at Kohls was easy the work wasnt hard and my supervisors worked as well as there co-workers.
good,Great and friendly staff members. Great job esp. if you love overtime.
good,Management was ideal. Nobody stressed at the job. This is another place that I would go back and work at.
good,"I worked Loss Prevention, so I protected the stores assets and people I ran 42 cameras on a daily basis, and handled anything from theft internally and externally, to customer accidents. I maintained the store's shortages on a daily basis, and teamed up with management on a frequent basis. The hardest part of my job was always ensuring I was making not only a good decision, but the best decision based off of my team and the situation. The most enjoyable part of my job was the excitement whenever I caught someone stealing."
good,"I was responsible for my department and alot of time other departments as well. I got along with everyone and we had a lot of managers. I would stock, cashier, do money drops, help people when they were upset. The most enjoyable part of my job was making my customers happy. The hardest part was getting the store ready for audit. I just want to be in customer service because I miss solving their problems and making them happy. Thank for this chance....Stephanie"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Unloading freight, co-workers were very helpful. It is a fast paced environment. I enjoyed finding new fashions."
good,"Everyday was a good day to me,I was able to meet and greet alot of different people.I remember a young lady needed a in-particular item in the womens section, man was that a crazy day.I mean we were searching high and low, left and right. It was a very good experience for me,pretty much showing myself how far i would go to make my customer happy.What i learned about being there is treating people with kindness which will lead you in a right positive direction,opening doors to a alot of opportunities. Management was very nice,just me to come on time everyday,smile and greet all the customers. My co-workers were very hands on with me when i first started working,to me very balanced. The hardest part i feel was leaving at the end of the night.I felt like working there was getting me away from the world for a while. Best part of working there is preparing for christmas shopping!!!!"
good,"typical day at work would consist of cleaning out the fitting rooms. organizing clothes back to its original place, assisting customers to help find what they are looking for. answering Loss prevention calls to help catch thieves. also being available to help out the cashiers at registers if and when it was busy. I learned communication skills among my peers as well as with customers. I also learned a little about fashion. the hardest part would be for me following the customers around that loss prevention would ask to keep a look out. its uncomfortable and I felt I was invading their space. the most enjoyable part of my job would have been helping the customers find out outfits for their special occasions."
good,"mangers didn't understand employees concerns"
good,I get to work at 7:45am i punch in and then i do a jewelry count once iam done i start counting in cash and the day begins .The associate comes in at 8am and i start her on a project and then i start taken care of customer some time the managers  will try and throw projects on you that don't have any thing to do with your department you just do as they ask because that can be a test
good,"I enjoyed working with everyone we were team players, we made sure we helped each other out"
good,"I learned how to be independent while working at Kohl's."
good,"•	Determine charges for services requested, collect deposits or payments, or arrange for billing."
good,"My typical day would be to open or close the store. Trouble shoot any call-offs, balance out the previous days sales and make bank deposits. Check daily planner for daily work flow and position employees accordingly. Most enjoyable part of the job was learning all aspects of management and meeting people from all diversities."
good,Great stable company to work for. Got a very good understanding of the Corporate culture and what you have to do to move up. Working there is very demanding. However depending on your management structure the work life balance is better in some areas rather than others.
good,"I got done because I was on Ad-Set and the stores changed to Electronic Signs instead of paper, also changing the work hours and making them later in the evening. When I worked there the Manager was awful, rude and just not a people person."
good,"fun and easy, good place to work. we would go up to 40 feet and pull order and we would also put stuff back on the shelves. i learned how to drive a forklift."
good,a typical work day is long. i learned customer service and how to run a register. management is decent. most of the co-workers are great. hardest part is dealing with co-workers that get preferential treatment because of their skin color (don't get me wrong. i'm not racist.). the most enjoyable part is working freight on Friday mornings.
good,I really enjoyed working at Kohl's . I enjoyed the work i did. I enjoyed the people i worked with. And the customers I would meet. The managers were great. And the whole expirence was great.
good,"i love working in customer service , and working with people i am very people oriented. very outgoing and very positive . I am looking for a job where i can be around people. i am very hard working the best part about working in customer service is always being able to help a customer out ."
good,"I really liked working here, the people were fun and the whole vibe within the store was always positive."
good,"Kohl's keeps me very busy everyday. There is always somthing to do. They give you computer training if and when needed. Management is not that bad, they just expect so much from you when you can only do so much. My co-wokers are like family to me without them we would not be a great team. The hardest part of the job I feel is the customers. If you do not know how to handle the public then you definitely should not be in the retail business. The most enjoyable part of the job I feel in the merchandising part. Getting the new freight out and figuring out where to put it and setting up the monthly updates such as, the new months strikepoints."
good,Clean my working area
good,"As a Sales Associate/Register Operator I help customers find what they are looking for, whether it be on the floor or on the kiosk. I answer calls for my departments, whether it be from customers or from other Kohl's stores, looking for a particular item. My job also includes keeping the fitting rooms neat, tidy, and free of clothing. I then proceed to get the clothes back out on the floor. I have learned what it means to provide excellent customer service, and the satisfaction that I feel when a customer leaves the store happy with the item or items he or she came for. I have learned how to obtain a credit application when servicing a customer at the register. The management and co-workers are excellent to work with. We help each other out and communicate effectively. They and the customers are the most enjoyable part of my job. I love the multi-tasking and the constant movement that my job demands."
good,I worked in KOHLs East Brunswick as a bridge from school to real world. The one month experience our team has achieved the goal number application of store care and help other customer familiarized the new store.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Great place to work. I was able to learn from different departments how my job effected theirs wich greatly enabled me to perform my duties in a way that was benificial to all.
good,"Very hectic around the holidays, but very fun place to work.."
good,Shopping was one of the major perks of this job. I loved my co-workers and management staff. Team effort was always the motto. The management emphasized that we work as a unit. It made company goals very productive and it also made the job easier & more productive for each individual. We knew we always had the help & support of our co-workers.
good,"Good place to work for, seasonal is a good start for the new workers just starting out on their first job"
good,Enjoyed working here as a seasonal position though was told that all seasonal had to be let go because they grossly overstaffed to prepare for the holidays.
good,Loved the one on one with the customers was constantly busy. I assisted the VP of the company loved working for him. Unfortunately he passed away and thus my job ended.
good,A company that cares for everyone and tries their best at giving customers a great shopping experience.
good,Love the sales and the discounts i get!! This place is clean and we take extra care of the customers.
good,"Great place to work, more for college and/or high school students. Does not pay that well."
good,Kohl's is fun to work at. It has great team members and the ability to cross train. Shifts are fair. Customers are great and work is consistent. Has a positive and contagious environment.
good,"I did enjoy my time working at Kohl's. It was a very good starter job for me, and I did learn a lot about costumer service from working there. I am now able to better assist costumers now and to continue to grow in my near future."
good,Great job but doesnt pay well. I love going to work everyday and seeing the people I work with. We are definitely like a family but people who have been there for years still make the 11.10
good,"I have worked as a seasonal associate at Kohl’s for two years. The whole work experience is great. I was fully trained to do my job, I get positive feedback and awards for my successes, and we’re offered snacks, encouragement, training, and mentorship, making this a great place to work. The pay and benefits, however, are poor."
good,i like this job the only thing that i ain't like was that it was to far from where i was leaving at and i have a car than so i had to get on the bus so it was just a transportation
good,"It was a simple place of work and very easy to get the hang of. dress attire is not as serious as they make it out to seem, just do not dress like a slob"
good,"I've enjoyed all the customers I have helped out over the past 2 months. It was a pleasure with working with them but more overall my co-workers and managers was a big plus they all where so encouraging, very energetic, and fun to work with. If I ever had a problem with anything they was always there to help guide me through any situation. I really love working here."
good,I learned to be more open with customers that way you can help them with their needs. The hardest part of the job is when you can’t find something where it is supposed to be.
good,"I loved working at Kohls. Everyone is very friendly and they care about you. They realize life happens and not everything is in your control. The management team is great at acknowledging employees for correct behavior or going beyond the call of duty. Pay could be imprived, or the offer of benefits."
good,"Fue todo un gran comienzo, me tocó ser uno de los primeros empleados de Kohls Beaumont Store, fue una gran experiencia y mucho trabajo, solo al principio ya después todo cambió ya que comenzó el favoritismo para unos  empleados ya que comenzaron a dar más horas de trabajo a los favorecidos y eran los más flojos y faltistas."
good,Good place to work as a part time job.  Awesome employee discounts. Family oriented. Employees worked together in a true team oriented environment everyone always helped each other.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Everything about kohls is great except the pay. Pay starts at 9 when other competitors like Ross and target start at 11-14$ and there isn’t enough room for raises other than a couple of cents raise per year. Management is great, coworkers are great, and almost all customers are really nice but there’s always that 1 rude person no one likes. Overall kohls is a happy place to work."
good,"A typical day at work is busy and very energizing.  I have learned so many different things about customer service and online shopping fulfillment.  The management is mostly helpful and willing to teach you new job skills.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me is learning new tasks and helping customers.  I truly work with great, hardworking people and my job is very satisfying."
good,"I liked working there.  It was a part time, seasonal job, but it was still fun.  I really liked my co-workers too.  They made it easy to work there too!"
good,I like working their. Theirs great co workers. I do cashier and I also do fitting rooms and organizing the kids clothes and the clearance racks and customer service
good,"Co-Workers were helpful to me when i first arrived at Kohl’s, Managers did their job but were also understanding of situations involving transportation and sometimes even sick days."
good,Great for a starter job but not something you can make a living off of. I started right before the holiday season so it was great until we hired more people then I didn’t get scheduled as much.
good,"Kohl's was a great company to work for. The only issue working there was that there really wasn't a work/life balance. Also the pressure to catch shoplifters was unreal at times. I would recommend this company to anyone that doesn't have a family. The pay was great, and the LP culture was amazing."
good,"I really enjoyed Kohls even though it was poor mgmt. Fast paced busy all the time great discount, food provided at Holiday and special"
good,"Really enjoyed cashing out our customers.  Some preferred coming to my station because I folded all their items nicely in the bag.  I found it fun to work there, even though we were serious workers.  I would work there again."
good,Excellent management team! Team atmosphere and very friendly.  Flexible work schedule once you get onboard and they listen to you. Dress code is casual.
good,"I enjoy working at Kohls.  The discounts are amazing, the employees are all great to get along with and the management is very supportive of their employees."
good,"Start pay is around $9. The work is relatively easy. It's mostly helping customers on the floor, working a register, and picking online orders. Co-workers are nice and management is great. Very understanding if you have an emergency or family issue. Good work/home balance."
good,Working at Kohl’s has been a great experience. The managers are patient. The co-workers are great. It is definitely a fast paced work environment. It does make the day go by quickly.
good,My area was Jewelry Department when the store opened back in 2003. I set up the jewelry cases. I stepped down to part time as a Point  of Sale Associate. Loved helping customers with their purchases. Retired after 14 years due to relocation. Still continue to  enjoy the associate discounts due to age and amount of employed years!!! 👍😊
good,"Enjoyed working there for supplemental income."
good,"It’s a great job if you’re only looking for something part time, because you won’t get a whole lot of hours. Majority of the managers are really nice and will help you out if you need anything. I wouldn’t call me and my other coworkers “friends” but most workers there are pretty friendly, you could walk up to anyone there and start a conversation. And the work isn’t hard at all, and it doesn’t take long to get the hang of any job you’re doing. I recommend it!"
good,"Doesn't pay very well, but is an amazing environment to work in! Great discounts! No benefits. Very few full-time staff with benefits. Amazing management! Always busy, but not stressed. Management is very relaxed!"
good,I always enjoy working at kohl's. The associates who I work with are wonderful.  The morale of the store is very low right now due to management's lack of enthusiasm and associate interactions. But that will change as management changes or gets transferred.
good,Very fast paced and a lot of tasks to do to keep one busy throughout the day. Early days to late nights and hours tend to be more of a burden around the holidays.
good,Recommend working for a Kohls. Great people fun atmosphere and great discounts. Holidays are the best because theyvare fast paced and it ensures a quick shift.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"A wonderful Retail  team is great open door policy,very good customer service. i enjoyed working with my co-workers.Great team Fun,clean..Being in the Beauty department was a good learning experience."
good,"I worked at Kohl’s as a seasonal worker for the 2016 x-mad season.  Liked my co-workers, had very good training & good support from the management.  Overall, a very positive experience."
good,Kohl's in Severna Park was truly a collaborative effort.  The store's executives were hands on and pitched in when and where needed.  Suggestions on how to improve things were always welcome.
good,"My Kohl’s experience was a very good one. My fellow is employees really helped me when I struggled. The customers were very friendly. The managers always made sure that we were okay, and dealt with customers giving us a hard time. Kohl’s is a pretty great place to work at."
good,"Kohls is not the best paying job, but they do appreciate their employees and are constantly doing things to prove that fact. I'll always love working here"
good,A typical  day at work consisted of setting up the conveyor belts.. And cleaning out warehkuse for new merchandise recovery.. Next we would put items from boxes in there correct location.
good,Very fun work place but hard to balance as a college student.  During the summer it is great but I did not go to school in my home town so coming home twice a month in order to keep my job was a challenge.
good,"Pay wasnt the best but i absolutely loved the job. People were great, environment was great, definitely am amazing starting job! Management was great, everyone seemed like they enjoyed work. Having the discounts were amazing which kind of made up for the pay we were getting"
good,"Kohls is very friendly and family oriented! You learn a lot and quickly! Gives you the opportunity to grown within the company!"
good,"A good job for students, relaxed and laid back"
good,a typical day at work would be a 6-hour shift switching from the registers to customer service. The management was around often had bad and good days. the hardest part of the job was trying to get customers to sign up for a Kohls credit card.
good,Kohl's is a structured retail environment with room for growth and development. There are many different departments and areas of the store to work in so you have a lot of opportunities to learn multiple parts of the business.
good,"Job is fun. Would love to have set hours though. Job security is a huge issue for me. If you're a cashier, they push getting credits. Hours are based off of the credits you get."
good,"Great company to work for.  Just couldn't get enough hours - had to leave for job advancement and better pay!"
good,I learned a lot from this job from folding at a quicker pace and getting everything done. Learning to deal with customers in a better manner. Learning how to cahsier and run customer service.
good,"Nice place to work during the holidays, in high school or college"
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Kohl's, especially after being promoted after three months. I love my coworkers, it was easy to take time off, but with all that said, the pay was really bad."
good,On the POC makes the day go fast if busy. When not busy one should check for change and make sure 500s are organized.  Treat Customers with respect and help them if they need help.
good,"The job is a very easy and fun place to work, and the hours are flexible and based on your schedule. The pay was pretty average and the hours were good."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Working for khol's was a great learning experience for me. I got to learn so much from the great managers that worked there. I got to meet people that have all different nationalities while working with them. I learned how to be a great leader and how khol's gave back to the communities
good,Working at Kohl's had alit of perks as an employee we got great discounts and so did family.The holiday hours were broke down fairly.Workibg as a while team made everyone closer so we could laugh and be comfortable around each other.
good,"I worked here just for a Christmas season, i was offered a full time sadly had to turn it down cause of the current full time job that i had. i would go back if i had the time to work there. i met great  people."
good,"i liked working at kohls, but it was only a seasonal job so i had to find something else. management did a good job hiring good workers and i had a fun time working with them."
good,"Great atmosphere and team. Sometimes it's fast paced,sometimes it's slow. Overall the experience is rewarding. My advice is at any job, give it your all, show yourself you are an asset and don't be afraid of challenging situations."
good,Kohl's was a great place.  Friendly co-workers and customers . . . treat them with respect and they would treat you with respect.  Management was understanding and supportive of all family/life issues.
good,"Working at Kohl's is just like any other job, it is what you make it. I loved the people I worked with and being cross trained in every department came in handy when it came time to schedule or when extra help is needed around the store. Fantastic management that provides the utmost respect for its employees and stands behind them when decisions are made."
good,I would say the most enjoyable part of the job was serving great customer service to the customers.  The amount of sales the company gained. Customer care Advanced
good,"A typical day at Kohl's was always a delight. I learned how to manage the fitting rooms and learned more about the merchandise. The management needed work, but the managers were all nice and flexible. Also they taught us a lot about Kohl's and safety procedures. The workplace culture wasn't really spoken of. The hardest part of the job was selling the credit cards because majority of the customers were already members. I enjoyed the customers the most, I had a few moody customers, but majority of them were nice and always had fun conversations with them."
good,the inventory experience at kohls was amazing for the most part despite the manager we was under. the job had some really good experiences and i would highly recommend the company to any of my friends and family.
good,"For the most part Kohl’s is very relaxed job, you’re mainly going to be on register/stock. Super easy, and they give you 15%off and you can stack coupons! I wouldn’t say it’s a full time job, but if you’re really needing the hours the management is always accommodating to that."
good,Good job if your in school or your significant other pays all the bills.  Not enough to live on and you have to work all the holidays   The people are great and they are understanding of emergencies or if you have to do things with your kids
good,"The one thing that set Kohl's apart, for me, was the positive team approach and positive leadership. Yes the pressure for selling credit was just as intense as any other retail job and the daily requirements were almost exactly the same but the management staff was supportive and positive. When I was employed there most every employee wanted to be there, complaining existed but it was not a determent to the day. Overall I enjoyed my experience and would return given the opportunity."
good,Great work-family environment!  Wonderful managers and awesome customer base.  Made a lot of friendships and wish I didn't have to leave. (I left for a better paying job.)
good,As my first job I enjoyed having a real job for the first time and now I feel semi ready for another job. Thank you to Kohl’s I feel prepared but I do wish I was on the sales floor.
good,"Management is very pleasant, it’s a slow paced work envoirnment only times it was crazy was holidays the rest of the time hours got cut any you tried to keep yourself busy"
good,"Kohl's provides a thourough, animated training program for it's new employees that will allow newcomers to feel comfortable as they begin work at Kohl's. The discounts provided to employees is a great reward for loyal employees."

good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"While working with Kohls, I had the best supervisors. When it came time to call off for personal days they worked with us well. Yes, they were upset if it was last minute but as long as we made up for it there was no issues. The customer engagement was absolutely wonderful! There was never a bad day at Kohls. The only downfall was the store manager wasn’t a working manager she sat most of the time and when a question was asked she made sure employees knew we were being a burden."
good,"It was a good place to work, great atmosphere and everyone was treated well. I never had any issues with management or my my co-workers. We always felt as part of a team and were informed of any and all changes made whether it was management, finances or just machanical."
good,"Kohls cares is a real program that does real things for local communities, even sometimes non local.  It was amazing to be apart of that program and of the kohls team in general."
good,Very family filled. Flexible with schedule. Employee appreciation. community service for employees. Price comparison matches competition. Pay too low.
good,"A lot of sales in my department and did register occasionally, Very enjoyable work environment. The location of the store was close to home. Enjoyable people to work with."
good,I love the people I've worked with and my managers are always amazing people and take the time to get to know you. I feel like I've made close friends working here.

good,"I liked working for Kohl's because the managers were really friendly. They made it easy to approach them when questions and concerns. I was a seasonal worker, so my hours were crazy. I mostly worked over night, early morning shifts."

good,Kohl's is a fun work environment with great management and customer service. They give good training and most of the job is quite enjoyable. The hardest part about the job would most likely be soliciting the Kohl's Credit Card.
good,It is a great opportunity for entry level call center workers. I just would like to advance with better pay overall. The job itself was easy and flexible. The hardest part was making commission every month because the goals change randomly at any given time.
good,"I only worked seasonal and still felt very comfortable, considering it was my very first retail job. I worked in shoes which i prefer because the stress of the section isnt as harsh. The employees and management are so kind and very diligent. I wish i still worked there personally."
good,It was initially a temporary job but it turned out to be more than that. I like working here due to the current team and the customer experience is great inspiration to pursue customer related fields.
good,Typical day was unloading and loading semi trailers and restocking and back stocking merchandise  and occasionally helped out customers on the sales floor
good,Your typical day consists of talking about the rate and production. The culture was pretty diverse management was always willing to help. Flow of work was constant and not to unbearable.
good,Many of this  questions doesn't apply to me as a part time employee but I love working for Kohl's the problem I have is that I am not guaranteed the hours per week that I like to work some times is 4 hours and some times is 12 or 16 it all depends but mostly 4 to 8 hrs and that is the reason I would like to find another job!

good,"nice-coworkers, discounts, good merchendise, good location, good management, bad pay at least at the time I worked there, customers are great, hardest part was keeping the shoes organized."
good,On a typial day there would be a good amount of customers and it kept me busy so it was not boring. The managers were very nice and it was an enviorment you wanted to work in.
good,"Employment as a Loss Prevention Supervisor was a great experience. The district LP managers I worked under were always supportive. The culture was competitive, but gave you freedom to balance your personal life. I was not micro managed and as long as you met goals, it was almost like being your own boss. When struggling to meet company goals, managers and district LP associates were always willing to help. "
good,"Working at Kohl's was a pleasure I learned hands on merchandising skills, how to manage a crew, unloading the trucks  and reading the map for merchandise placements. Management was encouraging and also very helpful,work place was energetic  and fun at times, the hardest part was was some of the customers and the way the treated you. T he best part of the job was feeling accomplished."
good,Interactive work environment with coworkers that are very helpful. Hours vary depending on the time of year. The managers are very respectful and create a pleasant workplace for the employees.
good,"A typical day at work would be fast paced, through out the whole warehouse. You learn to adjust to the machine to pick and you learn how to find each item the machine is asking you to pick. toy also learn time management. Vto/Pto started at 12.50$ an hour holidays/Ot is double the salary"
good,"Great place to work at. Love my job and the staff I work with. "
good,"i would walk in a clock in then I have to zone the store, I would have to cork the back stock. then I would have to clean the different departments and when a truck cam in i would have to work the truck."

good,"Very busy, great people not enough hours. You can be trained for every dept.   Love the company. Discounts great , you will work but that is what you do with a job. You better be in shape ."
good,during the seasons it can be very stressful especially if understaffed. there were times when you had to be covering multiple areas which made it difficult to assist customers in your area.
good,"I have been working for Kohl's for a little bit over a year, and I love working there. I do consider that pay is not as good as it could be. While customer service is a priority for the company, I think their employees should also be a priority. They could be offered full-time jobs and/or raises. Management is great and very understanding. I love working there, but with my financial situation, I need more. I personally do not agree with their Yes, We Can policy, too many people take advantage of that!!!"
good,"I really enjoyed working for Kohl’s, very fast paced and love moving around a lot. I was very good at finding all my items in timely manner and shipping  the orders to customers"

good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Its a good place to work while in school it gets you around well enough to pay for cell phone bills etc. But no matter how much time you dedicate to the company everyone and anyone besides managers will get pay the same wage
good,I worked as a seasonal employee at Kohls during the holiday season. The environment is fast paced and it makes the day/night go by quickly. Everyone is friendly and willing to help you when needed. I worked in various departments there and it was a good atmosphere.
good,"Overall, working at Kohls as sales associate was a good experience. Management was great and the culture was very relaxed. Miss working with customers."

good,It's a great place to start in retail. The updated cash handling system with customers is on point. Due the fact customers are not always right. The company maintains a professional reputation with everyone.
good,"Retail is hard and with the changing culture, stores are shrinking making the employment environment shaky. I like the work and dealing with people providing customer service."
good,"As a part time customer service clerk, I enjoyed customer interactions - even with returns, exchanges, refunds, etc.  It is easy to make people happy when a prioritized core company value is that the customer's experience should be excellent.  I loved having a diverse team of associates and management members."
good,Kohl's is a excellent company to work for and is much like a family at the location I work at presently.  I would recommend Kohl's to anyone from 18 years old to 80 years old.  It is a very flexible workplace and enjoy working with all types of individuals.
good,"Working at Kohl's has been a pleasure, from the time you start you are made to feel a part of the family. I work with people who have been with the company for 15+ years and still love it. I will miss working here, but I need to pursue a new goal in a new career."

good,Khols was a great start. Its not a company to make a career out of. the staff was amazing. I enjoyed my time while working there. The application process is very quick and easy.
good,Weekends at kohl's is very busy and fast paced especially if there is a good coupon/sale. This gives associates a chance to rack up those credits that your managers will ask of you. It was a great experience to work here. The staff at the woodridge location were great team members.
good,"You are scheduled to work a certain area but that can change in a moments notice, depending on call outs.   I have learned a lot from the management and staff that I work with and enjoy working with each and everyone.  The hardest part of the job is not getting enough hours.  The store that I work at is great because of the staff and management seem to care about one another, they seem to help one another.  Most jobs that I have had, had staff members that does not want you to secede, and goes out of their way to make sure you don't, but , I have not come across that, everyone has help helped secede."
good,"I enjoyed my seasonal experience at Kohl's. For the time I was there it was a ton of fun the staff was great, the pay is good and on a weekly basis. Even though I was seasonal I received a good amount of hours. Management considered me a great employee.

good,"Fast paced working environment, barely ever a boring day "

I learned to handle all kinds of customers, how to solicit credit, to communicate effectively with the team, and most of all, to always put the customer first.  The hardest part of the job is standing for long periods of time, but even that isn't too difficult.  The most enjoyable part is being recognized for my hard work."

good,"I enjoyed my time with Kohl's. The management was very nice, although sometimes when they were stressed with not meeting goals, you would know. I found the pay to be satisfactory."
good,"Working at Kohls is like shopping at Kohls. It is very pleasurable unless it's a holiday and good sales are going on. The people are always friendly and its not too hectic, considering the size of most Kohls stores. You may work several departments at once, but more than likely you will also have 2 other people helping you out"
good,"Always got something to do"
good,I had learned a lot of different skills and how to help customers.i enjoyed all the work I did. We work as a team we started work and finished together. the management crew was great.
good,Working here during the holiday season was fast past and fun. I always strived to help in anyway i could. The only down side was it was only seasonal. I would definitely work here again.

Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I gathered on-line orders, pulled merchandise, and worked register. I learned to have more patience and to be more kind to people. People tend to be in cliques, if you don't fit in, you feel like you don't belong. Management kind of seems like you're just another person and they don't really care. Of course, they're exceptions with the managers."
good,"Fast-paced, fun, friendly and clean environment."
good,Kohl's Duluth has an awesome manager and her team of assistant managers are great too.  They are all helpful and friendly.

good,Lack of communication across cross functional teams. Overall good place to work. Looking to advance my career further. I want to see what other job opportunities are out there
good,I loved this job. I worked on the Adset team. We all worked together to get the job done. I was always moving around. If I had finished up with my duties I would go and assist someone else. We would work until the job got done! No one could go unless everyone was done with everything. That was great! It got everyone to work together!
good,"It was at times very hard to work here do to the facts managers wouldnt communicate. But overall I was very fun and enjoyable, the employees were very helpful and encouraging."

good,I learn something new everyday and I'm grateful for it. The management is great and I love all my team members.  Also trained me at the service desk which is something I wanted to learn because it is a good skill to have.
good,"My day starts with picking up items people leave all over the store, cleaning and folding my departments. I enjoy working with my co-workers."
good,It is fun to work there and you meet new people.  I love working in the EO department.  I WORK ON THE NIGHT SHIFT AND SOMETIMES IN DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS.  The coworkers are nice and management is awesome.

good,"KOHLS is an amazing place to work at. the ability to be hands on and train your fellow coworkers is something I enjoy. benefits are amazing. the hardest part of this job is the level of advancement, which is zero. it took me literally 3 years to get into the position I am in now. you do have to pay your dues here to advance to a higher paid position. "
good,"a typical day at Kohls was taking care of customers."
good,"Very fast paced working environment. "
good,"I worked at kohl's, so much so i worked their 5 years.  My average day would consist of me coming in to work getting my register and starting my day.  I helped people find whatever they needed as best as i could.  I counted all the registers down at the end of the night before close.  I helped keep the items on the floor organized and in their right spots at all times."
good,If your looking for the same thing everyday this is not the job for you they will place you in separate locations so you do not have to work with the same objects everyday. This a very nice company to work for.
good,"I absolutely love this job. Benefits were perfect and the customers were great, but overall for the civil I was not treated equally"

good,"Participated in customer satisfaction trainings. "
good,"Kohl's was a very good place to work. The schedules were generally very flexible. On a typical day, I'd walk in, be greeted by the managers, and get straight to work. I learned a lot about how to work with customers and how to help them find what they need. The management at the Arnold location was stellar. I can't say enough good things about them. My co-workers were very genial and easy to get along with, and everyone seemed to enjoy their jobs. The most difficult part of the job was leaving every day. The most enjoyable part was walking in and seeing everyone's smiling faces."
good,I love working for the company but I do think that for a part time person you should get about 26 hours a week and right now I am getting about 17 to 21.  I am the only person that can pay my bills and with this job I have a hard time paying my bills.
good,"I kept track of all the registers and opened them or closed them, depending on the shift. I definitely learned to multitask well at this job and communicate effectively to make sure that my coworkers knew when I would be covering them for their breaks. It showed me how much me caring for the people that worked with me paid off. This was also one of my more favorite jobs. The most enjoyable portion of the job was dealing with the quirks and upsets from customers. It is also one of the hardest things but there is something about the challenge of making a customer happy and following store policy that I have an affinity for."
good,"working at this company was a good warehouse experience, i worked late hours for the first time and i was more focused on getting the job done"

good,Many retail places could care less about how involved you are in the company as long as you meet the required goals. Kohls management tries harder than most to make you feel like you are part of a family.
good,"Working for Kohl's was a great experience. The management staff were really close to their employees and treated everyone fairly. The opportunity for advancement was very much attainable. The only draw back would be the typical minimum wage complaint. Basically the pay was low, but there was always room to gain overtime and gift cards redeemable for store purchases. The work day consisted of some heavy lifting, a very fast paced environment, solving customer problems, restocking, and merchandising."

good,"Kohl's is a great company and is a very enjoyable work place. The management is amazing and I can call many of them my friends. Some days I'm a customer service representative where I am responsible for resolving customer complaints and concerns. I also have to balance nightly cash drawers. As a Point Of Sale Supervisor I am responsible for coaching and training employees as well as managing daily cash reports and balancing cash drawers. I'm also responsible for resolving customers complaints in this position as well. All in all it is a great job, there just isn't much room for advancement and I know that I can be much more!"

Management they are there to help and stand by you if you need something with out judging. Co-workers they are helpful."
good,"It's busy every department even without customers, there's lots of things to do such as helping with freight, cleaning each department, folding and sizing clothes.

When manager on duty answer all manager calls to ensure customers  and associates questions were answered. It was a challenging and rewarding environment to work. The time management skills I learned were invaluable to accomplish all the task each day. The hardest part of my day was leaving, when I knew there was a few more things I could accomplish.

good,I learned the correct way to pick and pack.  I also learned how to pay attention to detail.
good,"A typical day at work consists of greeting and getting to know all different types of people while providing them with excellent customer service. What I have learned while working at Kohl's is that customer service is the main key to providing people great service. You as an employee have to create the experiences that a customer with have with your organization, and what better way to do that by providing them with excellent customer service. The managment is wonderful. They are very understanding and flexible with the way that they manage the store. Always friendly and willing to help out. My co-workers are a colorful group of people and are always team players. The hardest part of the job to me is soliciting credits when no one is interested, but all I can do is ask. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to interact with so many interesting people throughout the day (customers and co-workers). Makes the time go by faster and makes my day  enjoyable."

good,Very good management and well organized business. A strong team attitude.
good,"I did take a major pay cut when I moved to the big city and that was a fall back because things cost more there. We had many races/cultures working there and it kept things interesting and taught me about other people and thier beliefs. The major fall back was their head management, she had 0 people skills. My personal manager (POS Supervisor) was great and always cared about his employees. My head manager told me after I took on another job to help with the pay cut that she would not schedule around that job because in my interview we had only discussed changes in my schedule due to school and that had nothing to do with school. So I was forced to work from 2am-7am delivering papers and then go to work at 8am or 9 am 7 days a week, and a couple of times I had to take my dress clothes on the job and be there by 7am. This made me very sick during my first pregnancy and plummetted my weight drastically because I lost the energy to eat and could only sleep when I had time off."
good,"You can work short or long shifts, and they dont give you very long breaks at times the management will help you out with any time off that you need as long as it not around a holiday. The work is easy but it is retail and you are picking up after people all day long. Most poeple that you work with dont stay long."
good,"Its schedule was very flexible, and management seemed to care about your needs. Coworkers would also help in any way that they could as well. In the end, it was all about the customers, and how to best help them, and their needs."

good,I'd love to work at Kohl's again. I enjoyed working with many types of people and being able to help them with an enjoyable shopping experience.
good,"I worked there the holiday season 2011 doing various jobs including cashier, stock replenishment and floor displays."
good,I clock in for work and ask the manager on duty what I need to do and I go where I am most needed.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,There is not a typical day at Kohls there was always something going on. You learn how to deal with other cultural values and see how families shop. I worked with some ofthe sweetest ppl and had the most sweetest bosses. The one thing about the job was was the pay was not based on experience and of course holidays. The atmosphere there is unbelieveable.
good,"I was seasonal at Kohl's, so hours were great. And we were always busy!"
good,they good pay but they expect only temps job

good,"a typical day as a Kohls associate is a long and busy one. In which you will meet a variety of people. There is never a dull day. You will always be learning something new. I myself learned how to work the computer systems at kohls, as well as the cashiers computer system. I learned how to work at customer services briefly. I learned how to properly fold clothes an how to be a better employee. My co-workers were more like family to me, they were very welcoming, encouraging and helpful. The hardest part of the job at first had been making credits, but once i got the hang of it. I use to get four sometimes five people to sign up for kohls credit cards a day. I truly enjoyed my time working with kohls."
good,They are very flexible with scheduling. communication isn't the best
good,Working at Kohl's was a great experience. All the employees were nice and helpful. They were flexible with your work schedule. Great job to have while going to school.
good,"A great first job as they hire 16 years olds. Pay is a little higher than minimum wage, but on the lower end compared to other retail establishments in town; however, they offer great flexibility in scheduling and it is a team oriented environment with great management support."
good,Worked here as a seasonal employee for two years straight...just wish they'd hire more permanent positions instead of laying everyone off...but in all fairness I was told it was seasonal..
good,"Awesome experience working."
good,"Management saw what I was capable of  , my work ethic , my drive, my experience and how I work with others . In turn they gave me full range to work all over the store and gave me the hours /time in wanted ."
good,I was seasonal so I made returns for items I put items on clearance and put them in the correct carts to return to the sales floor and I had a very small portion of the sales floor I had to take care of and keep clean
good,"hardest thing to deal with was ignorant customers without common sense. Overall I really enjoyed my time working with Kohl's, the people were all very welcoming and were always willing to help you move matter the situation. It is such a fun and loving environment and anyone would be lucky to work there full time."
good,Kohls is a good company to work for.  Opportunities to advance.  Fair wage.  Only thing I would say that makes it hard to work at Kohls is there is a lack of communication.
good,I liked my job but the pay wasn't as much for all the work they have you do. There was bo room for advancement since the supervisors have been there for a while and don't seem to leave any time soon. It's a good first job or for a college student.

Managers there are well-informed on just about everything and are very kind and willing to assist employees with anything they may need."
good,In the time that I worked at Kohl’s I really enjoyed working with my customers and coworkers. It was fun to work there and get to know the regular customers and new customers.
good,I have been working at kohls for 10 years. The management is very friendly and easy going. I do go beyond what is needed to do and feel i get no reorganization. Its difficult to get a decent pay raise.
good,Part-time job. Management really works with you on scheduling. Very friendly and helpful co-workers. Good job culture and great extras to make up for meh pay

good,We have a good time but also work and we get what needs to be done we get it done. When we have problems we talk about them so they can be fixed. We work at a fast rate when it comes to working on the floor.

good,Management and fellow employees were all very friendly and helpful. Working as an Omni associate I really enjoyed the work I did. One of the difficulties was finding equipment that worked but I was always able to do my job. It was great learning the layout of the store and getting faster at finding merchandise and being able to help out customers with confidence.
good,"My seasonal experience working at Kohl's was a positive one. I was scheduled for many hours, enjoyed interacting with the customers and felt good about the quality of the products offered. The only problem I noted was the lack of training, however, more experienced workers kindly assisted me and also management was available to resolve complex issues. I would recommend Kohl's to those seeking employment and I would enjoy working there again"
good,Kohls was a great first job and the schedule was able to work with my school schedule. At the time I didn't have a car and kohls was so close it was the perfect starter job.
good,"Get there and help people at the register. I learned how to use the Point of Sales registers for everything between purchases and returns to account payments and selling credit. Overall great experience, gave me a basis of knowledge to work with. Management was there when you needed them. Comfortable place with nice lighting. Never too slow People are always buying things and helping them pay is very enjoyable. Its their last stop in the store so it means the most to make every transaction enjoyable even when there are issues that need to be resolved."

good,This was an exciting place to work during the holidays. Everyone was in a festive mood and helped each other out. The time went quickly as there was always something to do.
good,Management is great at kohl’s. Managers work with your outside of work lives. I learned how to help create a friendly work environment for customers and other associates.

good,"I learned alot from Kohl's. Great management. But teamwork is required most of the time. If you have good team members to work with then yeah you are lucky for that day.  Without good team members, you will never able to finish your work in the time and you will end up finishing all the work."
good,"Great place to work enjoyed my time there, however unless your an executive. There is no job security. Ethics, performance is overlooked. Corp. policy"
good,A seasonal position requires a person to be able to organize the store in an orderly fashion and to fold all clothes that need to be folded. A very easy and fun job.
good,Love my manager and everybody! Pay is horrible! They are starting new employees at $9. I started at 7.25 and only making $10.50 now after 9 years! That is so not fair!!!!! They will lose a lot of us who have been with company along time because we can go to other retail jobs for a lot more money!
good,Nice people working there. I wish I would have been there longer. I grew up on playing with cash registers so I think that's why I enjoy working with them now.
good,Loved working here. Management and coworkers were amazing. When store was closed for Hurricane Harvey the company paid us for our scheduled shifts anyway. Training was thorough and we were cross trained. Overall great company and good amount of hours.

good,It’s a great job to start off with a lot of work the supervisor make sure the numbers were there at the end of my shift and the amount of work hours re great
good,Its a good learning experience involving receiving and merchandising. A typical day at work included receiving products and putting them on the correct z rail and taking the product to the right location in the store to be tagged and ready for purchase.
good,"Management has changed in the last three years. There seems to be a high rise of favoritism. Management has been bringing old friends and putting them in positions that current employees could very well have. "
good,I really did like kohl’s a lot and I didn’t leave because it was a bad work place. The managers were really nice and understanding and really cared about there employees.
good,"This is a pretty easy job,  you work together as a team here, you have your stations you work at each day, management was very flexible with my schedule."
good,"The bosses are pretty nice and considerate of your life, working there for 3 year I have quite some experience there. They’re lax and it’s a good environment to work as long as you get along with most of your coworkers. 15% discount sometimes bumps up to 35% and you can stack it with other coupons. Plus it comes off everything (even excluded items). The only major issue is that most customers are very entitled and rude."
good,"I work as a sales associate at the Kohl's in Clinton, IA. Each day is interesting and engaging. I am typically kept busy with different tasks, and I learn new things every day. Working at Kohl's has greatly helped to improve upon my skills in customer service/sales."

You are treated with respect.  Management is very approachable.  I would love to stay on in the position after the holidays.
good,"I would arrive at 5am in the morning and get RECEIVING READY TO RECEIVE TRUCK, then we would unload truck put freight away. and backstock product. then on other days I would arrive and cashier or work in a department. Management generally cared about its employees."
good,"Was hired there as seasonal help but was later hired on as part time. The place has a great atmosphere and if it wasn't for getting hired and offered a better pay opportunity somewhere else, I'd more than likely still be employed with them. My favorite place of employment by far!!"
good,I loved working there even if it was just for the season. All the co-workers were very helpful you just feel as one and nobody is left behind on workload
good,"Excellent, supportive and professional management team.  This is a productive, fast paced work environment with opportunity for advancement.  Horrible pay"
good,"Managers always treated with me respect. Great job once you learn what to do. I would switch between shoes and working the cash register, good customer service skills was certainly needed"

I like that as a part time employee you are eligible for medical benefits and also sick leave is available.

good,Very fun and energetic place to work and is very diverse. They threat their employees very well. Different cultures is also embraced in the company with makes it one of the best.
good,A very energetic place to work. Got along great with all coworkers! Management could have used some more work because they didn’t seem too interested in the employees needs.
good,Nice place to Work. The Diverse Cultureid well worth the long Hiring Process.  I don’t like that The Company Do t Practice Growing from Within. They Hire New People who aren’t as familiar with The Comanyp’s Way of Business
good,"A great place to work. The management is great as well. You have to work a lot of holidays unfortunately. And they need you to work weekends which can also be unfortunate. "
good,good and easy money. it is a department store so the work load is not that hard becuase their are multiple worker in the department you are in ususally. i loved working there
good,"Is a great company to work with."
good,Kohl's was a great place to work for. the co-workers and managment were frendly and got along well. Store was always up to date and never a mess. Excellent overall
good,This job was a lot of fun I loved helping people find the right things they were looking for I also loved being on cash register it was all around a great fun place to work just didn’t make enough money 💴
good,Managers and their work ethics are great! They work very well with school/ dual-job schedules and they encourage their employees to pursue as many hours as they possibly can.
good,This is a great place to work. You are rewarded for working hard and your work is often recognized by management. Staff are friendly and easy to get along with as well as hard working. The only complaint is that most of the positions are part-time.
good,"Well working.with merchandise different types of clothes,toys alittle bit of everything that you would see in a clothing store with perfume,all types of cologne blankets,beds..."
good,It was a nice relax place to work. It was a great place for myself to start out at 17. The crew was awesome and they really did take care of there employees.
good,I loved my job at Kohl’s I wished I still worked there. The hours were pretty decent. It’s a very easy going job but very professional as well. It helped me improved with interacting with others as well.
good,"I was not planning on leaving. One week they just started cutting my hours. I went from working 3-4 days a week 6 hours/day, to one 4-hour shift a week. This went on for about a month and a half until one day I decided I could not live on $30/week. I asked for more hours multiple times, and got none. My coworkers that were on the floor with me were working 30-40 hours/week as part-time employees. It just was not fair. Putting clothes up all day is very tedious work, it's like cleaning up after a bunch of kids. But the environment was nice and I had wonderful coworkers."
good,"This was a great place to work. Very young associate group, active, fast paced. Everyone was a family. Flexible with all availability. Over all, I loved the environment. But corporate gives less hours and expects more work load. Not worth the pay."
good,"everyone was super nice, but the customers were always mean and nasty, but you have to be thick-skinned to work in retail or it will get the best of you, and then you'll lose your job"
good,"I have around 20 years of retail/management experience, mostly small store companies (Brookstone, Sunglass Hut, etc). I had worked part time in college at Walmart and Target as well, which were my only ""Big Box"" experiences. I have loved every day I have worked for Kohl's. Everyone is going to have a different experience within their stores of course; management team and associates make or break one's overall assessment of working for this company. We are very family oriented and focus on our associates being a team, where we all work together to make our goals."
good,"Kohls gave me an opportunity to work in a friendly environment i learned to be a cashier,floor sales associate,merchandise handler price changer and dressing room associate"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,This job is a self motivated job. The assignments are posted or already known and everyone maintains an independent demeanor when working. Very friendly environment and constant positive appraisal and recognition for achievements.
good,"It was very enjoyable to work at Kohl's. I had the pleasure of working with great people, and serving great customers. I was able to work at the register and on the floor which enabled me to meet wonderful people."
good,"Kohls is a great company with a long future. However, the upper CEO's do not look out for the store managers nor the store associates. They think they have a handle on how to keep people employed, but do not pay part time associates as much as other companies. "
good,"Kohl's is a very friendly, faced paced Department Store.  My favorite part was being a cashier.  I enjoyed talking with customers as they went through the line.  I also enjoy the work of a cashier.  The hardest part of the job was standing for 6 to 7 hours at times.  It was doable, but tiring."
good,The managers are always understanding of anything going on. They sometimes ask for to much but they make sure your are all set at the end of the day. Other employees as respectful and helpful as well.
good,"The company itself is not a bad company to work for. Obviously the biggest issue is hours, during certain parts of the year like all retail hours get cut and are spread between the workers. Kohls has a very good determination towards their goals, they treat their workers evenly. I was a department associate so I was constantly moving and required to fold, put away clothing, answer to back up cashiers and assist guests on the phone when looking for something in particular. We had all the proper equipment to keep in touch around the store. Kohls line is YES, we never deny the guest."
good,As long as your hours are 20+ you’ll have a nice psycheck. Friendly environment but better to keep to yourself  if not working in customer service or registers
good,"I learned a lot about both the workforce and myself during my time working at Kohl's. I learned where my strengths and weaknesses lie through the completion of different tasks. I improved upon different aspects such as multi-tasking, learning new aspects/departments of the store, and how to work to meet deadlines. The hardest part of the job was making sure that I kept up with everything: all of the tasks that I needed to complete that day, helping customers, answering additionals at the cash registers, and all of the other aspects that went into my job each day. The most enjoyable part of my job was the fact that I learned so many different departments and new aspects to help broaden my horizons there, and making sure that I kept upon with all of the tasks throughout the work day, I also thoroughly enjoyed all of the volunteer opportunities made available through my job."
good,"My interactions with associates was minimal and only customer interaction was when walking in/out of the store unless at service desk."
good,"Great job, great staff and management, poor pay/hours. Worked here for 10 months and really did enjoy it, but by the last 5 months or so I was living paycheck to paycheck."
good,The job was seasonal during the holidays enjoyed working in the children's area and home department helped customers find certain children's clothing assisted in other departments
good,"Kohls was a great place to work at, but there were a few managers that the employees were not a big fan of. All in all it was a fun place to work part time at."
good,"As a part time job for extra money, Kohls was very easy to work with as a second job."
good,"Customer Service/Jewelry Counter Representative: Provide excellent customer service in person and over the phone, handle daily monies and jewelry without discrepancy or loss, oversaw merchandise handling and returns/exchanges. Input account information on computer, customer and store related."
good,I worked at Kohl's in high school and I was one of the youngest employees at the time. Kohl's felt like family. I met so many wonderful people while working there. I learned people skills and bettered my communication skills.
good,"I work the register, so i usually ring customers and make eye contact and treat them the way they should be treated. I have learned many things working at kohl's, customer satisfaction, The managers are always there to help and teach you new things as well. The hardest apart of the job is to try and get credit goal for the day and month. The most enjoyable part of the job at Kohl's is learning new products and they way the Kohl's managers and corporate take care of their employees."
good,"Family Work Environment, you become close to your coworkers. Always busy and never boring. Volunteer opportunities and you can move up in the company easily."
good,Converse was my first job out of college.  It was a growing experience.  It taught me a lot about the professional world.  I am looking for something with a little more growth opportunity.
good,"It was  great environment it required competition as there was commission involved but everyone was still able to work as a team. The work was very friendly,easy going and required lots of costumers service skills."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Management will expect you to learn new positions and will not compensate you for it. Not really worth the stress for the amount that they pay and raises are rare.
good,A typical day at work has you sign in and use one of the stores devices called bluebirds to assist you in completing your work. The bluebird is like a PDA that has all the information you need once you learn this the job is simple routine.
good,"Placed in a high volume, Bottom 10 percent store as a Store manager is difficult. Celebrating and building on wins, no matter how small made all the impact in the world in helping associates grow."
good,good place to gain work experiences as a young adult starting out in the work force. i had very little experience working and working at kohl as holiday help was a positive experience for me.
good,I t was a good place to work for .  I enjoyed the co workers  and I really liked the Store Manager. The store manager was always working with her employies. I got to do many different job. Rate of pay was very low.
good,"Amazing place to work, great with scheduling, very understanding. If you want hours they will give you the hours. Employees are open to new people . Security is on point"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of handling customer transactions, emptying sensor tags and hangers and making sure there was enough cash in the drawers. Management wasn't always the best but they did what they could to help us, Working at Kohl's you work with a diverse group of people. the most enjoyable part of the job was becoming friends with those we woeked with. The hardest part of the job was trying to make sure each department was presentable."
good,Everyone at Kohls is fun to work with.  The managers are caring and recognize employees who do a good job.  We work together as a team to get everything done.
good,"Good company and benefits management is lacking development for associates and upcoming leaders with the company. Great worklife balance for associates, but not for upcoming leaders that are hourly"
good,I loved working here and wish I could have got hired in seasonally but they can only hire in so many people out of the total amount they hired for the season.
good,"It was hard work, but when the right people worked together, it was awesome. We would crack jokes on the line, while in the truck,unloading and reloading. There was a game room in the break room, too. Plenty of vending machines and several microwaves. An outside patio was there, as well, for smoking, vaping, and tables and umbrellas."
good,"Great place to gain excellent customer service skills, it is an extremely positive work environment from customers to co-workers. The job duties aren't hard at all even when the pace starts to pick up for the holidays. It's a pretty typical retail job if you keep busy and keep up with the daily tasks then everything should stay great."
good,Worked during chistmas crazyness. Job was chill when that settled  down. I was in shoes getting sizes using handeld computer and calling other store for holds
good,"Kohl's is a great place to start a career or change to a new career. It is a good place for highschool and college students.  Also, it a great place for stay at homes moms who are ready to go back to work."
good,"Kohls was a very enjoyable place to work. I loved the challenge of working there, I loved the environment. They treat their employees very well. I worked in every position they had available and I loved every one. From customer service, cashier, on the floor, and even in the back. Coworkers and managers were friendly. Fair breaks. Opportunity for overtime."
good,Would definitely work there again. I enjoyed working there with all of the other great Kohl’s sales associates. They are kind of like a family there. Love it.
good,"Great place to work, was pleased to find that they were very willing to find a shift that would work best for me and my family, the E distribution warehouse that I worked for was less than 3 minutes from my home which was very convenient. Clean company breakdowns with microwave access. Various types of snack and vending availabe. Great bunch of people to work with. Non discriminatory at every level in my opinion as well."
good,"Please remember that every place is different.  For myself at least, I had to move for school and the Kohls by my school just had a different culture, probably based on the neighborhood.  I would definitely suggest working in this position as an undergrad or as a high school student.  "
good,A typical fun day at work is greeting customers and answering any questions that they may have. I have learned a lot of things on the job as far as needs for the consumer and different ways of approaching sales. Management always makes up selling fun with different contests. The hardest part of the job would have to be finding many different ways to personalize a transaction or re wording a sale. The most enjoyable part of the job is informing the consumer and having them leave with a smile.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"It's a great place to work u are able to learn alot of thing , the manager is nice easy to get alone with but the hardest part of the job is when u have to place things where they need to go it's kind of difficult but u will get the hang of it"
good,This was a seasonal position. Personally I thought the job was very easy and fun. I really enjoyed the interaction with the customers and making sure was organized accordingly.
good,I really liked working there the people where great. the people who work there are very helpful and if u have a question they will do there best to assist u and answer it.
good,The managers are very good and I recommend  working at Khols. The atmosphere is comforting and the coworkers all get along with each other. We also get discounts on items you purchase when you shop there.
good,Very cool first job everyone's loved the experience and the people i met. i usually worked night so it was very simple easy. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people around very nice people
good,assisting  every customer to the best of my ability to ensure they have  a pleasant experience while shopping at khols has made it very easy and productive me for
good,A Typical Day Starting My Shift At Kohls Walking In The Warehouse About 5:50 because we had to clock by 6pm . Putting my lunch away filling my water up with crushed iced and a little bit of water. By that walk to the punch clock clock in from there on go find the rf scanner im using for that night and wait on my manager and team lead for the start up meetings. The workplace culture is very smooth and in order. The hardest part of this job was trying never make a mistake in any of  the orders. Most enjoyable part was a staff we worked together to make sure our goal was met after each night we've finished.
good,"Work in Customer Service basic responsibilities:"
good,"The best part about living the store duties in reality during a virtual program, was beginning the tests of organizing the sales floors and department areas. Once, joining in with team leaders of the department, tasks became more specific. The division of time is very important. Weekly check-ins with the E3 management is an important milestone. Don't forget! Cashiers are always there to ring ya up."
good,My overall experience at Kohls was great. I got the experience I needed in my department for future jobs. Pay and discounts were good. When it got busy I help around other departments and on main registers. Flexible hours to balance school. The managers were nice if I weren't feeling well and had to leave early or call out. The job was never stressful and there's always someone around to help if you needed it.
good,Good place to be people are great. Go workers are great and everything is great. Loved it their when I worked their. It was not so beating and it was quick but not to bad.
good,"Typical day at kohl's would be slow. "
good,This is a awesome company that really cares about its employees. The only bad thing is that they are creating multiple positions for one person but not paying according to the work being done.
good,"Kohls has taught me how to increase my sales, without making the customer feel like their being rushed. The management at Kohls were there to help whenever I needed to ask a question."
good,"Not applicable at this time - I have not been there long enough to write a review. "
good,"A Point of Sale associate position is an hourly paid position and in 2012 to 2013, the pay was low. I am unsure if that has changed since then. The hours are flexible and you set your availablity, meaning this is a great entry level job with opportunities for upward mobility."
good,"I have been hired 2x now for Seasonal Associate and it is a fun but demanding job.  I get 14-18 hours per week(more if it's a holiday week). The pay is minimum wage but it's retail so I get why and that's fair."
good,Been working for Kohl's part time for 12 yrs. The hours are flexible where you can balance home life and wok. The employee discount helps with budget cost.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Kohl's was an excellent place to work, it was only fast paced during the holidays and when we had sales. All in all it was slow paced nice environment, great managers, friendly coworkers, and the venue was an excellent place due to the varieties of food options you were able to choose fro.m."
good,"Working at Kohl's is not a bad experience, keeps me busy and I get to interact with the customers, lots to do even if slow.  There is room for advancement to other departments and able to learn other departments."
good,"Kohl's is a great company that demonstrates amazing team work amongst its associates. With hard work and proper communication, there is defiantly room for growth within the company."
good,"After training you typically know what position you will be in. You can always check in with your supervisor if for additional information when things pop up and you need assistance. Most of the work is not based around a group. So you have to self-manage and know your pace.  We have associate days, fun days, dress up days, and cook-ins to keep it lively!"
good,"Kohl's was a good place to work as a second job on a part-time basis. It was very busy, particularly during the Christmas season. Managers were fair and helpful. Working the jewelry was enjoyable. Breaks were provided in a fair manner."
good,Kohl's was a great job for retail as a matter of fact it was my favorite place to work for retail. The co workers were great we always got along well with another. We had an awesome staff.
good,It is a really fun place to work. Low pay but great team to work with. Benefits are the volunteer events and getting a chance to help society. Working as a team here helps this company strive for success.
good,"Loved my time at Kohl's in Lake Wales, Florida. I helped open the store, and quickly advanced my title into other promotions. I loved working there and my coworkers."
good,"I've worked for Kohl's for 5 years and have loved it for the most part. As with any job, sometimes it can be stressful (more so around the holidays but that's a given.. it is retail). One of the biggest reasons that I haven't left Kohl's is because of all my great coworkers. They make it hard to leave. The discount is also pretty great. I enjoy my job as a customer service associate because I can perform my duties and feel supported by coworkers and managers. I also feel productive within my work, which is a huge bonus for me. I feel that I'm getting something done every time I come to work."
good,I would check customers out. If my register was slow I would then Straighten up racks and tables. They managers where very friendly and helpful. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. they were very friendly.
good,"A typical day for me starts at 7:00am. Each day in retail is different, depending on the season. But I have about 5 girls who work under me on my team and together we make sure to provide great customer service, keep the missies and juniors department neat, keep fitting rooms cleaned out and put freight out on truck days. The culture in the workplace is very diverse, we all come from different backgrounds, different areas of Pennsylvania, and we get along well. As far as management, I will be honest and say communication could be worked on. Some days, I have different managers giving me different tasks to complete, without knowing that one already told me to do something else. But I am a great at multitasking so I do my best to complete all tasks given to me. Hardest part of the job is deciding what is a priority and what is not. Again, this comes from the management team. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I love my team, and I love talking with customers. If you are not going to have a good attitude while working in sales/marketing/with the public, then you should not be in this field."
good,I only work at Kohl's approximately 8 hrs. a month right now. It's a way to be out with people and assist customers. Management and staff are very nice to work with.
good,I love it cause it's my part time job. I also enjoy the discount I get cause I love style and clothes from khols. I am definitely going to keep my job and recommend others to work there too.
good,Had a good company to for and would recommend it to anyone  had good work days and good days off also and good insurance  and good vacation as well as good work team members
good,"My opinion of the job may be biased-- I worked at Kohl's during the holiday season, and one of my first days was Black Friday. "
good,"very busy store,i was trained to work on the floor,keep the store looking neat and clean,i helped customer searched for items they were looking for in the store."
good,"My typical day at work consisted of picking, packing, and shipping orders, stocking shelves, and helping customers however needed.  I learned how to help people and stock shelves.  The management was very helpful and pleasant and very experienced.  The people were nice and helpful.  The hardest part was learning the store.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the people."
good,I love how at Kohls you are a family and everyone looks out for eachother. They maintain a professional work place while allowing it to be fun and exciting!
good,Love working here. The management team is great. They give plenty of opportunity to move around to other departments. The pay is great and so are the coworkers.
good,I learned that costumers like clean an neat. So for me to stock my area an a costumer face expression tells me that I did a job well done it wasn't hard for the costumer to find what they need. I really enjoy making the costumers smile.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I enjoy working at kohls bc its not very stressful. I leave my first job to go to kohls and im thankful that its not a hasssel and that it keeps my energy up.
good,"Sometimes the work is grueling, but it was not unbearable. If your working the holidays it can get crazy for sure. But on a regular day it was evenly paced and there was never lack of things to do. I enjoyed my position here and I am considering going back."
good,A nice place to work seasonally. The people are great to work with and managers are very helpful. Time goes by fast as you are steady moving and unloading trucks. The customers are also very nice to deal with everyday. I enjoyed helping people with their shopping.Full time employees were very helpful and offer good training.
good,"One of the best companies I've ever worked for, management seemed to really care.  Was always spoken to with respect and gratitude.  Low hours and other options pulled me away from my position."
good,"Kohls is a Team based workplace with flexible hours, caring and friendly associates including management. Cross-training within with advancement opportunities."
good,It's a very upbeat place to work. Training and management are great! I will probably work there over the holidays for extra money. They let you try different departments to see which one you like.  They are also very good about giving you breaks and the employee discounts are fantastic.
good,"I really enjoyed working here. The associates and managers are always fun and upbeat. You're always working and moving and keeping busy, it makes the work day fly by."
good,Very enjoyable place to work. Great for retail and customer service experience. Pay isn't the best but the relaxed atmosphere outweighs that. They treat their employees like family.
good,"Cash register responsibilities, There is a ""Yes we can!"" policy as there isn't a no to a customer that is ""always right.""  This is clever and it make this company stand out.  The employees have a sense of self sufficiency."
good,"A typical day at work consists of making sure cutomers and thier families are happy with our quality and our service that we provide to them. I need to make sure that the customer doesnt comeback with any complaints, and if they do we will all we can to resolve the issue. YES WE CAN promotion."
good,Kohl's is a great company to work for. I've had the opportunity to grow in many areas and acquire new and needed knowledge I can carry along with me. I would definitely refer others to Kohls for employment.
good,"I enjoyed my employment at Kohls, it is very fast paced. Everyone there is very knowledgeable about their jobs and go out of their way to provide excellent service"
good,I think kohls is a great place to work. Especially if there is so many amazing people that work there too. Learn new things everyday. It's never boring to go to work suprizely
good,"I worked for Kohls for 3 years and don't have many complaints."
good,"Tons of extra hours on holidays, fast paced yet fun. The hardest part obviously is recovering but that is a part of the retail experience. Great first job, 10/10"
good,"would great customers who came and left, translated for spanish speaking customers, organized merchandise. friendly staff and very willing to help out. management was also good"
good,"The work place was very productive, always moving around or doing something work related. Quick-pace and slow-pace. Some days very busy, others were slow. On a busy day, I would get more than 50 customers at my cash register. On slow days I would get between 20 and 30 customers. I've learned that working at a quick-pace work place is to stay calm and collected with my work. The management of the company is great! Always checking on the employees."
good,"A typical day at work is helping customers, cleaning fitting rooms, putting out freight and cleaning the floor.  I have learned merchandising skills and how difficult it can be to keep a store running.  The management changes more than I would like and goes from one extreme to the other.  The hardest part of the job is trying to keep up with fitting rooms and cleanliness when it is so busy.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with."
good,"Overall it is a awesome job or career choice for any one for their first job, returning to work and even to launch a career. You will meet new people, build sales experience and even learn new and interesting things everyday."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Kohls is a good place to work but I needed a change. The industry is going through changes, and companies like Amazon are changing the buying habits of customers. I wanted to leave before they started getting rid of the long term employees."
good,got to unload and process the shipment then disperse it before the customers came in to shop. learning the back working of the job and getting it all ready and presentable for customers.
good,Every associate was very welcoming to the store/team. The job definitely helped to improve my communication skills with customers. It was fast-paced and you are taught how to do a little bit of each department. They are also open to training you if you are interested in learning how to work in another department.
good,"Kohls is an amazing place to work i loved it, on task a lot of work to do but its easy, get to talk to customers and helping them. you do alot of running around and the discounts are awesome"
good,must be a people person.  enjoyed engaging with customers and making sure they were satisfied.  gotta love sales so if not for you it is best that you find someplacwe else to work for.  really satisfied with this job and hated it ended
good,"It's a cool place to work, and you can move up fast if you're eager to put in the work. There are always challanges but always people willing to help you out as well."
good,"Worked at a different Kohls and it just wasn't the same. People here are so kind, generally the same with customers. The manager is great! Flexible hours are always a plus as well. Administration is always holding employee appreciation days/events. Food was ALWAYS provided during overnights and especially during the store being open 24 hours of rChristmas and Black Friday. They really appreciate and care for their employees on a professional and personal level! Fantastic place to work."
good,"I enjoyed going to work, I loved enteractting with people, I loved the people I worked with all around I had a great time. The hardest part of the job is standing on your feet for so long before you get a break."
good,Great management and people to work with. At Kohls we volunteered for events in the community. The events included walking a few miles to get the community motivated to participate on other walks that Kohls offered. We also had daily meetings with management and everyone was informed about new merchandise that was on sale.
good,I enjoyed working there the manager and supervisors were great. I learned a lot about customer service while working there. Good place to interact with customers.
good,I enjoyed the job and bosses they seemed to care about the product being sent out ... gave good breaks for the long shifts being worked and everyone seemed to get along great!
good,"I enjoyed working at Kohl's as a whole. Everything from my coworkers, my managers, and even the customers. Needless to say, I was disappointed to find out that I wouldn't be kept as a permanent employee."
good,Working at Kohl's was always fun and never dreadful. A lot of people shop there so we were always kept busy. I met new people who taught me things I needed to know and things I didn't know with things concerning the store and my career in general. The job itself isn't really hard I worked in home and kids which I would say is the easiest because you have to fold. The Management were friendly but unable to accommodate many people's schedules.
good,"It was a fun fast paced environment. There was always something to do, and customers to assist. I loved being able to help out the customers but I also loved getting in the zone to organize a clothing rack."
good,If you are young or want to get into the clothing or management industry its a great place to start or continue a career. Flexible and willing to accept school into the schedule.
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work.  They offer excellent compensation and benefits packages, and the people who work there are for the most part nice, good people."
good,I love my job. The one and only reason I am looking for a new job is because I need more pay. Most days go super quickly because there is always something to do.
good,"its a good job you learn different positions, jewelry, cashier, and people skills. The hardest part of the job is really nothing but making sure fitting rooms are done and cleaned and the floor is good. The most enjoyable part to me is the jewelry counter its a lot fun, meet new people every day!"
good,We would start off around 6 am with unloading a truck and basically distributing boxes to whatever department. It was fun. The team was great and there was always something to do.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"People are working here they are good they help a lot new employment"

good,after season not enough hours maybe four hours once a week. some managers were really great . the hardest part of the job was standing up during shifts great environment
good,"A typical day at kohl's was busy you're always on the move, you might have a 5 minute window period of not having work but it was always fast pace. The hardest part for me with this job was standing for so many hours at a time working over night it takes a toll on your body after a while. This is definitely a job I would do again during day shift."
good,Kohl's had a great atmosphere. Good people and a great view of clothing at all times. People their were helpful and seemed genuine. I  hated to leave. But the pay was not good.
good,This job consisted of me cleaning up the bathroom stalls cleaning up the whole store vacuuming the carpet cleaning the windows and making sure all the toiletries were refilled
good,Communication was great among the associates and management. Loved that we were crossed trained in many areas.  I loved helping customers find what they were looking for.  I love to stay busy and Kohl's was a busy place so it was all in enjoyable to me.  The scheduling grid was hard to get used to because there were so many employees.  It was easy for me to mix up the times and days I was supposed to be there.  Trying to reach management while not at work was next to impossible.  There was no separate line just for associates or if there was it was not disclosed to me.
good,"Kohls is a great place to work. I loved it from the first hours that I worked there, and considering I started on Black Friday at midnight that I'd truly saying a lot about the work environment. My coworkers are friendly and really trustworthy and the management really knows what they're doing."
good,During my time at Kohl's I experienced great management and associates. I loved helping the customers get the best deals possible and find the products they needed. Signing people up for credits was difficult at first but I learned the perfect way to sell it and ended up reaching my goal everyday.
good,Its a nice workplace that accommodates your personal or additional professional job.  A typical work day is helping customers and answering phone calls.  The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers.  Trying to help them leave with a good experience.  The hardest part of the job is trying to make the customer happy or satisfy.
good,"They hirer you as a seasonal employee and then you "
good,Great place to start out working at not the best to stay for a long time pay is not great. the work environment is great nice people and great chance to meet fun and exciting people.

good,Working in departments was great well as a cashier. Helping customers find what they want was amazing. It was a great experience.
good,The Management at Kohl's in Anderson is amazing. I love working there. They allow flexible scheduling and many people I work with go to school or work a second job. The computer and register system at Kohl's is easy to learn and the employee discount is good off everything in the store!
good,Working here left me with a lot of various experience in many different fields. I signed up for one position and left trained in many.  Good people to work for and with.  Had many good friends and nice customers.
good,"Great working environment.  Community involved with community events that bring associates and community neighborhoods together.  Typical work day starts with answering emails mostly concerning invoice reconciliation.  Also, manage leadership calendars, and travel arrangements.  Manage weekly agenda PowerPoint presentation, as well as ordering supplies for the building departments."
good,Great Company to work for. Definitely allowed me to build a great foundation. Has great opportunities for those in college. Growing in the company is possible.
good,It is a fun company to work for. You learn new things everyday. I love the deals we have for our customers. Kohls is not like other retail stores everyone working at Kohls is friendly and Nice. I can not begin to count how many customers tell me they love Kohls over other store because of deals that they get. Meaning you can use a percentage off with a dollar off coupon example 30%+ 20.00 Kohls cash.
good,I was just part-time employee there. So did not have much involvement in other areas.  Just do my job and go home.  I had to leave this job to go for a full time study in a community college
good,"Kohls was a very wonderful place to be employed , Very fast pace and all the workers as well as the Supervisors where always hard working and Helpful ."
good,"During a typical day, I have over 10,000 steps. I am always traveling throughout the store either unloading the truck of merchandise or putting the new merchandise out on the floor. Yet, I have become very familiar with how they run things and how fast pace this store becomes. The management is all very helpful and the co-workers excepted me as a new employee with open arms. Everyone quickly loved me even more, when they saw how quickly I learned and that I actually did the task that was asked. I have learned how to back stock merchandise, pull merchandise off the truck then organize it to which department it belongs to and put it in the proper place, and I have also learned how to properly fold to the Khols standards. "
good,"was a good place to work, not really long hours, was able to do my job and help with stocking and unloading of the trucks.  liked my manager and my co workers."
good,"friendly environment, helpful employees, optimistic co workers. always helping each and every customer. very faced paced work, a little caotic, but fun to be around"
good,Nice place to work. I enjoy working with my co workers. I hardest time working there is at closing. People really dont respect your time and dont like to leave
good,Helping customers day to day. providing great customer service. Making sure customers are well taken care of. Always report to management when there is a problem.
good,"I loved working at Kohl's! The atmosphere was also positive, productive, inviting. I also liked the discounts we got off of any merchandise we purchased."
good,"Typical work day was to cash customers out, maintain a clean area on sales floor, take customer returns, assist customers in their shopping and balance cash drawers at the end of the night."
good,Punch in and go to register.  Ring up customers.  Page for assistance.  Help stock when not busy.  Helpful management and co-workers.  The hardest part of the job being on your feet for long hours.  The best part helping customers.
good,I first worked at Khols for seasonal. It helped me get a work experience. It gave me the opportunity to try to balance a job and school at the same time. It really helped my understanding of what i should do when i'm working it gave me great opportunity to make friends. The hardest part of this job was balancing school and work. It was very difficult but i pulled through it/
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,A typical day at work for me was working in the juniors and womens sections. I learned how to properly stock merchandise as well as tidy up the clothes around my areas. Management was always nice and they were very professional yet down to Earth. My co- workers were always personable and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was working some over nights. This was hard because there are not many customers around and it is very slow and tends to drag on. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers with questions pertaining to my opinion in style.
good,"I love working for Kohls,the managers are awesome,I clean fitting rooms and straighten up my area,the managers are great,some of the best I have ever worked for.My co workers are friendly,and hard working.There is no hard part to this job,i enjoy what I do at Kohls."
good,"Great place to work, with great coworkers.  Easy place to work and you are treated with respect.  Very flexible hours to work and create your own schedule."
good,I love working here. You shouldn't work here if you don't like to be moving around constantly or if you like to complain and definitely not if you hate people. I love being able to help a customer find what they need. On crazy busy days I try to focus on the tasks I've been assigned and getting them done quickly. If you focus on the negative stuff you'll hate Kohl's but it's pretty hard to hate such a great place.
good,"I enjoy working with great people and staff. The opportunity to meet wonderful customers and knowing that you are helping to place a smile on someone face is ""Priceless""."
good,"it was good seasonal money"
good,All the coworkers were so helpful and nice and shared a well meaning friendship. The managers were like older brothers or sisters to us. it was a perfect environment
good,Kohl's is an amazing place to work. The management goes out of their way to make everyone feel welcome. They make sure that you are awarded for going the extra mile and they definitely go out of their way to make sure we work in a very fair and fun environment.
good,"I have been working with kohls for 2 years now. My managers are very cool, and they care about there employees. I work in the misses, mens, and junior department. basically answering customers phone calls, helping at the register, cleaning out fitting rooms, putting back recover and doing other little projects around the store. The are very flexible when it comes scheduling. You will get hours as long as you do your work and come to work on time."
good,"Good place to work, flexible hours. Retail is hard work especially during the holidays, now with the after Christmas sales it has calmed down  to where you get a feel of the merchandise and selling. "
good,"A typical day at Kohls would be very rushed, heave flow of people until closing time. I learned how to manage and get things done even when being swamped with things to do. Multitasking becomes second nature to you after a short while. You learn to deal with heavy days with great co-workers that always have a smile on their face and are always willing to help. "
good,"I am in customer service and do returns, sales, account payments and stock management.  I have learned many aspects of retail and how to deal with difficult customers in a pleasant friendly way.  Management from Store Manager to E3's are fabulous.  I can't say enough good things about them all.  Most of the coworkers are hard working people and always there when you need them.  The hardest part of my job is very nasty customers who want something for nothing or argue because of a company policy that can not override; I am blamed by these customers for being to structured because I go by policies that are set by corporate Kolhls. Most enjoyable part is the interaction I have with most customers."
good,Kohl's was a very productive place to work with great customers and awesome staff members. I really enjoyed worker there as a cashier and a sale associate.
good,kohls is a company that prides themselves on a tidy enviorment for the customers and well dressed emploiees. when on truck grew there is a time frame to get everything of the truck so it is ready for customers when store opens.
good,I enjoy working in the kohl's atmosphere with the friendly customers and also my co workers. My work experience with this company has has helped me to grow in was of running a department and working on my strengths and weeknesses
good,Kohl's is a great place to work in the retail industry.  The compensation and benefits are some of the best in the industry.
good,Wear comfortable shoes at all time. Be confident and help others .. Upsell. Know your departments smile and always greet customers.
good,"Every personnel of management is very supportive. They are very big on attendance, but this expected with any company. For the most part my co-workers are fun and respectful people."
good,"If you're happy to be in a place that is always rushing, this would be a good job to have. The only reason I had to quit is due to not having good transportation."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,The hardest part about working at kohls was when you was transferring the managers would take months to get you in to the new stores and there was not a lot of hours available.
good,"Kohls is diverse, promotes advancement, and flexible with regards to scheduling. Encourages employee input. Everyday is different and always rewarding. Managers care about their associates on both personal and professional level, open door policy. Commendation is always given."
good,"Alright place to work, relaxed could work at own pace.  Decent people to work around and was good about giving family time."
good,There was always something to do. Learned how to multitask and move throughout different departments. Goals were always clear and reachable
good,"I would recommend this company, fun fast paced. Management  cares about their employees.Very good with breaks and time off."
good,"Few things are as fun as helping kids achieve their potential."
good,"very fun and energetic, there is always something new going on that can get all the customers  and the employees involved. meeting new people and new hires cause you can learn a lot of them. and they can learn a  lot from you."
good,"It was a great place to work, if you love clothes, and if you have a family! They do volunteer work and it gives you a chance to get to know your coworkers outside of the work place."
good,"Team members were great everyone worked together to complete a comon goal, was moved around a bit to learn most of the store in a short period of time."
good,I really enjoyed working at Khols. I had decent hours and the manager was very respectful and flexible. I learned excellent customer service and enjoyed my peers
good,"Fun work place with excellent management. Not always about how fast you get the job done, but more so on quality of your work."
good,I love to shop and get great deals. I loved my experience in retail. I was top credit opener for months. I also was awarded employee of the month 3 times out of the 4 years I was there. You are only allowed to be employee of the month once a year. Talking to people and helping them work with there budget to make ends meet. I have also trained a lot of people in retail and also trained someone to be a supervisor.
good,"Kohls was a wonderful experience where you got to meet very nice people, both co-workers and customers!"
good,"When I first started working at Kohl's, I would help put fixtures together so we could stock them with merchandise."
good,"The work was easy, and the atmosphere was very laid back and pleasant. The management was passive-aggressive at times but not unbearable. Nobody forced you to do anything, and they were always willing to try and make sure you were doing something you hated less than others."
good,managers try and work with you the environment is clean. very easy and fast paced. they train you in other job titles.co workers want to work and get the job done. the job goes by quick if you stay focused.
good,"Kohl's was amazing company to work for. The staff and management were a pleasure to work with. The discounts, schedule were good benefits."
good,"Work started at 10, we gathered in the back before hand and discussed what would be happening that night. Some times we would have shipments to unload but other than that we just stocked shelves."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"start off with fun workout, work until the work was finish,"
good,Working at Kohl's was a Great experience.  I worked in the shipping and receiving dept.  I enjoyed my coworkers.  Management was very helpful.  The hardest part of my job was probably doing inventory where we were locked in for an all night.  I really enjoyed the relationships I built with many coworkers.
good,This employment is a great place to work. The management is really good and the over all culture of the environment is a good place to also establish and build meaningful relationships.
good,"great company to work for. I wished it was closer to where I live as it was a 30 minute drive one way for me. some of the managers are nice to work for, but when I went to my interview I had asked not to put me on schedule for 4 hours at a time, but they did."
good,Kohl's is a good place of employment but the benefits and job advancement are not the greatest. The business in general is very respectful and treats every one the same no matter culture.
good,"I worked here for 3 1/2 year the pay, overtime, and bonus was a plus. Another plus was being able to by extra 2 weeks of vacation. The health benefits are top notch."
good,I stayed busy at all times. I got to meet new people and and do new things. It was a positive environment and the management was great.
good,"My first job in a retail clothing environment, I was allowed to grow in all areas of the store from clothing and shoes to small electrics, housewares, table-top, bed and bath, rugs seasonal and toys.  I also trained in the jewelry, Point-of-sale and Customer Service(returns) areas of responsibilities.  Kohl's has excellent co-workers and Managers and some of the best Customers anywhere."
good,"Sometimes it would get very busy with returns, and purchases for tax season, it would make the day go by so fast and other times it was frustrating."
good,Everyone is helpful and friendly overall.  Mangement works with you to help you do your best job. The hardest part of the job was being on your feet all day but that is retail and is expected. I enjoyed meeting and working with customers and being able to assist them with their needs.
good,"I have worked as a point of sale associate for Kohl's for 5 years, all throughout college. Kohl's is VERY flexible with my hours, and understanding of my crazy college schedule. They really allow me to put my education first. Kohl's has allowed me to transfer to three different locations no problem when I transferred schools and/or moved.  It is a fun part-time job for students. The only downside is the pay (which is expected out of a part-time job for someone without a degree). After working there for 5 years, all of my raises combined have not amounted to a full $0.75. When I was first hired, I was making $7.45 hourly, and now, 5 years later, I am making $8.19 hourly."
good,I loved my job and I loved the people I worked with. My only reason I left is because the pay was not good at all. I had great managers and they were very supportive. Wish there was more opportunity to advance in pay when you perform well.
good,"While Working at Kohl's, I first started out in the Dressing Rooms as an M.J.M (Men's, Junior, Misses). Keeping the Fitting Room cleaned out and putting away all clothes. After working in M.J.M, I wanted to branch out to other departments! I then cross-trained in P.O.S (Point of Sale), working at the front of the store checking customers out and opening Kohl's charge Cards. After a short while doing both M.J.M and P.O.S, I then was asked to be trained in Jewelry. Jewelry then became my main department, helping organize the jewelry, inform customers of sales, handle expensive rings and watches etc..."
good,The co-workers are great. The management is very compassionate about their employers and job duties. The work environment is very comfortable. Their are some hardworking co-workers. The hardest part of the job is making sure all customers receive great customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job is the management team and the great customers.
good,The team members were all so friendly. Everyone helped everyone. I was only there for a year but I still was promoted from Cashier to Guest Services. it was a lot harder job but worth it. The only reason why I left was because I had moved and the commute was too far and their was no availability for a transfer. But the costumers who came build a relationship with you and it was hard to say goodbye to them as well as the team members
good,my typical day of work was to get the customers out as fast as possible from the store.
good,"Work environment was friendly and supportive. A typical day consisted of moving inventory, replenishing warehouse and open order supplies. Additional experiences included working in the shipping, receiving, and bagging departments. Coworkers were also friendly and supportive management and employees worked cohesively as a team effort."
good,Kohl's is a great place to work with friendly co-works and friendly managers.
good,great work place.people are friendly and you learn better ways to help people with the things they need
good,"Excellent working environment, great work life balance. Compensation could be better. Chances for advancement within the company are not good, to much politics involved."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Gained a lot of experience. The jobs were sometimes tedious, but they must be done.  Great work for students."
good,I was a cashier. Working during the holiday season was the worst because the store stayed out until midnight or later but that's part of the job. The managers and my coworkers were very friendly and understanding.
good,My typical work day at Kohl's was a steady paste of energy. I learned how to transfer calls and the way the register worked. Management was excellent. The managers were very respectful and fair. The co-workers were very friendly and also respectful. The hardest part was when the manager put me on the floor from the register and it started to get a little busy for my first time. I needed to learned quick where items were located to be able to help my cashier co-workers when they needed a location on an item for a customer at the front. The most enjoyable part of the job was during the Christmas holiday. I love seeing everybody attach their spirit with the holidays with joy.
good,"I would get to work, clock in. Check in with my supervisors on my tasks for that day. Depending on the time of the year, the tasks varies. I learned a great deal about the the whole retail world. My management crew were very helpful, in terms of showing me the ropes, being very understandable with my school schedule, being flexible with hours as well. I would say that the hardest part of the job was Black Friday. Working a 12 hour shift from 12p-12a, dealing with the holiday madness, and trying to answer to demanding customers was extremely hard to deal with. At the same time, my most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. Being able to help them out on a daily basis, helping them find their, ""YES!"""
good,"The co-workers were very out-going. They managers kept every thing in order at all times and made sure things were getting done when needed. The store was very clean, and organized."
good,"I enjoyed learning the retail experience with a large company such as Kohls. Working with many different types of people was nice. Being in a supervisory role allowed me to pass on my experience and share my skills. I held three different positions at Kohls and experienced the retail process from all four corners of the building customer service, merchandise presentation, merchandise processing, and team building. I wore many different hats so there wasn't a ""typical"" day, but each day was busy and always needed to be prioritized to complete all tasks. Having three other supervisors at my level made it more enjoyable as we worked together."
good,content and fast pace environment . the staff here are all sweet people and supportive .
good,Love learning the newest fashion brands and styles to keep up to date. Great friendly staff.
good,"Working with different kinds of people. Watching what people werew buying, generally caused me to spent my paycheck in the store. Kohl's has some really great things at reasonable prices. Sales combined with employee discounts meant I paid next to nothing for great things."
good,"I enjoyed fulfilling the needs of the customers, branching out to my co-workers and learning from them. Overall I enjoyed the energy I received working there."
good,"typical day at work would be coming in with a smile on your face, greeting customers, assisting customers in finding products/ exchanges/ resturns/ account. there was always a lead on the floor to ensure everyone is doing their job, making sure we are greeting our customers or staying busy, making sure everyone got their required break. the co workers were always friendly and supportive and willing to help pick up. the hardest part of the job was trying to sell kohls credit to customers, but we still had to try, we had a goal to meet everyday. the most enjoyable part of the job was to interact with the customers and the co workers. everyone knew how to make it worth it every day coming in."
good,Nice place to work! Great people to work with and snacks and meals on special occasions. Pay could be hire to keep associates.
good,"A typical day at work included ringing up customers and bagging their items. This job was fun because you really got to interract with the customers. I learned that you really needed to be friendly and to have patience, with some customers. The management was mostly okay, there was just some manager, or E3, that was not as welcoming or friendly as the others. The hardest part of the job was probably trying to get customers to sign up for the charge card for the store. Regardless of how hard that was, the most enjoyable part was that the people I worked with were very nice and made me feel at home."
good,"packing and picking department was exiting."
good,This was my very first job and it was a great start. I enjoyed the staff and customers. The store was very well organized and I had a pleasant time during my stay there. I was a cashier and lead customers in a speedy checkout process. I also would greet customers upon arrival and when leaving the store. The hardest part of the job was learning to maneuver throughout their computer system and also figuring out the sales for the day which sometimes were not clearly relayed. Staff and managers were always polite.
good,"Clock in, get my morning assignment from supervisor. A typical day at work for me is normally doing the side work that needs to be done and the hardest part of the job is management telling us that we're slow and that we have to VTO. My co-workers are amazing individuals."
good,"You need to work hard and focus on what the district manager needs to be done for the company.  I had a pretty good experience with a great management team at the end of the time I was there.  If you have a good management team, then you will enjoy working for Kohls."
good,"I loved everything about working for Kohl's  ! from management to the customers and my co-workers . Everyone was so friendly it was like we were all a big family . The hardest part of the job for me was leaving , because of the pay . I needed more money and they only paid minimum wage and i was a part time associate . If I had the chance to come back as a full time associate , I would surely accept the offer ."
good,"the atmosphere is very positive and the energy is upbeat, there is pressure to get accounts as all retail jobs ect,the co-workers are cool and fun and the store manager is sunshine to be around it's not so much pressure all around in the positions. the only issue is the pay."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"We start at the same time every workday, and management holds meetings for what we need and listen to what we say. The hardest part of my job was the distance and the hours. Managers often listened to what we had to say and were open minded. Co-workers were helpful especially the ones that were there the longest."
good,"A typical day at work for me is always an productive one, even if they a'rent busy days. I've learned to keep myself busy and occupied during those moments finding more work to do or sharing any new ideas that had in mind that would benefit the store. Management team has always been great. Nothing better than working and surrounding myself around positive people. I usually have gotten along with all my co workers. We all were team players, their to help one another and focus on one specific task. Hardest part of the job was knowing if we've reached our quota everyday. The more sales we got, the better opportunities we had. Most enjoyable part is just the experience alone. i love being around people and helping them, so i really appreciate any opportunity i get where i can help someone out."
good,"Working at Kohl's was the first job I ever had as a teenager and I worked there for just over 5 years. "
good,Kohl's is like my second family. The associates I work with are all so wonderful to work with.
good,"It was a good job experience, an employee can see himself/ herself growing in an environment like that."
good,"Unload the truck and replenish merchandise, ability to get scheduled days off if necessary without much hassle"
good,Really enjoyed working for Kohl's. It did require very irregular and long hours for Key carrying managers.
good,"Kohls is a great place to work, the discounts rock, very east job, but the standing will hurt after a while"
good,As a seasonal job I helped out with Black Friday. I worked as a bagger one day and then I was a line monitor. As a line monitor I made things flow easier for the cashiers.
good,Helping customers check out and find products they were looking for. The management and co-workers were really nice people to work around. I loved working with all the customers and meeting new people.
good,"Come into work, clock in and go to the jewelry department. Depending on the time of day I would either start helping customers, stock things, or replenish the clothing section. The hardest part of this job would have to be dealing with a lot of customers at once while the only one in my department. The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers and my coworkers themselves."
good,"I loved this job, although Retail was not my first choice. It was unfortunate that it was only a PT/temporary Holiday position."
good,"•	Provide quality service to customers."
good,I learned lots more then I had already known about retail at this job. I met some great co-workers.
good,They took pride in training their employees correctly and was a great place to build a career.
good,"One of the employees to help get every shift stocked, the back of the dock,price inqury."
good,"Great way to get extra cash for the holidays, worked close to 40 hours a week sometimes more.  During the holidays too much food, gained weight."
good,"I enjoyed working there even though it was just seasonal, I just wish I could work there permenant, but i didnt, but i dont have anything bad to say about this job either."
good,"I enjoyed working for Kohl's for the 6+ years that I did. They provided great pay, monthly bonuses, and incentives for hard work well done. I learned how to deal with difficult behaviors, and how to get a customer to ""like paying you"", for the company. My co-workers were great, always caring and supportive. The hardest part of Collections is separating the ""personal"" from the ""business"" when a customer is verbally attacking you. I enjoyed most about the job was the flexible work arrangements/work/life/balance that was offered."
good,i loved the job and the co - workers a good place to work if you need to get on your feet
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Expected work day was strenuous enough to keep you busy, but not run you into the ground.  Break room is definitely a plus, their own cafeteria, plus some decent fringe benefits beyond that."
good,A very excellent place to work starting off in the work field.
good,a day at work for me would be getting everything done on time having a good team of co workers to work with the hardest part of the job would be when you done have the team work you need to accomplish everything the most enjoyable part for me is being able to work in a place where you get to learn new things
good,"Productive and fun workplace with great co-worker, understanding supervisors. a typical day at work was audits,ticketing, divides. The hardest jobs was shipping and the most enjoyable was helping out a co-worker and getting a check."
good,"Typical day would be, come in, get the coupons/kohls cash ready. Clean your area. Kohls is a super busy store so if you are at the register, you are always so busy. Which is great, some days are slow, but if they are, you can go out of you area, and fold clothes, or straighten up a few things near you.Things I learned from Kohls is how to move super fast. That is a super fast paced store. One minute you have 2 customers the next the line has 30 people. The hardest part of the job is keeping up. The most enjoyable part of the job is coming into work with great co-workers and management."
good,"I have worked in an office most of my life. "
good,"A typical day is greeting customers and helping them with anything that they need, handling payments for the store credit card and running the register. "
good,Enjoy meeting customers.  Management was always fair.  Working as a cashier was a great experience.  Most of all I enjoy talking with the customers.
good,Loved working there just happened to be bad management at the time I was there. It has been corrected I am told. Loved the district managers. They always wanted things done the proper way by the book!
good,"day to day store operation"
good,Being able to explore different types of jobs in this business
good,"Typical Day at work was being repsonsable for greeting every customer that walked in the door, helping customers find a product by paging/calling the appropriate department, checking customers items out. Being responsible in helping loss prevention. Soliciting credit. Handling credit card payments. Also handling exchanges, comments, concerns, refunds, and answering telephones while in customer service. "
good,"As a cashier I send my day dealing with customers, and handling sales transactions. At the end of each shift I return non-purchased items back to the sales floor."
good,"a typical day at work was fast paced and busy seeing new faces all day long and even the regular customers. i learned the retail system easily my co-workers were very respectful, energetic, and very dependable,the hardest part of the job was trying to keep the fitting rooms clean on a busy day or when a shipment came in, the most enjoyable part of the job was everybody made eachother feel comfortable."
good,"I go into work and help unload a truck.  We have a great time talking while working and helping each other.  I have learned how to work with people that I may not like in order to get the job done.  Management is friendly to a point, they know when to be a friend and when to be a boss.  While I may not like all my co-workers I enjoy going to work.  I think the hardest part of the job is not having enough help and equipment to get the job done correctly.  I have worked at Kohls for 9 years so everyone there is a family to me.  I enjoy going to work to see my second family."
good,A typical day at Kohl's was very calm and we had a lot of goals to meet which made the day very productive. The hardest part was meeting the set goals with the Kohl's card.
good,As a cashier it was a great place to work. I learned a lot of the retail side and how hard working there was. overall it was a great place to work.
good,"I started working at Kohl's after my children were in school full time. I learned department merchandising, pos training, and sales strategies. I was responsible for ad-setting, clearancing updates, stock, recovering merchandise to department, transferring special orders to other stores, and running a clean and organized department. I trained associates in my department and also took calls into the department. I enjoyed interacting with management as well as co-workers and loved being busy. The hardest part of the job was leaving, I needed to spend time with my Mom, who was in ill health. I enjoyed giving great customer service the most."
good,It was the first time I worked retail/POS. It was seasonal from October to January. Great for extra money for the holidys.
good,"Got paid every Friday, my bosses made sure that I was well trained. Group interview was intimidating and I thought I messed up big time but received a call back a day later for training. Good people and good memories."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management.

good,Kohl's is a fun place to work - every day is different. I like to interact with the customers and enjoy my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is trying to get everything done while still keeping the customers happy.
good,I started as cashier then showed good performance and promoted to 09 position and also working at customer service
good,Kohl's has nothing but positive reinforcement with everything you accomplish. I never have a question that what II'm doing is contributing to something bigger and better than myself. Nationwide company with midwestern values.
good,"Managers weren't the nicest, and didnt care about the employees but only about the company itself."
good,"Co-workers were always friendly, E3'S were very helpful along"
good,"well being on time is the most important part of having a job. wwaking up early is a change but hard work pays-off so i dont mind some work. the hardest part of my job is walking on your feet for two hours straight. the most fun is working for my cash, theirs enjoyable woman and the men have curtisy for others."
good,This was my first retail job and I learned a lot. I was responsible for scanning and printing all of the signs in the store then we would put them up to be presented for the sale the next morning. This started off as just a night job but eventually I worked the floor more and was responsible for keeping customers happy and helping them find whatever they needed.
good,"a typical day at the job was for me to be at the cashier for 8 hors of the day and assisting cstomers with their wants and need of the company, my management was the most enjoyable part of the company because they were always there to help and gave a fun experience while learning . the hardest part of the job was not being able to help the customers complaints."
good,The employees and management all welcome you with open arms. The hardest part is actually closing because of the store being larger.
good,"Customer Service as a Cashier, keeping work area clean, helping where ever I was needed and work any hours needed. Enjoyed the people contact."
good,"I learned to work as a group, had a fantastic team and leader. Hardest part of the job was the daily changes concerning our job, it was changes every day. Outstanding managers and co workers, enjoyed the bonuses and extras we received."
good,"I work in the shoe department.I start out my day by straightening up my dept. then i start helping customers.I also work at the register when i am needed.I love what i do I just wish i could get more hrs.and money.I originally applied for management,but i guess there was a better applicant than me but i am glad they gave me a shot to prove myself"

good,Nice Retail place to work. Flexible and management is great! Wish I would have never left full time there.
good,I had worked in the retail business in the past and I enjoy meeting and working with the public. There are some times you need to step up and help a customer more than others to help them have a good outcome.
good,I absolutely loved working there. the people were super nice and it was an easy job as long as you did what you were told. I loved my manager because he was always a ball of fire and put a smile on everyone’s faces.
good,"Great office personal and everyone very helpful.There is a lot to handle though, people leave everything everywhere and do need to replace everything 5 minutes after your done. But that's retail life so just keep in mind your there to pick up everything all day and you'll do good."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Loved working at Kohl's. Management was great and cared about the employees. The management had plenty of employees so I never felt that I had to fill in every week for someone that called in sick, very well managed. Benefits were great for the employees with prizes and bonuses for great customer service and sales.  Also, the company prized hard work and felt that I could move up in the company if I went on full-time."
good,"Overall I enjoyed my brief time as a seasonal employee at Kohl's distribution center. I have been working at various industries for over 40 years and the management team at Kohl's was amongst the best. However, there were 2 employees, both used for training newcomers, who were compete oddballs who made work difficult. The one was completely obnoxious and condescending in her remarks but she was good at her job so her behavior was excused. "

It is such a fun and loving environment and anyone would be lucky to work there full time."
good,Kohl’s is really nice and a fun place to work. You also gain friendships and learn to grow. The hardest part of the job was when they put me on the sales floor because I haven’t been on the floor that much.
good,Made friends and money over Christmas break. The hours were very flexible. The manager encouraged me to do anything I thought would help the business and I was a great worker.
good,"When thinking of retail, people will give you horror stories. Not much of that happened at the Kohls I was working at. Retail in its self is terrble but the people I work with are AMAZING. Even the management is amazing. Everyone is your friend there. Pay is what it is expected to be. The worst part is working all those  holidays while your friends and family spend the time off!"
good,"I love the location because of the diversity of customers. I have customers from all across the world who come in (India, Yemen, France, Spain, Mexico, Mongolia, etc) and shop. I love when they tell me stories about their homeland and how far they have traveled to come to the US to support their family.  The managers always have positive attitudes and are very helpful to the employees."
good,"I love working here. The people are so nice and social, my managers are so understanding and fun, and the hours are super flexible. They will work with you and your schedule. Working at Kohl’s literally just feels like a whole other second family because everyone is so close. If you don’t mind the mediocre pay, this place is wonderful to work at!"

good,Very caring to the individual. Any time off needs you have due to children or any other responsibilities aren't an issue at Kohls. They care a lot about helping
good,Waste of time it was the biggest mistake of my life because they were so confused with hours like always the manager was horrible and I’m gonna report them in the future for racism .
good,While being employed at Kohl’s distribution I learned a lot retail . My least favorite part of the job we’re the break sets but overall it was a good laid back job
good,"It was a fun job experience. Really great for a high school students first job. Only down side is that management is on you to sell credits, and its very slow at times."
good,"The managers are amazing, they always make sure that the rest f us employees are taken cared of. the provide special events with food and raffles in the breakroom. The give badges based upon efficient work, and you can move up within the job."

good,"Love the environment. The workers are great, fun and easy to get along with as well as be work great together. A lot of teamwork."

good,It is a fun place to work.  People are nice and easy to work with.  I do get to meet a lot of people that live around here.  The management is easy to work with also.  I like working with all the fashion.
good,I worked here for three years! I stayed because the management team was amazing! I was so sad to leave but had to quit because of getting accepted to a university. I still have great relationships with everyone I worked for and with!
good,"I absolutely love working for kohl’s. I was hired for seasonal but I have plans in making it long term permanent. Friendly working environment, great team work, learned so many new skills and I am excited to pursue my career with kohls"
good,"The seasonal position at Kohl's was nice. I enjoyed the accommodations for breaks, ventilated areas, great work enviroment & the diversity. The schedule was very straight forward & the peak was very fast paced."
good,I got to move around I didn't have to remain in one spot.I like using guns in I liked learning about them.I like my job schedule it was convenient for me.
good,I liked working for Kohl's this was my first job ever and I learned a lot from working there they give you space to grow within the company only problem was the pay just wasn't enough for me to live off
good,"Although slow sometimes due to certain times of the year, Kohls was a fun place to work and offered great discounts especially around the holidays and hours weren't bad at all."
good,Has a great experience at the store I worked at.  Had a change in management  which led to  a younger more up to date outlook.  They really care for the associates and  you want to come to work. Everyone cares for you there and people will cook and bake things and share just because as well as management
good,"the kohl’s in clearwater was so much more laid back. don’t get me wrong, the work was fast paced but everyone was laid back. my managers were always amazing with me and always helpful no matter their personal workload. very good store especially when it comes to organization and team work!"
good,"Kohls was a great place to work. The management provided opportunities for growth, there was a good balance between work and meetings. There was a lot of volunteer events and non-work events to build team energy."
good,"Everyone worked as a team, and the managers were amazing! they cared for their employees so much! The only downfall are the rude customers but that's every retail job."
good,"I really liked working at Kohls  , with nice people , flexible scedule. But they hire just part time , and of low salary and also i was hired just for the holidays. They hired me again after 3 months not seasonal but same, part time , they give you just two working days. So thats the cons in this company. Eveything was great."
good,I absolutely loved working for this company. They spoil their employees and have a wonderful work enviroment. I wish that I could've relocated to the new call center whenever my center closed.
good,"fun place to work as a seasonal employee, detailed training and opportunities to learn other areas and positions  of store would have loved to continue employment after season  just didn't work out"
good,I had a blast every day and was excited to show up to work. Management was very flexible and reasonable with time off and availability. Extra hours where always available and actually encouraged.

Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,My experience with Kohl's was amazing. From the management to my coworkers we all worked great together as a team. The customers were always a pleasure to assist whether it was looking for an item or helping them order from the kiosk.
good,Working at kohls was one of the best working environments I have ever worked in. Co-workers were extremely helpful and respectful to each other. Everyone acted as a team to highly satisfy customers keeping them returning. There were opportunities to advance in a career and offered benefits. I had also made great friends while being employed at kohls.
good,"Still work there. It's a great company with endless opportunities to grow. Well, if your patient enough that is. Great if you want to challenge yourself as a leader."
good,"From seasonal to part time flex , this company is amazing !! This is beyond the best job i have ever had and i wish i wouldve stayed !! Its fast paced , fun and challenging!!"
good,"Been here 8 years and I have to be honest and say that if it's your only job you might be in trouble because the hours are unpredictable and not very consistent if you're part time. But still, I love the job, I love the variety of things I can learn and do, and most of all I love the people here. When I'm here I feel at home and I can't imagine not working here."
good,First attendance is super huge but this is an amazing company even the customers arent really that bad. The training sucks if your a fast learner. Pay is good
good,"Working at Kohl’s is pretty decent. The pay could be better but the management is exceptional, and they actually care about their employees. Flexible hours and room for improvement."

good,"An amazing job for retail, even the customers are great! Communication is great and managers are always willing to answer questions, even a silly one!"
good,I absolutely LOVE the store I work for. Management is the best team I've been apart of. We all work together to get things done. Sadly I'll be moving soon but will be applying at the nearest kohls.
good,Excellent place of employment. I can actually genuinely say that i enjoyed working for this company and would highly recommend any other persons to apply. I don't believe the pay is enough for the tremendous amount of work that we do. I walk about 6-10 miles at work for only $9 an hour.
good,The environment is very positive and great management team and I had a lot of challenging obstacles. I like that my skills got noticed and got the promotion I deserved
good,Kohls could be stressful at times. However management always worked on ways to relax us and keep us distressed. Overall it was a great company to work for.
good,I love working at Kohl's! I get to go to work and enjoy the people I work with and get freight done faster. Kohl's is a good place to wprk because we believe in hospitality.
good,"Kohl's has a very quiet store, and is a very calm environment. I learned how to properly assist customers when finding products on the retail floor. The hardest part of he job would be the unflexible hours."
good,Kohl's had a great group of people to work with. The management was excellent. Retail is always a busy job and with good people to work with it made an awesome place to work.
good,Gained experience in customer support that I believe will help further my career. Employees were kind and worked together to achieve a smooth workday experience.
good,Kohls is great for college students because the store was great with adjusting your schedule to new semesters. They were also very good at giving you the hours you requested.
good,"Learned a lot while working at Kohl's. I've Learned how to talk to people, how to make sure customers leave happy, and learned a lot of patients while working there."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Khols is a fast paced retail store with various advancement and growth opportunities. Khols promotes community based initiatives by allowing employees to volunteer for Habitat for Humanity, Food Banks, and Cancer Walks/Drives."
good,I had a great time working for Kohl't. They offered flexible schedules and hours. The management was nice and very friendly. Kohl's gave an opportunity for people to volunteer. This job taught me how to have patience with customers because some will try you !
good,"It was a great first job. Training could have been better. They only gave about two days of shadowing before putting you on the floor and if you wanted training in other departments you would have to ask. It was a very relaxed working environment, but did have a dress code to follow. Everyone worked together. The hardest part was move up in the company. Unless you could relocate you had to wait for someone to leave their position before you could move forward."
good,"I worked at Kohl's as a Part Time employee for many years and I loved working there. I liked the people. I would've stayed there if they would've paid be more money, full time hours, and also, advancement in my career."
good,"I enjoy the work I do at Kohls.  Manager is very fair.  Associates all very nice.  The scheduling is a little tough, but can live with it.if you are interested for work at kohls, it is a very high pa ed job."
good,"there was a manager that was kind of strict, more strict than the rest but he mostly just wants things done his way. Overall, everyone there is really nice and makes it a good work place. Everyone helped everyone when they could, a very family like vibe. The hardest part was just dealing with random customers that have attitudes or are just hateful, but that's just dealing with a job that deals with the public. Overall the job itself was pretty good during the holiday season, I just didn't want to continue the position because they cut hours back drastically after the holiday ends."
good,"Fun autmoshere, friendly co workers, great management, hiring events and hires are friendly and professional, HR did an engredible job during peak season. Very pleased with my experience, would work for them again seasonal, and permanent, I would recommend to a friend, who could appreciate the hours and pay, pay rate is competitive for surrounding area!,  great job Kohl’s."
good,it was a good experience working with Kohls. I have encouraged a couple of my friend to join Kohls. I am also planning to go back if they offer competitive pay.
good,"One of my first jobs, I had such a great learning experience in social skills and providing great customer service. I definitely would recommend to a friend and thank you for the experience."
good,"The company underwent a rebranding several years ago. The company now focuses on maintaining a safe and respectful work environment to all of its employees. Management is very understanding of situations that occur between employees and customers and strike a good balance between providing the customer what they need and protecting their employees from harassment. The one downside is the constant need to push credit cards, which determines store performance."
good,"I am a people person I absolutely love this job. The hardest part of my job is probably when I do not know how to help a customer. The most enjoyable part of my job is keeping the customers happy,"
good,"working for kohls has been fun, the management are kind and hard working, they work with you to make sure the job gets taught right, making you a better employee"
good,it was ok very and were not reasonable with changing the amount of hours were able to work very hard to the way things work in the store it was very busy job
good,"My position was temporary, but they offered me permanent and I decided the job I was doing would interfere with my school schedule. I applied for Sales Associate/ Cashier and specifically told them I would prefer to work afternoons/nights due to school next semester. They gave me Ad Set, 4 am or 5 am - 9 am or 10 am. Regardless, it was an experience because my job prior was my first job ever. I would recommend as an entry to department store work."
good,While working at Kohl's your main focus is customers and the store credit card. Managers and staff made working there fun. You have meetings during shift change about the store and what to do. Staff at Kohl's are very helpful and friendly.
good,"I love working at the Kohls in Carrollton.  The management team is awesome...and so is my co workers.  The only negative for me is the hourly pay.  Other than that, I LOVE IT!"
good,"The management was great to work with. Most co-workers were easy to get along with. I was glad that I explored this sort of career, it interested me a lot. Until they started making me stocking things."
good,the job is okay sometime it can be hard and manger sometime don't like my ideas and it's can be a fast pass and sometime they tell you to go home. Sometimes the boss doesn't help when i ask for there help
good,"This is a great first job. I don't if its same for all Kohls but where I worked the people were great. The management made sure that everyone was treated fair or that we were happy. The job is not stressful, only during the holidays when it gets the most busy."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Though retail may not be my thing, I did enjoy working for Kohl's. They truly are remarkable. I love that they have so many volunteering opportunities.I liked interacting with customers and getting to try different jobs."

good,Everyone is always on the move and willing to help one another to reach company goals. All Leads are willing to pass on their knowledge in the workplace and to give opportunities to advance in the company
good,"Great co-workers and management. Very enjoyable work. Nice environment to work in. The only bad aspect is the amount of hours given. The hours are very low,so a second job is advised."
good,"During a typical day at Kohl's, there is always something to do in order to stay productive and organized. I learned how to be more organized and responsible. The managers at Kohl's were awesome, really nice and good at helping you stay on task or answering questions that you might have. In my opinion, the hardest part of the job would be getting people to apply for credit cards and the most enjoyable part of working at Kohl's is getting to know your coworkers and helping out customers."
good,The store I am at is very flexible with working hours. I do find that the management can be very inconsistent when it comes to different policies and procedures.
good,"Great place to work, Management is great and so is the other employees. Learn a lot of different jobs which makes things go fast. Meet a lot of nice customers."
good,"I enjoyed working at Kohl's it was a clean, friendly, and safe environment. I learned a lot about retail while working at Kohl's. The management was very well and secured at Kohl's. I didn't have much of a hard time working at Kohl's because whenever I needed help with something the Employees were always friendly and helped me out. The most enjoyable part at Kohl's was being able to help the customers find certain items in the store, It was my first ever experience in retail and I enjoyed it very much."
good,"The hardest part of the job is definitely dealing with angry customers. Working in retail I dealt with a lot of people and some unhappy people. I love interacting with people and asking if they needed any assistance. The most Enjoyable part of my day would definitely be our meetings we had twice a day, everyday. The meetings were relaxed and just a chance to decompress from running around all day."
good,"The managers are great, funny, and inclusive. If you're a new person, it might be difficult to make friends since it's a bit clique-y but once you find the right people, it'll make work more enjoyable."
good,"I had a very great experience at Kohl's. The interview/drug test was quick and straightforward. I started working two weeks later. Everyone was very friendly and we had daily meetings. One supervisor had no problem helping out when workers were short. Overall everything was very fast paced during seasonal, but very easy."
good,"Everyone at Kohl's was so nice and helpful. I truly enjoyed working for them, even if only for a short time. Thank you everyone for all of your help and friendships. All of the H2's were great to work with. I loved the culture. Everyone worked together as a team and helped each other. The hardest part was standing on my feet more than 4 hours."
good,This job had a  great mix of fast and slow pacing. I'll probably go back to work there again but had to quick due to personal reasons. The pay is great - the amped up my salary just because I got paid more at a previous job! The management is fair and mostly awesome. The training is thorough and everyone is there to help answer your questions.
good,"Kohl's was a very nice place to work. It was very fast paced and that made time go by faster. Some of the managers were not very nice, but for the most part they were nice."
good,"gurnee kohls is a nice place to work, its fast paced and the discounts are really good during certain days. the pay is really bad and thats what makes it hard to work there"
good,I only worked her for a short tim but I was easy. I worked in the shoe department and I basically just organized and stocked shoes. I didn’t have anyone watching over me.
good,The job wasn't the worst I've ever had but the management was pretty bad. They were very hard to work with. They seemed to have a little bit of an attitude most days.
good,"Typical day at work was busy "
good,I enjoy my job . The workload gets a little hectic but overall it makes our job. I love the flexible hours. Giving customer service makes it a joy able place.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"My day consisted of morning meetings with staff on expectations/goals.  Providing exceptional customer service first and foremost!!  Working on the sales floor to merchandise new deliveries and set the floor according to standards.  Provide support throughout the day to associates and other management.  Finally, to always be available to the customer for assistance, questions, or to improve their shopping experience."
good,"Love working here, sad to have to look for another job. But I need to advance my career. Coworkers and management are great. Yeah It can get busy, but with great teamwork it wasn't so bad."
good,"It was just a job to have in high school to make some money, pay wasn't bad at 9 an hour, and management was good to us. The employee discount sometimes made things 65 percent off their sale price. I was definitely bored of it though. Kohl's cards are a massive part of the culture in their stores, I was a top tier consultant and was one of the few people that maintained over 20 hours a week when hours got cut in January --everyone else was getting a shift a week."
good,"Kohl's Cartersville has been one of the BEST places I have ever worked; one area they thrive in is building relationships and employee satisfaction. They put an emphasis on customer interaction and credit goals; however, they do it in an enjoyable manner."
good,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about our kohls store!  We have the best management....flexible hours...we hire from within...always a positive attitude and constant recognition.  We all work as a team and we consider ourselves family.  Kohls may not pay as much as other stores, but we have a awesome discount.  Kohls takes care of their employees.  We have lots of food days and its just a fun place to be."
good,"Timecard edits, checking vacation or PTO for all hourly employees, scheduling all hourly staff according to company standards and workflow, helping interview, background check, drug test and hire all regular and seasonal employees.  Preparing reports, etc. for store management team, covering breaks or lunches on sales floor or checkouts as needed.  Filling in for missing shifts in receiving or on sales floor."
good,Truck would be getting unloaded sending freight to the proper areas to be processed and sent out to the floor to be merchandised.My  boss was great.Equipment not working.Completing my work.
good,"Super friendly stuff to make it really welcome help you out with  anything you need. A lot of customers  are really appreciate it to all associates. Friendly, fun, and great."
good,"This is a great pace to work for. There a lot of benefits and the people that work there are friendly and understanding of your life outside of work. It is a perfect job to gain customer service and communication skills, especially for those who have never had a job before."
good,"I enjoyed working for Kohl's Selingrove.....they worked well with my schedule ! The only downside I had was the pay, even with the employee discount I felt it was low"
good,"Overall I think Kohl’s is a great place to work , I’ve only been there a couple of weeks but the employees are very helpful which made it easy for me to catch on. I’d encourage anybody to work there."
good,is was coo workin there not enough hours tho but over all i liked  that we could dress Casual an wear makeup an nail polish I loved my discount card as well
good,It is a fast pace fun place to work. It is always busy and there are always things to do. There are several departments to choose from to work in. It is flexible hours.
good,As long as you are willing to build strong work relationships help will always be there . Very hard to stay to yourself at work need to create ideas in groups and drive performance
good,Call the great place if you're wanting to work for a seasonal position. It gives you the tools you need to further your experience in customer service and Retail.
good,"This is a great part time job for students or people who want to make a little extra income. Because the team is part time, they are very aware of school and work schedules and are flexible with the hours they schedule at the store. There are different shifts, so this makes it easy to continue life outside of Kohls."
good,"This place offers alot of opportunity if you can prove yourself with great work ethics. I started off in a seasonal position during the holiday season. They do a mass hiring there every year around that time. During seasonal you have an opportunity to make really good money. They start you off around 11.75 an hr, you get bonuses throughout the 3 week period between Thanksgiving and Christmas. You also have to commit to working between 50-60hrs a week during that period. The average checks during that time were between $1,000-$1,400! The job culture there is fantastic, they do a great job at making everyone feel belonged there. The will sometimes provide food for you, they have a huge breakroom there as well. Everyone is friendly and overall this is a great place to work. If given the opportunity to stay on like I was, they have really good insurance there. They provide a wellness program which is free for every employee. There's also an onsite clinic there which is free as well. It is a typical warehouse job which requires you to be on your feet for 10hr shifts. You work 4 days on and have 3 days off, each different department has different demands. Overall this is a great place to work at."
good,"Opportunity for making great money if you want to. Very face paced, management not so great but tolerable. Not a lot of opportunity for advancement but able to learn many different departments so you become very desirable to company. Opportunity usually always for overtime. Discount is incredible and starts immediately. Medical center on location for employees and immediate family. Fair breaks and you are paid foe all of them...just not allowed to leave the building for any reason."
good,I loved working at kohl's due to being able to do different functions everyday and never having to do the same thing ! I think this is amazing and gives you an opportunity to grow and show your full potential to management. it was a great atmosphere and a very diverse group of people that i worked with while there. There was no really hard part of the job besides not getting a consistent amount of hours each week. I enjoyed being able to move around and help customers find exactly what they wanted the most.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I dread going to work everyday and I am done having to work at a place like that and not have much time to spend with my first born son. I work hard and even pick up other people’s slack. I’m dependable. lol
good,The job was very fast paced and employees had to learn every aspect of the store. Hours were flexible and determined by management. Hard to interact with coworkers.
good,I think it was good part time job while I was employed in Maryland which was mainly seasonal. The hours are flexible and production up peak and down peak so hours expected per week may varied on paycheck
good,Enjoyed my time working seasonal at Kohl’s everyone is nice the environment is relaxing yet attention catching anyone would love it prices are reasonable.
good,"the best place to work with good benefits for employee's , It was great working here it helped me to regain my confidence and every staff right from the manager to the supervisor was very co-operative  and also a guiding factor for each and every employee."
good,"The staff was great made amazing friends, management staff was nice but needed some strong leaders and better communications"
good,"Its a very good job to have, easy to do but can get dull to how repetitive it can be. Most of the time I had to refold cloths that customers would look at then out back , other than that other duties were to put clothing in certain areas and to set up the cloths on the wall."
good,I think this job is good for people that are working and in school or just starting out. But with the cost of living increasing the pay isn’t and after awhile it just won’t be worth it anymore.
good,Kohl's was the real first job that ever made feel like i was apart of the team. I was there two years so i can honestly say I grew with the company as it grew.
good,"Great place to work with friendly co-workers, supervisors, and a way to help customers with their shopping. Will work around your schedule and help you get hours."
good,"well everthing was fun and fast, you had to work at a fast pace. but other than i really liked khols, the enviroment was fun and fast.oh and we get paid every week."
good,Love folding the clothes when its not busy. Always came in early to clean my work station before we opened. Helped with customer service questions. Great lunch with chipotle rite outside.
good,Collaborative place to work Wonderful management team easy to work for. The company is willing to let you advance and learn different positions so that you can work different jobs with different shifts
good,"Both of my experiences working with Kohl's were great. I always felt like a part of the team and the managers were very kind and understanding while I was learning the ropes of the store. I learned great communication and customer service skills while working there. I also learned how to work as more of a team and less of an individual person. The hardest part of the job for me was learning how to run the cash register. As soon as I learned how to do it properly, it became my favorite part of the job."
good,"loved working at kohls for the almost four years I was there, the environment was great and got along with everyone, management was fantastic to work for, I would definitely recommend working here"
good,"I loved my time at Kohl’s. The people were so nice. Everyone really worked together to get throngs done. There was never a time where we were under staff. Managers are easy going and understanding but at the same time expect you to get your work done. As long as you go in with a smile and put your customers first, your days will go smoothly!"
good,Peak season was slower than i expected but it was a cool new environment. Breaks were paid for and you had time to get to break room and enjoy break. work was slow which made time go by slow.
good,The job was a good one and worked for me at the time. The management was helpful and understanding at the time. The schedule and discounts were great .
good,"I like being a cashier, the atmosphere was good, the management was very good, the pay was decent, I liked getting discounts at such a nice store, it was a good Christmas job."
good,I enjoy working at Kohl's. The managers are very nice. Its a fast paced environment.  The work culture is amazing. Everyone is very friendly and when help is needed and asked for help is given at the very moment.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Being a sales associate could be a lot of work dealing with overflowing dressing rooms and answering customers questions but it was a fun place to work.
good,"Kohl's has been the best place i have ever worked, the people are friendly and they have things under control. Great environment, and feels like it's a family."
good,"The managers really care about employees. Most coworkers are friendly and helpful. Kohl's is a very fast-paced environment when it comes to the holiday season. The company is thoughtful, you'll be provided with everything you need, and sometimes you get free food too."
good,"The job is awesome and I work with great people.  The pay isn't great at only 9.00/hr.  Management are always there to help.  I never feel overwhelmed or stressed.  Everyone is willing to pitch in and help with customers.  I am currently looking for another job, not because of Kohl's.  I am looking because I want to work in a medical career."
good,What I didn't like was that people who where there longer than me but didn't know what to do so i had to help them out but other than that is was a great place to work at
good,Kohls is a wonderful place to work. its a company where you can move up the totem pole. The associates are very nice and you get the chance to interact with many walks of life.
good,"I have loved working here, it is like my home away from home and everyone treats you like family. The managers are a bit tough on everyone but when it gets busy everyone is doing their part to help."
good,"Work around school schedule "
good,"feeling excited to start the day. I've learned how to do shipping & receiving, red, tagging, etc... I've learned that communication is huge in a company. The workplace environment was great, and very friendly to everyone. Very positive people. The hardest part of the job was just the lifting. But thats because I was a very good loader so I was doing more than most people on a daily basis. But the most enjoyable part about the job was break because they had a break room specifically with games and ping pong table where we would all socialize and talk more etc..."
good,"It is very busy around peak season. Attendance was mandatory. Pay was great, but be prepared to be on your feet for long periods of time. They let you have headphones, but you have to remain focused on the task."
good,"I loved working here. It was a team work place to be. I learned many new skills and was a fast paced environment. Management was on top of things and very helpful. The hardest part of the job is learning a lot on your own. You do not get shown a lot, you get told once and then are pretty much on your own."
good,"Great place. Very Customer Service oriented. Works well for college students for scheduling. Management is nice, they absolutely back you up when you're right, but will also concede to an angry customer"
good,"I worked here during back-to-school time and I was surprised at how busy I was!! It could've been over-whelming to some people, but  I'm comfortable working in a fast-paced environment.  When I was there, I was working both of my departments by myself, and other departments had two people.Management was great and always offered more hours, if we wanted to them. I was a part-time associate and always got full-time hours. The only thing I didn't like was that I was trained for only an hour or so the day I had orientation and the first day I worked on the floor, I was by myself and lost at what to do, but a co-worker from a different department put me in the right direction."
good,A lot of possibility to move up. great coworkers. also can transfer to any localion in the country. Willing to work with your time. Management is good also.
good,"Great management, great customer service, need better hourly pay, need better screening for employees. Some lazy employees. Had a very involved Store Director/Manager, Assistant Managers, excellent Customer Service Manager. Great work environment in St. Petersburg, Florida. Worked as a Seasonal Sales Associate in Apparel for Men, Women, & Children. Had a great working experience with Kohl's."
good,i enjoyed about 3 years of working there. managers were very professional and fun to work with. i loved the discount the most as well. i love how their schedule was very flexible like they say. they kept their word on that part.
good,"Kohl's really knows how to treat their employees and customers right. They allowed me to try out various departments in the store so if I wanted to changes positions, I was able to. The pay wasn't great and the hours were random but the company was so lovely to work for. This is a great place to start building experience."
good,I worked almost every department. Also was on freight and over nights. Great coworkers and management. Schedule was fairly consistent. Lots of work to be done during the shift.
good,I learn how to help people apply for Kohl's credit card. It was very hard to learn at first but i got the hang of it. I loved working in the retail business. It was very nice to work there.
good,"I was currently working at Kohls during the holiday season 2017. The pay and hours were amazing. The work wasn't hars. I stayed busy and got my job done. "
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Loved the job. Managers are always there to help, easy to communicate with other associates. Everyone takes their job & position seriously trying to make the customer as satisfied as possible."
good,It is fast paced and you must be able to work different hrs. There is no set schedule. It is always challenging and customer service is essential. You are cross trained to work in every area of the store.
good,"Everybody always comes into work with a game plan, ready to tackle anything that needs to be done in store. Always great at making sales! Everyone's attitudes are positive."
good,Loved working their when i didnt know i had a gift for retail and i did the walk in just because. I learned the entide store and how it works in 5 weeks because i put myself out there and cant wait to see what happens next
good,"Most work shifts consist of assisting customers in having the best shopping experience possible. Making sure the customer feels engaged as well as paid attention to. If the items the custmers are searching for is not available in-store it is the associates next responsibility to direct them to the in-store Kiosk where we can help the custmer purchase on-line and receive free shipping in the process. Final responsibility is to make sure the customer leaves satisfied with the help provided, even if the product they were searching for is not available."
good,Sales Floor associates must help with Registers too which is extra work but the whole experience is very positive. I would say one of the strongest points of working here is the company culture and management.
good,The management is great. The emploees are great! Its very fast paced and i love it. They care about you as a person. You learn how to do a lot of different things.
good,"I would unload the truck. Which was followed by a lunch break. I then started to unbox the merchandise and put it where it belonged. I  would also clean up stock rooms. Management was cool. They would always help you, if you misunderstood they would make sure you got it before they left you alone. The hardest part was working in the night time. And the most enjoyable part of the job was stocking in my opinion."
good,My position was temporary seasonal position. The management was awesome and very friendly. I learned how hard it is to keep a huge store organized and clean.
good,"As single Mom, Kohls was a great place for a second job I was able to request the hours that worked best for me around my full time job and appreciated the great discount for items I needed for my family."
good,"I loved working for kohl's, it was a great experience and if I did not have to relocate I would have definitely tried to stay after the season had ended."
good,Kohls is a good place to work you get a lot of experience in retail learn new things each day . I am in charge to do jewelry count an to  provide good customer service
good,"Enjoyed working at Kohls, Busy time of year, but the staff was friendly and easy to work with.  Employed there for Seasonal, but would go back if needed"
good,"I thoroughly enjoy working at Kohl's, everyone i have worked with has been very professional and kind. The Managers are very nice but professional and there is no stress about asking questions or asking for help."
good,"It is incredibly fun to work there, they have sales competitions that they make very fun and everyone is friendly there. Management is run very well, especially the Kohl's on Hall Road, all of those employees are incredible."
good,I think it may become difficult to remain interested and involved in work long term. Very repetitive work in all departments. Not much individual interaction with management or coworkers.
good,"Nice and  friendly associates."
good,I will recommend working for khols its a fun and productive place to work. The managers can work around you day to day schedule. The staff is friendly and well spoken.
good,"I loved my coworkers, working environment, discounts and their flexibility with my schedule. I would recommend anyone looking for a temporary job or entry job to join Kohl's."
good,"TONS of hours! i was working 60 hours during peak! They offer bonuses for pretty much everything during peak season, the con is that right after peak season is over they let everyone go that didnt work there before peak season"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."

good,the best seasonal job ive even had. i would and have recommended the job to others. the people are friendly can do some work on some of the blue shirt managers but other than that thumbs up here.
good,"This job was very chill and laid back but at times could be a little quick-paced. Co-workers were very friendly, nice and polite. They also had a nice and clean break room."
good,"Kohl's was my first ever job. I thought that it will be a disaster on my first day, but it was not. My coworkers were really friendly and very helpful. They taught me well what I  need to know that will be helpful to me when assisting customers."
good,"I unfortunately had to move out of the state, but if I had not moved, I would still be at this place. Khols, specifically in Sherman, TX, was a fantastic place to work. I never had any issues with any of the employees, the management was extremely willing to work with any and all employees who had issues whether they were work issues or personal."
good,I’ve been working at Kohl’s for a few weeks now and they have treated me like family since my first day on the job. They are very clean and organized I would recommend shopping at Kohl’s as much as possible they will treat you like family and help you with anything you need
good,Co workers were friendly and helpful. Overall great experience. I would recxomend to a friends most definitely. I also would work here again as well. Khols was great!
good,a lovely store with awesome collection of dresses for all ages.
good,"Fun outgoing and full of excitement with fellow employees"
good,This was my favorite job. I left because it was only seasonal but I would definitely work here again. The customers are great and Kohl’s does great fundraisers for all types of things. The managers are all nice and they do not pick and choose who is their favorite.
good,"Learned how to pace myself in the shoes  and other"
good,Great retail chain!  Love working at Kohl's!!!  The management team is wonderful to work with and they provide training that is relevant and on-going. Very customer focused corporation and also employee focused....you don't find that combination very often. I highly recommend being part of this team.
good,Working for Kohl's was very laid back and easy-going.  The managers always tried to make it fun and provided great incentives to reach certain goals.  The employee discount was great also!
good,"The discount is the best thing about working at Kohls. It is also satisfying helping customers get what they are looking for."
good,"I enjoy working here. The other personnel are friendly and very helpful to new employees as are the supervisors. The only reason I am considering leaving is I need a full time job, more consistent hours per week."
good,"This place was a fun and enjoyable work environment, with flexible scheduling, and phenomenal holiday hours.  The teamwork philosophy was unlike any other I've experienced, and the discount given to employees was a huge help."
good,"Great place to work with the right manager, Grweat benefits , great discounts  shifts hours were good .the distance sometimes heavy traffic after 5pm but that is everywhere traffic"
good,"Kohls is a nice place to work. People are friendly, job is easy.The only thing I didn't like about it is the pay wasn't enough for me, otherwise I'd recommend to work there."
good,I enjoy Kohls and the management there.  You have lots to accomplish there and the pace is interesting and different all the time.  The people there are nice and everyone gets along with eachother. I recommend this highly.

good,one of the best companies I've worked for some days its crazy but other days it a breeze.The  associcates are very friendly and the management is not that bad.
good,This place is great for a first time job or if you're still in school.  They are really flexible with your schedule.  Management makes work fun and they offer great discounts.
good,Kohls has a lot of great people that work there and I enjoyed the time that I spent working there.  I would recommend kohls to friends.  They work with your schedule extremely well.
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work for. The work that you do, does not go unnoticed. They treat you like you're part of a family. There is also volunteer events that you can participate in which I found to be the most rewarding part of working there. The only downfall is career advancement, which I felt that there wasn't much room to grow."
good,I love working here. You get to meet new people every day. everyone is very helpful towards each other. you get paid weekly. apply for a job!!! glad i did
good,"Work day for me was getting to greet customers, offering help or suggesting an outfit for them because they had a party to go to or a dance. Having contest for our employees to make it fun for them to enjoy coming to work and having a purpose in being a part of the company."
good,"It was easy and you can stay busy which is important to me. Good pay but long hours. Management is not present or easy to find and that would be my only negative when you have questions. But, you also don't need them much."
good,"My typical day of work consist of merchandising and I work in the home department. I've learned where every item is located. My manager is very easy to work with. I am a perfectionist and sometimes I can be very meticulous, so I am respected at my job. I am very optimistic about my job and enjoying helping customers and performing my job duties. I do not have any negative feelings at my job."
good,"I learned a lot from the supervisors that worked there, they were very helpful. The hardest part of the job was trying to maintain credit applications, sometimes you would get 3 in one day and then 0. The management did not like that so they pushed you a little harder, some customers did not want a credit card, so I did not force the option, which made the management upset."
good,"The workers are very friendly and welcoming. The work is easy, but at times it can be overwhelming. However, everyone is willing to lend you help when needed."
good,Great place to work while busy very people oriented. Very flexible with staff schedule. The management was helpful in getting you trained so that you are able to move forward for promotion.
good,"I picked up this position for the Christmas season and made some extra cash. I had a lot of fun, met a lot of folks and had great discounts. "
good,I've been working for kohls for 14 years I find it still fun and challenging. Love it enough to want to stay! Wonderful people working together to give great customer service.
good,"The company is great to work for and Lancaster has one of the best run stores. Yours coworkers are friendly and helpful. I pigeon holed myself in my position and am unable to transfer to another department without losing income and hours. The department I worked in is a constant learning environment. When someone needs help, I reach out and help; whether it's a cashier with a problem she can not solve or someone needing a battery changed in their watch. Many associates at Kohls operate with great teamwork."
good,"It's a great working environment, Kohls puts customers first & they care about their employees. I loved my job. I never had a bad experience working there. Employees are great, managers are great!"
good,"His is a good place to work if you enjoy working with people and a fast paced enviroment. I have learned better time managment at work and better multitasking skills. The overall management is good but could be better, but that can be expected from any job for the most part. Overall take is that I do/did enjoy working here."
good,"The management at the Rochester Hills, MI Kohl's store was spectacular. All managers were kind, encouraging, and helpful. Whenever there were issues with customers the managers were quick to help employees and handle the situation the best way possible. Management was also very understanding if a family emergency or something sudden came up during a shift."
good,"busy with phone calls and helping customers find what they want."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Love this place. Great people, great management and great customers. The holiday Time was the best. You would make peoples whole holiday by helping them find that perfect gift, and for a great price. The customers seem to maintain regulars it is such a great environment."
good,i love working for kohl's i've been working there since 2012 as a seasonal associate. i love the fact they had motivated us at one time by if we came to work on time we would receive a bonus. the only thing it does get hard as the long hours kick in and you're tired.
good,I enjoyed working for Kohl's. I received customer service awards. I liked the recognition and the hours. Wish I was picked up after Christmas season was over.
good,"Kohls is a great place to work. We have a great team. They give you plenty of perks, benifiets and discounts. Managers are respectful and considerate."
good,"Great opportunity , fast-paced yet comfortable. Provide great break schedule and food on special occasions. Very nice coworkers and management. Would recommend"
good,"I enjoy the atmosphere of Kohl's because whenever you have a question, the staff is so willing to help you through whatever you may need. Every one is very kind!"
good,not enough hours a week. i show up at 5 am to work and i clock-in then head to the stock room and start helping out with the truck unload process i help with the housewares freight
good,"Kohl's was a great place to work but it's not exactly the type of job that gives you guaranteeded hours or something you can live off of unless you are there working for raises every year, but it's a great place to work and there are many benefits."
good,"I learned many skills at this job including time management, customer service, and many others. I was given many responsibilities ad worked in every department. The management was very helpful and understanding. The culture among employees was generally very good. Overall a very positive experience."
good,"Great place to work"
good,My day at kohl's can be very busy. I deal with customer issues and employee's issues every day. I order supplies for customer service and cashiers. I Manager from 30- 40 people a day. along with closing the store too. I love my job because I enjoy people and love to learn.
good,"A normal day at work for me would be Hanging clothes on racks , checking dressing rooms and cashiering. The managers were nice overall some more than others . The whole team on my shift worked together. theres wasn't a very big age difference between the wrokers and everyone mainly got along with each other."
good,"This job was so much fun, that I loved coming into work and we worked hard. But it was fun hard work. I would love to be able to work here again if my life would accommodate the pay."
good,A typical day for me would include packing and sorting. This was my first time working in a warehouse so I learned how to pack and sort which I thoroughly enjoyed. The management was highly qualified and efficient. The workplace culture was somewhat laid back yet very organized. The hardest part of the job was being on my feet for long periods of time but I was able to adjust quickly. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fast-paced environment.
good,I worked for this company for 7 years. I only recently quit because of an issue I had with one of the management staff. I 100% recommend kohls as a future place to work.
good,Kohls is an fun and exciting company. It was never never boring working there. And I enjoy all the sale and discounts. The customers are always polite and enjoyable.
good,"The staff, customers, and schedules are great!"

good,the manager are really mess. A typical day at kohl's is very cool and very fast pace.  learned to deal with everybody attitude. the hardest part of the job is the manager's gossiping.
good,During a normal work day I put out and restock merchandise.  I also help customers find whatever they are looking for.  I help run the registers at their final purchase.
good,"I loved working at Kohls and would highly recommend this position. The management was incredible, very sweet and professional. They were very flexible with hours and there were many opportunities to pick up shifts. It was very easy to make friends with coworkers because the environment is so warm and friendly."
good,"The environment is what got my attention, The feeling of being at home, It kept me motivated at work. I learned there culture was really about family, They didn't leave anyone behind. My team was out of this world never worked in a place where the whole team was one , we helped each other become strong where we was weak, We left no one behind. The management was even better , They made sure they let us know we were appreciated. Best job i had, The hardest part is when we switched to a different department getting use to something new but our team adapted quickly, Reaching goals was a challenge too, But we got through it.The most enjoyable part was seeing smiling faces, And being recognized for your hard work weekly"
good,"My typical day was usually only 4-5 hours."
good,Kohl's was a nice quite place to work. Worst part of the job was probably cleaning out the fitting room. lol it would get pretty bad in there. Overall it was amazing. I would recommend it to anyone.
good,"The corporation pushes the solicitation of credit a bit too much. However, the overall working atmosphere is that of positivism and empowerment. I thoroughly enjoy working there."
good,"I absolutely love working at Kohl's.  The atmosphere is so friendly and comfortable.  All of the employees are like family.  Everyone treats me so kindly.  I am hard of hearing and all of my coworkers are so patient and understanding with me.  I love all of the customers."
good,It was fast pace. I learned a lot was able to expand and enhance my skills. It was a pleasure working with my management and coworkers. Sometimes the hours were either too many or none at all.
good,"Best place to work fun and loving environment to be , work hours are great the people are always enjoying work always leaving home feeling accomplished,clean"
good,Workers here are very helpful and nice. Everyday is a adventure and it never gets boring. It's not every day you can go to a job you love but here its different.
good,It was a very professional work environment. Even throughout the holidays I felt very safe and confident working here.
good,The only thing I did not like about this job was having to stand in the same spot for hours at a time. Other than having to go around and organize items on the shelves or racks.
good,"i enjoy working for kohl's, staff and co workers are very fun, the day to day tasks keep me busy, some customers are interesting but nothing you cant handle with a smile."
good,I absolutly loved working here. I was at the store in Burbank. Everyone is so friendly and management is awsome. Best managers I ever had. Loved it!!!
good,I'm looking forward to going back every year to work seasonal part time. Awesome place to work. Everyone was nice and polite from management down. I was shown the ins and outs of everyday operations even though I was a seasonal part timer. Definitely will go back to work this upcoming holiday season.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I love working at Kohls. The management is very nice and all of the people you work with are hilarious and fun. The only thing I hated was the cut in my hours after the holidays.
good,"It's always a busy day at work and there is always something to do. "
good,"A typical day at Kohls would be walking into the store clocking in, saying hi to everyone, getting my radio, and heading to the floor to start helping customers and folding clothes. I also had to put back clothes and clean the dressing rooms. I worked in three sections, mens, womens, and Juniors. What I learned from Kohls is that it is always polite to ask a customer if they need help finding anything because chances are they do. The management at Kohls was stable, nice, and rewarding when you did a good job. The workplace culture in Kohls was good. I met a really great friend there, and we are still friends to this day. There was an age difference from younger people to older people, but we all got along. The hardest part about that job was cleaning the store, and making it perfect for when someone from corporate came.The most enjoyable part of my job was working with people I liked, and also interacting with the customers."
good,"Working at kohls the management team has done a wonderful job training there employees up to be self sufficient. There is lots of freedom to work at your own pace, in your own style, and in an environment that works for everyone."
good,Had an great time working here. The overnight team that I joined made my time there amazing. The management treated me so well and ran things the right way. I gained the ability to work at a fast pace and be able to multitask better.
good,Helping customers with certain items and always be really friendly and out-going person with a positive attitude! Never assume the answer to anything.
good,A typical workday could be at a fast pace or slow and steady but no matter what I am always doing something from assisting customers or organizing. I learned teamwork is a major plus when having to tackle down big tasks. The most enjoyable part of the day is meeting the many different people and working with a great team.
good,When I started a kohls they knew I was a cashier and they put me on a register and I had very little training.  Because I work on a register every day.  I have learned a lot on my own.  I go to work and ring up my customers and try to get them to sign up for a credit card.  Kohls want everybody to have a credit card rather they want one or not.  I enjoy working with the other cashiers and I have learned a lot from them.  Management is ok.   I enjoy going to work and working with the people.  My hours some time is based on if I get credit apps
good,"I love working with the community, pretty face paced job depending on the time of the year. It could be very challenging at times when you get upset customers."
good,Kohl's cares about their employees. They understand if you need a sick day or the weather wont allow you to get to work. Kohl's provides a relaxed friendly environment to work in.
good,"Kohl's cares about their employees, they understand when it comes to health and you need a day off or if the weather wont allow you to get to work. They don't typically keep their seasonal workers but it gives you a chance to find another job. They pay good, and the staff are very supportive and helpful."
good,Working with customers is my specialty! Great. Benefits great leaders. Great benefits my experience with working with Kohls is great!

good,Working here was great i have absolutely no doubts about my choice selecting this job. The people and team leaders are lively and influential. I would love to pursue a better opportunity in this job field.
good,"MY personal experience with this company has been nothing short of spectacular. This company cares about its employees and is one of the few great businesses out there. A great name to work for! On the LP side there is a good close-knit community working together to protect assets. There is competition between stores, but at the end of the day it is one team, one fight. Outstanding training is implemented not just for new LP hires but monthly/ semi-annual as well. Management is great from the floor to the district level. With all that said with great support requires you TO WORK and not SHAM. You will have to hit the floor to observe/ detain. LP Technology is hit or miss depending on which store you work for. I have been in some stores that have high-end servers with live recording/ digital cameras ...all the bells and whistles. On the other hand, I have been in stores that are still using VCRs. There is no continuity as for as your tools for the fight is concerned, but Kohl's Senior LP Management is aware of it and actively replacing outdated systems."
good,I enjoy working here. I love mybosses and co workers. Fun environment but yet still professional.  Everyone works hard and everyone works as a team to get stuff done.
good,Fun energetic staff with unlimited opportunities and great culture. I highly recommend this company for employment to anyone. Thanks team!

good,I really enjoyed working here. The pay wasn't much but i looked forward to coming to work each day. The environment alone was welcoming not to much that all the employees were so helpful and nice.
good,"Great employer. very flexible, willing to work with my schedule while pursuing my education. I learned most phases of the running of this large retail company while working here."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I loved working at Kohl's, it was a wonderful experience. Management was always kind and very understanding. The tasks assigned were never too difficult and manageable. The only downside is that retail is not always busy all year round, so the hours were not stable."
good,Most injoyble part of my job is wen I can help in interacting with a customer convincing sale or saving discounts being a member of khols. It is an opportunity to allow  your self to see how the company that s ran in different part of the department in u learn more about how to keep ur customer up dated with the app.ther are lots of benefits for the employe while working with khols.
good,a typical day at kohls is enjoyable on going some days will be slow some wil be very busy over all its a good company never leave wit out smiling
good,Displaying merchandise throughout the store with a marketing mindset along with helping customers find their needs. I work well with all of my co-workers and management. There isn't really a hard part about working at Kohl's. The most enjoyable part of Kohl's is working with my co-workers and helping customers find what they are looking for.
good,"Overall experience everyone was nice, kind, and very bubbly and generous I can say they have a awesome team staff I just didn't feel comfortable in doing the job on my own."
good,Great place to work. Has a good work/life balance.  Management does a good job at developing employees who are wanting to build their career.
good,"Kohls was a very good company to work for. They respect each employee and really listen to feedback from employees. They actually seek out feedback regularly on many different aspects of store operations. They were flexible with scheduling needs, treated all employees equally and trained you for new assignments.  They had great incentives for those who met or exceeded daily personal sales goals, daily credit apps, offered great employee discounts, and really tried to work with each individual for holiday schedules."
good,I worked part-time while going to school full-time. Great place to work for college students due to the flexibility given for a full-time school schedule.
good,A typical day at Kohl's was to get there a tad bit early and be prepared to work my overnight shift. This warehouse was full of different people and work ethics. Management at Kohl's for the most part was straight forward. You were to report at the front of your department where instructions were given throughout the day.The hardest part about my job was relocation to different departments that you weren't trained in but as we move forward we learn how to operator as if it was.
good,"Kohl's is well known for always putting the customer's needs first. We are also well known for also being great with our returns. As a company we take back anything even it has been used or returned back to the store after about 2-4 years ago. "
good,"great place to work just starting off in retail or in school, its very flexible to help staff and wonderful feeling. the staff is very upbeat and helpful they make you feel like family."
good,I had a great time working for Kohl's. Very fun place to work and managers care for their employees. Always have fun events for the employees.
good,"I absolutely enjoyed my time at Kohl's, my co-workers were very friendly and management was about their business. I loved working in their environment, and I also loved working with my team. My day would start with a meeting, followed by stretches, managers make sure we have that morning stretch. My co-workers were my trainers when I started there, I had many questions and they kept a positive attitude and were very encouraging during this process. The hardest part of my job would be when we are not able to get all the products packed and shipped at the end of the day."
good,Hours may not be given much for working but the flexibility they allow you to have for scheduling is perfect while going to college. The environment is uplifting and there is always a chance to learn something new there.
good,"I enjoyed working for this company, however it was a large department with a little help from other associates, but the most enjoyable part of my work experience here was my co-workers.  A typical day at work at Kohls consisted of constantly hanging clothes which was the hardest part of the job because it became monotonous and never ending. Management was professional, but strict, and their expectations were no less than perfection."
good,Kohls helped me grow out of my shell because the job requires customer interaction. It help develop a passion for retail and merchandise presentation to help customers find what they were looking for.
good,"Working with cashier and handling money. Processing customers. Interactive. My coworkers were really nice and friendly. It was hard during the holidays because it was so busy but other than that, I enjoyed working there."
good,"I love my job! The people are awesome, everyone really looks out for each other. Management are very engaged. We have weekly meetings and morning huddles just to touch base and make sure everyone is on the same page. They do little things like give us donuts if we end up having to work on a Saturday, or giving us frozen treats on extremely hot days. Those little things make me feel appreciated. They also have lunch catered for certain milestones within our DC."
good,Had trouble encouraging people to get credit cards. Enjoyed the team there. The manager is a great man to work for. I had trouble standing 4 or 5 hours at a time.
good,Kohl's had outstanding professionalism. I loved who I worked with and the goal to stay on top. Learning company policy was tricky for me at first but I caught on sooner than later.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Very friendly place to work. All the employees are very nice, as well as all the management team. I enjoy helping customers and keeping the department clean for the shoppers."
good,"The department I am in does not require too much to do. I like going there to work. Its sometimes warm in the Summer time in the building though. But there are fans to help keep cool, depends on where you are working at."
good,"Kohls is a great place to work, they give back to the community and help local non profits that benefit children.  They try to keep employees happy, and work with limited schedules-if it's a valid reason."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working together as a team to get things done. Most days at work were typically the same besides the difference of being slow or busy.
good,Great place to work at the people are awesome. They are flexible and family oriented. Sometimes not enough hours for everyone but that is the way it goes.
good,"Frequently, in my mind I have my day mapped out before I get to work. Just as frequent the goals I wish to achieve for the day are often put aside to attend to an issue that has come up on short notice and has a priority over my plans. I have learned that no matter how prepared I am for the day that it is far more important to be flexible and rise to new challenges. "
good,Its a great job and has helped me learn how to deal with very difficult people. It has taught me how to juggle multiple tasks at once and helped build my customer service skills. The downsides are unsteady hours and having to work every weekend.
good,"Very laid back environment, enthusiastic management team, varied tasks required, overall good place to work for, the hardest part of the job would probably be the tedious task of merchandizing product but since everyday is different, somedays you're up at the register, others you're on the sales floor, others you are doing operations (freight/merchandizing)"
good,"This company is great! Most start part time, but it is great to be able to spend time doing other things after work. They have fun events, food sometimes, and know how to treat a employee. The people are nice and the managers are very helpful. Pay could be better."
good,"I enjoy working at kohls, the people, management that I work with there are nice. I learned a lot from being seasonal to now a PT employee . Nothing is really hard for me,except the things I haven't learned yet will be. The most enjoyable part of my job, my manager. "
good,"-typical day at work is short (5 hours)"
good,great. very polite and friendly always doing great and keeping customers  happy. management great. enjoyable part is being recognized for all the good you do.
good,"A Typical day at work, able to maintain an area and at the same time put out new merchandise, else you will need to be able to stand and walk for 8 hours or more"
good,"I worked in the Jewelry Department, but I earned the respect from the store managers very quickly.  They realized that I was only part time but was very dedicated to my job and I understand the importance of a clean environment and cost it takes on a person that works in the retail world.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the returning customers and the friends I made."
good,"Arrive on the job on time for the team meeting, then straight to work. Allowing my self to enjoy the presents of the customers and working hard to accommodate them. The shifts leads were awesome, quick moving, an to able to solve any thing. My co-workers were great. A refreshing fell of young people, with bubble personality's and smiles on there face. The hardest part of my job was getting off on time at times. But the most enjoyable moments, are when i was able to connect with the customers an laugh an just over all enjoy my job."
good,I enjoyed going to work everyday! You were trained in several positions and the hours were great. Constantly offering incentives that kept moral high and employees wanting to do a good job.
good,The management at Kohls is on-point but laid-back enough that an associate does not feel uncomfortable in day-to-day communication.  A typical day at work is predictable.  They provide opportunities to learn new jobs within the organization. Dealing with customers can be difficult - Kohls is a heavy coupon retail organization and people are not always easy to deal with when it comes to coupons.
good,"A day of work at Kohl's goes by pretty fast. There is a great amount of walking involved . I am usually assigned a project. While completing my project, I am also helping customers, answering the phone for a specific department, and checking out customers at the register. My managers are usually full of energy. They are all about team work and making the customer happy while having fun. My co-workers are like a little family. We help and teach each other daily. The hardest part of the job is unloading our trucks. Sometimes it is very physically demanding. The most enjoyable part of the job is making a customer smile and feel satisfied with their experience."
good,"Great place to work! A lot of seasonal positions available during the holidays. Don't rely too much on staying beyond the season, only a select few are kept when it's over. Overall a great experience and lots of fun."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"awesome company to work for, enjoyed the managment staff, they were very knoweledable. and great opportunities to move up in the company."
good,Working at Kohl's as my first job was the best choice I could have made. The coworkers were so welcoming and helpful and you can tell they truly love their job.
good,The overall work experience was fast paced and enjoyable. The management were understanding and helpful. I think the hardest part of the job was the irregular hours during the holiday season.
good,A typical day at work was helping customers find Levis they were looking for until they found the perfect pair. I also was backup for customer service and registers and I liked interacting with customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was having a good communication with my co-workers and with my managers.
good,Kohl's Department Store is very professional.  Kohl's always puts its customers first.  The staff is well informed of new procedures and are given new sales and customer service skills with many ongoing training tapes.  Working at Kohls has been an excellent experience.
good,"Great place to engage with customers. Enjoy the ""Yes we Can"" attitude for satisfying customers. Ability to help and converse with other team members. Management support is very good and on the spot with helping out at busy times. "
good,Everyday it was always an different experience. I'm driven by my customers who demand reliable timely and friendly service.Thats what motivated me. The job at Kohls everybody is so friendly. I think that's what I enjoyed about it the most What I think is a down fall is when people don't show up for work then there is a extra load on everybody else.
good,"A typical day at kohl's will be busy but keeps the day moving fast paste .what I have learn working at kohl's is to be a leader and good worker , my management is very understanding co-worker will help you and make your day fun. The hardest part of my job is sales , the most enjoyable part is seeing customers leave with happy faces."
good,I likes working for kohls.My Manager was amazing. and they provide associates with agreat discount . The only downfall was the store I was employed at could be very much like high school to much gossiping.
good,"The day consisted of greeting customers and making myself available to any questions, comments or concerns they might have had. Management was also very supportive and helpful when I needed it. My colleagues were extremely helpful when I would get stuck in a predicament."
good,"Typical day at work: Make sure all the sale signs are correct, make sure my area was clean, keep products stocked through out the day, making sure all customers have been taken care of and doing inventory counts. Great management, easy to talk to and very understanding. Hardest part of the job was when we were under staff and trying to get all the daily tasks done while trying to help customers and run the checkout. Most enjoyable part of the job was putting up all the ad set displays and resetting departments."
good,"Great place to work. I think the managers at Khols were the most down to earth people I've worked with. They're always on the sales floor and they're very hands on. They help whenever you need it. "
good,Kohl's is an excellent place to work for part time employment. Hours are flexible and co-workers are nice. Work isn't difficult mentally or physically. Standards are good. Overall a very nice place to work.
good,The people and management were awesome! You knew what time your shift began and ended. You had set break times and a nice break you to enjoy your time off the floor. As long as you did what they expected it was a fine place to work for.
good,My experience with working at Kohl's was good. It was a place that I experienced most of the areas in the store. A typical day at work would be going in and working at the register. Depending on my shift I would either close up my register at the end of the day and count the money or I would close up for the next cashier to use. The management was overall good but a little all over the place.
good,"I am a cashier and the position is easy, my co workers are very friendly and fun. Supervisors and kind and personable. Even the customers are easy going. Kohls creates a shopping experience that makes it hard for customers to get angry easily like in most retail jobs. My days are stress free. Hourly wage isn't great but for such a low stress environment, it works."
good,The majority of the time was spent on helping others when necessary. I felt the great responsibility of being in charge and trying to keep all systems moving constantly.   I enjoyed working with everyone there.
good,staff was great management where great and open to the team wonderful part-time job great rewards and store benefits clean and friendly environment really peaceful well organized place of business great hours and part-time job
good,"Greeting my managers and coworkers, help costumers and customer concern. Help the store any way I can. Always on time ready to work, continue to work with a smile and positive attitude."
good,"Overall pretty busy for a typical day."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I would say it is one of the best retail jobs. Only down side is that it is just that a retail job. You will be on your feet most of the time, holidays are crazy and the pay is minimum wage starting. I loved this job and learned a lot but with out a degree you only have so far you can grow."
good,kohls is a great and clean place the management is great . when I first started everyone was very polite great smiles and willing to help me out with out having a attitude . the only thing I did not like is when I was put under investigation I was not given a call back as far as how the investigation went so I was forced to find another job.
good,"A typical day at work involves greeting customers and associates, soliciting credit, ensuring quality service and accurate transactions, advising customers on products, and resolving their problems."
good,"I absolutely loved working at Kohl's, it was the best job I ever had. I was great in customer service and got along with everyone. Although  Kohl's was a fun a job it was also very productive. I will never forget this job."
good,"When I used at Kohl's, my job is to check out customers, greet them as they come in the door and solicit credit for the company. I learned how to really count money quick I was ok counting money but  I got better as I had more experience handling it. I learned how to work at customer service which was very fun to me especially doing returns but answering the phones and re-pricing clearance was hard for me because I was still new and just started to learn how things work but I enjoyed it as well. My co-workers were fun, interactive, and polite as well they help me with whatever I did not know and welcome  me as part of their time. I really do any management but besides making sure that the store was update such as looking nice for the customers but I was only a part-time associate there."
good,"consistent busy schedule, advancement , cash handling, customer service, key holder, trucks and inventory control."
good,"Use registers, sale the kohls credit card! Keep the store looking organized and shoppable. Open and countdown registers always come in with a positive attitude it will make time fly by fast!"
good,At Kohl's the work never stops. The staff is really great they help anyone who has a problem. They also show you how to use the RF scanner.
good,"I enjoyed working at Kohl's. My fellow employees were always kind and willing to lend a helping hand when things started to get hectic at the customer service desk, and the managers always had clear expectations and wanted to make sure I knew exactly what I needed to know to get the job done. If I had trouble figuring out how to make a return, or to process a damaged item, they would help me out until I understood the process. A typical day at work consisted mostly of processing returns, re-tagging items, and processing damages."
good,Great place to learn new things and serve people. Great team work environment. Great management and work atmosphere. A place where you learn hard work and managerial skills.
good,"This kohls is two stories. it has everything you can think of there. Its amazing how many people would be in there everyday. I had many tasks at this location. Cashier, sales, and customer service."
good,"Getting on the phones, assisting customers with their orders for the holiday season.but the hardest thing with that job was the customers as well, sometimes it was hard to get what the customers wanted because the only thing that you can see was the website and their description of what they wanted and liked. But I managed to successfully go through with the orders in a timely manner."
good,"The managers were more like friends than they were managers. That made everything enjoyable. Even when they had bad news, it was still good. My coworkers were beyond amazing. Everyone there was always willing to help out with any problem that came up."
good,"I enjoyed Kohls for its ""customer comes first"" attitude. I like to help people and I am a friendly person so I fit right in. They provided a safe, clean environment not only for the customer but for the employee as well. There are many departments to learn and the customers are friendly as well. I was able to bring my daughter to work as well on the designated day where she enjoyed lunch, a tour and the chance to stand side by side with me and see what I do. She was later given a certificate and her own name badge along with some congratulations on her first work experience, she was 10."
good,"I made a few friends amongst my co-workers. I learned a few new skills, the managers are all sweet-hearts. I really hope that I can return to Kohls in March, because I really started to get the hang of being there."
good,"- a lot of interaction with people and customers"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"While working at Kohl's Photo Studios, I was able to learn a lot about the in's and out's of the behind the scenes of Kohl's. I was able to work with merchandise, attend photo shoots, and even help with all the smaller things like catalogue organization, or doing tasks wherever I was needed. My supervisors always took the time to make sure I understood what I was supposed to be doing and that I kept it up to the Kohl's standards. I got to meet a lot of amazing people while working there for two years, and they each taught me valuable lessons I will take with me."
good,Working in a navy setting with alot of respect form the recruits
good,"Placing merchandise at proper displays on floor"
good,"Great people and clients, products are amazing and hours are flexible. perfect for anyone looking for part time work only."
good,"I work in shoes, which has the most activity. I have been at three Kohl's stores and the company culture is virtually identical at all of them: Positive, helpful atmosphere where the customer truly comes first."
good,"Answered an average of 30 calls per day by addressing customer inquiries, solving problems and providing new product information."
good,"I would clock in at 1:00 pm, we would have our daily team meeting. I learned how to better use my communication skills with customers"
good,All wonderful things to say.  Would have loved to be full-time.
good,"The typical workday at Kohls involved most surveillaance and creating reports for store audits."
good,"Daily set up of associate teams, to reach the highest production level. I learned that team playing is very important to achieve efficient and safe work environment. This team playing also needs to climb the ladder up into management. It is difficult to achieve goals set, when everyone is not on the same page. the associates look to us for guidance and motivation, we as management need to maintain this."
good,"I worked for Kohls and had a great time as a seasonal worker. I had internships to apply for so after the season I was let go, but if you plan to stay employed with them just pour all your time into them and you will switch from seasonal to full time :)"
good,"A typical day at Kohl's would be helping customers with finding the right kind of clothes, house wear, clothes, and shoes. Answer questions if customers have any concerns. What I have learned from working at Kohl's to deal with people that are having that couldn't always be in the best spirit I must keep my head up and always smile. All of the manager at Kohl's are great, whenever someone needs help I can just call a manager and they will do everything in their power to make the customers happy. I love all of my co workers when at Kohl's I feel that I am at my second home and I love that feeling. The hardest part of my job would be having to let a customer down by saying no we don't have anymore kid books or no we can't take your Kohl's cash if it is out dated. Over all I enjoy working at Kohl's because I always have fun when working, I always have a smile on my face when walking in."
good,"Typical day at work at Kohl's is starting out the day at the morning meeting with all the associates scheduled. We listen to our scores involving sales, credit, email and our customer service based score as a whole. All my co-workers and management are very friendly and we are all able to get a long and help one another out. I work for the Customer service department of Kohl's my day can get stressful depending on the work load but, it does not get to me. I come to work with a positive attitude, enjoy the people around me and do my job the way it is asked of me and I go above and beyond when needed too. In my job I have learned you are going to meet all walks of life and each person is different. If you take care of the customer, listening is the key role and taking action.

good,"I found it difficult to adjust easily to Kohl's. Although, I am the type of person to move into any situation and make the best of it this was my least favorite job. I had experience in retail but, not with such a big store. There were plenty more customers and a lot more clothes. One of the things that benefited me even in the difficult process was it forced me to work harder and challenged me to learn new ways to get things done. This was good for me because I've always been one to love a challenge."
good,I'm currently the Supervisor of the kids department.  I make sure the kids department is set to the company planogram.

good,I Love the job but don't make enough.. The people are great and so is everyone I work with .
good,"When I was a team member at Kohls Dept Store for Customer Service, I enjoyed my job! The team I worked with was OUTSTANDING! I learned to go from POS, to Customer Service, and found that I enjoyed C.S. so much more. That was where I was able to chat with customers, and do sales and returns. Plus many other duties. I enjoyed that job probably the most of all my jobs so far in life. It was a great company to work for! I always talk very highly of Kohls and recommend it to anyone I can."

good,cashier and do go backs when needed. and you get to talk to new people every day.
good,"Everyone is wonderful. Learn a lot and quick. The easiest part of the job is the customer service. The moto is ""Yes We Can"". Always make the customer happy no matter what it is. The hardest part is the learning the discounts and what coupons can the customer use at a time. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people. Everyone is so nice and treats you like a person. They are always willing to help you out no matter what."
good,"I enjoyed working here and meeting new people a regular day for me was going into work at 10 pm  grabbing my coffee before arriving. Once there go to the back area and clock in, prepare the work area by lining up the racks and transporter carts for the unloading of the merchandise. Once the truck was unloaded we would take the items to the sells floor where we would restock, change displays the stores merchandise."
good,"an overall great place to work.  There were challenges throughout the day, but with the help of the managers and  my co-workers we were able to handle those challenges.  There were days when we were extremely busy, and there were days when it was extremely slow.  My responsibilities were mainly to handle POS and cash office, and to over see the Customer Service desk was being maintained properly.  But I was able to help out in other areas.  The hardest part of the job was the long hours, and the best part of the job was going to the greatest lengths to make the customers leave happy."
good,"I loved working at khol's! I work there during the closing shift. It was very laid back and carried a very positive vibe inside the store where I worked at. I like working for khol's because they take very good care of there customers. A typical day for me would be to work the register and stock shelves. My co-workers were very friendly. The hardest part off my job was standing all day, but the most enjoyable part of my job was to help and meet new people on a day to day basis"
good,Overall it was a good job for it to be just seasonal. You get good pay.
good,"A typical day at work would involve a very big effort to keep the store nice and organized, and to keep the customers happy."
good,Enjoyed working for this company. Management was very understanding and the co-workers where a delight to work with. Everyone worked well together and enjoyed eac others company.
good,"You punch in on the time clock, check the paper on the memo board to see which area you work in, then put your stuff in your locker, and get a radio from customer service. If it's in the early morning they do a huddle and go over what the credit goal is for the day, how many e-mails are needed and how much we're supposed to make for the day."
good,I enjoy the time I spent there and look to joining the Kohl's team again someday at a different level.
good,"This is a great company that does offers great opportunity for anyone need a job. If you have a great work effort, you can do well for yourself here."
good,I've worked in different positions for Kohl's Department stores and would love to work for them in a managerial position. They care about their customers and their employees and have competetive wages.
good,"A typical day at work would be dealing with 40 or more customers and processing returns and payments. Working at Kohl's gave me a more outgoing and less shy personality as well as confidence in performing my daily duties. Management was always understanding and put the employee needs up high. They were always understanding when it comes to school schedules, children and when you are sick they make you go home first so you don't over exert yourself as well as keep other associates from getting sick as well. My co-workers were always amazing and helpful, I hardly remember anyone I worked with that I didn't like. The hardest part of the job is when I know I've already gone out of my way to help a customer and there isn't anything I could do being a store associate to help and having to explain to him or her that they need to call a different number or go to another place. The most enjoyable part of my job was that the company was always growing and teaching associates new skills."
good,"Do great costumer service, greeting costumers and helping them to find items, really good environment with the associates, the hardest part of the job it's when there's to many customers in the line, the most enjoyable it's to meet people every day"
good,I like being able to socialize and give great customer service.
good,The atmosphere and my co-workers made my job extremely enjoyable.  I learned so much about the business and how important customer service was! The hardest part of my job was that it was my second job and I would be extremely exhausted.
good,"I loved working here, even if it was just a seasonal job.  The management was excellent and my co-workers were such a joy to be around.  I was really sad when the holiday season was over.  "
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management.

good,processing debagging filling in back stocking I learned the routine of an over night job management was good there they systems and views where fair ..most difficult part might have been arranging back stocking back stock of back stock .. good experience no complaints
good,"    My typical day at work would consist of me clocking in and taking a phone to communicate with my coworkers of whats going on in the store. For example if anybody needed help or if there was any problems I would report them to my manager or whoever had another phone to communicate. My tasks would consist of making sure everything was in order on store floor,to assist any issues or questions costumers had, to help out at customer service when it would get busy, and from time to time I would handle the cash register. The best part of my day was always putting a smile on the customers face, knowing you helped them out and you met there needs. The not so much enjoyable part was handling an angry customer, but I've learned all you can do is always keep a smile on and try your best to help them with there issue. The most important part of a job like this working in retail is communication, for instince what needs to be done, what was done, and when it was done. "
good,fun to work at and the environment was joyful. great mangers good co-workers
good,Great place to work. Everyone here is really nice. The only thing I do not like is the pressure they put on everyone to sell credit cards.
good,very fun atmosphere.
good,"Everthing was well organized, and associates worked had."
good,"I loved it here. Packaging is the easiest job I've ever done, and it was hard on my body. I loved coming home and feeling like I had done a hard nights work. I loved knowing exactly what I was doing every night and what hours and days I was going to work. I loved the people and the two half hour breaks every night."
good,"Throughout my time there, I worked a repeated routine. I learned safety precautions on how to open up the new incoming merchandise to place onto the floors. Management was outstanding. Co-workers were very welcoming and responsible individuals. Hardest part of the job would have to be adjusting to the cold season. Best part of the job would have to be all the over-time hours."
good,"As a cashier I was limited with what I could do, but with great co workers and great clothing to work around it made the day go by quickly."
good,"Unloading truck, sorting merchandise,and stock shelves,cleaning area. Clean restrooms and fitting rooms."

good,"Great place to work for, not enough hours recieved though. Co-workers, managers are genuinely great people to work with. Hours of operation are very convenient for a student."
good,"After working in three stores, overall I'll give the company a A-. Management makes all the difference, I've been to unorganized and unprofessionally managed stores and the opposite. Great for younger people, don't however expect a lot of hours. They hire only part time workers (probably 90%) and give people 12 -20 hrs a week."
good,"My over all review working at Kohl's, a good experience, everyone willing to help out where needed. The management was always there and willing to roll up their sleeves to assist you. I will be putting in an application again to work at Kohl's."
good,"There was never a time I felt that I wasnt a part of an actual team. I learned how management works and the essentials of being in a team. My co-workers were friendly and supportive whenever I wasnt at my best. As the hardest job, it was counting the till early in hte morning without coffee. However, it was the most enjoyable part of the job since it was my very own challenge."
good,I work on the sales floor and the jewlrey department it is very important for me to provide great costumer service to each costumer manegment is very friendly and understanding but the hardest part of the job is the fitting rooms on the weekends its non stop cleaning and the most enjoyable is the new people you meet

good,nice employees who helped each other when needed. got a lot of customer service which helped me through the long run. got to deal with good and not so good customers but helped you deal with different situations.
good,"I worked during October to beginning of Jan. It was hectic but it was fun however, the one time a few people called off and a manager started taking a lot out on us younger folks. It stressed me out so much because I was at registers for a good half an hour and I called backup MULTIPLE times because there was a huge line forming. The manager wouldn't do so. Then I needed a manager approval to bring a price down. So she came over and looked at the line and got after me in-front of the customers. Some times it is very unorganized but that's life. I would love to work there again but they gave me a lot of shifts on top of high school.   I worked every day but Tuesdays and Thursdays. If you are looking at kohl's I would recommend it if you have great patience like I do."
good,Kohl's has a lot of fantastic employees that make your shift go by. The management crew is hard-working people who want to see the store and their employees succeed.

good,"A typical day at work at Kohls was very relax and nice. Everyone including the managers were super nice and outgoing! They loved giving everyone energy so every employee can sell Kohl's charge, which is a credit card. Overall, I loved working there cause everyone was so positive and nice towards me."
good,"It is always something different when working at Kohl's. Depending on the time of department you are in, you will always have something to do whether it is assisting customers to their merchandise needs or merchandising the floor with our products."
good,"This was the first time that I had worked in retail but overall I found the experience to be very rewarding, especially when you just being nice and respectful to customers would make their day."

good,"Working at Kohls in Sussex, WI was one of the best working experiences I've had. The management staff is amazing, supportive, and always there if you have questions or need help."
good,Kohls provides a comfortable and fun work environment.The daily goals are realistic and keep the associates motivated to achieve them. Providing great customer service is important and getting good reviews is what is truly drive this company.
good,"I've been working at kohl's for about 5 years now and I won't ever say a bad word about them. The managers and supervisors are all like family. The staff is welcoming and friendly with the occasional drama starters, but what can you expect in retail when teenagers work there. They have worked with me on being flexible and understanding health issues I was dealing with and not getting frustrated with me over that. I love kohl's and honestly don't think I'll ever be able to leave because I love it too much!"
good,"The atmosphere at kohl’s is fast paced, but relaxed. The high volume of customers means there’s always someone engaging to interact with. There was almost always random food in the break room and they had a card-compatible vending machine."
good,"Kohl’s is most definitely one of the better retail places to work. Seasonal or not, it’s a blast. The best job i’ve ever had. Met some of the most respectful, intelligent, and professional people here. 10/10."
good,I loved working at Kohl’s. The managment and employees were awesome to work with. The only reason I am not currently there is because I found a job to match the degree I have.
good,"I love working at Kohl's, I have wonderful coworkers and managers, flexible schedules and it is easy to take time off if it is needed. I have good salary."
good,It was wonderful to work at Kohls for the short time that I was there. It was very fast pace and all the employees were very helpful with any type of assistance. Kohls is one of my favorite stores to shop so it was very easy to love to work at store and interact will all the customers who had the same option as I did of this great store.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Lots of opportunity for advancement. Great management. Training is fast so you need to be a fast learner. Flexible hours. Have to work weekends And holidays as with any retail.
good,I had a great time working at Kohls. I learned a lot and the staff/customers were great people. The different areas of work that were available to the employees opened plenty of doors to new opportunities and new skills. Although there was a healthy amount of competition for a secure job position between the younger employees I still had a very pleasant experience working there.
good,"Good relationship with my co-workers.  Was able to talk to my managers. Healthy work environment. I enjoyed working for Kohl's."
good,"I liked the job. If it wasn’t for seasonal applicants, I would probably still be an associate there. Everyone is nice and easy to get along with. They are very flexible with hours."
good,Several options for advancement and the staff are very understanding and concerned with each individual employee. They also deal with workplace issues very appropriately.
good,my managers was great they always made sure i had breaks and had everything i need to work efficiently. everyone i worked with was so sweet and helpful.and the work was easy to learn
good,Nice friendly environment with family-like co-workers and managers. Worked between me having a child and me going to college full-time. Always considerate of other people opinion and feelings.
good,"every company has its pros and cons.  Kohls is no different.  Overall, I think they do a great job with work/life balance for retail.  They put a lot of energy into the associate and that makes a difference with retention and culture"
good,"Most of the managers at this site are very encouraging and pitch in during those busy times.  The company promotes ongoing computer based training and really tries to keep up with buying trends.  The options that customers are given are numerous, so most of the time not only are  fellow employees pleasant.  The customers are very pleasant due to"
good,"Kohl's was a great place for seasonal work. I ended up working a lot more than initially promised for about a month. The job itself was easy going with a lot of folding. If i wasn't with helping a costumer, I was folding the same things over and over. My management was great while at Kohl's. Every so often our manger would call over the headsets and ask if we were all okay on the floor. I will say that there was a lack of training having come in so late during the holiday season. I never touched a register and I didn't know how to work a bluebird, what the store is essentially run on, until my last week or so. I knew how to fold and be extremely polite to customers, but overall the job itself was amazing, and I would gladly work there again."
good,"I work in housewares and kids usually stocking, folding and straightening up items. I also pull omni online orders, customers places order and you have to pick it, pack it, and place it in the proper place. I also run register."
good,Psysically challenging. I walked a lot more than I expected. The Bluebird system made the order picking a lot easier and helps reduce errors. I really enjoyed the relaxed workplace atmosphere. We all had a timely job to do and we worked together to make sure the customer orders were taken care of in a timely manner.
good,"I liked working there it was a fun, friendly place to work, I liked all of the managers they were always helpful and friendly, I also liked the people I worked with. I got close with most of the cashiers I worked with."
good,I learn a lot about the system of Work Force in America from Kohl's which made me to rejoin the company in Atlanta. Kohl's has trained me operating the power lift truck that gives me more energy to find an additional job in the warehouses to keep myself busy and make the money to help my family. Thank you Kohl's!!!
good,"Loved the fast paced days.  "
good,"Kohl's has been a blessing. I've never had an issue with co-workers or my managers. They do their jobs exceedingly well, and have helped me every step."
good,"Would work here a long time. I would love to be their loss prevention officer if I was given the choice, but I’m only seasonal so it is what it is. It’s a nice place to work though."
good,I enjoyed kohls because it was a laid back job and I got to help out people. I would recommend working there. The hardest part of the job was finding a missing shoe.
good,I loved working at Kohl's and I would recommend any high schooler looking for a flexible job to work there. Good pay for a high schooler and easy work.

good,I enjoyed working at Kohls considering it was may first job out of high school I always had fun working their and the people always made it the best. My manager was always so nice and sincere she always made you feel comfortable thats what I love the most. The people.
good,NIce place to work at just the salary wasnt good enough but a relaxed job ennviroment would recomendd for lart time if u have a standard job if not wouldnt reccomnd
good,"I have worked for Kohl's in multiple full-time positions over the past 7 years. I love this company very much. They are respectful to work/life balance, focus on celebrating their employees accomplishments, and overall just a positive work environment. The only drawback in my opinion is the pay. Again, I have worked here 7 years and am standing at less than $12/hr."
good,"I worked there for a seasonal job, but the management was super amazing to everyone there, helped us if we had any questions or concerns, taught us wonderful customer service. Anybody looking for a beginner job, this is the place to start! The hardest part for me to learn was learning to use a register, the most enjoyable part was the overall employees who made it super enjoyable to work there."
good,Kohl's was a great company to work for. The best part was how they tried to engage teammates and community. The hardest part was the peak schedule around holiday. Overall great company to work for.
good,I liked the job and the management and other workers were very welcoming. They were very flexible with my hours and knowing that I had to go back to school.
good,"You get a hand held scanner to check inventory and work with. You'd get a list to retrieve your freight with, and some people enjoyed to see who could effectively and accurately get their list done the quickest. Its not the funnest job, but if you work with the right people, it can be quite enjoyable."
good,Kohls is a great place to work. They have great benefits and options to make your own schedule. They have two shifts to choose from. They give their employees great discounts during the year.
good,"This is definitely a job for early birds. Sometimes started at 4:00 a.m. But a good work environment and good supervisor. Black Friday was a very busy day, it kept me moving."
good,"enjoyed working with the public, fast paced environment with good management and training available. variety of duties, great work schedule. happy place to work"

good,"I enjoyed starting when the store opened, getting people to open up kohls charge cards. I was able to come there when I got off of my first and full time job. I also liked that we got a discount because I love to shop."
good,"Kohl's is a very busy retail store with many customers who have many questions when checking out but with the help of many qualified employees questions have been answered immediately. "
good,Great location to move up fast with in a companie. Makes well rounded employees by having them learn a bit of all areas in the store. they are well involved in the community.
good,"Enjoyed going to work"
good,I love being employed at Kohl's. Great management team and co-workers. They truly are a second family. The vast majority of our customers express their satisfaction with their Kohl's shopping experience. I truly look forward to going to work.
good,"A typical work day starts with being assignment in a certain sub department on the sales floor. You were expected to maintain that part of the floor for the entire time. I learned a lot about the store and how it is managed and how to handle certain situations. It taught me how to manage my time well while being on the floor. The workplace culture was kinda clique-ish, everyone had their pack and only one pack had their way which was not the best."
good,"I had an awesome work experience with Kohls. The atmosphere was so welcoming,  my co workers were like my family. I loved my hours and the flexibility of my position."
good,"The management and coworkers really make you feel like you are a family. There is almost always some sort of meal provided in the break-room. You also get the best of both working independently and as a team. I would highly recommend working here, and would love to return myself."
good,"Solid Company to work for at the time I was employed with them. Lots of workload and deadlines. Work life balance needs work. Overall, working with my team provided me with the opportunity to form lasting bonds with other associates. I am still in contact with many of the team members that I worked with."
good,i hated working there i learned nothing but how to use their systems management workplace was horrible people were quitting all the time hardest part was pay
good,Fun day to work. Always something different happening each day. Get to interact with various kinds of people. Coworkers were always very helpful in the learning process and helping each other out.
good,"A typical day at work for me at kohl's is helping customers with anything they might need as well as helping unload trucks and helping set the new product out. The management at kohl's is always willing to help there employees in any way they can. They also give words of encouragement! I feel as if the hardest part of the job is not knowing what days you'll be scheduled, so that other appointments can be scheduled. The most enjoyable part of my job is to help customers in anyway that I can!"

They have a very flexible work schedule and give me as many hours as I want or need, and still give me time off when I have other school-related obligations. The managers are understanding and motivating, and the co-workers are kind and helpful. Teamwork is a huge aspect of working here and we are always willing to help one another inside and outside of work."

good,I loved to work at Kohls good pay for the Work associates were great along with managers. Working there made my day go by fast and easy work was as you go making it really easy just had to check over our areas and make sure it was clean
good,kohl's has a great work place and is good during the holidays but once it starts to get slow and you only get hours based on your ability to get credits really sucks.
good,Your coworkers are more than happy to help you out and answer questions you may not know. The managers are also awesome at working around your schedule.
good,"Had great discount, breaks, and management. I loved working there as a seasonal associate and would recommend it to anyone in need of a job as long as they work hard."

Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Kohls has a very friendly work environment. Everyone who works there is very understanding and management is very understanding if you need to leave early or need to call out for any reason. There are also lots of opportunities to pick up extra shifts. When there are a lot of people at kohls it can get a little stressful and very fast paced, but typically it can be somewhat slow especially on focusing on folding one area of clothing."
good,I love working at Kohls. The only down fall is all the change and having to adjust with no pay increase. Awesome vacation time as well as able to buy vacation time
good,Kohls is a good company to grow with. The business is always changing and adapting to the times.  Kohls has many locations which gives opportunity for advancement. The pay is very competitive and the benefits are great. If you were able to succeed in the past pace environment with the high sense of urgency Check out Kohls.
good,"Everything is awesome is just that is not as busy as before. staff are so respecful and helpful. they aloud you to learn and move up.aswell.   "
good,"Kohl's was my first actual job. The staff was nice, welcoming, and extremely helpful but the tasks seemed to make the day drag longer. I was a sales floor associate. I was in charge of organizing clothes, putting the clothes back on their proper racks, and helping the customers. The job was not all that difficult, just time-consuming. I learned how to plan and work with a team. As stated before, the staff is nice; my co-workers made the time fly by at times. Overall, I enjoyed being employed at Kohl's."
good,"Great job fun fast paced during holidays after the holidays asked quickly died cutting hours. Very easy job. Pay was adequate. Just looking for more hours. Hours,"

I advance yo work in the cash office counting all the stores money and making deposits. In charge of stocking store with enough money from bank"
good,"Learn a lot of new things and was promoted early for hard work. Worked with my family life. great benefits. I loved this job. If you had any questions, they would help you understand them and show you hands on. Very easy and fun. I did put a lot of unwanted clothes back on the floor. Great people and environment. Was a very busy place to work, kept you busy. Very good on giving breaks. Paid well. Had benefits for full time and part time. 401K for fulltime and lots of vacation time. Had reviews."
good,"It is a great place to work, they are willing to train you in more than one area of the store. Nice/friendly co-workers and managers. Flexible schedules."
good,While working with Kohl's I gained a lot of customer service experience as well as working on the registers. I only worked Part Time but it was a great environment to work at really great team and a manageable job to have.
good,Kohl’s is a fun exciting fast paced place to work. They are caring and always understanding. I wouldn’t want to work any other retail job and I’m grateful I had this opportunity
good,"I enjoyed working at Kohl’s and would have liked to stay on as a permanent employee however, the position was only seasonal.  The atmosphere was fun all while keeping the customers in mind. I enjoyed keeping the floor presentable and providing great customer service."
good,Good job and good benefits  and good salary .. it’s important to say that Kohls is a big company with good sales too . That’s what I love my jobs at kohls and I love to buy clothes there tooo
good,"My Boss would usually tell me what department she wants me to work in. I have learned how to fold, organize and place objects so that they look showroom ready. The people who work at Kohl's are nice and easy going. There was really nothing hard about the job. Knowing that I was doing a good job was the most enjoyable part."
good,"it was a fun environment with friendly coworkers."
good,"When I started I was a freight associate and not I can work anywhere in the store. Like most jobs in this field the hardest part can be the customers, but there are always those who have been there long enough to help you through anything. It has been one of my favorite places to work because of the individuals that I work with, they are like a second family."
good,"I enjoy working at Kohl's EFC for the Holidays ."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,awesome place to work for. Love the environment. Awesome people and everyone is friendly. Everyone is helpful and will go above and beyond to help you. Very fast apced environment.
good,"I worked at Kohl's over the holiday season as a dock worker. I would unload, organize, and stock the merchandise in the store. The management there was amazing, the staff was incredibly welcoming and friendly."
good,"I would go into work. Check in with people who were there before me. Find out what has to be done until it is time to go home. See who the closing manager is on duty. There were always new things to know and learn about. There are many changes which happen within everyday. Help customers who needed assistance, fold clothing, organize clothes on racks, pick up clothes on the floor, clean out fitting rooms. Make sure the store looks presentable. Help others and provide excellent customer service. Go above and beyond for customers. Make the customer feel very satisfied."
good,"You are moving a lot which is good and you learn more then what you are assigned to do. For example if you were a Sales Associate you would learn more than that position, like doing OMNI or BOPUS. I learned something everyday and I think it would be a great experience for others because you learn how to multi-task as well as enhance your skills in communication in positive and negative situations."
good,"working here at first is a lot to take in there are alot of items to memorize and know where they go, coworkers are very friendly and super helpful, guest vary but usually are polite, making rounds of your area can be confusing at first but picking busy stops to work on first sets you on the right path, and managers are on breaks and peoples stations in an effective manner love the organization here."
good,I worked in Loss Prevention with a Manger who gave you the tools for success recognized success and drive. If it weren't for cut backs I'd still be there. There are some who complain about not liking their schedule but My manager allowed us to make ours around our store needs (which just boosted our success). My manager would fight to get us what we needed to be successful. My team was a cohesive unit and there 24-7 to help each other. I often traveled to other states to help out other stores. LOVED IT. GOOD pay too.
good,"I enjoyed working at Kohl's. Company culture was positive, supportive and helpful. I enjoyed interacting with customers. I would recommend Kohl's as a prospective employer to others."
good,"overall grate place to work, Awesome with flexibility and willingness to compromise but not good at supplying employees with consistent hours and pay is on the lower side of the scale"
good,"I was very lucky to have supportive, hard working managers that really cared about the associates. While the pay isn't that great, the discount is fantastic, often amounting to 55% or even 65% off at some points. Sometimes there are nasty customers but that's true of any retail job. The managers also badger you about soliciting credit. Overall, I love my job at Kohl's."
good,"Enjoy working at Kohls, positive attitudes. Really great discounts. Friendly management and flexible with second job or school. Company is fair about the breaks. Other accociates very friendly and helpful."
good,I loved working for Kohls- great people and great company!  The company cares about their people and Customers.  I worked for a great boss. I only left because I was approached with a great offer that was of a much higher scope.
good,"Training was provided, management very visible and involved in daily operation. The most enjoyable part of the job was interaction with the customers. Nice to be recognized for being a positive, customer orientated employee."
good,"My previous job experiences were always stressful, but the environment at Kohl's is so peaceful and calm. There is still busy times and lines, but it was less stressful in a way. The most enjoyable part of the job is being a cashier, or folding clothes. The hardest part when you're new is knowing how to direct or help people since orientation doesn't really teaches you why we sell this, or if we sell this. We kind of have to learn how to communicate and work as a team to help provide service to our customers, and it's a process I haven't learn yet, but hopefully I will soon. I am learning a lot about teamwork, and being dependable for a team."
good,"A typical day at work would be me coming in and clocking in, grabbing a walkie and then walking back to an open register."
good,Nice start to the work world. Kohls teaches a lot of responsibilities not only with work but in life! Happy I was able to experience this corporation as one of my work place
good,Management is always happy and willing to accommodate time off for personal issues. They take the time to explain the task at hand as well as its importance.
good,the managers and coworkers were amazing. if i had the opportunity to work at kohls again i would defintely take the position agaim because it was such a great working environment
good,"A typical day at work keeps you busy."
good,"I learned how to keep a positive attitude and how to be patient. I also learned how to multitask because I could be doing a project on one side of the store and would be needed elsewhere. I'd have to find a way to get things done on the way to my second destination. At times, it could get crazy, depending the location you work at, just go with the flow and hold on tight."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Khols. It was only my second job, I really enjoyed the environment there at the time. I succeeded in my position. I was even offered two promotions from managers after working there a short period of time, however, I was moving out of the area. Overall I had a great experience there."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management.

good,managed a large number of associates and loved interaction with guests.  Developed a better understand of merchandising.  Enjoyed the opportunities the job offered.
good,"This had to be my favorite job so far, too bad I was seasonal. I was able to work at my own pace, unless I was the cashier. The training is really easy and so was the interview."
good,"Overall this company is very satisfying to work for. There are a lot of very helpful people working there as well as the customers that visit the store. If you are working part-time, your hours will usually be pretty consistent, with very minor changes week to week."
good,"Working at Kohls is a great place to work on customer service skills, on the sales and as cashier. In addition, you get to be part of a team and work with others on projects and sets."
good,"I enjoyed the managers,i enjoyed working with the staff, i like the sales the have all the time,cash back i really like all the clearance sales i like they clothes shoes ect."
good,"very nice liked working here for the past year, the managers are awesome, and everyone is very friendly, I think the hardest part of the job is standing on my feet for such long periods of time."
good,I learned the most about great customer service at Kohl's. They always knew how to help and please customers no matter what and most customers who had problems would leave happily. Kohl's knows the true meaning of great customer service. Management was always there to help especially while training.
good,"I enjoyed this job very much. The customers, employees were great. The managers were always very helpful with questions and concerns. I enjoy making and keeping customers happy no matter how little or how long it takes to fix their concern or problem. This store was a high volume selling location. That brought some challenges at first with it being so busy but I enjoyed it very much. I learned about how to conquer time management."
good,"Kohls EFC is a great place to work, a fun, fast paced atmosphere. There are ample opportunities for advancement and the environment is very motivating."
good,I worked here seasonal the days were long and hard. The pay was decent but some of the staffing in upper management had a God complex. But my co-workers were great team players.
good,"Kohls was a great place to work.  Many opportunities for job advancement and to learn new skills.  There are so many different departments that work together to make Kohls successful The workplace culture is always changing and grown to include new and innovative ideas.  "
good,"Great company to work for, this company really cares about the associates. They focus on customer service and really have a great chance of moving up to those who really work hard. I love kohl's."
good,People were all very friendly and helpful. The pay wasn't bad and the management was good. They trained me well. I didn't feel like i didn't know what i was doing.
good,"I only worked there seasonally but I wish I would've stayed when my seasonal term was up. It's a lot of folding clothes and picking up the floors, but it's actually really relaxing. The hardest part was cleaning an area and then coming back a few minutes later to see it all torn up, but that's just retail!"
good,"It was quite an enjoyable job, I would definitely go back there. They care about their workers and the managers are really nice and outgoing. Fun Job!"
good,"Working at Kohl's was a lot of work, but at the same time, I always felt as if I was getting something done. Everyone was always so kind and helpful, the whole idea of treating customers with respect and kindness was real and Ii really appreciated working in such an environment."
good,It was a nice learning experience. management could have been better. but it was very fun and my co workers made work a blast. the seasonal times though. it made me appreciate the people in retail way more
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Very friendly and very understanding. Works around your schedule. There are always new opportunities to better yourself, and become better at other areas of the job."
good,A great place to work!! It is a team effort company. Everyone has a job to keep everything running smoothly. Lots of management and they are very hands-on. They want to help as best they can. It is a fun environment.
good,I loved this job. The managers were so awesome and I made a lot of friends while working here. Only issue I had was that I didn't make enough so I had to leave and started working at Walmart.
good,I love Kohls love working there. The people are nice the pay is good. Everyone gets along. Pay every week....good work life balance there as well...love it
good,Working for Kohl's set me with all of the customer service skills that I would need for life. The management was fantastic at this store and the Customers were alright. there was a lot of folding and picking up clothes though.
good,manage retail staff as well as all aspects store operations. Controll udgets and expenses to ensure profits. Provide quality customer service to internal and external customers.
good,Absolutely love this job the only reason I quite is because I didn't have reliable transportation at the time. I would go back any day fun energy fun work environment and diverse.
good,"Management is very precise when it comes to treating customers with up-most respect and making sure counterfeit money is not accepted. A typical day working at Kohls would be normally easy during the day and around 5 or 6 we would get a rush of customers. If you love working in a fast paced environment, seasonal work at Kohls is just the right job. The hardest part of the job would be having to wait until everyone finishes cleaning their station. Usually i would be done rather quickly so i would try to assist everyone else to speed up the process."
good,"Long hours but great pay, the only thing was having a manager go in and erase my vacation time, but HR fixed it and sent me a check the next day, other than that I loved Kohls."
good,I really enjoyed working this job. I always had a lot of fun with the other employees. We were able to work hard and get our work done but still have a good time and enjoy doing it.
good,"Started as a cashier. Sometimes (most of time) you could met rude and upset customer but we know that this is kind of job industry is interaction with customer so its pretty common to see this kind of problem, just don't take it personally.

good,I love this job its very good work and hard work. Its all outdoor year round and they keep you busy. Great team work and easy to mive up in the bussiness. Great if youblike to be in nature.
good,I worked in the Home and Kids department. I was hired as a seasonal worker and was hired on after the season. The ladies there are so fun and nice to work with. They are very competitive but very helpful and encouraging. I plan on staying with them for a while. Discounts are very nice too.
good,When i first started it was the holiday season and I was working 40 hours a week if not more. Once the holiday was over my hours cut down to 7 to 10 hours a week. The shipping room is very cluttered and disorganized it was hard to unload the truck. Otherwise it was a great place to work and the management team was very professional.
good,"Soon as you step into the building, everyone looked happy and glad to be there."
good,"A typical day working at kohl's is very face paced, yet fun. I absolutely enjoyed every minute working at kohl's! they are very quick to acknowledge and reward you for your hard work!"
good,"I loved working for kohl's. From the associates, to the managers, to the customers. The company treats the employees very well, and it shows because the employees treat the customers so well."
good,I enjoyed the interactions with customers and associates. Helping out in departments gave me a chance to learn the department and product lines. It was great to volunteer for some good causes. Kohl's gives back so much to the community.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Did our morning stretches for safety precautions. Hardest part of the day was working on the black out periods having to keep up with amount of product to how much time you had.
good,"Friendly environment great people great staff good values strong leaders everyone is willing to go,above and beyond I enjoyed working there good pay good benefits"
good,This was a great first job. I am currently just looking for something new to better further my people skills and other aspects. I have become comfortable at my job and would enjoy new challenges.
good,This Was A Nice Place To Be Apart Of as Far As working. It Was The Pay And how Much we Actually Worked That Didn't Add Up. They Should Pay More For All The Work you're Entitled To do In their Establishment.
good,When cleaning up fitting rooms you don't have to work alone there's someone that can help. If you're needing help with anything someone is willing to help. Communicating with the customers is great.
good,"One of the best retail companies out there. Pay is really good, plus benefits. Only things to earn benefits is that you have to work there for a while. overall the best retail companies out there."
good,"I unloaded trucks and worked home and kids. I did inventory, stocking, orginistion, and register experience. I got a good amount of customer experience. The truck manager was a great person. The high up ones terry and merlisa where rude to there employess"
good,Everyone at Kohl's is very genuine! Management at my store was excellent! Provided everyone with a happy environment. The most enjoyable mart of the job was when I got to work on the Sales Floor and was able to help maintain it.
good,"working here was the best job I ever had, I wouldn't want to work anywhere else if I was in retail. the environment is always positive and full of fun"
good,Working at Khols was a new job experience in such a good way. They're very family and friends oriented. The work environment and personnel are very organized and professional.
good,Kohl's Warehouse created a comfortable work environment. The managament team was open to helping employees move up through the company and learn as much about the system as they could.
good,"I personally love working for this company, and I have never had a job that I have loved so much. I know how to do pretty much anything there. It's not a hard job at all,  basic day on the sales floor would require you to clean out fitting rooms, pick items up from the floor, recovering all areas (not by yourself), and assisting customers if they need your help. You also have your usual cashier and customer service positions, and there is an OMNI crew that handles online orders or buy online pick up in store orders."
good,"management is easy to get along with and have flexible hours "
good,"the management and the co workers are very helpful and understand how it is being new. they are very generous and ask if you need help all the time. "
good,"Unloading & processing freight. Distributing out to the sales floor."
good,"A typical day at work entails you to work with customers and clean up the store."
good,Very good place to work just slow and not enough hours through out the year but very fast pace during peak season which is what I'm used to.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Handled customer calls regarding online orders and tracking information. Learned how to provide excellent customer service. Coworkers were very friendly. Hardest part of job was maintaining your QA scores. The bonus were great motivation to work hard.
good,"I got to deal with a bunch of new customers every single day. That was the fun part, besides me being alone in the stock room for the majority of my shift I got along pretty well with my other co-workers when they'd see me out on the sales floor. A couple things I've learned while working here is that no matter what be respectful to all the customers in the store no matter what they say about you or the other employees. The hardest part of the job was probably trying to find the right size of clothing the customer needed and finding things that customers have ordered online in the back. The management was amazing because they all had huge smiles on their faces when they showed up to work."
good,"I really enjoy working at Kohl's.  The managers and co-workers are very helpful and a joy to work with. "
good,"Everyone that is employed are so very nice and helpful."
good,"Great, love the job all around but more than likely seasonal,  have to take this job serious if your looking for full time after so be careful not to talk so much and do work!"
good,Great place to build and learn. Managers are friendly and always willing to help. Raises are usually based on performance and there are always opportunities to grow.
good,"Working at Kohls in Fairview Heights is very community oriented. I loved their Associate in Action program. They are really like a big family there. The management was very friendly and my coworkers were very welcoming, as i was only a seasonal employee."
good,"Where I worked for Kohl's was a pretty laid back environment. Weekdays were usually slow opposed to working weekends, of course. I enjoyed my time working there."
good,"I picked items from labeled bins with a RF scanner by scanning the collate bar code and placing the product in it's rightful place. I unloaded trucks and built pallets."
good,Great with flexing hours at your request. Everybody works as a team and is great with helping out. Managers are known for being apart of any work instead of just sitting back and watching.
good,"Working for Kohl's is a fun environment. I've learned new things everyday. I've learned to be patience to customers, that if you are having a bad day you still put your smile on your face and be helpful. One thing i like about Kohl's they are very flexible with my hours especially I have two little kids. The Store manager and the area managers are very approachable. I remember when i was new if i have questions about the register my co-workers are very helpful and understanding. The most hardest part when we are open 24/7 a week before Christmas and the line to the register was non-stop and I am working until midnight and need to get up early to drop my kids off to school then go to my morning job.The fun part was when the management caters food for all the employees during Easter, Thanks Giving and Christmas week."
good,"I enjoyed working at Kohl's, people are cool. The other associates were very helpful. "
good,it was great working for kho'ls they made me feel a part of their family and it great talking to the customers about different clothes ideas for their kids or husband or wife.
good,"Awesome place to work. Management was great about everything- breaks, meals, schedule requests/changes, answering any questions. I really loved working here and would have stayed if they compensated more than minimum wage."
good,Kohl's is my first job and I've learned how to be more social. Interacting and meeting people is what I love most about my job there. The hardest part working there is try to help as many people as you can at once and/or finding what the customer needs when it's not in store.
good,Kohls was a place that I really was able to stretch my wings and get a feel for a new style of environment and customer. There was always new people coming in allowing me to accomplish my goal and leave a lasting imprint with my customers and create a bond through a relationship.
good,"Kohl's is a great job if you're looking for ways to make money. You're given atleast 30 hours a week with wonder people around you. Everyone there makes you feel like in kohl's we're one big team. Everyone knows everyone, and the management is so organized. 5 Stars from me!"
good,great managers who truly care about everyone. always hours avaliable. many advancements but once you reach a point there is no more options.
good,"Stock the clothes given from the back, also maintain the main area and meet and greet customers. Clean the front and wipe down all stationery area available at times."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I was at Kohls for close to a year. And my grandfather took badly ill that turned into him passing away. I was told that it was a family based store. The people you worked with was like your family. But when i was at my most difficult point. There was a few that knew my sorrow. I just wished it would of turned out much more different then me ending up quit.
good,"- Flexible working hours"
good,"A normal day at work is to go on time clock in , start the day by unloading truck, go to stock merchandise and assist customer around the store as needed."
good,"This is a wonderful place to work if a part time job is all you require.  I absolutely love going to work each day knowing I will see people that care about my well being."
good,Was a great place to work.  People were friendly and very helpful with every situation. Management was always willing to help and work with you. Co-workers were friendly but always have one it the crowd. Hardest part was trying to please everyone when they were in a bad mood.  But you put a smile on and keep going hoping you could turn the frown upside down.  Most fun was making people smile and enjoy their shopping experience.
good,Kohl's is a very good place to work with regard to them accomodating life events.  Family type associations come very easily there.
good,"kohls was a good place to work . not only for the pay which was excellent we got paid $9 an hour and they paid use weekly , but the people were so cool and i had fun working and learning there"
good,I love working with clothes and helping customers find what they need. I worked mainly in the fitting rooms and putting merchandise back on the floor. My supervisor was great and my co-workers were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was doing alot of bending but the best part of the job was helping  customers find what they want.
good,"KOHL's was the first company I have ever worked for. The employee's are nice, the managers confident and amazing. The only downside to working for KOHL's is that the hours you work is based on how well you are at getting customers to apply for credits. If you work 8 hours one day and only get 1 credit that day and none for the rest of the week, then in two weeks you'd only be working four hours."
good,"Great company to work for. I love my job the management is great and very understanding. They treat employees with respect and fairness and make decisions that you are proud of; this includes using appropriate language, images and expectations."
good,"Worked part-time for 6 months. The team is very productive and everyone, from the Store Manager on down, does their fare share. Team members are courteous and friendly. They willingly help each other out. Because the team is cohesive the customers are treated well, which makes for an inviting and pleasant experience for the guests."
good,"I cleared 3 to 6 fitting rooms and process cash, credit card, coupons and rewards transaction for customers."
good,I enjoy working at kohl's it is a easy fast pace working environment. I love my co workers and management. Our communication with each other throughout the store between departments and our managers is amazing with swift response time and clear answers. I love working at Khol;s.
good,"Kohl's is a great company that allows for a great work, life balance. They provide you with the ability to learn and excel in your position and do not over burden you with tasks that can be draining. They want to make sure that you are happy with your work. Relaxed start and end times for the day and allow you to WFH. Fast paced environment because of retail as well."
good,Working here I made quite a few new friends and acquaintances with co-workers and customers alike. The work environment could get quite stressful around the holidays or rather boring during slow times but I don't have anything bad to say about the time I spent working there. It really was a great job and I highly recommend it!
good,"Kohls was an awesome job. The best part about working in kohls were my co-workers and customers. Everyone helped each other out in order to keep thing running at a good pace. I've learned and grew a lot thanks to kohls. For a year and a half I was a jewelry consultant that helped people out with transaction,returns and merchandise. Afterwards I moved to the sales floor where I greeted and assisted customers with merchandises. The hardest part of the job was leaving and saying goodbye to awesome people. Overall, working at kohls was a great experience that I enjoyed working in."
good,Fast pace... benefits are great thru Kohle's... people and culture are good... just don't know if you have a full time position or not due to seasons.... only secure jobs when you get hired full time
good,Great company to work for. They support future growth of their employees to better themselves for future positions within or outside of Kohl's Corporation.
good,"Great place to work, it is very satisfying to be able to help people find things they need and help make suggestions for items.  Co-workers are fun and helpful.  Gives a feeling of accomplishment in making a messy store nice again."
good,The breakdown of what is required by each manager is not balanced. There is too much reliance on certain salaried positions compared to others creating an unbalanced work atmosphere.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Working at Kohl's was a wonderful opportunity. The management is great and all of my co-workers were amazing. You quickly become friends with everyone you work with, and everyone is helpful when it comes to helping new people learn their jobs."
good,"I love working with the public and meeting people. The people that worked at Kohl was nice and friendly. The boss had strict rules such as every customer that entered Kohls make sure that you say ""welcome to kohls""."
good,"There is always something to be done, and it is an excellent teaching job. It can be very hard working and at other times, a little more relaxed. I have learned how to treat customers and how to solve customer complaints. There are always set expectations and goals to fill by the end of the day. Management is great and provide a happy place for all associates. They are quick to recognize great employees and good services."
good,"the people who work here are always willing to help you out in anyway they can, I loved it here but I was only here for the hoilday season. Would work their again . The only hard thing about the job is working the palm pilots. Other than that it was a breeze."
good,"Great environment, amazing and loyal customers, but some areas do need some work. I love the customers and how amazingly nice they are to me; they are the reason I love the job. Even though some  things need work, I do love the atmosphere."
good,"I liked working for Kohl's because  most of the people that worked there were real nice. During the holidays they had food catered in and we had a nice spread of food. For 1 week before Christmas, the store is opened 24 hours a day. They made sure that the overnight crew that worked had food every night.There was something new every night."
good,"I really enjoyed working for kohl's. It was my first retail position for department stores. Everyone was really helpful and nice, especially the management team, kelsey,erin, alison, gerry, and so many more. I learned so may new things working there.I am grateful that they gave me a chance, and it will be an experience that will stay with me at each new job I get."
good,A typical day here is simple and easy. I learned how to be fast paced and work well with others in a croded environment. The management are great to work with as they do all they can to assist its fellow employees/co-workers. Co-workers are easy to work with as well as get along with. There isn't much about the job that's hard its pretty easy. I honestly believe that only yourself can make the job complicated by doing something wrong. The most enjoyable part about the job is receiving your check at the end of the week.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of operating a Point of sale system. Performing transactions with the general public and soliciting Kohl's specific credit cards to customers. I learned many skills that benefit me in my customer service career as well as time management, and general information on how to keep a successful corporation successful. The management and co-workers at my specific store were more like family. They were interested in your day to day life, friendly, and were more than helpful when it came to personal issues. The hardest part of the job was difficult customers around the holidays, and in some instances, language barriers. The most enjoyable part about the job was working with the public."
good,Overall I liked kohls as a workplace and you can really expand your skills if the field you was hired for is somewhere you would like to stay. I personally came from the health field so this collection environment was a little different for me but overall I can say that management always works on your weakness and help come up with ways to get you to the next level
good,"A typical day of work for a Seasonal job include pulling merchandise from inventory, assembling fixtures, and straightening up the sales floor.  Management was great and always there to help.  Fast paced environment.  Employees were always willing to help.  The part I didn't like was that it was a seasonal job.  The amount of people the company can hire on is very limited (under 5)."
good,I've loved working here and the Kohl's in Cary has a great team. I've learned a lot but this was a great introduction to retail with real opportunities for advancement.
good,"Enjoyed working for the company. A typical day is fast-paced, but can be handled easily, simple work. Management is always available and very friendly and straight foward. Co-workers were decent."
good,I met a lot of wonderful people through kohls I learned a lot and feel more confident in everything I do because of the experience and skills I gained from kohls
good,"I worked at Kohl's both full time and part time over the past years, and always enjoyed my time there, as well as my co-workers."
good,"Fast pace environment, learned how to put customers first in all circumstance. supportive management and co-workers. Hardest part was always finding a way to please everybody but best part was knowing I've done my best to succeed at my job."
good,"Fun place to work and meet new people. Staff is super friendly, the trainers are very steady with new comers at work. The HR department made sure that the employees were comfortable. They also made sure that all the employees little problems and disputes were always handled."
good,"I have learned so much in such a short time but I love it! Its a fun fast paced work environment, everyone is nice and helpful, even the customers are great! I love all my peers and haven't found anyone I cant get along with. The hardest part about my job is probably maintaining our shoe department, its a little difficult, I call it our organized chaos department."
good,"It has been a few years since I worked retail at Kohl's, but I enjoyed working with the associates and management. When I first worked there, I was nervous after having been out of retail for several years . The management team let me know they had confidence in my abilities and encouraged me. When I was offered another job at a large factory, they were not upset, and encouraged me to accept. This led to me working at Kohl's two other times on a part time basis. The management team never hesitated to hire me on these part time positions when I needed the work."
good,Fun work place I got a chance to interact with the customers directly  it was helping them to find an item off or website or f they had questions concerning the rewards program Also assisted other team members with knowing where to go if they had questions concerning the job requirements while they was on a call
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,The people at our store go above and beyond for other associates and customers! Love working as a team and driving success to the corporation.
good,"I love my time there at Kohls , i stayed moving , helping any one that needed and i work hard. I learn how to stay strong while doing more and one thing. My boss was great, if i needed help she help and she made sure that everyone understood the rules and on the same page. Co workers were even better, they mad me feel welcome and if i needed help they also help me out as well."
good,"Amazing group of people to work with, always very busy with room to grow.  Managers are very easy to approach.  They're medical could be a little better but other then that it's a good company."
good,Management has a great energy about them and always eager to help with any task at any time to make sure he customer leaves highly satisfied. Always keeping employees up-to-date on trainings necessary in field of work.
good,"People welcome you when you start your day and you greet them back. That gives an active start up to the shift. Friendliness with everyone, up to mark management, and treating all the customers with equality are the characteristics that every job teaches. The hardest part of job was to work less."
good,"Day at Kohl's: Fun and love to look at the style outfits."
good,"Kohls is the best place I have worked yet. Co-workers are friendly, greets at door before shift, games in break room, food can be purchased, decent hours. Hardest part of job is trying to meet UPH daily, some big boxes have 1 item only that takes up a lot of space in line, which would mean less UPH. Overall my experiece at Kohls Dist. is a very good experience.Looking for a part time opportunity."
good,"A great place for beginners to work. They also work with students, so they can go to class and still work. Have any repeat customers, so you get to know them by name."
good,Kohl's is a great place to work.  You meet the most interesting customers.  But also can be very fast paced and busy.  The hours are flexible and the management team always makes sure that all the employees are enjoying what they do for the company.  It's great to work for a company who puts the customer first.
good,"I worked at 3 different stores and it really depends on your management. First two stores had terrible management. There was a lack of communication and stress. "
good,The management and shift leaders always made sure every single person working knew what they had to do. We had rewards for meeting certain requirements.
good,The work environment is free and stress free. A good mix of people from different backgrounds. the hours are flexible and the work ii not to difficult
good,Everyone worked together as a team & work went smoothly. Kohl's provided good benefits as well as good pay. Their management went well & provided good encouragement.
good,"Upon arrival, I clocked in. Went to work, and on some days we had a surprised hot meal. I loved the peak season benifits like pto. The place was always clean. The only complaint I have is the part time flex."
good,"I really enjoyed my time here. I met a lot of awesome people, the management was fantastic. They were great with me, they really made it feel like a home for me. I really loved our new store manager, she was the absolute best. The senior employees really helped me out and guided me to be the best associate I could possibly be."
good,Loved working with Kohl's. Loved to help customer's on the other end of the telephone. Great computer software we use to handle customer's issue as in finding items on our website and placing their order. Great management and awesome co-workers. The hardest part of the job is to leave to move to Laredo Texas. The most enjoyable part of the job is continuing learning with all the training we had throughout the year. We had fun in decorating our pod and section and had contest with the best of decorating. I will totally miss Kohl's.
good,"Each day is different and I may be placed in a different department where coverage is needed. The management goes out of their way to touch base with you and makes sure that you are on the same page for goal and what needs to be accomplished. My co-workers assure that we work together to get the job done or as close as we can before we are required to go home. The hardest part of this job is not being able to complete all required tasks because of the minimal hours that we are scheduled (4 hours minimum). The most enjoyable part of this job is to see a customer happy after I am done assisting them with either finding something on the floor, resolving a return problem, and/or completing a sale."
good,"I would clock in coming in very welcomed, greeting customers. It was either a busy day or a very slow day. I loved the environment and i was welcomed with open arms to some to say the least."
good,"I enjoyed working with my co-workers, and working for my managers. They know how boring a job can get, and would set goals for us to compete with. I was able to be myself and get along with everyone. If there was a problem with the pay checks, or schedule, they were fixed right away."
good,"Hours are inconsistent, but the work is extremely manageable. Management is always willing to offer advancement in company."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I enjoyed working at Kohl's. The company had a great working atmosphere. The management was great and I would work there again.
good,"Kohl's is my favorite place I have ever worked at to date. They offer the associates the best opportunities and freedoms to actually help the customer. While the permissive environment they engender can occasionally cause conflict with the sometimes over spoiled clientele, they are quick and friendly in ever conflict. They daily do their best to ensure that every customer leaves the store satisfied, without hurting the companies profit margin. With strong team building and ethical values, Kohl's is definately a retailer I would work for again."
good,this was by far the best job I have had. It paid good money hours were long but manageable. The breaks were short but you had two breaks so it all worked out perfect.
good,I love working at Kohl's. The customers love the store and so pleasant. Our products are great and everyone loves our sales. I never worked retail before and management made it so easy to assimilate to this position.
good,This job was my favorite that I have ever had. The atmosphere was very welcoming and they do not overwhelm you with too much at once. I started here as a holiday hire and was extended a part-time position after the holidays were over. The only reason I no longer work here was because for a short time I relocated to Norfolk to be closer to school. The managers and very supportive and when I was ready to move to a different position within the store they worked with me to make that happen.
good,"typical day was helping costumers finding things, making sure they have everything they need and have what they are looking for "
good,"I unload freight from our trucks we receive. I've learned much of the inner workings of Kohl's, and i have become a valuable asset to there company. I do well with their MLS computer systems, and keeping track of our freight. Management are easy to get along with. Our management look at me like a very dependable person because they know I will get the job done. My coworkers are great, and I have made friends with most of them not to mention everyone of them know I'm very helpful and dependable. The hardest part of my job is most the weather conditions effect the environment inside the truck when i unload because it can be really hot or really cold in there. The most enjoyable part of my job is the coworkers i work with, and the environment because its easy, and a calm place to work."
good,There is never any down time. You always know your daily tasks and you have certain amount of time to finish it. I learned how to manage my time very well and to complete more than one tasks on hand by myself or with a team. Learned strong customer service and sales skills. Management was always persistence with daily tasks and daily reviews of work overall customer and sales quotas.
good,"I handled approximately 50-75 calls per day between February and October; and 80+ calls per day during the holiday season. Primary job was to assist new and existing credit card customers with inquiries, issues and complaints. "
good,Love the discounts Kohls gives its emploees.  You cant beat them and I love getting paid every Friday!  The turnover rate was high for part time employees.
good,"Ensure that each guest receives outstanding guest service by providing a guest friendly environment which includes greeting and acknowledging every guest, maintaining outstanding standards, solid product knowledge and all other components of guest service. I've learn to work in a fast paced environment. My Managers and co-workers were wonderful to work with. The hardest part about the job was the hours weren't consistence. The most enjoyable part of the job, meeting and serving the public."
good,"Kohls is a great place to work. The culture is very customer-minded so that the employees are empower to do anyting they can to help the guest. I never felt crazy rushed or that my work wasn't being appreciated. I will say though that you will not get alot of hours as an associate. I averaged 25 hours and I struggled to pick up any shifts available. I was only actually scheduled maybe 2 or 3 short shifts a week. The pay is okay, I started at 7.95 which our state minimum is 7.25."
good,"I've been working for this company 4 years now and most of my coworkers have been there many years like me, or you're one of the turnovers. If you enjoy retail Kohl's is a great place to work. Most enjoyable part of the job is making the customer happy. With any job though, you will have customers that are hard to please but with Kohl's Yes We Can policy, it ensures that the majority of the customers are always taken care of."
good,"Kohl's was a great place to work. I loved my job there and will miss it, but I signed on for seasonal help and am sorry to see it end.  The management was wonderful to work for and with. The customers were kind, Enjoyed the cleanliness of the work place and the overall work environment. It was a constant learning environment.  There was no typical day at work, it was constantly different, which was refreshing. I learned a great deal and had a great time working with all my colleagues!"
good,"Everyone at the location is friendly and outgoing.  The managers are fantastic and upbeat and bring fun to the job.  Even though it is a place of business they allow us to have fun and they join in on the fun.  We all know there are certain times and places for some things but we can project our fun, happy attitudes towards everyone including customers.  A typical day for me depends on where I am, I do both cashiering and customer service.  They both follow pretty much the same standards of Kohl's Yes We Can motto.  When at the register I solicit credit more than at customer service.  Registers are constant check out procedures where customer service I am processing returns.  I would say the hardest part is dealing with irate customers that just want to complain about things and not hear what you have to say and what you can do for them.  The most enjoyable part is just being able to be ourselves and have fun."

good,I think Beauty would be more busy if people knew that we existed. We have no national marketing what so ever. Nobody knows we exist. That being said Corporate kept cutting hours for beauty because we weren't doing well. I'm part time so i get roughly 11 hours a week. I'm still expected to do as much work as the full timers but I obviously can't with only 11 hours a week.
good,"I enjoy working there, it's a nice enviroment, amazing merchandise, & great clientele."
good,I liked working at Kohls. It was hard work but it was well worth it.
good,"I absolutely loved working at Kohl's. This was my favorite job, they worked with my availability, always taught new things. My co-workers were friendly and outgoing just as I am. The majority of the managers were understanding and were willing to work with you to solve any problems. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to be friendly and work in such a great environment. The hardest part of the job was Christmas season."
good,Kohl's has a great work life balance. I have 5 children and sometimes my kids come first. Kohl's as an organization are very understanding of that.

good,"Great working environment, great co-workers, flexible schedule"
good,The day goes by so fast. The company cares about their employees a lot.
good,The management was very professional and seemed to really care about their jobs and their employees. The company did everything in its power such as accept expired coupons at times and returns without receipts. In turn this made my job easy with pleasing the customer as well. There were spiffs at times for the cashiers when reaching credit card inquiry goals which in my first week there I won extra pay on paycheck. It wasn't a high paying job and my position was only seasonal but I did hear some great stories of people who started out there as just part time or seasonal positions that have made great careers from working at Kohls.
good,a crazy day sometimes.to be more effichant.they were really cool.they were laid back.when it was hecktic.paycheck.
good,Kohl's is a great place to work at. I really enjoy the co-workers and the customers.
good,"Our managers are very engaging and friendly. I can ask the questions and see what I need improvement on without fear of judgement. I really like working with customers and I believe I can learn even from difficult customers. My co-workers are hard working and help each other out in other departments when they get done with their tasks. I like that my job is casual but professional. However, problems can arise when there is a misunderstanding between managers and associates."
good,"A typical day at work will be a constant line at the cash registers. I have learned over the last year of being there that this store is more than just your ""normal"" department store. We are a family, and we treat our customers like family as well. The management team here is amazing. They are always willing to help the customers and the associates without hesitation. My co-workers and I get along great. We are always happy to see one another, and there is never a time when we all don't have a smile on our faces. The hardest part of the job is trying to make the angry people happy, but even the rude ones leave with a pleasant experience. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that at the end of the day, I have helped someone else's day get better just by greeting them with a smile."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management.

good,"Exciting world class distribution enviornment"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of my department manager, Josh, and I would straighten up our designated clothing areas. Straightening up our department would be quite easy. Folding clothes neatly, picking up clothes that had fallen on the ground and hang them back up. After our area was clean we would both focus on both of our men's fitting rooms, and we would pay attention to the line of customers as well to see if our co-worker would need assistance. If I was lucky enough to work every day of the week I would do mostly what I had just described, but on Tuesday's and Thursdays I would help unload merchandise from the delivery trucks at the docking station. I enjoyed pushing boxes off of the truck, cutting open the boxes, and putting the merchandise in their appropriate spots. That was the most enjoyable thing I have experienced so far while working retail and that is why I am trying to acquire a warehouse  position. "
good,"I'm was a cashier there and my day consist of handling money at the registers, sales of Khols cards, and providing excellent customer service. I also helped the new co-workers who got hired after me. I showed them how to use the registers. I sold my Khols cards and helped customers with any questions. I know how to work hard and be my best. Customer service is what I do."
good,"I loved the atmosphere. I liked being able to dress professional and going to work. I enjoyed the customers, the staff, and my job!"
good,"POS is great for some people that like the challenge of getting credits and talking to people - you also get to see what people are buying. Fitting rooms are great if you want to be moving all the time - but you will get burnt out there eventually.Compensation is low, but benefits are good. Employee discount is 15% on top of any coupons you have.They schedule you during your available hours and getting specific days off is very easy.Plus you get to shop everyday!"
good,"Working at Khol's was lots of fun. I got a lot of help when I started my first shift as a Sale's Associates, got to meet with some employees, and I got to help some customers. I also get to have a  20 min break so that was good for me. Working at Khol's really got me experienced through out all that hard work and helping out customers."

good,I have learned to multi-task better.  Working with customers is the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"As a cashier, you can expect your work days to be very busy. You will come across a lot of rude customers, but most are kind. My co-workers and management are the best, they seem really nice. The best part about the job is you get paid every week!!!! Its a good part-time/seasonal job to have just to make money on the side."
good,"my day was helping customers, and running a slicer, wrapping meats, chicken, all kinds of imported meat cheeses from Italy.I learned a lot about meat and how to cut meat, certain imported deli foods, etc.My co-workers were the best.The hardest part of my job probably was learning new things but I could always handle it.The most enjoyable part of my job was the customers and my co-works."
good,Working for Kohl's is wonderful. They do a lot for their employee's. Everyday is started and ended with a huddle that lets you know what the goals are for the day. They treat their customer like real people and not just another dollar. Management is always on hand. The hardest part is sometimes getting credit applications and capturing emails.
good,"I worked in the customer service department which handled all customer returns, price adjustments, as well as answering and directing phone calls. When I would start my shift I would check and make sure that the previous employee left the work station clean and stocked with the correct materials. Then I would have to count the cash drawer to make sure it balanced out to the correct amount, this had to be done every hour as well. I would answer any questions customers would have, and if I was unable to properly answer them myself I would direct them in the right direction."
good,Working for a company like Kohls is great. They are flexible with your schedule and are always willing to help. A typical day for me is dealing with different variety of customers and helping them make returns on items they purchased. The most difficult part of my job is helping customers who are extremely rude and mean to you and having to not respond to there negativity. All the associates are very nice and are easy to get along with.

good,"Overnight shift, unloading merchandise from delivery truck and sorting into the correct departments.  Learned how to work with a team and to follow instructions carefully.  My co-workers were fun to work with and very helpful.  Hardest part of the job was the overnight hours sometimes.  Enjoyable part of the job would be keeping busy and organizing."
good,"This was a fun, fast-paced, great place to work. I loved the coworkers and the management people. It was fast-paced, especially because it was the holiday season but it was interesting and enjoyable. Loved the company itself, Kohl's, which seems to really value it's employee and gave great incentives and personal accolades."
good,"Kohl’s department store is a wonderful environment to work in this company is always looking for new opportunities for their employers. This company is always trying to find ways to keep the employee’s active, I remember when I went to the brake room they had all kinds of activities on the table it was amazing. The employees are always a delight to work with and very helpful when I got stuck on something at work."
good,Kohl's is a good experience to obtain the ins and outs of the customer service world. It's a challenging but rewarding because Management recognizes the hard you put forth. Co-workers are team oriented. A place that keeps you busy. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers.
good,"Kohl's was a great place to work, despite the minimum-wage pay, because of the team that I got to work with. The people were great. One manager was the only downside in that she would simply shuffle her work off to the rest of us. All in all, an enjoyable workplace."
good,Was a very great job wish it isn't seasonal at the time. But you are more opened to doing your own thing and not someone all upon you saying do this or do that.
good,There are many things to do at McDonald's; from sweeping the floors to making food to serving customers. I learned a lot about the company working here. I learned what it takes to run a store. The workers are fun to work with. The hardest part of the job is the standing. The most enjoyable part of the job is making the food and serving customers.
good,"At typical day at kohl's we have to show great customer service, I have done with returns and exchanges, not only that but angry customers as well, but I work real well with any customers. We also work as team here at Kohl's, everyone gets along and everyone get along with me as well. To me there really isn't a hard part at Kohl's, I have been here for year so I'm pretty much comfortable with everything, I'm really good with catching on things. The most enjoyable part of Kohl's are my co-workers."
good,"A typical day at work is going to be very busy, but your also going to enjoy yourself. Your co-workers all are accepting and hard working. It was a great experience working at Kohl's, I would recommend anyone who love retail to start there. The management there is about business but still can make working fun. The hardest thing about working at Kohl's is that your hours aren't as consistent. People think working in retail isn't that much work, but it is you stay busy and stay updating the store. One thing I find most enjoyable at kohl's was the people you meet on a day to day bases. You get to hear all different stories and different people backgrounds, its just amazing and makes all the hard work worth it!"
good,"Kohls was a great place to work and the people there were great."

good,"enjoyed customer interaction, managers were very understanding."
good,"I am a team player. It was a fun company to work for. A typical day at work would be me greeting the customers, helping customers find the products they were looking for. My co-workers were wonderful very helpful. I cannot say that there was a hard part to the job because, i was very well trained in a few departments. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the customers, knowing that I made them feel welcome and they keep coming back!"
good,A typical day is customer service. interacting with customers and ensuring the customer had a great shopping experience. The management team is great and my co-workers are nice. the hardest part of the job is finding enough time in the day to get everything done. the most enjoyable part is helping customers. 
good,"Great values, vision, and recognition opportunities. I usually knew just what was expected of me, which made it much easier to perform well. I really appreciated that they were willing to cross-train me whenever I showed interest in a new department or opportunity. The overall attitude, vision, and management skills of the staff was wonderful. "
good,"I have many jobs, I am usually up by 5:30 am, and home by 3:30 pm. I have been cross trained in different departments. My original hiring was for POS, but now I am in Customer Service, which I enjoy more. When working customer service, I have more to do than at a front register. I enter and retrieve data, make tickets for items, take payments, answer phone calls, answer to customer needs and questions. It's more exciting and lively in C/S."

good,Fun job with nice people. okay break room. management was nice but stern. room for advancement if you work there for over five years and someone decides to leave the store
good,"For me, it was a little off balanced because we had just opened a new store and I would always end up running multiple department by myself and I only had a month of work experience. Many people did not show up for work so those who did would have t cover for others on a daily basis. I learned that it is better to prioritize when working in a stressful environment. The management was really awesome and friendly but also very busy. Some co-workers were friendly. The hardest part of this job was trying to manage multiple departments in a brand new store. Yet the most enjoyable part of this job was the fact that we were given so much freedom. If a customer had a complaint, we could take care of them right away without having to consult with management."
good,Co-workers and management were mostly helpful and gave ggreat advice
good,Oversee all Operations of the store.  Responsible for hiring and overall payroll.  Oversee the daily Operations from unloading trucks to merchandising.   Love working with the associates and watching them develop and grow with the company.  Enjoy customer interactions and taking care of there needs.  Looking for opportunity in a growing company.
good,"A typical day at work would include checking out customer, taking complaints and filing them with a higher authority, attempting to sell credits to customers, making sure the building is tidy, cash handling, and closing down the building. "
good,"When you arrive at work you go into the break room and clock in with your work card ID (normally i would get there 15 minutes early to relax before work) Once clocked in, you have about 3 minutes to get to your designated cash register for the day. Type in your ID into the computer and start your day. I am eligible to help customers as needed. Normally they just need help finding customer service so they can return a purchase. You get one 30 minute break and two 15 minute breaks (if you work a full 8-9 hours) if you work less than 8 hours, you only receive two 15 minute breaks within the day. My bosses were VERY understanding and actually cares about their employees and customers, Even off the job they respect our customers and employees. The hardest part of the job was beginning out with no cashier experience and trying to run a register, after learning the basics, the rest comes naturally. The most enjoyable part was everything. There was no downside to working at Kohls, other than not enough hours (but i was also in school). I highly recommend working at Kohls to anyone."
good,"I usually go in to work and clock in then head up to customer service to relieve one of the staff and I handle customer returns, payments, sales.  It's a nice change of pace as I'm usually working my full time job before I go to Kohl's and work a 4 hour shift during the week and a 5 or 6 hour shift on Saturday or Sunday and sometimes both days as needed."
good,The most enjoyable part of working at Kohl's is the friendliness of the customers and employees. My favorite part about working there is helping customers find good deals using company programs. Management is friendly and easy to get along with.

good,*A job where you look forward to waking up and arriving at each day
good,"I worked here for 2 years and I slightly regret leaving. I was a part time cashier and it was very fun. I enjoyed talking with customers and I was taught many things. I had advanced from a cashier into other departments as well. My co-workers and management were like a second family to me. The hardest part of the job?

I learned how to up date knowledge of new items, displayed merchandise, how to open the jewelry department. How to work in a fast paste environment, how to meet deadlines on time. Management were really helpful, understanding, demanding sometimes, responsable. I enjoyed working with my co-workers, we would help each other and worked well in groups and get along. Hardest part of the job was to learned the different responsabilities as a sales associate but got the hang of it fast. The most enjoyable part of the job is to help customers with any questions they had. Seeing them happy and satisfied and seeing them leave with a smile of their face."

Then after the truck is done I usually unpack the hardlines or go out to the floor and replenish the sales floor. I learned most from Kohls is that some people just are there to work and some are there for a job and dome people are there for a career. Management it depends on how well you get along with the manager on how they like you or not. The co workers a lot are fun and easy to get along with. Hardest part of the job is getting up early going on a couple hrs of sleep and keeping up with the work. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and talking to all the female associates and getting to know them.

The building is nice and clean and everyone of the co workers is friendly. The only drawback is the pay. It's hard to support a family on the pay that's offered but they do have nice bonuses you can earn monthly.

The managers are all understanding about any concern or problems you may have. The staff all works together to accomplish goals that we have. Help customers in anyway they can. Always great customers with a friendly smile."

good,"After being out of the work force for 13 years due to a medical crisis I suffered in 2006, I found a welcoming and accommodating place to call my work home. Flexible and shorter shifts were available and I would welcome the opportunity for part time employment after working seasonal during mid Nov 2019 to Jan 8,2020."
good,Overall I had a gear first experience working in retail for the first time at kohls would do it again if I cam. I learn how sales floor work and as well as cashier in retail which I kinda knew already.
good,"Weekly pay, flexible hours, diverse work enviornment. Chance to grow within company. And you will also learm various areas. You will learn everything from customer service to cashiering to working the floor"

good,"Kohl's was a great place to work.  Management was good and accommodating with schedules, co-workers nice to work with.  It was nice getting to work with a variety of customers."
good,"This was one of the best places that I've worked at in a long time. I learned new things oil the daily basis, I met some really awesome people, I got to have an overall amazing experience with this company."
good,"When working there, I enjoyed every minute. Yes, some days were more tedious than others, but that can be said of any job or work environment! Working there was pretty repetitive in a way; you go in, do your assigned job, help where there is need of help, and go at the end of your shift."
good,"This was my first job ever, and it was a lot of fun and a very good first job. I work(ed) as seasonal and the entire application/interview process was very quick and easy. I was working within a week of applying. "
good,"i absolutely love my job at Kohl’s. When i first started, i felt a bit lost, but my coworkers were extremely helpful and helped me learn fast. in my main department of work, the lead of the department quickly helped me learn everything and is overall a great person. coworkers are all extremely kind. i love my job at kohl’s and look forward to going to work everyday. My managers are some of the nicest people on the planet, and never fail to make feel included."
good,"Was a great place to work flexible hours, decent pay, however after Thanksgiving my hours got cut so I had to find a new job. So as a temporary job it allowed my to make money during high school."
good,I think it's a pretty neat place to work I like my co-workers management is great the way they treat their employees is amazing and overall it's a fun place to work and you get your job done it's not very stressful like I said it's high energy everybody's having fun taking care of business getting the job done
good,"All employees and management were amazing to work with, and I loved learning the new technology of shopping for online orders for customers. Lastly, being able to work with a team for holiday decorating and taking down Of the decorations"
good,"Most seasonal workers are kept in and the managers are absolutely great about working with employees on our own schedules and available work hours."
good,"Considering Kohl’s is my first job, I learned a lot. "
good,"Great people, great team, great company. Very friendly. Managers are actual people who understand. Policies are common-sense. Associates don't get fired unless they basically try to."
good,"Kohl is a dynamic organisation , they are flexible, flexibility does mot mean you should be lagging behind in your daily responsibity.  You work to fullest. In nutshell is a nice place to work with clean environment."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"This job has showed me so many personal lessons. It has showed me that kindness and compassion can go a long ways. Also, that some people can be hard to deal with but, always put customer service first."
good,"Well-managed business platform that is open for growth within the company, Diverse and a great atmosphere to work in, multiple departments to work in, flexible and understanding, and offers Associates to give back to their communities."
good,"I love working for Kohl's it's a great job I am a seasonal employee and have been for 2 years now."
good,"Most days working a shift at kohl's starts off slow. Like working on a Sunday morning we open early and we know it will be slow so as a couple hours goes by we expect our church crowd to come in along with the usual customers at the same time so we then began to pick up a little bit. Then when customers check out, everyone seem to want to check out at the same time. It makes the time goes by quickly and the shift will end soon. Customers help your shift at work go by quick. Even our managers at kohl's help out on the register when in need and we're very busy. We work as a team in everything we do. Our motto is a 10x10 rule. If we come 10 feet towards any customers we greet and make sure if they need help with anything. I love how they hire all races so the work place and our customers can feel comfortable. The most enjoyable part about working at kohl's is seeing how happy customers are to get those good savings and discounts when they shop. Their big smiles make me have a bigger smile."
good,"Working there makes you feel happy, everyone useally gets along. Never had a bad experience never got dirty. Never got put down for asking for help.and working hard pays off"
good,"Retail is retail no matter where you work, but, Kohl's is family."
good,"I love working at Kohl’s,they work has a team and they have quality stuff and they are always welcome there customers always.If I have to choose a job I will like to work with Kohl’s anytime"
good,"all the employess were helpful , and hours were fair , they give you experience in all areas of the store so we dont feel left out , all in all a great place to work"
good,Great place to work for love the fast pase cross training is available in all departments your able to work in this bldg and work all the hours your able.hr is friendly you can get help when you want it.
good,Working at Kohls was fun and you got good hours. Between customers you did clean your area everyday to provide clean environment for customer and employees. If needed you helped other departments or did different tasks
good,"Working in the Kohl's warehouse is the best warehouse to work at. They allow you to listen to music while working and don't have a strict dress code, you can wear anything you want as long is it appropriate for the working environment. Everyone has a positive attitude and is very social. Also, the pay is very beneficial."
good,I don't think it's a livable wage for anyone supporting just themselves. The management is very flexible and easy going. The employees aren't seen as expendable and easily replaceable.
good,Productive and fast paced environment. Flexible with work and school life balance. Employee discount is good with friendly work environment. Overall been a good place to work.
good,Easy to move up as long as you come to work on time and work hard I started as a material handler making $11.50 and made it to problem solver in a few months and then quarterback after a little over a year making up to $15.50 but if you slack up it will go away and you can end right where you started.
good,Enjoyed working with the public and department responsibilities  . Appreciated the atmosphere and working with other employers and customers. It was a nice easy day with a variety of multi tasking jobs within a days work.
good,Every employee is so very wonderful and overly very nice to every one wonderful pot luck and wonderful christmas parties good warm hearted feeling every time you shop or work
good,It was a seasonal job November through January and it was a lot of fun.  I enjoyed working with the public. Staff were helpful and managers kind and supportive
good,"Enjoyed working for this company.  Good benefits, great people and managers to work with!  Managers always supported your input and care about their employees.  I would work for them again!"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Worked to maintain current knowledge of sales and promotions"
good,It was nice got to learn plenty of skills required to work dale associate improving engagement with merchandise and providing outstanding customer service
good,"Worked there for seasonal.... loved it and loved how amazing they worked with me and my schedule.  Managers are very down to earth, which made it easier working there."
good,"I didn’t work at Kohl’s for a long time. During my stay, the work environment was great. I was part time and received quite a few hours in the beginning, but towards the last month or so, my hours were down to two days per week which was only 4 hours each day since I worked part time."
good,"Very welcoming. Hours are great, having 3 day weekends is very nice. Quite flexible, if you need time off or are planning a vacation, as long as you put it in advance your chances are high of getting it. A lot of great programs through the DC, they do volunteer work and the wellness center is an essential benefit. Good environment, good people."
good,It was great working here it was just too slow and you couldn't go over your 40 hours if you were part time only if they really needed helpers and that was barely
good,"Long term employees leaving little advancement opportunities, good benefits packages available. Good work/family balance, ma y associate appreciation days with treats and meals."
good,"Kohls worked really well with my schedule"
good,"This was my first ""real job"" and once seasonal hiring period had passed and they decided to keep me on as part-time, I was given opportunities to learn more and pick up new skills in the work place. They are good about motivating us and even helping us not grumble about working on holidays. Often management will pick up meals for us on a holiday, and sometimes co-workers will bring in a box of cookies or doughnuts to share for the day."
good,If your starting at retail then I would recommend Kohls.  This company teaches and promotes from within.  Great group of people to work with and one day can call them family.
good,"Positive work environment with friendly associates and highly competent management. The store is clean and well maintained, the hours are fair and has been a good experience of mine."
good,Working at Kohl's was a rewarding job. I have no complaints. It is possible to work your way up the ladder if you choose to. Pay was a little higher than minimum wage.
good,Great place to work! Only work weekends so i get time with my son...Pay is great for the job...paid breaks jus can't leave the building...management is great
good,"I loved working at Kohls. I loved the discounts, the people, managers were very nice too. I would go back again. It was always a lot of variety and I liked that. It never really got boring. And there was always something new to do and new stuff coming in all the time."
good,It was my first jobe so everything was new to me but the people there made me feel comfortable and helped me learn alot about warehousing quick. I didnt stay cause they didn't have enough work and always had to let people go home early
good,"Every day at Kohl's is a fun day. The management team is so nice and supportive, and everyone there has a great open door policy. The one thing, this is more about retail in general, is that sometimes hours can be kind of hard to come by, particularly in the beginning of the year. However, around September, hours and foot traffic definitely pick up!"
good,"Other than not making a lot and only working part-time, I love Kohl's. I love how they make it their goal to help customer's get what they want and they try to nurture their employees to help them grow and advance if they choose to. More training would be great but that can be said at most any company"
good,"Managers friendly, approachable, understanding. Timely raises. Co-workers were fun to work with. Close to my home. Store was always clean and attractive. 99% of the customers were nice."
good,Kohl’s will always be one of my favorite places of work. Management is amazing and I’ve never been around a single employee who wasn’t willing to help you in one way or another.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I really enjoyed my time working for Kohl's. At the time I left that job, I had no desire to leave. I had difficulty in transferring locations but had to relocate."
good,"If have another opportunity I will love to work with kohl’s anytime because we always work as a team also Kohls have so many benefits like health care,paternity leave,vacation leave and so on. I have never regrets working we Kohls. I left Kohls because I relocated to Sacramento"
good,"Although the hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers, I learned how much I ultimately love customer service. I  enjoyed interacting with and serving all of our customers within the fast-paced environment, which is what a typical day looked like. My boss was also a great leader, and this helped our team work more effectively."
good,Manager was very professional and knowledgeable. Coworkers were great to work with. Flexible work schedule except for blacked out dates throughout the year for holidays and high volume business days that you can request off.
good,"A typical day at kohls includes clocking in and finding out which department I work in, which is either men's Juniors or women's customer service and jewelry first thing I do when I walk into my fitting room is clear all the Stalls and hang up loose clothes and I organize them by brand size. After that I start bringing the clothes back out to the floor. I also answer any questions customers might have. The hardest part of working at Kohl's is being motivated to get things done and having to pick up other people's Slack but I still think working at Kohl's is a great beginner job."
good,"Kohl's is a good first job. When I was about 17, it was a job that was suitable at the time. Working at the register was sufficient for paying my bills at that age."
good,"My review for Kohl's is that they are very goal oriented, they are very supportive in decision making, and are very appreciated of their employees, and also give incentives to their employees to try to make their daily goals."
good,I enjoyed Working  at Kohl’s it gave me much experience I Have learned a lot working at Kohl’s I had a great team I really enjoyed the staff  and Management team
good,I appreciated greatly that management allowed me to take my own spin on getting credit incentives. It was exciting when we met our goal because it came with extra rewards . They always kept me motivated to do better!
good,"It was a great job for me, well a great seasonal job. I got to do 2 different things. I went from stocking to unloading trucks and building pallets in receiving. It's a great friendly environment to make good and meet new people."
good,A very good place to work for everyone is so nice to each other and friendly I've learned a lot for working at Kohl's management is very good at halding problems
good,"I did enjoy working for kohls , though my schedule changed every week, i was always able to add more hours . Torrance building was responsible and very much fun when it came down to opening credit cards."
good,"Kohls' is a very fun job. I loved everything about that job. If you want to learn another position that you didn't apply for, it's easy to go for it by asking your H2."
good,I enjoyed working here. My only complaint would be...Offer more stable hours for your full time workers instead of flexible hours. I love people and interacting with them was mostly a pleasure. I had great Managers all around. They were just Awesome. Hated leaving for steadier hours.
good,I enjoyed working at Kohl's. It was a seasonal part time job. I learned to operate the cash register which was new to me. I worked in the jewelry department and was a cashier. I wanted to learn how to run the cash register. I cleaned our area and put out merchandise.
good,This was a great job. I had the best managers and the best employees behind me at all times. They always motivated me to do better and improve myself all the time.
good,It's a good palace to work the pay is good it's not a stressful working environment it can be fun at times they have holiday bonuses it's good exercise
good,I started out as a seasonal employee and loved it. my store manager was liz and she was great. I learned all the ropes and different positions. your always busy
good,It was a great place to work the other employees were like my second family the only thing it was tough Soliciting the Kohl’s charge the managers were supper stressed about that
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Being an operation associate I was at work by 2 am- 8 or 10am unboxing truck loads of merchandise. I learned to manage group tasks on my own when there were not enough hands on deck. culture is easy going, but goal oriented. I enjoyed working the late-early morning hours."
good,"Great place to work, everyone is very friendly and helpful. Love working with the public and setting up new displays as well as keeping the store looking great."
good,I loved working at Kohl's!  The managers and staff were extremely nice!  I also enjoyed talking with the customers.  I was deeply saddened that my seasonal job was coming to an end!
good,"Laid back, expressive, cultural, flexible and well organized store. Discounts not only for customers but for employees as well. Friendly atmosphere. And strict when it comes to following rules."
good,you get to see all the new clothes before they even come in . walk around and look even while working .  I loved my job just had some problems with my childcare .
good,"It was enjoyable day at work with employees and customers."
good,it was a really good first job for me to understand how important retail is. also to show me how holidays are from a perspective of an employee within retail.
good,Very place to work. I was hired on as seasonal help and stayed on part time due to the environment. Everyone that I have worked with has been great.The employee discount alone was worth working there through the holidays.
good,I love to work at kohls distribution I really wish I could work there full time I can't wait until its time to work again I work there every year as a seasonal
good,"Great place to work. People are friendly and enthusiastic. You learne lots of stuff there and management is great. There is always something to do, so you won't get bored there."
good,"Kohls was a very nice experienced. Hours are flexible and the staff is amazing! I was tuaght how to properly respond to customers, stock, work the cash register & also customer support."
good,"I learned so much at this job, and I honestly hated leaving. I was hoping for a transfer when I moved out of state but sadly it was not handled very well. The people I worked with really helped me feel at home and really let me have a lot of freedom when it came to the hours I worked. I was able to learn as many different positions as I wanted, so this helped me not only to accumulate more hours, but it also helps me when looking for jobs in the future. The managers always responded to everything in the store very quickly no matter if it was employee issue or a customer issue. The managers also were always willing to accommodate to every employee, a compromise was always discussed in a very understanding way!"
good,"a happy day to go to work meeting new people everyday,  lean to kind with others workers, manager was good, when I had to go home for the day, I enjoy"
good,I actually loved working at kohls it actually was my favorite job to go to I actually wanted to work. But the hardest part of my job working there was on Black Friday or getting close to Christmas but overall I still loved it.
good,"The only reason inconsistent is in the table is because of the lack of customers that would come into the store sometimes. But more days than not, it was fairly busy with more than enough work to do."
good,A typical day at khols ill clock in then stretch for about 5 min to get my body prepared to pick up the boxes.I learned how to properly use a scan gun. Management was there when u needed them but was also kinds busy cause of the size in numbers of working that were there.The hardest part was trying to maintain your pase to reach the goal for that day. Atfer a long work day break be the most enjoyable part to me is the paid breaks
good,Kohls pays decent compared to other clothing retail stores. They have great management that are willing to train the right person who is wanting to advance there career.
good,I like working on the weekends because it is busy.  I get to meet many people and help them out.  Customer service can be fun.  We work as a team both at night & on weekend.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Depending on the area your assigned too nothing is difficult "
good,The employees that have been at Kohl’s for some years do not mind helping you and teaching you the Kohl’s way. It’s a very relaxed place. Everyone is so helpful.
good,This was a place where you always needed to have a smile. It was my job to make sure the customers left our building highly satisfied. I would help them locate items and check them out at the cash register. It was a competitive job as all the staff made a game out of who can open up the most credits during their shifts.
good,Productive and fun workplace loved the benefits just did not like how they wouldn't let me have days off due to my son and did not like the pay they offered
good,Great company if I had to say anything that I dislike it would be the annual raises they would be anywhere from .19 cents to .30cents also whenever minimum wage would go up we never get a cost of living raise. That is the one thing I dont agree with
good,"A fairly fun place to work, often busy at times but with good workers it didnt bother us. I learned how to work in a team, management was good, great workplace culture business casual with a fun environment hardest part was getting alot of hours really the most enjoyable part was tackling the busy seasons and achieving tasks."
good,I have worked for several different Kohls stores and have enjoyed each one.  Management is flexible with schedules as long as you provide decent availability.  Kohls is a friendly and fun place to work.
good,I was blessed to work with the kohls team in a great work environment.Kohls is generous to train you in different fields in the warehouse.witch only makes you a better employee.
good,"I worked for Kohl's all throughout my high school years. They are very flexible with school and schedule differences. The team you work with is amazing, and the management is even better. Working at Kohl's, you will feel like part of a family. They have monthly activities that you can volunteer to take part in, and they give back to the community a lot. The employee discount is great, and it works on every item in the store. You will most likely have to work Black Friday, but it's super fun and crazy."
good,quick paced job with good customer service building possibilities. friendly co-workers and fair managers. flexible scheduling especially for students.
good,"I loved working at Kohl's while i did. All my co-workers were wonderful and welcomed me with open arms. I got paid 15 minute breaks and had bathroom breaks whenever i needed to go, and they always either had some type of snack in the break room or there were vending machines you could use. I always had work to do which i loved, because i don't like to sit around. All around Kohl's is a wonderful place to work."
good,Great place lots of things to choose from to by in there. All the staff is friendly in helpful if they can't help you find what you need dont worry they will find the right associate to get the job job
good,At Kohls I am assigned to the register. There are times I hang and tag clothing for different departments and straighten merchandise in departments. In the course of a day I may open new charge accounts for customers and assist customers in finding what they are looking for by interaction with departments in the store.
good,"Working at Kohl's was an absolutely awesome experience! Even on the slow nights where nobody came in, the people who worked there with you were enough to keep you entertained an happy. Everyone was willing to help everyone, and it was just a wonderful environment to work in."
good,The employees and managers were nice. The environment was enjoyable and you mainly deal with customer service. Managers were professional and nice. Everything was good.
good,"Kohl's is an amazing company.  In a positive way, Leadership is obsessed with success.  They look for every edge in order to achieve growth and profitability."
good,"Kohl's has been one of the best places I ever worked for,I like the management and co-workers flexibility to work at different times and areas,volunteer opportunities,opportunities to move into area supervisor, management, etc."
good,My experience at Kohl's was very nice because I got to meet friendly associates had a relaxed but also fast paced job. I'd say the hardest part of the job was keeping my numbers up.
good,They offer great dicounts on products. Employee moral was exceptional employees are very friendly and easy to get along with.Management was very easy to get along with.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Kohl's is a great place to work the management staff is amazing. A lot of amazing people work there. If you ever need help with anything the staff is always willing to help.
good,"Kohls has been a fantastic employer to work for. The global work environment is very positive and progressive. For the first time since it's existence, a woman will be CEO starting June 2018. The benefits are incredible. The only negative thing I will say concerns the work/life balance. It's different on every team. Every manager has different expectations which is to be expected but it can mean a complete change for your team. Every area of the company is also different, which means re-learning every time you move. You also have to deal with the politics of working for a corporate office. Otherwise, Kohls has been a great ""fresh out of college"" job and I feel like it has set me up to move to another company and be promoted."
good,I met so many new people and I had fun working in fashion. I loved the independence and the way Khols treats their employees. They keep people happy and provide great working conditions.
good,"Kohl's is a great job to have while in college. As a basic sales associate, you'll be sent to different parts of the store to ""zone"", this means cleaning up areas, helping customers, and making the store a better place to be. You'll also be called to check fitting rooms a lot as well as being called up to the registers to help with cashier backup."
good,I worked here during high school and my first college years. The pay is what drove me to look for a job in the healthcare field. I am a nursing student and want to get my foot in the door with a company and hope to make a little more money.
good,"Love This Place "
good,"Really open to training, welcoming, and helpful environments. Fast paced, productive, fun, hard work! Great pay, people are accepting, encouraging, and the company is dedicated to  the safety of employees first."
good,You have to work hard because the managers expect that from you and never try stealing because you will be caught. overall it is a fun experience and i enjoyed my time there.
good,* Kohl's is fast paced
good,Relaxed staff and very well trained managers who allow a great work environment and I would recommend this job to anyone looking to get started in some type of retail company
good,great place to work depending on the location .but there work guidelines and rules are strict.they do not care and will give you an accurance for being one minute late
good,"I worked during the Christmas season, very busy most of the time Everyone I met was very pleasant to work with and the customers were great. I worked at the customer service desk,. We did returns, took customers payments, online pickups and when cashiers were backed up we would help out."
good,Loved working at the e-Commerce distribution center. Fast paced environment where most people that you work with are willing to help when you need it. We did lots of hiring events and orientations which was fun and there was always something to do to keep us busy as HR Specialists. One of my favorite jobs.
good,"Great place to work, great people, amazing managers. You will aquire a lot of different skills from various departments through out the store. KOhls is a great starter job!"
good,Management is awesome. The hardest part of the job is working late hours. I love cashering and assisting customers. We had a great team and everyone is willing to pick up extra hours and help when needed.
good,It was a great place to work. The managers were always able to answer any questions I had which helped tremendously when assisting customers. Pay was competitive with surrounding retail stores and there is always something that needs to be done so one does not feel like they are just standing around. Sale days like black Friday were busy and hectic but at the end of the day it was always fun and exhilarating.
good,"I've been a Kohl's for 3+ years & it has been one of the best pt jobs I've had. They have an outstanding work environment, great discounts and phenomenal staff!  More importantly, corporate really cares and listens to store employees.  At previous jobs I felt like just a number, but it Kohl's I honestly feel like a valued employee!"
good,I like working I love I just don’t like being mistreated when I know I’m doing right and always on time and hard worker  don’t like getting picked on I like somebody to come to me and talk to me with respect
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I was only at Kohl's for 4 months as a seasonal help out, the managers there were awesome and the staff was friendly and fun to talk to during down times, seasonal is the busiest job because of black friday and the many days after black friday."
good,"Great place to work. I enjoy my job. Very much a can do, open to ideas environment.  Your given opportunity to improve, grow, learn about the e-commerce business."
good,Kohls is a great place to work for high school students or anyone looking to make some extra money. The hourly is not the greatest but you get great discounts and it's not a stressful place to work.
good,This was my first job every and I really did enjoy being there because it was a bit of quick pased during the holidays but over alll it was a great place to work
good,Kohl's provides great work-life balance for their associates. Leadership is transparent and forward-thinking. The benefits and pay are good and most associates start with PTO of 3 weeks.
good,the employees and manager were very helpful and I was never expected to  be perfect. Something that I had experienced at my previous job. overall it was an amazing job and I would go back at anytime.
good,"Kohls was a great working environment, everyone always worked together as a team and we were very productive. Kohls management will set you aside to tell you what you can do to improve your working skills which I feel is important to do at a job if you are willing to get better and move higher up. The hardest part about the job was trying to make the unsatisfied customers satisfied."
good,All employees are like a family and have each others backs when working.  Everyone is willing to get calls and help out on the floor when needed without any type of problem.
good,"excellent coworkers and managers, very productive environment,flexible schedules. I enjoyed talking to the customers and helping them in whatever ways possible."
good,"I liked working at Kohl's, a day at work consisted of stocking shoes, organizing shoes, and helping customers find and order shoes/products. This job got very busy every day/night that i worked there and closing the store was long and strenuous."
good,a typical day would be a meeting before a shift then going to our department getting stuff ready to pack or sort. management was the coolest. the workplace culture rocked.
good,"If you're looking for a place to start a career you can work your way up and keep climbing, Kohl's headquarters is perfect. You have a selection of many departments and the people there are great."
good,"I had worked at the Portage Kohls and I loved working there at the time. However, the time that I had worked there the workers were  barely getting paid minimum wage and the hours really sucked. The environment, workers and management were all so very nice. It was so easy to talk to management and they worked with you."
good,Very much enjoy caring for Kohls Corporate Associates and their families for the past nine years. It has been a pleasure and an honor. Kohls has treated me very well and I am grateful.
good,"very fast paced, keep busy all day enjoyed my job very much.              Loved merchandising, working together as a team. Fun place to work management worked well with everyone and were very helpful whenever needed."
good,"It was a fun place to work. Everyone go along. We worked great as a team. There was nothing hard about the job. Just the fact that we all had fun and are manager was amazing."
good,"I loved working in Kohl's, I had a great manager who was so understanding and friendly more than just being a boss. MY hours were so flexible and I was able to handle my kids care with their schedule"
good,"Management truly cared about their employees and were always willing and able to help, especially when they were interested in moving up in the company. I went from truck un-loader to an Area Supervisor in a year."
good,"good social working and more to learn at work place lot of applications or training to take up  and to upgrade the knowledge "
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Kohl's treats their employees very well in terms of advancement and pay scale. They are a great company in many areas of the professional world. The people that I worked with were absolutely one of the best teams ever to be a part of.
good,"I loved working at Kohl's, the managers were great at making sure employees were always doing okay during shifts, they are caring and the work environment is great. Kohl's is a great place to build friendships as well as experience in the work field. The hardest part of this job would have to be keeping up with the busier parts of the day, it can be stressful at times when dealing with customers but with good customer service skills and patience it is quite a bit easier. A lot of the skills required for working at Kohl's are learned while working, the managers are aware of this and are 100% willing to help employees learn new things. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be getting compliments from the customers and seeing them leave with a smile."
good,"I chose to work at Kohl's as an opportunity to recover from a medical illness. I always prided myself on my health and balancing work/life balance exceptionally well. I'm a planner.  I never thought I'd reach a point in life where due to an unforeseen situation it would mean this normally very logical woman would choose to leave her financially secure job. Kohl's welcomed me with open arms. Human Resources, Loss Prevention/Security, and the Leadership have eased my fears and ""nursed"" me back to health with support, praise when it is due, and flexibility of hours. A typical day includes 15 to 20 minute breaks and a required lunch break. Teamwork is integral to the success of the company which makes the tasks more entertaining. The job is laborious at times and when dealing with an unruly customer or thief, it can be an exhausting day. However, having a leadership able to quickly direct staff, provide support in difficult situations, and being nonjudgmental makes working at Kohl's an outstanding and pleasant experience."
good,"It was temporary but worth it, seasonal positions keep you busy. You get awesome discounts and lengthy break times. Overnights are great shifts for relaxed pay"
good,"Great job understanding was great. But position was only seasonal. Store manager was hands on more than the supervisor over the department. Overall, great people organized and professional."
good,"I really enjoy working here. They are big on team work and recognizing someone when they go above and beyond. It's defiantly a team environment. The discount is a really nice bonus, too."
good,I would lo e to relocate to the Kohls in Broken Arrow if im able to. I'd like to apply.. I worked in MUM and had to clean up all three of these sections their dressing rooms. You help all customers and make sure they are happy. I would love to work for this company again I just unfortunately had to move. I hoody will give me a position back. I love that job.
good,In the six years I spent at Kohl's I was promoted twice and became part of the management team. Never had a dull day. The company policies made it easy for me to do my job. I was able to work in every department and learn as much as I wanted. The associate discounts are very generous!
good,"they have a nice system that keeps everything organized and they also have good teamwork, and very good managers from what ive seen.the store that i was at also had about 3 days out of the month that they would make us all some sorta food."

The managers also we're understanding and great to the should me alot of easy ways to do. Things especially during the holidays when it's so very busy."
good,Kohls is a great company to work for. There are various work shifts and the atmosphere was very comfortable. The benefits are great. My supervisor was very helpful.

good,I loved my time at Kohl's! Employees and management were always great. Very Reasonable as far as hours go. Holiday Season is great (More Hours if needed)
good,Working for Kohl's gives a great look into the world of retail stores. A very clean and structured environment. Great management and there is potential for advancement but not into a high salaried role.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."

good,"Not many days too work, but great pay. Awesome managers and co-workers. Friendly staff and theyre very helpful. I definitely reccomend this job to anyone."
good,Kohls is a great place to work. Great for seasonal. Perfect for high school students or college students. Only bad part is if you are seasonal they might not keep you for non-seasonal.
good,"I've been with Kohls for about a year and a half now, and i loved the environment. It was quick paced at times depending how busy the sales were or not. Otherwise the people I work with are very family based and diverse. Enjoyed working here but as time comes, it was time to set off onto new opportunities. This will be an awesome first job."
good,"Just not enough hour's . to pay bills & go to school, otherwise the staff was Great,   Miss the crew, but needed more money to live on, they were very flexable about my school."
good,"I loved working with Kohl's, they relocated and moved the Call Center to San Antonio TX which was a heart breaker but I just was not ready to relocate. If the company's' Call Center was still here I would still be there. The company was very  understanding and great to work for. The promotions and growth was there and was happening quickly and often. The vacation was earned and if you did not use it then it was able to be bought back by the company which I thought was a great deal too. This company allowed you to choose your hours and days to best suit your lifestyle. Which was great because everyone life is different which means with enough employees they were able to satisfy everyone as well as having people available to successfully take care of there customers with great customer service skills due to non-stress. Kohl's was a great place to work for."
good,"I have been there for 15 years, since before the store opened. It is a very fast paced environment. Excellent Customer Service is important. Good associate discounts."
good,I absolutely love kohls. It is a great environment to work in. Its always a team effort and as a team we put our all in. I dont plan on leaving kohls anytime soon because i honestly think its a great place
good,"I loved it there, very organized and overall wonderful people. There were all types of associate benefits and theres even a cafe in the buildings. Many great opportunities to move up as well."
good,"Beginning on my first day at Kohl's, I felt welcomed into the team and the company as a whole.  Everyone I met throughout my time there was extremely friendly.  However, the work I did as a Software Engineer Intern was not as technical as I would have liked.  Although there were more technical roles, by luck of the draw, I didn't end up in one of them."
good,I love working at Kohl's.  I especially love shopping at Kohl's.  It's a great balance between work and life.  The hours are flexible and so are the work days.  Expect Great Things!

good,en general buen ambiente de trabajo pero no te dejan ni ir al baño en temporada navideña
good,"I really enjoy working at Kohls, for an 8 hour shift you get two 15 minute breaks (paid) and a lunch. This is really awesome. They've also been very gracious there when I was pregnant in terms of helping me out a lot and not letting me lift heavy stuff. They currently allow me to pump breast milk at work on my breaks in one of the offices which is a great help!"
good,The environment is like family. They genuinely care and work with you to make your schedule work for your needs. They are flexible when your availability changes.
good,"It is a great place to work, although I was a seasonal cashier, it was super fun and their schedule is very flexible. The staff and managers are friendly and want to help you out in any way possible. The only thing that was pretty tough, was getting costumers to sign up for the Kohl's card, as the managers set a goal up everyday."

good,the workplace culture is great. Your colleagues are your friends and everyone strives to complete any and all tasks as quickly and efficiently as possible. Management is approachable and adheres to changes in employees availabilities.

good,Ringing customers doing go backs sorting merchandise I enjoy the people I work with management is always helpful great incentives for employees who get credits
good,"Kohls team culture translates to every aspect of their business. From sales floor all the way to corporate I have always felt they have the right view of coworker interaction and customer support. They are one of the only retailers I've experienced that empowers their employees, not just at the managerial level but the floor associates as well to full assist a customer with purchasing issues or grievances."
good,"I have loved working here. The staff is great. "
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work. The managers are very considerate and flexible with your hours if anything ever comes up. The hours are good in general, and most people have a chance to ask for more hours depending on their departments. The departments are always busy and filled with customers, but everything else about the job makes the chaos not too bad. Kohl's is a very friendly environment and I love walking into work everyday."
good,Everyday at Kohl's brought unique employee and managerial experiences which allowed for learning and growth. Beside daily retail task that may seem autonomous at times each customer was unique and so was our engagement and interaction with them. the managers were stern but fair and always supportive. They were always willing to set their work aside to provide any associate with the help they needed. It became a real family environment.

good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management.

good,"A typical day at work was very smooth. Management was very understanding and took employee suggestions seriously. It was a very diverse place to work, so many wonderful people. Most enjoyable part of my job was the team i worked with. I believe any workplace with a great team of people is a wonderful place to work."
good,"the workplace is relaxed on normal days, but on holidays it can be fun and stressful but you still get to help people with questions and spend more time with co-workers."
good,"My typical day at work I try and sell my products, I clean, restock, and do beauty consultations.  I've learned more about makeup and skincare, and how to make people fee good about themselves. The management is good. The workplace is welcoming of all types of people and cultures. The hardest part of my job would be updating my department and my towers. The most enjoyable part is doing consultations."

good,"Best part about working at Kohl's would be the coworkers, and then a close second would be the benefits given to employees assuming you shop at Kohl's regularly."
good,Great management. Fast paced enviorment. Most difficult is keeping up with multiple people when you're alone. Amazing morale. Most enjoyable part is the people.
good,"You really can't beat the pay in the kohls beauty department. 11.55 plus commission is nothing to sneeze at. I also enjoy the flexibility and the hours, I usually get at least 20 a week. Don't really have any complaints, although I probably wouldn't work here if I was only a cashier. You do have to have a working knowledge of beauty and skincare products, but do not have to have a cosmetology license. You need to be able to apply full face makeover to customers, as some come to get free one's before a big event. Mildly stressful, but if you know what you're doing, it's fine."
good,"Pretty straight forward work days."
good,I learned working here is a chance you can make a change in your life if you want to advance your career. The management team are wonderful with there customers and employees. The hardest part is when others are slackers and your left with their work along with yours. The most enjoyable part is seeing the customers happy.
good,I really do miss this job it was one of he best job I ever had.Work was consistent.They pay was above average and steady.It was a most definite reliable job.
good,"Other than feeling a bit stressed out in trying to generate ad on credit sales, I enjoyed working here. Management is good and they try to instill good training techniques."

good,I enjoyed working at KOHL's. The people I worked with were extremely nice and helpful. I worked for this company on 2 different occasions. The most enjoyable part was helping customers find what they needed.
good,We come in clock in and start our morning meeting. Then we do our stretches and begin our day. They have great management that will work with you never had to worry about not getting enough hours.
good,"My typical work shift involved picking things up off the floor, folding clothes, and generally making my designated area look more appealing. I usually worked until late at night, 11:00 to 11:30 from what I remember. I learned how to unbox merchandise, work up at the cash registers (which I did only once), and how to fit all my clothes in my suitcase."
good,"Kohls is wonderful company to work for. Its a fast pace job, so you have to pay attention in training to all details. Once you get the hang of everything you will be able to move up"
good,"mornings are slow I wish I could help with hanging or folding clothes because just standing on the carpet gets really boring."
good,"I absolutley love my job at Kohl's. The work environment is always fun and exciting with our spunky managers and employees. I have been here for a year now, and all my coworkers and managers have become close friends, like a family away from home. They were very sympathetic to my car accident and wanted me to take as much time as I needed to heal. They were always very supportive of me and understanding to home life."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,I usually work during the evening which is closing. My duty is recovery which means I get everything out of the fitting room and make sure all the clothes the customers tries on is put back in the right place. Also I make sure that all the clothes are put away and fixed up for the next morning. We don't want to leave anything behind for the next morning crew.
good,"As a Point Of Sales/Cashier, I typically begin by making sure that all registers have what they need and the front of the store in presentable. I greet customers, educate them on Kohl's Charge card and Rewards card benefits and help them with purchases."
good,Very easy and simple. A great first job to dip your toes in retail. I loved my managers and coworkers. The environment is great and everything is very structured.
good,"All employees always had great attitudes, they make everyone feel welcome and like family. Whenever help is needed they make sure they come provide assistance as quick as possible."
good,"Easy 4 hour to 8 hour work day"
good,"this is a great beginner job for anyone with no experience, they require no experience and if you don't have a diploma that's fine they have a no judgment policy. great environment great service think highly of this establishment."
good,"It is a good place to work. The return policy should be more strict. People are taking advantage of the company. Customers return clothing and shoes from years ago. When my managers get involved, they usually give in to the customer. Which makes me feel like they don't want to deal with the customer so they just over ride the issue. It seems that my managers are overwhelmed and over worked. I do enjoy working with people."
good,"Good staff as well as good management and hours."
good,"Working at Kohl's was beyond a joy and always something to look forward to even on the bad days. A typical day at work for me was clocking in, going to the jewelry counter and helping customers by informing them of sales, how to be approved for credit, and picking out the best options. Management was very supportive and helpful when ever they possibly could be. I loved my team! The workplace culture was very diverse and the corporation as a whole is very accepting of every ones differences.For me there were really never moments that were hard.

good,"Kohls has a ton of upward advancement opportunities!!! And they pay for tuition. There are a bunch of rewards for performance and benefits. The hardest was Black Friday, and it being mandatory for ALL employees. Everything else was a breeze."
good,It's sad to know the store I worked for is now closed. This was my first job after moving to a new town and it taught me so much. I worked for a strong management team and made some great friends.
good,"Very great place to be working at while in high school.  Everyone is so kind, and getting breaks really helps me because I have really bad blood sugar."
good,I loved working at kohls. They had great hours for part time and the pay was reasonable with it. Only wish there would have been more chances to become full time
good,employees are too busy mingling to work its more like a dating facility at least for the workers but as far as the staff goes and the company as a whole its a great place to work
good,"Our work day was to maintain our company vans,  check for service dates. Then we would get our work orders and perform the jobs. I learned how to install and maintenance the security panels and CCTV. We worked in twos and the employees were great to work with.

Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,If Kohls paid a little bit better I would never leave. It is the best job. Actually I love almost all the jobs I have had.  But Kohls is so exciting.  I loved shopping here for so many years and have been trying to get in and just started as seasonal help and am planning on being taken on into management after the holiday season is over.
good,"Loved my co workers and managers there, always worked with one another to get things done. I mostly worked night shifts so it was important that we had the store finished and prepared for the next shift."

good,"taking care of customers with credit card payments, late fee's, change of address and so on. learned to take multi task to another level because you are searching for information for the customer using up to 7 different systems,  co workers are great here the hardest thing to over come here is patients being a great listener is a plus, you will have fun doing what ever position you choice  there are always fun activities created to help with employee moral and keep employees positive to better serve the customer . Management team  is always looking out for you and always will to help and learn with you."
good,My personal impression after working at Kohl's was really good the management could still use a lot of work.The overall though was really good i learned so much from Customers to the fellow employee's. That's why i would highly recommend people to work they're cause its a warm fun filled job it never get's boring and it helps to of had such amazing coworkers who made any situation better.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was working either at Customer Service or Point of Sale registers because no two days were alike. The store was busy most of the time and it was always neat and colorful to attract customers."

good,Kohls was a great company to work for that is always focused on people. They focus on a great training program starting with associates hired as part time all the way up through the store managers.

good,"I just started and I have to say that I am not without support.  Everyone I ask for help, helps me.  This in turn teaches me the operations of my job and enhances my knowledge of the retail world.  I have learned a great deal about retail being there for just a month and a half.  I enjoy working there and management and my co-workers are always there to support me to succeed."
good,Kohls is one of the only jobs that really cares about their employees. The pay could be better but they do give you raises. Also the store manager could use some work but other then that it's a great place to work. They really take care of you it's like a big family.
good,"A typical day at work mainly includes customer service. Kohl's is all about making the customer happy. One can do as much as work a register, clean out the fitting rooms, clean up the store, and service desk. What I learned at Kohl's is time management and discipline. Some days you can be so busy that you have to really work as hard as you possibly can. Management is wonderful and very easy to get along with. Co-workers make the work experience fun and everybody is willing to help everybody, no matter what department. The hardest part of the job, in my opinion, is working the fitting rooms. One really has to have a lot of patience because sometimes there are messes in the fitting rooms and the racks and tables are messy, but that's just part of the job, and for me, I like to stay busy. The most enjoyable part of the job, other than food and parties and jean days, is the friendships you make with the people you work with, managers and all. Everybody makes you feel at home and are always helpful."
good,"I had many responsibilities in a fast paced environment where I was always dealing with new things, which was a great fir for me. I really enjoyed the independence, as well as being able to interact with a large amount of customers. I was also able to create more efficient procedures, and the employees made the position the excellent experience that it was. Not only was it a lively position, it was also very diverse in opportunities. I enjoyed learning all the aspects of a retail store and continuously learning on the job."
good,"A typical day was get in touch with my superviso or do the tasks that we planned to do a day before, I've learned to organizations and comunications skills, management was incredibly great and enjoy my co-workers as well, it was not to have enough hours, and I enjoy everything for the most part"
good,I absolutely loved working at Kohls. They payed attention to strengths and weaknesses and put me in the position that best suited my abilities. They created a work environment that allowed me to thrive and advance from cashier to Ship From Store trainer. I would still be working at Kohls had I not moved out of state to an island that doesn't have Kohls close enough.
good,"let you get your work done without constantly checking in on you, and even let you listen to  your own music when you are in the back unloading"
good,Kohls is a  great place to work. We work together as a group which is awesome. The management is amazing andfl so are my co workers

good,"Typical day at work was going to the dock early in the morning, unload a truck of merchandise and stock it all on the sales floor before and while the store was open. The co-workers there were great and all had positive attitudes. The managers were good as well it just depended on their days. But over all a good place to work, I just never got enough hours to get enough money to pay my bills."
good,"I was always on my feet and helping others, and it was a great experience working here. I learned a lot working in retail and have improved on my social skills."

Really easy flexible company to be cross train in avery single department with real good opportunities to advance to the next level if desire."
good,I worked the Christmas season and enjoyed it very much. The employees were all very nice and fun to wrok with. I able to work with customers and restocking in my department and was able to keep busy at all times with no problems.
good,"The typical work day various depending on which shift you are coming into. Working for Kohl's for over four years now I've learned a great deal.

good,work with customers nd help them have a good visit when they would leave out the door. i learned how to communicate with different types of people nd customers
good,If we were slow we would start folding cloths and cleaning up the store and make it presentable. All of the staff and even managers were very nice and would always greet you and make you feel welcomed.
good,"excellent place to work, that is why few leave. Co-workers and management are easy to get along with, everyone helps everyone else out. Worst part of the job was that there were days that required 2-3 hours of overtime,"
good,Great job to have. You have to be ok with being on your feet for a long period of time ! You well also have to be able to communicate  with customers ! You well all have to fold and organize things to put out on shelfs !
good,"My favorite part was when I first started working there, everyone treated me like family. I loved being comfortable around my coworkers. Not once have I had a negative experience about that. I learned that I will make mistakes, but I can learn and grow from them. Seeing customers disappointed that we don't have a particular item in stock was the hardest part. I always made sure my customers left happy."
good,"A typical day at work at Kohl's would be very fast paced and work filled. I often moved from department to department, or assisted customers at the customer service desk. I spent a majority of my time cleaning, organizing, and helping customers with various needs. This job taught me how to work well with others and practice patience on a day to day basis. The management team at Kohl's was very helpful and cared about their associates. I always felt comfortable and confident asking for help and knowing that it would be provided. The hardest part of working at Kohl's was trying to please the customer at all times, and feeling disappointed when I could not. The most enjoyable part of working at Kohl's was building a strong relationship with my co-workers and learning to effectively communicate with and assist other people."

There wasn't anything hard about working with the great people at Kohl's. I enjoyed even the days that may have seemed longer than others.
good,"A typical day at work was very fun and fast paced. I learned a lot but the main thing I walked away with is that the customers should be the main focus. Management always kept the team on the right track."
good,Greeted customer as they came in. Assisted customers with their purchase selections. Accepted payments for those selections. Opened & closed the store. Maintained all applicable reports. Answered customer’s inquiries either on the phone are in person
good,"A typical day at work was quite orchestrated smoothly.  Kohl's Department store is more or less like a small city in itself.  A ship fleet crew.  Management was as professional as you could possibly imagine.  My Co-Workers, here again, are part of a ship fleet crew.  The hardest part of the job was the need to eventually find full-time employment due to finishing a sabbatical at Berkeley College, White Plains, NY.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working for Kohl's Department was Kohl's Department store organization."

From management to the cleaning crew everyone had some sort of reltionship with one another. We had theme days where we could dress up and if it was your birthday they always had some sort of treat for you. You felt special and admired at the store."
good,"Kohl's is a great place to work. I really enjoy the work/life balance and the way they listen to what the employees need. Day to day, I work in the back office helping solve cases for customers whom have disputes with different scenarios."
good,A typical day at work involves taking care of the customers and making sure the sales floor is adequately filled. So far I have learned to handle cash and the inventory of merchandise. The management here at Kohls are grade A because they communicate effectively with they employees and they provide a fun work environment. My co-workers are outgoing and help whenever assistance is needed. The hardest part of the job is not getting the hours I would like to receive. Finally my most enjoyable part of the job is just showing up to work each day because I love interacting with the general public.
good,"A typical day at Kohls consists of helping customers locate items, ringing them up when they are ready to go and soliciting credit. Management and coworkers at kohls are great people to be around . They are all willing to help one another. The hardest part of working at Kohls is when people get mad about something beyond your control. The most enjoyable part is being around happy people"
good,I've been with Kohl's for over 5 years and all in all I have had a very pleasant experience. I started off as the Beauty Specialist and was promoted to the Visual specialist. The Visual Specialist is a fun  fast pace job. You always need to be aware of things that are changing and get all the sale graphics up before the opening of the store. I'm also responsible for helping out with new project launches and capital projects. I'm also responsible for decorating the store for Christmas. Every week there is a graphic directive that comes out for the two weeks out. So at the beginning of each work week I look at that weeks graphic directive so I know how to plan my week.  The hardest part of my job is having enough time to get everything done. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing my hard work pay off for the company and for out store.
good,"I have been here for about 4 months and I love it. It's probably one of the most easiest jobs I have ever had. I was hired for replenishment, and now I just got hired for full time picking. I love the 10 hour shifts and most importantly the people I work with are cool. I have the weekend shift so this works great for me as I am going back to college for my bachelor's in August!!"
good,Kohls is a great company to work for. I worked part time and went to school full time and Kohls was very understanding.
good,A typical day at work is fast paced. There is always something that needs to be done such as a project or assisting with customers. It is a very friendly environment where everyone feels like family.
good,"Fast paced."
good,Had a balst going to work everyday. Started as a cashier and work my way up to customer service specailist.
good,"t really varies store by store. In my store, the Misses, Jr's and Men's departments are the busiest. You'll be running around a lot, doing go-backs, keeping the department clean. The store does have goals, including credit goals. You will be expected to solicit credit (which isn't really that bad). Overall, it's not bad for a part-time job, especially in this economy. If you keep a positive attitude, and with a little luck in having good managers/supervisors, you'll have a good time."
good,Everyone is very respectful and friendly. The benefits are wonderful. I enjoy the excitement in all of my fellow employees. I enjoy the management. I enjoy always being busy and having a lot to do.
good,"I worked primarily in shoe department, but was also a cashier when needed.  I received great discounts on name-brand clothes.  Managers are very nice and understanding."
good,If more business models adapted Kohl`s model a lot more companies would be successful. As previously stated this particular company was an absolute wonderful place to work for...management very supportive and receptive to ideas and change. Each employee no matter their pay or position or stature were treated fairly and equally there was no hint of favoritism which dogs more places to work for than not. The only knock I would say came from with the amount of people that were employed there a good chance of bad apples coming through the door was high which could make some days a little more challenging than need be
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Need a job that keeps you busy? This is the perfect job for you! I liked this job and were given lots of opportunity.  I met a lot of good people at this job and worked really hard.  The managers were always so helpful and making sure you had all that you need.  I learned great customer service and how to work at a fast pace.
good,"great work environment I already made a review on this job."
good,"Everything about Kohls is enjoyable. The work setting is wonderful. Kohls works hard to provide a setting that you want to work in, that is fun and enjoyable. Working with other employees is like working with a big family. Everyone is very nice and welcome you with open arms. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking with customers. The regulars are very sweet and customers always love to come back. The hardest part is explaining to unhappy customers how Kohls Cash works with percentage discounts, and the return policy. Those give the most complications at work and tend to make customers unhappy. The management is by far the best compared to anywhere else I have worked before!"
good,"the people were great, the management was great. the break room was nice and when we worked 10 or more hours we got 2 breaks"
good,"Punch in, go to customer service pick up returns, put returns in proper place in the department,  go to department organize and fill in product as necessary, light dusting and cleanup. Be friendly and nice to customers, interact with customer and help with finding product or describe how products work. Great management and associates."
good,"Great work place, everybody is friendly family atmosphere"
good,Great group of girls to work with. I enjoyed working with this company!
good,Well my day usually started at about 5:00 AM and usually ran to about 12:00PM. And no matter what could possibly happen outside of work i could come to work and know that I would be treated as a respected individual and the people that i worked with were all easy to get along and easy to talk to. in my time working at kohl's i learned about retail and the many thing that it makes up and how they coexist with each other.the hardest part is not being able to help the customer find what they are looking for either because we don't have any or because we don't carry the item.the most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the smile on a customers face.
good,Great place to start if you want to be in the retail business. I learned great skills.
good,A typical day at work would be helping the customers providing them with my excellent customer service. The management team were great.
good,"A typical day consists of greeting customers and making sure they are satisfied with their purchases, if they found everything they were looking for and to ask for assistance if there was a problem. If I couldn't help with a solution, to seek help from management. I learned the customers' satisfaction is job one, My managers are always ready to resolve any situation and they assure us that we can use our best judgment to rectify any situation that may arise. My co-workers are pleasant and supportive. The hardest part of the day is when we might be short staffed and have more than two customers in line and I want to keep my lines moving smoothly. The most enjoyable part is interacting with customers and to have them smile back at me and have an enjoyable experience while checking out in my line and thanking them and wish them to have a great day as they exit."
good,I learned a lot about warehousing it was a good experience and I liked to work at this warehouse.
good,Every time I go to work everyone is there with a smile.  All co workers are respectful honest fun and friendly.  And I always do my best at my job.
good,"They could pay experienced people more than $7.50 hr.  I rang out customers, greeted customers, helped in other departments when needed, collected carts, hung clothes on hangers or folded for that department to put out, counted out my drawer and counted before the shift; if enough time, came in early or stayed late to do sign changes and straightened and folded all area around and at my register."
good,Working at Kohls was a great experience. My fellow coworkers were very supportive and always willing to assist with any obstacle. The management was willing to allow for growth and trained me in different areas of the store. I enjoyed speaking to customers and forming a bond with the regulars that came through the store. I have rarely had a customer leave without a smile on their face.
good,"A typical day was full of work and a lot of walking. Being a picker is a physically demanding job being on your feet for hours and the walking up and down stairs."
good,Working in the customer service department at Kohl's has been a very life changing experience. Managing your time wisely and taking the time to focus on each customer individually while answering the store telephone. The people who work with me all care about each other and we work as a unbelievable team.
good,"I really enjoyed this position with this company. The atmosphere was fantastic, so were the working conditions and the class of people was very comfortable."
good,"I learned a lot about customer service, including soliciting and processing credit card applications, processing online orders, and also received training in loss prevention."
good,"A typical day at work for me there would be to provide great customer service, clean fitting rooms, and keep everything clean neat and organized and run registers"

Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I've never had a job that I absolutely love going to or don't dread going to work, Kohl's changed that! Kohl's is the best place to work! The management is so nice, they give you great employee benefits/discounts, you can do volunteer work with your co-workers, fun events throughout the year, you get recognized for great work and you're always always busy! It's an awesome place! :)"

good,"Assist with closing of the store if needed. Prep team for the evenings workload. Usually includes the unload, processing, and flowing of freight."
good,"It was different everyday. Sometimes customers could get annoying but it was job security to keep the store looking nice. "
good,days at work are long and stressful but over all I enjoy my job.
good,"Start working for Kohl's 2.5 years ago.I am 47 years old women.I love my job!I love my co-workers and I love my managers.Our store 560 Burke,Va the best place in this big Earth to work.Everybody respect everybody.Everybody helps everybody.Everybody loves everybody.I love to stay with this company in the test of my life.If you are 40 and older and if you young person this is a great place to work.Absolutely no age discrimination!!!!I am very blessed working for this company."

good,"Fun place to work, and all management is fun to work with. Days go by fast working with a good crew."
good,Customer service is the number one priority at Kohls. Sales numbers  are not as much as a focus as other retail franchises.
good,"You make your own hours, mostly part time people. Very friendly atmosphere.  Lots of work. Holidays, lots of hours. Good for that job to pay extra bills with."
good,"This was a really good place to start my retail and customer service experience. I learned a lot about the retail industry, sales, and promotions. Not only that but how putting the customer first truly does make an impact on your company sales and reviews."
good,"Great place to work, really big on core vaules and customer service."
good,"I learned basic warehouse operations. Stocking and unloading of trucks. Moving merchandise, product placement and customer service. Management was strong and training was important. Everyday was new objective. "

good,"Usually the days are busy, nights and mornings can be boring with no customers. Always a workload and the management challenges you to meet store goals. "
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,This is my second retail environment I have been in and by far my favorite. The day went smoothly and management treated everyone fairly. 
good,Came into work always knowing that the job qualifications were good and all co-workers helped each in times of need.
good,I enjoyed it everyday I would learn something new. The management team was very involved with employees and co-workers were friendly and never minded helping to get the job done. There wasn't anything hard about it. I loved everything about it.
good,I worked for kohl's for 2 years. I have learned and gained alot of customer service skills from working with kohl's. I had nothing but great experiences when working with my co- workers and seeing customers/new faces leave the store with good impressions about the store. my most enjoyable experience with working for this company was helping every customer I could help even when I didn't know the answer I would go find the answer to help assist the customer with their questions. I feel that is great customer service to make every customer feel welcomed.
good,Good job flexible to other job and school hours. no complaints
good,"fast pace but beneficial"
good,The management team is very accommodating to the scheduling needs of the employees and take an active interest in our personal lives. The company is focused on environmental responsibility and charity. 
good,cashier sales associate credit cards submissions they made me feel love management was very helpful
good,"A typical day at work for me is to arrive at the building and make my way back to the staff area, put my things in my locker, wait for the correct time and clock in. I would then go to my register, sign in, and begin work. I had cashiered before but Kohls was a bit more demanding. It's a great work environment and I liked everyone there but I was a seasonal worker and it was too hard for me personally to continue working there. You had to wear dressy shoes even though no customer would ever see your shoes, and it was a standing job. You also could not have water at your register, even though there was an area to keep things and they wouldn't have seen it. So you could go a few hours without a drink or anything. That and the standing was the worst for me. "
good,"Great environment good discount, good scheduling but no hours. "
good,"kohl's was a great place to work. Great people, bosses, and environment. i hated leaving"
good,"A typical day of work would be slow, then busy, then slow again, and so on. Ringing people out and making sure they have a good experience is the typical thing for a cashier to do."

By them coming back you know that business is good. the hardest and enjoyable part of the job is the people that are doing the shopping.
good,Management at Kohl's in Timonium respects every employee in the store. I learned important thing customer likes personal relevant to him .
good,Good work place. Management was great. Co-workers were very helpful. Hardest part of the job was during black friday and the holidays. The most enjoyable part is meeting so many people.
good,"Very good company to work for, however, I felt being on the register wasn't the best place to work to fulfill my needs but I still enjoyed helping the customers and working with my co-workers who always helped if I was able to find what I needed"
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."

good,Wonderful corporation to work for.Management really showed appreciation for their employees. Typical day was always steadily busy. Met some really awesome co-workers/friends there.
good,"I loved working for Kohl's. The people were great, the management was supportive and helpful, and they worked with me so I could get the hours I needed to stay employed around my full time job. Unfortunately, I could not get the quantity of hours I needed, so it was a second job and I had to leave when my full time job got too demanding. I was mainly a POS clerk and alsoworked withina few of the departments. There really was no difficult part of the job to me, but the easiest and most fun part was relating to the customers."
good,"co-workers were friendly and helpful, work days were enjoyable."
good,we check out customers and sale the kohls charge card to them.
good,Working at Kohl's has taught me a lot. I have learned the responsibility of the flow of a work place and how a retail job flows in the correct manner. Kohl's provided me flexible responsibilities and a friendly staff to be a part of.
good,"Management is very lenient and understanding of work/life balance. A great place to work in teams and depend on each other to have tasks accomplished. There is a variety of job positions, and management is willing to train you in a position you desire."
good,The work is pretty easy. You have hands on training and there is always someone to answer anything you might want to ask. Its fast paced most of the time and the management is AMAZING. The co-workers are extremely cool and friendly.
good,I've worked with kohls for over two years and it is truly a great place to work.
good,"kohls, was very different and very friendly environment. the job is always motivating and fun."
good,Kohls as any retailer is intense and demanding but rewarding at the same time.
good,"Kohls provides a fun and friendly environment. A typical day would include sorting through merchandise, providing customer service, selling credit and stocking shelves. The most enjoyable part of the job was making excellent connections with the customers and co-workers."
good,"It was great, no longer there. The owners were fun, friendly, and caring. Co-workers are fun. Not a hard job, cooking and waitressing are enjoyable types of jobs."
good,calm

good,"My day would start with a morning meeting to discuss sales, daily goals, what the sale plan is for the day and information about different things the company is doing. I learned a lot with working with different people. The management was very helpful with keeping us well trained. My coworkers were fun to work with and made it more family oriented. The hardest part of the job was keeping coworkers on track at times. The most enjoyable part is working with people"
good,"Auditing certain areas of the store/stockrooms are a consistent priority. I have no particular schedule, however monitoring high value items for appropiate security devices, the conditions of the receiving dock, dock doors, high value cages, and regular operational audits require approximately 25% of my day. The remainder of my day involves working with Kohls Management and associates to insure safe conditions on and off the sales floor. Internal and external investigations, apprehensions, appropriate and accurate paperwork and follow-up; responding and communicating with other Kohl's Stores' Loss Prevention personel will fill the rest of the day."
good,Everyday was a new and different experience. I was able to meet and help so many different customers from so many different cultures. That was the most rewarding part of my experience in the jewelry department.
good,best managers i have ever had they are laid back. my coworkers are awesome to made so many friends from work.
good,"i was part of the shipping manifest. i would weigh, and scan packages that were being shipped out. if a package weighed a pound or more i would change it to priority mail, but all others after it was weighed and scanned in i would place it in a bin with what city it was going to. but everything about this job was enjoyable the people the supervisor, and the environment.."

Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Kohls was an average place to work at. They assigned you a job and that what you did, they also assigned lunch breaks and who would be covering your break so that everything ran smoothly. The store manager was rude to employees. The only negative thing was pushing people to sign up for a credit card, and you had to ask everyone! Also the hours you received were based on how well you were at getting people to sign up for Kohl's charge cards, which is not fair!"
good,"I wish I was still working there because I loved the enviroment, the people, everything. But I had to leave, I didn't have a choice, I had no way there and my car had Burnt to the ground."
good,"Helping out customers with any store questions, which includes our store credit card and payments, returns and exchanges. I do that by operating cash registers and handling cash. My co-workers are always very helpful and team players. At the end of the day i count out/balance the registers, make sure all equipment use is put away and locked up. Making sure our goals are exceeded."
good,"Loved working here! Gained a great family, friends, and long time people to count on even when not working there anymore!"
good,Working for khols was very rewarding. I found that it challenged my abilities in many ways that was testing and fun. I enjoyed going to work and the people.
good,"A typical day at work was answering phones and taking orders from customers. I learned how to answer phones a correct way, I learn how to make order form in their system. The management were great people and I glad they taught me. My co-workers were great people I grew up with and completed school with.the hardes part of the job was making sure I didn't miss a phone call on my line and the most enjoyable part was working with great people and learning."
good,"A great company to work for if you love retail. This company values its employees and management is there for you, creating an environment enabling you to voice your opinions, concerns, and hopes for the future."
good,"You clocked in and started work right away whether it was straightening dressing rooms, putting clothes away, or helping cashiers minimizing the lines in the store. I learned to do task more efficiently with the electronics they let us use and to quickly put clothing in the correct section of the store. My co-workers were all relatively helpful. The hardest part of the job was the cash register at first, but with practice I got the hang of it. The most enjoyable part of the job was the discounts and free food."
good,"A typical day at work is focus on excellent customer service and daily credit goals. My years with Kohl's has taught me how to multi-task while remaining calm and focused. I have strengthened my management skills over the last several years by understanding that consistent feedback is very important for not only my associates' development and success, but for mine also. Each person is motivated differently and being able to adjust my management style to each associate has made me stronger and more effective in my role."
good,Calling on delinquent customers for payments.
good,"Loved helping out the customers find what they needed. Loved how sometimes it would get crazy, but the same time remained fun."

The ability to maintain a balance between customer appreciation and employee appreciation determines their success rate."
good,"There is no ""typical"" day at work. Every day brings something new. The management staff is approachable and easy to work with. Very much a ""family"" atmosphere here."
good,"Kohls was a great place to work as a first job. I got hired when they first opened and had a large part in helping open the store up at Grand Opening. I started on the receiving team in the backroom and after working in the back for a year was asked to go work on the floor because of my people skills and friendly nature. I was trained in every job position while working at this facility aside from the customer service desk. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Kohls and would recommend anyone apply there. It was my first job ever and it served as a great start as it introduced me to what a REAL job was like and also taught me a lot about retail. I enjoyed working with my fellow employees and got a lot of work done through the efforts of teamwork. During my time at Kohls I witnessed many managers come and go, some of which I was not too fond of but respected. However most of the management was always considerate of your feelings and worked towards your needs. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the customers and trying to accommodate their needs as no customer is ever FULLY happy but I believe if you work towards most of their needs they will be appreciative. The most enjoyable thing was the learning experience as I took in a lot working their and had to adjust to things that I learned and realize what worked and didn't work in a retail setting. Overall my time at Kohls was great."
good,"Loss prevention officer pays little but is great for a part time job as a student or to gain expereince from there you can move up to be a loss prevention supervisor, better pay. Great company!"
good,"Kohls is a great place to work, for anyone looking for a first job to get started or for someone that is looking for a company to continue working for."
good,"Great team and fantastic supervisors, tons of opportunities to move forward and very energy filled work enviorment."

good,"I enjoyed working at Kohl's, the co-workers and management team were great."
good,When it came to deadline moments it was really fun we all help each other making sure we get everything right and well organized.
good,"The environment at Kohl’s is a balance of customer service and employee happiness where they both work hands on together. The Manager for the Lake Park Store Katrina is awesome and is dedicated to ensuring that the customer who visit the store, enter and leave happy, as well as ensuring that the employees that she supervised are happy as well which creates longer tenures of employment. She lets her employees no that they are appreciated and she plays a active role in the work in the store hands on which is an important characteristic for any manager."
good,Enjoy working at Kohls. They are able to work around my schedule with kids and other job. The managers are easy to work with. I always have plenty to do to keep me busy during my shift.
good,"I loved every minute that I worked there. Anytime I needed help, someone was there in an instant. They treat their employees with complete respect. They provided lunch on a few Saturdays that I worked there, which shocked me. Not many workplaces do the things that Kohl’s did for me."
good,"Ever since Day 1,  respect among all co-workers  was present in the air.  Never no bickering,  team work  has always been applied with high spirits.  Great benefits and I would recommend a 401 Plan to every Associate.  Promotional opportunities is great and its just a friendly Store to work at."
good,"Kohl's Montebello has a great team of leaders and even better employees. The work environment they have built there is welcoming and as an associate there you know that no matter what challenge you face, whether it is personal or work-related, you are not alone. It is a great place to start at and I am thankful they gave me my first job."
good,The most laid back and easiest warehouse job you will have. Every area and department you are able to work at is straight forward and simple. The rate is attainable for anybody. The warehouse is fairly new so its pretty clean and and tech is commonly used and up to date which makes work productivity easier. Associates are also able to work with earphones making the day go by smoother. The only downside is inconsistent workload especially at the beginning of the year. But overall a really good modern place to work and in my opinion the best warehouse to work at.
good,"Kohl’s has honestly been the most impressive job I have had. The company treats you like a person and not just a number. The coworkers are friendly, helpful and really team oriented. A typical work day at my job there was cleaning out dressing rooms and putting the clothes away, folding and making sure the clothes were hung and folded neat and tidy, helping customers find what they needed and giving them advice"
good,The reason why I gave kohl's this review is because it was my first job when I was in high school. This job has helped me gain the experience and knowledge of retail and an customer service also with excellent work experience.
good,"I loved working here! if I didn't move out of the area for school, I would loved to have stayed and worked there. The management and the entire staff was so friendly and kind to everyone."
good,"Enjoyable coworkers, management and hopefully I can get on full time.  My experience has been so rewarding starting as seasonal to part time and I want to learn more, take test and gain growth within this company."
good,"I did not really have a social life but then again I was working seasonal so I can not really complain. Good staff, and it was a really good experience in retail."
good,"A typical day at Kohls for Sale Associate was doing go backs, making sure the registers and area around them were clean and organized. Also helping customers out with any questions they have about the store or sales. I learned how much I really like retail, I love a fast paced environment where there is always something to do. My managers were really nice and helpful, they definetly made me like the job more. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was doing go backs because you get to know the store better so its easier to direct customers to what they're looking for."
good,"The overall work environment is friendly. The manager is approachable and tries to work through issues with the employees. Also, they are very friendly regarding department and hours."
good,"The staff is kind, helpful and understanding. They even bring in food when ever there's a busy day to help out the workers. Whenever there's a problem, they are always trying to help to the best of their abilities."
good,I had no complaints the management was very friendly and understanding. The have very flexible hours for scheduling which helped me go to school while I worked.

good,"I loved working at Kohls."
good,"Enjoyed my many year at kohls, ability to advance and the friends/family I made there. This is a fast paced company. Need to be able to adjust and accept change throughout your shift."
good,"As one of America's largest retailers, Kohl's cares, not only about their customers but also about their associates and employees working for them. Our store showed tremendous appreciation for us coming to work on Thanksgiving day. In addition to paying time and a half plus $2/hr, $1 per credit app, and tons of back up and support in every inch of the store, they provided a variety of tasty foods all day long to be sure every shift was included, which also extended throughout Black Friday! We had a brief, spirited huttle beforehand lead by our store manager, Don, who (for those of us who had never experienced it before) gave us all the opportunity to watch the opening of the doors for the first time, and see all the eagar shoppers just pour in...  It was quite an amazing sight!!  I must say, I am very proud to be a small part of this stellar company made up of successful leaders, co-workers and team members.Thank you for caring Kohl's!"

good,Kohls is a great place to work when you are first starting out great managers and a great company they are understanding and flexible if something comes up.
good,"good for a high schooler, but anyone else should probably look the other way people always calling in sick and just being ridiculous all the time, awful planning skills on supervisors part."
good,The job itself is very simple and an easy task. The company is very organized and balanced. I would just rather want more work hours to keep up with school funds.
good,"I love working at Kohl’s "
good,Kohl’s was a great company to work for. They have a great core value! I was very impressed with how involved they are with the community. It was a very enjoyable job.
good,This is a great environment to work in. Expect to work hard and you will be rewarded. Nice environment and management is excellent. Pay could be better but I love my job that I work
good,I like packing merchandise at Kohl's because it was fun. I also like this fulfilment warehouse because I got trained  Even though I worked temprarly I enjoyed it because I got over time and the pay was good.
good,I enjoyed working at Kohl's for several reasons. One of the primary reasons why I found Kohl's to be such a fulfilling work place was the fact that my personal ambition was celebrated and encouraged. I have always had a very strong work ethic and I do not idle well. My managers at Kohl's always celebrated my achievements and gave me extra projects so that I was never bored.
good,"During the short time that I worked at Kohl's my experience with this company is one that made me proud to say I was once apart of that Kohl's family, cuz that's how they treat you just like one of the family. They truly care about their employees and they show it. Not only are they understanding when it comes to having issues that pop up when having Lil ones at home they express their concerns about how they can help easy some of the things that might be going on in ur life. I suffer from major depression and and trying to deal with my issues while at work was challenging but they were there to help me every step of the way. They expressed their concerns about what my priorities should be and that was getting my health in order. They said it was my choice they weren't insisting on letting me go they just wanted me to know that they were by my side and supported me all the way, they even said that if I chose to leave my position and worked on my health issues that once I felt the time was right that they're still have a job for me ."
good,Good place to work work with your school schedule. Life balance good honest people and hard working. Can depend on co-workers to always help you. Would recommend this job to all my friends.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,This job was amazing I loved everything about especially when peak season hit you could make so much extra money and they gave u so many raises the only this is they don’t really give second chances much
good,I love working here! My management team and other associates are one of a kind. I was hired in as full time beauty Supervisor and was offered a great starting pay. Great incentives and rewards. I love working with the AIA program to do volunteer work around the community. There is room for advancement also. You get what you put in :)
good,"Kohl’s has been my favorite job I’ve ever had by far. Easy work, awesome team and management. Works great with student life. Good pay and benefits for part time workers. Would go back in a heart beat."
good,On days I open the store I let the associate in to the safe room to start balancing. Next I get the crew sheet and start assigning backup schedules and writing down our goals for the day. Then walk the store to verify recovery from previous night and if extra touch up is needed then that is added to the list. Once all employees are there for opening a huddle is called and we go over everything. Then if change is needed I get that. Any orders come in for in store pickup I assign that to someone or do it myself. Try to set up the closing manager with enough customers who have applied for credit cards and rewards. Walk the floor and see that everyone is still on task. Then leave. Closing is basically the same thing with the associates and recovery. Close down registers in order to get out of the store at a decent time.
good,this is a retail giant in our american culture both online and brick and mortar buildings.Kohls listens to the voice of the employee and implements different changes to accomodate associates.
good,I started in my senior year of high school as a seasonal shoe associate. I was so elated at the opportunity to work at kohls since it was so close to my house meaning travel time was minimal.  I was lucky enough to be kept on so after i graduated high school i ended up transferring to a new location near where i would now be living in the Tampa area. It was exciting but sad to leave all my friends I had made in the past few months to start all over again with ppl id never met. After saying my farewells to my managers and other coworkers on my last day it truly showed me how caring the environment had become for me. Fast forward almost now with the company nearly 4 years I've had many opportunities to learn new practices and trainings to propel me forward. Some may say you don't get adequate training but from my experience our learning program is accessible so if you need a lesson or something learned about it's not impossible which is what i like about Kohl's having all the trainings at your fingertips. Since August of last year I had the chance to become full time but due to some ppl shifting around and leaving I have become a Lead which i would never have thought possible. This company has allowed me to grow and I'm thankful for it.
good,I stock shoes. Help customers find what they are looking for to drive good customer service. Make sure my department is neat and clean and well taken care of.
good,One of the best places I’ve worked at all the managers are reall nice and respectful had a great time and easy time learning the ins and outs of the store would definitely suggest it as a career opportunity
good,"Great place to work for a first job, they start hiring at 16. Also a great place to stay working at if you enjoy working with other people and have good customer service skills or want to work on them. flexible hours, minimum wage pay with opportunities for pay raise and promotions."
good,"I had the privilege of working for this company for 7 years and was one of the best company’s to work for. I left for a better opportunity, didn’t leave on a bad note at all and wouldn’t say anything bad about them"
good,"Kohl's was my very first job and I gained a lot of knowledge working there about work life. The place was very diverse and full of happy smiles. The hardest part of my job was working with other employees that were very rude (specifically one person) because I was very new to the job and she always was annoyed at me when I would ask her for tips. The more I worked there, the easier it was, and I finally understood everything clearly which made me love working there, even more. I even got to teach other people how to do things! The best part about my job was helping customers choose which outfit to by for themselves and for their kids who are around my age."
good,"Awesome atmosphere and even better people! I loved working here!! There was never a boring day, I looked forward to each day there, regardless of my shift."
good,I loved kohls great work place and they helped me improve in sales. Hours and pay was great startes at 7.25 and left making 9.00. Kohls made me love retail.
good,Everyone there was great to work with and management is always very hands on. My first day working was on a Black Friday and everyone helped so  much!
good,Kohl’s was good for the most part. Within me being there for 3 months I got a promotion to be the Kids Lead at only 17 years old. You get a 15% discount. It can be very challenging and overwhelming but it’s nothing you can’t handle.
good,"I worked at Kohls 2690 in Fredericksburg Va.. It was a great experience for the 3 years I was there. They took care of their employees and tried to give as many hours as possible. I appreciated everything they did including extra hours, always making food for us for breakfast lunch dinner. The management staff was the best. I enjoyed working because we had a team there. Yes sometimes there were issues but we worked through them. I loved being there and left because of pay and not enough hours except for holidays. I would reccomend highly for someone to work there. I loved it. If they offered me more money and hours I would go back in a minute."
good,"It was a wonderful job, the pay was fair, and you got amazing discounts for everything (which was dangerous for me because I love everything Kohl's has)"
good,"a typical day at kohls is to mainly do your job and keep to yourself do not make friends,work fast and safely, nothing is hard at Kohls you are trained"
good,Great place to work while in college. Room for advancement and they are willing to train in all areas. supervisors are very helpful and friendly. Overall I would recommend Kohls
good,i enjoyed the steady paced collaborative work friendly customers   and the organization  and customer service is a great experience there. someone is always there to assist you andwe were trained to never tell a customer no

good,"A typical day for me is standing at the register, checking out items for customers, greeting customers, giving sales pitches for customers to sign up for a kohl's charge card, putting away recovery, counting registers for change and more. it is a very good job, sometimes fast paced, others can be slow."
good,I believe it is a good company to work for. I have worked for the company before and I believe they a growing stronger with each year. I hope to stay working there.
good,Working for kohls has been great. The job is honestly easy. I enjoy doing the work and putting effort into my job. Its great helping others and answering all questions.

good,Always be on time never be late everyone is super nice do your job anything they ask for even if it's not in your job title be willing to learn new things.
good,"A typical day at work was filled with merchandising products throughout the store. It was face-paced. You learn about the ins and  outs of retail, customer service and time management."
good,"I have enjoyed my stay at kohls so far, all the management isn't all on the same page but there are plenty of people that u can talk to. During peak season there is a good chance to make alot of money if you put the time in."
good,Postitve place to work with flexible hours and fun people to work with very nice and neat place managers are somewhat cool never have problems and good discounts and
good,"Awesome managemen, flexible hours, volunteer work, amazing benefits, team oriented, community based, local, the very best discounts, bonuses, and there's alot of employee encouragement"
good,"the people are very friendly, very clean environment too work. the company always had events and we were able too participate and felt that the company cared about there  employees"
good,Coming from a previous company into kohls I can say that kohls does a much better job at work/life balance and having a team of managers to support each other instead of everything being left on one person's shoulders
good,"overall, I really enjoyed my time working at Kohl's. The management was great and the scheduling was flexible as long as you stuck to your availability and communicated any changes in advance. The employees created a good work environment and were willing to help each other out when needed. That being said, the compensation you earn for your job is really poor. Don't expect to earn much over minimum wage. Great first job but not a long-term job."
good,"Kohls was flexiable and understanding with scheduals, the opportunity is there for those who want to work hard and move up. Great place to work with friendly staff."
good,"This was my first job and I worked seasonally, the managers were nice and often gave you extra jobs to pass the time when things were slow, and answered any questions you had with a good attitude. Other employees were also very helpful and nice."
good,I personally love working for Kohl's. All of the employees and especially managers help make the workplace a fun and safe environment. Working for Kohl's has helped me build upon my retail skills and to possibly provide opportunities to obtain higher up job.
good,"I have almost spent a year at Kohl's and it has been eventful to say the least. I came in as a seasonal employee and loved every minute of it. The work is fast paced and sometimes stressful, but I feel like I can thrive in that type of environment."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,When I first started at kohls everyone was so welcoming and helped me out since it was my first job. They work with my schedule which is convenient to me because of my classes.
good,I Was Picking Items To Totes And Also Moving Packing Items Putting Them Where They Needed To Be I Got Trained And Became A Certified Picker And Packer
good,was very hands on and a lot to do. Had to clean clothes from the dressing room and also had to assist customers. Employees were nice to those who were new at working there
good,A great place to work the fosters development. I have learned a great deal about SCCM. I have worked on a number of unique projects that have expanded my skill set.
good,Everyone is always smiling and saying hi! It help build my confidence. My children loved shopping their. The associate discount is a good precent off.

The job culture promotes an effortless work life balance, and it is! Many people took advantage of split schedules, special accommodations through HR, etc. for various family, school, or health circumstances. The easiest part of the job is showing up!

Great leadership helped me evolve to the person I am. Instead of firing me for missing work, I was given a second opportunity to prove that I could change and get my act together. It showed me how missing work can effect everything. I was given the opportunity to advance into a supervisor role finally and enjoyed mentoring new employees.

good,"A typical day of a freight seasonal freight employee starts with you getting your assigned blue bird and walkie. The blue bird has its issues and we all happened to be learning together as a team. As a seasonal employee, you report under a full time employee, but you are typically on your own after a short briefing either in person or through radio. As a season freight associate, I unloaded trucks, distributed merchandise throughout the sales floor meanwhile helping customers as needed. The manager and assistant managers at my Kohl's were anything from okay to great and friendly. I had no problem with management and they understood when it comes to hours if you give them a good enough heads up. My coworkers were sometimes clueless, but always willing to listen and work hard, as I can say about myself also."

good,"The life of a designer is cyclical, so everyday is different within the cycle of a season.  It starts with market research, identifying fashion and social trends and applying that to a seasonal concept with fabric, color, art direction and new styling.  There were daily approvals, which were submitted from overseas offices for production and fit sessions to review the fit of styles going into production.  I was with Kohl's for 9 1/2 years, so I learned a tremendous amount during my time with them, especially in the area of team building and interpersonal skills.  The hardest part of the job for me was determining when to let go of an idea or concept and when to keep pushing for it.  I leaned on the advise of my management to help navigate through these decisions.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me is when we reviewed sales and I got to learn first hand what our customers were really responding to.  These reports gave me a feeling of connection with our customers and gave me the insights to better deliver more of what they really seem to want."

good,Kohl's is an excellent company to work for and there is plenty of room for growth there. The job is fairly easy and you stay busy pretty much the entire time you're there. Many amazing people to work with and very flexible.
good,The management has clear standard for production and safety. My coworkers are really low key down to earth people. Unfortunately my position was seasonal. I'd like to stick out around. Oh well.

good,"My job is different day to day, I'll never know what type of person will come in my line. I love it because I'm a people person, so if their having a bad day, I'll try to make them smile by talking about what they bought was a great deal, or how I like whatever it was that they bought. Most of my coworkers are friendly, those that are not I 'll speak  to them without any small talk. The hardest part of my job is not being able to make every customer happy even though I try my hardest. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the smiles on customers faces, young and old when I great them with smiles."
good,"A typical day at Kohl's was very inviting and enthusiastic enviorment. You and your co-workers become one human being because you become a family member while working at Kohl's. I learned that I can count on my co-workers for help no matter the situation either work related or not they were always willing to help a family member out. I feel like the managment at Kohl's took care of me like a little sister, or daughter becuase they never treated me wrong, they always looked out for me. Honestly I don't think that there was anything too difficult for me to do while working there. They would give me a task to do in a time frame and I would acomplish that task. Yes, it could take me the whole time frame but sometimes it would only take me half of the time and if I finished early I would offer to help my other co-workers with their tasks. I feel like the most enjoyable part of the job was making friendships."

good,"Man, let me tell you. I only worked here for 2 months as a seasonal employee. I worked night shift which was $12.25/hour... best place I ever worked. You work 8/10/12 hour shifts depending on what you chose! You also chose the days you wanna work, and it never changes! "
good,i really loved this job to be honest. working cashier was something new i never done and i liked it. you meet lots of people . sadly it was seasonal .
good,"Typical day would be to come in and check with the manager to see what they would like you to accomplish for the day. "
good,I was very fortunate to have worked here for a few months. The corporate structure allows the employees to do what is needed to appease a customer and takes a lot of pressure off of the associates when they are facing an irate customer.
good,"I absolutely have nothing bad to say about Kohl's. The best company I've ever worked for. They are family oriented, the pay is great. Management really cares about their employees. Management is always looking for feedback to improve the company. The training very in depth. They make sure you know your job."
good,"My managers are fantastic to work with. They really want to help you succeed in your career. They know there stuff and are willing to answer any questions you may have.  My co workers are great to work. They are very willing to help you if you are in need "
good,Kohl's was a very welcoming place to start a warehouse career at and i enjoy all of the the work i did serving them. The employees are very friendly and helps you step by step to get a pacific task done faster. Even though i worked there seasonal 2 times i really learned a lot and made a lot of new friends.
good,At Kohl's I learned how to supervise staff and how to correctly handle various situations in customer service. I also learned how to handle interpersonal issues with staff during my years there. I started as a seasonal associate at customer service and was promoted to a key holder and assistant to the human resource manager who was also the assistant store manager.
good,"I loved working for this company. I learned a lot about customer satisfaction, and about achieving goals to advance in my position. The management was very formal, but very easy to talk to and relate to. Co-workers were always very pleasant, and one of the best parts of working the job. I really enjoyed advertising the company's credit line and the challenge of getting new customers to apply. It was also the hardest part of the position when trying to meet a quota."
good,"The managerial staff at the warehouse was always friendly and efficient. They paid great attention to the needs of employees and made sure everyone was comfortable with their positions within the company. "
good,"Work started very early for us, typically around four in the morning. We would unload that truck for the morning and then continue to break off into assigned groups, either merchandisers or back-stock. The time would really go quick. The management was always nice, but motivated to keep employees moving at a fast paced. We were rewarded for our hard work with gold pins."
good,I was trained to operate the cherry picker and electric pallet jack. Certified on both. I enjoy working in this fast-paced environment everyday.
good,Great interactions with managers and coworkers they are always friendly.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Right once I clocked in I would go back to customer service and put my radio and a Palm Pilot on. Then I would let management know I was there, clocked in, and ready to hear what I would begin with for the day. Once they told me, I would get straight to work and/or meet up with whoever I was working with and discuss the game plan, so to speak. After that, we went to our fitting rooms, and began our work cleaning off the bar and helping anyone along the way with whatever they needed: being a shirt size that could be in the back, checking a price, or getting an item down for them. In this job I would always be learning teamwork, productivity, patience, and helpfulness. And my co-workers were a joy to work with. I don't think there was a person I didn't like. The hardest part of this job was the constant brisk walking, bending, squatting, lifting, carrying, and pulling which could be a strain on my body. The most enjoyable was getting to help a customer find what they were looking for and being a team member with so many wonderful employees."
good,Love the experience and atmosphere at Kohl's. Everyone is friendly and the managers take time out of their day to talk to the employees like they are actual people. The focus on making customers happy really show and help us understand the needs of others inside and outside the store.
good,I do not want to write a review at this time please respect my rights thank you
good,"I would go in and see where I was scheduled and clean the area and focus on the fitting rooms."
good,"great work place, great co workers I worked there for ten years"
good,Great working enviroment and great employes. The manager is very understanding an really take care of the employes. The most enjoyable part of the job is making the customer feel good.
good,"I absolutely love Kohl's as a place of employment! I have had very intuitive and respectful managers throughout my 4 years of working for them. Not only do I get recognized when I am going above and beyond for customers, but I also receive constant positive feedback from the customers and associates. Every day when I come in for work, my team and I work together to get the store ready for opening. We open registers, count the money from the prior day to make sure all of our numbers line up, and learn about what sales are going on and for how long. We receive a daily 'line up', which tells us who will be working in which departments, who will be available in case of customer assistance, and what codes we can use on our in store Kiosks. The entire day consists of constant communication between all associates and executives. We work as a team to accomplish tasks and help out all customers in need of assistance. I've learned that a smile goes a long way, especially when it comes to the customers who walk in thinking negatively. The only thing that can change an angry customer, is someone who can relate, listen, and fix the problem. We rely on customer service scores to give us our company ratings, so every time we make a customer completely satisfied with their experience, we direct them to our online survey. The hardest part of my job is when the holiday season hits. We have seasonal help that comes in and assists with the abundance of shoppers, and some times it is hard to have them fully trained and aware of the store's merchandise and policies. Also, we have to replenish merchandise"
good,"• Use decision-support computer software programs to respond to common customer work/service order inquiries and requests."
good,The experience gained within this company helped me grow in numerous ways. I have no complaints regarding the company.
good,"Love working here as a part time associate.  Very flexible with my schedule, and the employees and management are great people."
good,"I truly appreciate this position. The managers listen to issues and handle them quickly. Any type of training is done so thoroughly so that workers are aware of what to do and able to do tasks completely and efficiently. A typical day consists of pulling orders using a standing picker, sometimes fifty feet high in the air, completely OSHA certified with safety harnesses, etc. A fairly fun and reliable job. Hours are hard to come by, since it is technically a part time flex position. Sometimes they schedule you zero hours, yet they have an automated text/phone call system that informs you of shifts that are in need of being filled. Typically I am able to take on three extra shifts per week."
good,great team work any time anybody needs help with something we all help. we all work together to keep store looking clean and orginized. managment is really good also they help with what they can weather its a customer or one of the employees.
good,"Some days I would help with shipping, but most of the time I was on the sales floor either helping customers or just doing side work. Management was the nicest people and co-workers were young and outgoing. There was really no hard part to the job. The most enjoyable part of working there were the employees and management."
good,"A typical day there is standing on your feet all day picking items and packing, I learned the job can be very stressful but not ever job is hard. The management is very friendly they help out as best as they can. Some of the co workers are a little rude, some don't speak English which is really frustrating but its a friendly environment. the hardest part of the job is walking almost 10x a football field."
good,"A typical shift was 8-12 hours. There were daily meetings at the start of the shift to fill in the workers about our daily quotas, possible new methods to be implemented, how well we've worked, and general information the supervisors felt was imperative for everyone to know about previous, current, and future production."
good,I loved working her it was very fun to meet new people and to help them and make them smile all within the same day that could be a team member or a customer.
good,"Working with Kohl's was a wonderful experience, and everyone work as a team to get things done and accomplish. I learn plenty of things and help my communication skills to improve."
good,Kohl's really is a GREAT company to work for.  Management is very understanding and not overbearing.  They have great advancement opportunities.  They treat their employees very well.
good,I worked with a great bunch of people and really enjoyed my time with them. I would still be with this company if my spouse wasn't currently employed there as high management.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"Great environment, great people, great all around service. Definitely in all means a GREAT store."
good,"great co-workers"
good,"My main job at Kohls was the shoe department, but I would often move around to help the other departments and even costumer service. Kohls really taught me about what it means to provide amazing costumer service. My coworkers were often younger than I was so there was the occasional gossip. The hardest part of my day was zoning a lot of departments with limited help, but the most enjoyable part of my day was dealing with costumers and helping them pick out the perfect outfit or the perfect pair of shoes!"
good,"military family friendly, great co workers, always busy, great hrs,"
good,"I worked everyday with a fast pace, I learned working hard for a team pays off. my managers always wanted the most out of me, pushed me to become the best I can be. my coworkers always made it fun, we learned from each other everyday. the hardest part of my job was the hours, I worked hard to get my 40 hours in. I most enjoyed the customer interactions I had they made my job worth every minute."
good,"A typical day at work is stocking the floors, organizing merchandise throughout store, Assisting customers with finding items or concerns they have, answers calls, maintain a safe store from hazards. The co workers are great there. There nothing too difficult to handle. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers and co workers."

Management was very professional and help was and so were my co-workers. The changeling part of this job was dealing with changeling customers. Most enjoyable part was working in a very professional environment.
good,A typical day at work was 4 to 8 hour shifts   I learned different areas of the store.  Management was Great and helpful.  Co-worker was great. The hardest part of my job was trying to persuade customers to open a Kohl's account.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the work atmosphere was like family and everyone was treated fairly.
good,All fun and outgoing co-workers. fun to enter act with customers finding out what they are looking for or if they need help
good,What is great about working at Kohl's is that you do not have time to be bored and you learn many different duties as you help others in different departments. Management helps you to learn new responsibilities and recognizes your potential! What more could you ask? 
good,"As a Point of Sale Associate I was expected to greet customers when the entered the store, check out customers in a friendly and efficient manner. POS Associates were expected to sell Kohl's cards and obtain customer's emails during the check out procedure. "
good,"A typical day at work for me is assisting customers on the sales floor and with purchases, and cleaning up tables and racks of clothing in misses, mens and jrs.  I get along great with all the management and all my coworkers.  I really dont' find any of the job hard.  The most enjoyable part of the work is getting to deal with the customers, i am a people person."
good,"Great people, great work environment. I learned alot of great skills and being apart of management was great! The job was not hard but very rewarding. I enjoyed everything about the job and I'm grateful for the experience."
good,The employees are very nice and care about each other. The management team is nice and usually tries to work with you. It is a fun and exciting place to work. If your not a department head you wont get 40 hours a week. But its great for a part time job. They are flexible with hours and if you request for a day off they will honor it.
good,"a typical day at work was easy going i learned to fold clothes propery. Thaye had great managment, my co-workers were always pleasant and helpful.The job wasnt hard at all,and the most enjoyable part was being able to work alone at my own pace as long as the job was done by the end of my shift."
good,I worked at Kohl's as seasonal staff who stayed on after the holidays. I loved it there as a part time job while finishing High School. Great Management and great people. Very flexible.
good,"Kohl's is a great company to work for, the management (E3) are the best to work for, they keep it fun and aide you to any advancement available.

good,"Great company, great experience, great pay... low pay. I worked for Kohl's for nearly seven years. Had a fabulous district manager who found ways to advance my skills in the district. Fantastic job experience. I had hoped to go work in the buying office, but decided that I couldn't live in Wisconsin, so pursued career opportunities with AT&T."
good,A typical work day is you come in we have a breif meeting telling us what has to be done for the day and than we get straight to work. Ive learned there are lots of hard workers out there and once a goal is set they do as much as possible to get it done. Managment is okay its not great but theycan be very helpful. I would say the hardest part of the job is trying to get done what needs to be done for the day because they set a high standard on what is done by the end of the day. The most enjoyable part is getting to work with people that are fun to be around that makes work a fun place to work.
good,"Clock in, check out my department which is Intimate and Accessories, check 500's room to see where I need to start. Then go back to my fitting room and start cleaning. Afterwards recover my department by doing that i put things where they belong and anything that doesn't belong in my department goes to the 500's room if its so much for me to carry or if I'm with a customer. When I'm not in my department I'm on POS which is the register either men's or misses ."

good,"Finally , I started to work at kohl's on an working with many different type of people, a typical day at kohl's would be checking out the customers making sure they are being fully assisted on everything they needed to know about a product. I learn how to communicate better with customer and how to interact with them as a beauty advisor. The management at this store is great , the managers help the sales associate when they got a problem related to the work they doing. They make sure everything is done the way is supposed to be done and help us get our task done on time, They actually give us a lot of motivation.The hardest part of this job was when i was new because it's was a new environment that i didn't know nothing about. The most enjoyable part for me was working as a beauty advisor because people would actually listen to me and at the end of our conversation about the product and how would it look on them they were really happy and nice to me/"
good,"A regular day at work would normally include fast paced movement and motivation to perform a specific task based on ability and experience, I have learned how to manage my time on a specific task such as packing, you have to make sure everything is correct because your job consists of packing a customers merchandise and preparing it to be shipped to their home, if it is not done correctly than it falls back on you. Overall the supervisors are all really nice and professional people, we all have to work together and they are there to make sure that things get done in a timely professional manner with no setbacks. I would say that the hardest part of the job is going to lunch or break and having to pick up where I left off, I feel that I'm not complete with my task even though I will be returning in 20 minutes to fully complete my task. Throughout the entire day the most enjoyable part is hearing the area supervisor say that we have exceeded our goal for the day, that really makes my day and I feel happy that i was apart of productive team to make this even possible."
good,a typical day would consist of myself bagging purchased items and when i was done i would have to zone.

good,Kohl’s matched what I was asking. Their pay benefits are great. I believe starting pay for Kohl’s is around $15.00 starting out. Every year they have an annual review and that is when you find out what your raise is going to be.
good,"Working at this particular retail store, it provided me with the ability to talk to people every day. As well as gain discounts on clothes and other items I may want."
good,Kohl's is a fun place to work and the management listens to your feedback. I would recommend Kohl's as a fun place to work with advancement in a short period of time if you are interested.

good,With what I said in the review. I view Kohl's as an excellent place to work. I would still be there if not for a stupid mistake. However they did not listen to me as well. This was the first retail job I held. So I did not have any other companies to measure against. Like my wife said I was always a supervisor or manager at my previous jobs.

good,"I really enjoyed working here. It was only a seasonal job so beware if you work a seasonal job they may send out a termination email. I was given no notice that my time of working was up which was bothersome. But overall, everybody is nice there and it's very organized."
good,Kohls was an amazing job . But i’m younger than most of the employees and the job became boring because it wasn’t much customer interaction or coworker interaction . The job is fairly easy and you’ll love every manger you have !

good,Kohl's has been a great for me to work while going through college. Would highly recommend to others. I worked unloading trucks and in store stocking and was treated fairly.
good,"Everyone is extremely nice and understanding. You may get a few costumers that are overly exaggerating and impolite but most of the time you build relationships with customers and it makes them come back and continue their business there. Also the mangers are super nice and very understanding. They get that life sometimes gets in the way. I was given the opportunity to go from cashier to Customer Service representative after a few months of working there. I wasn't ready to be trained to do jewelry not because I wasn't given the opportunity but because I loved my customer service position. The hardest part of the job is when a customer returns an item from over a year ago with no price tag and no receipt and you have to use Main Frame in the back ( if you know how to use it) sometimes it gets a little confusing but eventually you get or you just call for a manager and they will assist you. They also do prizes when we make our quota for the day or when employees compete against each other for credits and rewards. Especially close to holidays for example jeans pass, extra break, snacks, etc."
good,I really liked my job at Kohl's. it was fun and innovative environment with an ever changing day. expect the unexpected was what my manager once told me. The management was nice and gave me opportunities to shine in areas where I felt most comfortable. The best part of my day was seeing the smiles of customers when I helped them with their questions.

The job was fun to interact with the people in town and be able to get to know what people liked around town."
good,There is much room for career advancement with Kohl's. Majority of managers are professional and kind. Many locations so easy to transfer if need be. Friendly atmosphere.
good,"The people I worked with including co workers, managers and directors were just great.

It truly is a wonderful place to work at and an even overall amazing place to create friends.

good,"I started working here in October as a holiday worker and stayed on afterwards to be a regular employee. I often worked nights and when you close you have to clean up the store which can take anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes, so you might have to stay quite late - especially during the holidays. The management would have new sales or coupons but wouldn't always tell the cashiers what or when they were so I would sometimes not know about new deals going on at the time."

I started part/time then went full/time then went misses supervisor then went to the softlines area supervisor.

But I learned a lot about closing and opening and the cash office, not to mention the color coding, recovery, truck unloads, managing many departments with many employees."

There were times where I would be scheduled a light, four hour shift, and there were also times I was scheduled an eight hour shift. There was no telling with the schedule. The majority of my coworkers were all very friendly and hard working, which is great as every department requires you to work together. The management at the time was very kind and motivational! The managers would call for nightly ""meetings"" and give everyone a pep talk to thank us, finish the night strong, and give everyone that little bit of spunk to keep working hard."

We work as a team to run the store smoothly making sure all products are properly priced and readily available.

good,This was my second favorite job. I loved the people I worked with and the constant support from all teams. All the incentives that were offered such as a higher hourly rate for working past a certain time. I worked nights and got hired on seasonally and got asked to stay after the season.

good,"At first, learning the cash register took me a minute, but once I got the system down, it was easy to run and very self-explanatory. My typical day at work, involved going to the office after I clocked in to get a radio, and headphone piece. Then I would go downstairs to the ground level and I was the cashier for one of the main entrances. I would make sure I had everything I needed for the day at the register, and with each customer that walked into the store, I would greet them with a friendly hello and a smile. As the customers who were checking out if they had a reward card or coupons, and if the did not I would offer the rewards card. The same concept would go for a credit card. If they did not have a credit card and wanted to sign up for once I would take care of it at the register."

The work is hard, but very rewarding. I am treated with dignity and respect, and even being a part timer, my ideas matter.

good,"I loved working there it was a fun environment nice co-workers I loved being a cashier there. working at that department store it seems like I was always on my feet and busy instead of just standing around doing nothing. As long as there were customers in the store, there were things to be doing. I also love Kohls because of their great clothes and affordable prices and every time you walk into this store, you were warmly welcomed, so I think it would be a great atmosphere for anyone work in!"

Kohl’s  also Did things to bring their Employees together like pot luck day. It’s Just a great place to work.  I  justwish that they gave you more hours but other than that is a perfect job especially if youjust need a part-time job.
good,"Kohl's was a good place to work, it was my first job out of high school. I really enjoyed the people I worked with, the managers, and the customers. It was just a temporary job for me becuase I was straight out of high school, did not plan on staying there long, since my plan was to finish school and get a job that my degree was in."

good,"Kohl's has a great environment. Everyone is happy there and nice.  I have learned to solicit credit cards to customers along with helping them if they have any questions.  Keeping the store organized and checking out customers at the register.  The hardest part of the job happens on days that the line gets long and the computers for the register go super slow, so that creates some type of pressure.  The most enjoyable part of the job is saving customers money and watching them walk out with a smile on their face."
good,This company is the worst. They feed off of the despair and hate that they create. They are vile bloodsuckers with no human soul or redeemable qualities.
good,"It was over 14 years ago that I worked for Kohl's Department Stores, but  from what I remember it was an amazing, inspiring place to work.  I wish I still worked there now!"

good,great company to work for. never had any problems with managers nor anything else. The workplace would get hectic but you have to know how to handle the situation.
good,Its a great Place to start off your work experience.  The management was great. the work culture was very different per day. The best part was closing making sure the store was looking great for the next morning.

good,I worked here during my senior year I’m high school. It’s not a bad job and they work with your hours which was really important. However they over push their credit card and it would often be stressful to get people to sign up which is one of the only things I hated about the job. The employee discount was actually really great and could be used with sales and coupons which made a really great discount.
good,I felt really safe at this job. It was tedious and sometimes aggravating but it was routine and easy ! Spent most of the days hopping form fitting room to fitting room in every department cleaning up and organizing merchandise. Weekends I may have to hop on a register and answer a few questions for a customer.
good,You can't pay all of your bills working here but the benefits and discounts are great. Fun place to work and there is always something to do to keep you busy. Management is not always on your back if you keep yourself busy.

good,My typical day at work would be working behind the cashier and putting items back where they came from. I learned how to do multiple cashier duties everyday. There are some very rude customers that come by and expect you to know everything so the hardest part to just to keep a smile and be nice.
good,"You clock in report to loading dock manager, you will than learn how to unload and process merchandise. Usually the manager helps on the truck they have a unique way of setting up, keeping up I would say is hard what i thought was the fun part of the job is seeing the new freight come in ."

good,working at khols was my pleasure. this company allow you to wear your own type of clothing. this company also allows you to get discounts. i would definitely refer my friends to work for khols.
good,"I was responsible for my cleaning up department. If I was scheduled during the days since I usually closed I would feel a bit lost.  I do feel like I could have been trained better. The worst part was I would have to give the Jewelry department their break, and although I did get some training I felt as though it wasn't thorough enough or that I was never in there enough to make it easy for me. Aside from that, management was very professional and I respected them."
good,"Wonderful, friendly place to work.  I recommend it to anyone who likes working with the public.   A typical day is to look for the sales promotions going on and making sure that you are prepared to do sales for customers."

good,"They take care of their employees with monthly discounts on certain items which is something that I thought was really generous of the company to do so. They also occasionally provide food, snacks and little treats for their employees which is awesome when you forget to bring lunch."
good,It’s a job perfect for someone that has no previous work experience that’s in high school or just graduated. There are days where there’s a lot of standing around and days where you don’t stop moving.

good,"I enjoyed working at Kohls Warehouse. I love how they take you through training before you start working and then you get paid for training and then once you get through with training you start working. You get paid every Friday and if you want your money to be on a card they can have it where it gets deposited to your card and they also provide a card for you to have during training day. The breaks not as long but it's like 30 minutes of break time and you have breaks like 2 or 3 times a day. I love how you can be able to wear what you want to wear and you can work while playing your music, you'll just have to have headphones and one peace in your ear and the other out of your ear just for safety precautions. I also love how you can work alone or with others and you don't have to worry about no one telling you really what to do, but the only thing is that Kohls Warehouse is not just an easy job, you got to work hard and be strong enough to work because that job requires you to lift and pick up heavy things as well as stack heavy boxes and during the summer its hot and and you're all sweaty and frustrated because of the heat and I'm pretty sure its cold during the winter."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management.

good,"Its very fast paced and always constant work . One great thing about working here , you get to work around people but can also be on your own . I loved the pay ."
good,A typical day was waking up at 5am to be to work at 7am. going around the store to make sure correct sale signs were up for that day setting new graphics around the store dressing mannequins also helping jewelry when they needed help and cover the front end supervisor when they had meetings and breaks. also helped out with ship from store and buy on line pick up in store ever chance I  had. also helped with merchandising. hardest part I would say was always being there go to and helping so much sometimes it would set me back in my own work but when the store owner needs you you go. I love retail honestly and I love interacting with people
good,Kohl's was a FAMILY and made you feel special and so welling to help anyone. Limited hours so they let the seasonal employees go without any notices. sad

good,I was only a seasonal worker so I was there for about a month. It was my first job and my favorite place to work. If they would of kept me past the seasonal I would never of had a different job.
good,"I really liked working for kohl's, the management, associates treated everyone like family, the hours were manageable, you had options to move up the ladder in management, and the discounts the store provided."
good,great place to work great management work place culture great everyone willing to teach you and work with your schedule. the most enjoyable is helping people
good,khols is a great place to work they get a raise .50 every 90 days and offer great training with different skills they offer great opportunities within the company to move up the letter
good,"Absolutely an amazing company to work for. Fun, fast paced career and great opportunity for advancement. "
good,"A typical day was pretty chill"
good,This was a great place to work. Very busy all the time and great coworkers. The holiday season was long and with Black Friday sales it did keep you away from doing family things at times
good,I personally worked in Home and Kids. My job was seasonal. I loved the environment. The managers were awesome and so were the co workers. They are very good about breaks.
good,"i love working at kohl s because it feels like a family and its very friendly and the customers will tell us that they feel at home, work cashier and occasionally the floor or omni fulfillment (online shopping) love the culture at kohl s and how we treat our customers, i honestly cant say enough about how great kohl s is."
good,Nice people to work with. Very slow paced before the holidays start. After that hours pick up and so does the crowd of customers. Could make some decent money a few weeks before Thanksgiving and after Christmas.
good,I learned a lot at Kohl's. There was always a challenge dealing with customers. It brought me out of my shell and made me more of an outgoing person. I was always busy and I was always willing to work in other departments.
good,great co workers fun environment fast paced very busy which makes time fly by while listening to good music not to mention the difereent customers you meet
good,"i worked 7am-5pm maybe 3 days a week, i was part time, the workplace was great the hardest part of the job was to keep your points up but i always managed to keep them up."
good,I loved working R.E.D at Kohls wish it wasn't a seasonal thing I would have loved to stay and do that job I would never quit if I had that job! Would defiantly do it again
good,High energy workplace with a large customer base. Constant contact with customers. Close attention to details of the stores appearance Large need of knowledge of store products and sales..
good,The entire experience at Kohl's was enjoyable. You are able to work in any area and learn different aspects of each department. I enjoyed working with the ad set team.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I enjoy working at Kohl's it was a fast pace environment, would like better if instead of working more days and less hours, to work longer hours and less days."
good,"I personally loved everything from Kohls. The management the work load, coworkers, everything! You would think that working at a branch that's being supervised by HR on the 3rd floor would make this job more stressful but that was not the case. I worked at the one in Bella Terra Huntington Beach, CA and would most definitely recommend anyone a job there. Wish the pay was a bit better, but that's how all retail companies are with their starting pay unfortunately."
good,this was an awesome experiance and fun and easy. it was fast paced but one of the easiest jobs i could have asked for. i would have tried to stay on but had other things to do
good,"Interesting work, a company that promotes from within, growth opportunities for entry-level employees, nice coworkers, good management, convenient location."
good,"The managers and employees are great and are extremely helpful to the customers as well as each other. typical days have moderate amounts of customers that come through, not too many to overwhelm you, but not too little to bore you. Management is extremely nice and helpful to all employees."
good,"Kohl's department store is a very friendly work environment, with a flexible work schedule that suits all our associates. They are very understanding if you go to school or any other problem we may have, they are very helpful. customers are very friendly and our customer service skill makes everyone feel at home."
good,"The typical day at work is a 10 hour shift full with amazing coworkers who all wants to meet the goal. We all work hard, and play hard as well. This job was an amazing learning experience, and I do not intend on leaving anytime soon."
good,Kohls was a great place to work at I was only there for a seasonal position but I would have love to stay on as part-time I love working with new people and learning new policies and getting trained in more than one area of the store
good,I enjoyed working for Kohl's.  They truly try to have a work/life balance.  The benefits were good. They were very good to me.  The discount is great too!
good,I met fun and energetic people at working regarding my co-workers and/or customers. Kohl’s was a great work area to work in. It was also my first year experience for retail
good,"good management, good team work, good hours, i learned a lot of work from kohl's, helpful people, fair managers, and good place to work and learn, part and full time available."
good,Kohl's is an awesome place to work. The management team was always on the floor willing to lend a helping hand. The associates all treat each other as though they are family which makes a days worth of work so much easier.
good,This was one of the only warehouse jobs I loved working at and was excited when I was called back. It was very insightful being able to see what customers were picking out.
good,"I loved volunteering here, I got the opportunity to work well with children. I learned to work as a team as well as an individual. Its a great place to work."

good,It was a fun job over Christmas break. Around the holidays it was very busy and always something to do but after Christmas was over things slowed down a lot. Everyone was very nice to work with and they customers were fun to help.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,Kohls is a great job for part time or full time. Many different departments and oppurtunites to grow allow for a fun and diverse workplace. Apply here if you enjoy fast paced work
good,"Good day and or night, learn to pick items for shipping. on my feet between 8 to 10 hours. great workers and management. environment and locations was good."

good,"Love love love Kohl’s! Management is so much fun and positive to be around, along with most of the employees! It’s a strategic job, which I love. We’re all one big family!"
good,this job was easy i stood in one spot and packed boxes the people were nice. it was very clean. it was also very goal oriented. taking time of when needed is not a problem
good,I really enjoy the work atmosphere because it's so easy to get along with everyone. Management was nice and they always encouraged and acknowledged us. As a cashier you usually hear bad stories but even the customers are nice. Of course you deal with a few bad ones but overall the experience is wonderful.
good,"Never assume that you are golden...even though I was fast tracking to management training, just one or two lapses in judgment caused me to lose a job I valued and enjoyed.  I lost out to people who had no desire to continue or grow with the company.  I understand why I was terminated, but I don't think I was given an opportunity to rectify a behavior, indeed, I never even realized I had overstepped boundaries.  Unfortunately, Kohl's lost a dedicated employee and I lost an amazing opportunity for growth."
good,I loved it there wonderful managers and supervisors who enjoy the community while I was there they push alot of credit applications to help the corporation
good,Kohls is a Great workplace. They always have tasks on hand. Extremely motivated store that sustains a clean and presentable work environment and garenteed customer satisfaction.
good,"Great hours, benefits, and recognition for it's employees. They really do strive for greatness with their employees as well as providing excellent service to their customers."

good,I liked working at Kohl's because it has a very nice work environment and Kohl's treats its employees very well. They are very understanding and flexible with hours.
good,Kohls provides a great work life balance. Provide clear expectations of your role and give you ample time to accomplish it. Overall the best company I have ever worked for.
good,Retail environment is so great. Taking care of customers and restocking all clothes and merchandise. Seeing all new products and items that are new to the store and corporations.
good,"The only thing I really disliked, as in they should've mentioned this during the job interview, was the MANDATORY OVERTIME. I do not appreciate, nor do I think it's fair to have that forced upon us. It's bad enough sitting for 9 hours, so here, you have to work 4 more hours a week."
good,While working here it was a fast pace store but that was because it was the Christmas season and then after there was a lot of returns and a lot of cleaning up the floors around this time but it was a fun place to work.
good,Very happy and impressed with the direction of this company. My only reason for leaving was an experience to work for my old district manager at Kohls who left to work for Gordmans. Would recommend Kohls highly.
good,"Great job , great hours, location, hourly wage, and over time, holiday pay. Friendly staff and light work loads. Holiday incentivities.  Easy pay from check card ."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management.

good,its a great place to work everyone is really friendly. the mangers are really nice and they will work with you. you get a lot of hours around the holiday.

good,It was a great experience at Kohls. I had a great time working there. It was the best job experience I ever had. I would definitely work there again.I would also recommend Kohls to anyone.
good,Nice place to work. Flexible shifts and flexible work environment. Kohl's offer great deals for associates and customers and is always looking for ways for their customers to return.
good,"Lots of independent work, customer service skills needed as well as friendly attitude and motivation to do well. Employees are expected to pull their own weight and sign up customers for Kohl's Charge and Rewards programs. Friendly work environment with headstrong employees and management."
good,staff was great management where great and open to the team wonderful part-time job great rewards and store benefits clean and friendly environment really peaceful well organized place of business great hours and part-time job
good,"A typical day would be working in the ATS and finding experienced  csr to work for the company. I would also do phone screens,  set up interviews  for that department."
good,Managers are cool. Nothing about the job was hard. As long as you know how to fold clothes and check people out at the register you should be okay. They are very strict on how many credits you get so make sure you ask customers if they have a Kohls credit card.
good,Ive worked at kohls for a little over a year now and its one of the easiest jobs i had. You can ask to be crossed trained so you don't lose interest at work.
good,Overall they have great employee discounts but a strict sales goal policy. It can be stressful. But it can also be a lot of fun. The team to me was about ranks. It is all about how you carry yourself.
good,great team building environment. There is plenty of room to grow in the company. everyone is willing to teach you what ever you want to learn. Friendly atmosphere.
good,"The managers at Kohl’s truly care about you, and the hours are great. I really enjoyed working at Kohl’s, and would strongly recommend it to anyone else."

good,"I loved working at Kohls warehuse, it was great exercise, great people and managemant. If I ever needed any help there was always someone available to assist me. It was competative but we all also worked together to get the overall job done."
good,The atmosphere is a wonderful family oriented place to work. The supervisors and associates were friendly  and respectful people to work with. The hours I was scheduled accommodated my first shift job in which I worked 40+ hours per week.
good,Different shifts for part-time employees. loved working here. Had a great relationship with co-workers and managers. was always fun at all times while getting work done.
good,Kohls is a great place to work for. The management is great and so are the co workers. Even helped me out when I messed up my foot so I could still work. Want to go back so badly.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,It  was great experience for seasonal i  learned that there is really team work there it was a great experience to work there because i was a Constance moving and there was no time to sit down and relax you always stayed busy
good,"Everyone is super friendly, and there is never a dull moment. The atmosphere is electric to me, and I can't get enough of it. The only thing that could make my job at Koh's better would be more hours."
good,"Very organized company"
good,"Working for Kohl's is not a easy job, although it always keeps you moving. The greatest satisfaction for me is knowing a customer is leaving with having a good experience. Although it does get tough because Kohl's is a popular store, you're never done working. Whether it is fixing a rack, tables and the fitting room there is always something to do. Most of the time there is a time limit and you might not be finished with cleaning your department and the managers understands and they make sure that you get all the help that you need even if that mean them helping out too. Kohl's provides the chance to work in every area in the store, all you have to do it ask and you can advance your Kohl's career. Working for Kohl's you are part of a team."
good,"Work everyday with a smile on your face, it makes a difference to all the employees and customers in the store. be friendly and informative. Hardest part: finding stock in the back rooms in a timely manner, Most Enjoyable: Working with the customers and answering questions about products."
good,Make sure if you are going to have music to always wear wired earbuds with one ear free so you can hear someone yelling at you. I like the breaks included.
good,Kohl's hired me as a seasonal worker for the holidays although they didn't keep me on the team cause holiday season was ending they decided to let me go hopefully I'll be working there some day again thank you Kohls
good,"Associates are hands on friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers, however it is important to stay calm and answer appropriately. The background music is upbeat and the closing team works together."
good,I love working at Kohls but they never gave me enough hours nor was the pay great.  If they gave more hours to employees and offered full time positions it would be great
good,"It was a seasonal job, but I'd definitely go back to Kohl's. Great place to work. They have goals to meet as a cashier for obtaining new credit accounts."
good,"It's a nice place to work, i have never had any problems working there. The managers listen and understand and it's average pay with a decent discount you can use on any sale."
good,"I joined the Kohl's team as part of Seasonal but at the end of the holidays they decided to keep me on the team. I work on the sales floor as an MJM Associate and on truck days as Freight, I earn $9/hr but don't get very many hours in the week. Kohl's is very open to hiring different types of people no matter what disabilities they might have. I really enjoy how everyone who I work with does their duties but is still relaxed and joke around like family. Customers really range, some are very tough to deal with but the managers are extremely good at calming the angry customers down and making them happy again, some customers are great and fun to help out. My only complaint working here is the low hours, I'm lucky if I get 20 hours a week. But the managers do what they can to give me as many hours as possible, calling me in if they have a shift open. Applying was super easy, got an email the same day I sent in my application, setting up an interview and orientation date is all online quick and easy, very basic questions asked in the interview. Overall I'm very happy I applied at Amarillo's Kohl's."
good,"Kohls is a great place to work , You will learn alot of different skills.You also will get to work in different areas of the store.There is plenty to do when your at kohls especial shop."
good,Working at khols was very fun because i was only hired temporarily for the holidays. I worked with alot of different people and dealt with alot of different customers.
good,"loved working with them"
good,"Great co workers, great managers, fast paced, great pay, easy going people, flexible hours, training, place for advancement, overall it's a great place to work you get discounts."
good,"Fast paced,friendly, and good hours. Took care of employees and was a pleasant place to work. Enjoyed working with freight. Advanced in my position quite quickly as a young employee."
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,good work place good people to work for fast pace job not so much hard work good lunch breaks pay great paid time of they have good benefits for people work for them
good,"Retail is retail, has its ups and downs. The only issue was the work-load at times. Being a perfectionist in retail leaves a lot on your shoulders. Overall great staff and people. Flexible hours and GREAT discounts."

good,"With this job you must obtain so many sign ups for credit cards, and with each credit card you get so much commission. This job teaches you how to set a goal and to be competitive against others stores by reaching you goal. The environment is clean and the coworkers are very friendly. The management system is great as well, as they will work with you and your schedule."
good,I would recommend this job to anyone. It was an amazing opportunity to get to work with such kind considerate people. I felt like they were my family. They all make you feel so welcomed.
good,i      liked working here. it was fast paced and things get boting from timr to time. thank you for asking                          fgdfgdfgdfdfdgdfgd
good,"Most of my experience was very enjoyable."
good,"great place to work , enjoyed my time here, they help you out when you can, hours were a little bit suspect at times but they give it to you.  when you ask"
good,"This was my first retail job and I learned a lot there. They are all about team work. Management was amazing, there was not one manager I didn't enjoy working under. Most enjoyable part of the day was the end of the day and seeing what you and your co-workers accomplished. The hardest part of the day was cleaning out dressing rooms and trying to find where every item is supposed to go."
good,"The people I surround myself with are awesome. They are fun, hardworking and great to be around.There are no Cons for working at Kohls that are not Cons for working anywhere else."
good,If you have ever worked retail it is your typical retail job. You have to assist customers and provide good customer service . Team work is key to running the store efficiently.
good,"A typical day at work included going on the sales floor and talking to customers, working in the back room (stocking merchandise), and picking up items from the floor for online orders."
good,Working for Kohl's I have I have learned how to be good at customer service being a cashier learning different positions have taught me how to please others
good,I liked kohls it was a good working envirment . I was a seasonal at Kohl’s packing associate I liked the discounts . I liked the free lunches and it was nice
good,"People  I work with are great.  Friendly and fun atmosphere."
good,"The average day includes working with customers to resolve misunderstandings or inconveniences by expediting transactions for either exchange or return of merchandise. Additional tasks as assigned are normal but not frequent. When not engaged with customers it is the responsibility of the associates working in the customer service area to complete clearance markings of returned goods and to counter damage those items which can be sold at a greatly discounted value. There is a great deal of teamwork focus in the workplace, especially with the closing crews, and everyone helps the other members as they can. The hardest part of customer service can be when dealing with especially belligerent customers but usually the situation can be passed to management for a more definite conclusion. Some of the enjoyable aspects are the frequent pizza days for meeting company credit goals and the ever present volunteer opportunities that are given through the Associates in Action initiative."
good,very nice people that worked there everyone worked as a team love the rewards we get as an associate faced paste environment a lot of different departments to choose from.
good,I Enjoyed working at kohls. it was a great experience and all other coworkers where very nice to work with. I would recommend to another person if they like working with kids or clothing.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,"I love working at Kolh's. Kolh's is a great team to be apart of,they are very caring and understanding that life happens. This company is a great family away from family."
good,"A typical work day is helping customers and answering their questions, cleaning out the fitting and putting back the returns. The evening shifts focus more on recovering the department making it look clean and presentable for the next morning which is the hard part to do if you are closing alone. Everyone at Kohls is helpful and if you are struggling to finish, management will help you with what you need."
good,Kohls was a great experience. I would come in to work and do some physical work which would be offloading the merchandise and preparing it for it to go on the floor. Then after I would check out the inventory make sure everything is properly assorted and then I would overlook the stock room.
good,I really had alot of fun at Kohl's made alot of new friends learned new things about online shopping the breaks was cool lunch was great and the people where nice.
good,It is a great place to work if you are a high school student or a college student who doesn't have many bills or don't need much income. Their pay rate is not for people who have a family to provide for.
good,Kohl's was such a great experience for me i wish i could've stayed but i could not unfortunately. All of the managers are great people to work for and the team over all is great to work with. They help teach you in everything you need to know.
good,it was a good place to work for someone that wants a part time job. they only give you less then 20hr per week. it was a good job during the holidays so that you can get employee discount.
good,"I was a Mens, Juniors and Misses associate. I worked as a cashier when needed and interacted with customers regularly. I was one of many employees in this department was was whiling o work wherever I was needed."
good,A typical night at Kohl's for me would be pulling stock from the back and replenishing the shelves. Organizing company inventory and making sure the store is in perfect condition for shoppers.
good,I would defently work there again very nice job it always brought me good money its surrounded by good people that are wroking as well and the hours and very good
good,"great environment just low amount of hours."
good,"Nice place to work, Worked in several departments on both first and second shift. Would go back if I could get into office. Many perks, voluntary time off, paid vacation. decent pay per hour."
good,Working for a large retailer who has a strategic corporate culture is very refreshing. Weekly strategy meetings are inspiring to continue to strive and do our best.
good,"the work day at kohl's was either laid back or fast pasted, if anything kohl's humbled me. my managers were easy to work with, and the workplace was fun. the hardest part of the job was the customers and the most enjoyable was the customers who made your work day better."
good,I loved working at Kohl's. It was jus an overall fun and energetic work place to be at. the associates and the managers made the days so fun it didn't feel like I was at work sometimes. I can really tell that Kohl's cares about its employees. They was always doing things for the employee's and just wanting to make sure that Kohl's employees was treated just as well as the guests that walked through the doors.

good,"Kohl's is an amazing company to work for they are fair and listen to feed back, they have a great training program. I have always worked at speciality store and I was worried about working for such a big store but I love and could not be happier."
good,I love working at Kohl's! The teamwork is awesome and all of the employees get along great! I have brushed up on my selling skills with the help of the supervisors and coaching on key words. My manager always makes sure the employees get recognition for their hard work! There is no hard part of my job.
good,"kohls was amazing to work for,great friendly enviorment and great staff,you really learn a lot from customer service and the people you work with are fantastic,managers are very friendly and teach you alot."
good,My review on Kohl's is that it's truly a wonderful place to work at. Everyday I worked alongside great people and the work environment was sensational
good,Working at Kohl's as a seasonal associate was different. Learned a lot of new tasks that I did not know. The managers were extremely nice and they know what they want and know how to ask employees how to do their job without sounding harsh.
good,Putting out merchandise is typical day if I'm not doing fitting rooms. Learn something new everyday. Management is great and getting to people is the most enjoyable.
good,"I loved working at Kohl's because everyone got along. The environment was so relaxing and peaceful and most importantly, the store manager and the mangers for other departments were kind and nice. The communication was great and even the customers could tell how the employees enjoyed working there."

good,"A fun yet hardworking enviorment, you'll meet some of your closest friends, they have amazing communication skills and there are always people there to help"
good,It was a very good paying job to work making 13hr was so good... They had plenty overtime even after season was a three times a week shecudal was good paying money ... Always had extra days to work
good,"When it comes time to work, I don't play no games I get straight to work.all you got to do is show me one time how to do something and after that I'll have what ever it is down pat. I love working and makeing money."
good,"Its a fast paced,friendly environment. Plenty of diversity among the coworkers. Shifts are normally 10 hours with 2 breaks and you have little supervision, so the expectation for you to accomplish your task is high. I learned plenty about self-sufficiency and how to break my work up to get the most done. The hardest part about the job is you have to find work to do, so there is plenty of chances to mess up. However it is your responsibility to stay on task. The most enjoyable part the job is that you can listen to your music."
good,"Kohls is an amazing place to work, I love it! I get good pay and great hours. My schedule varies throughout the weeks which always keeps me on my toes."

good,we come in gather around in a circle everybody introduce themselves then we stretch then get something to drink then its time to go to our spot to work
good,I learned great communication skills and how to make things work even if you didn't think it was very possible. The lack of availability to move up hurt my chances to want to stay there very long.

good,Kohl's is a wonderful place to work. It teaches you how to be responsible and helps with decision making.You also learn how to enhance your interacting skills with customers and staff.
good,Kohl's is a great company to work for if you like to work hard but be able to leave it at the door of the office and enjoy your life outside of work. The working culture is extremely collaborative. All of the members of the buying team sit in the same cube which was specifically designed to enable teamwork. Most of the promotions in the buying offices are internal so there is a great career path.
good,This is a warehouse job. However the outside feels this is exactly how the building will feel. This is a place to learn new things and meet new people. I worked through the temp service so my assignment was ended. If I could go back I would.
good,depends on the day it can get really busy or it can be really slow at times working with others is amazing I have learned to work on a register. the most hardest part of the job is on my leg the non stop walking is hard on me but I can do it if I need to the most enjoyable part of the job is when we do really good they feed us as well
good,Loved this job. Ended up meeting some of my close friends here. Had a lot of fun with the staff and joked around a lot. Most managers are laid back if you do your job.
good,Working at kohls can often times get overwhelming. Do expect to go above and beyond your call of duty.

good,"On a typical work day i would clock in and immediately go to the cash register that i was assigned to that day and begin to ring up the customers items.

good,"Managers and associates work closely to provide a YES WE CAN attitude.  "
good,"Exciting place to work,great management team, a typical work day for was how I consumed my time and kept busy, the workplace culture was very nice, because the most important they focused on was safety, the hardest part of the the job was the training, cause the trainees didn't listen to what I was teaching them, the most enjoyable was environment and the people I worked with."
good,"I learned to do a lot of different positions at work from cashier, fulfillment, replenishment, price changes, etc. I enjoy all my coworkers and it's such a great environment to work in."
good,Loved the job because when arrived at designated work time u had fun and worked hard that next thing I knew I was time to go home.  They trained exceptionally well
good,Working at Khol's was a pleasant experience. I worked in the back room where we unloaded the trucks. The day would mostly consist of just an assembly line of unloading the boxes from the truck to unpacking and organizing the merchandise while being able to talk and chat with co workers. The goal would be to empty the whole truck before the shift was over. some days we didn't finish so some of us would stay late to finish while others leave if they needed/wanted to. you were never forced to stay late if you didn't want to. We'd get one break in the middle of the six hour shift. The supervisor of the team was very pleasant and friendly along with the other employees. Everyone was polite and helpful especially with showing you how to do things. The hardest part of it all was the heavy lifting and the fact that the shift started at 5am. Waking up at 4am to go to work is rather tough. The most enjoyable thing though was the people and flexibility. If you needed days off you could get them very easily.
good,Great job not enough days to work and didn't pay enough. Breaks are short and they rarely hire you full time. Not a long term job for some one with a family.
good,"This is my first time working retail and I found it to be interested and rewarding at the same time."
good,great place to work i loved management i loved what i did but i didnt like the pay for me being a supervisor. sometimes communication would get lost. still not a bad place
good,"Great discounts to employees very often. Very nice employees, helpful and great place to work. They have a lot of employees and do not give their part timers very many hours sometimes."
good,"Working at the register, greeting customers daily. The management is good, it generally varies like any typical job. I love working here, very diverse!"
good,They give great discounts it sucks because it was a temp position. They were still building on the warehouse  so that call backs werent coming back for six months so unfortunately I had to seek continued employment.
good,"if Kohl's would hire me I would work there. overall it is a nice facility, full of work and the pay is worth it. they provide coffee for the sleepy heads...which always comes in handy."
good,Working for Kohl's has been a very rewarding experience.  There is nothing the management won't teach you unless you don't want to learn.  My fellow employees are kind and giving.  We all work as a team to get our goals completed.  Scheduling is a major plus for busy families.  The only thing that is a negative personally for me is that hours are not consistent.

Customers can be grouchy, but your team will understand. You have to sell credit and they REALLLYYY push it to sell to customers and to sign yourself up for a card. You get a 0.50 cent incentive for each card you sell. They train you and make sure you know what you're doing, and I've been really appreciative for this experience."

I have learned a lot from Kohl's such as using technology, the Bluebird in Kohl's case, to operate many of the primary tasks in the store. This includes helping customers locate merchandise, replenishing merchandise on the sales floor, locating and shipping merchandise, etc. There are not many tasks at Kohl's that are hard but rather take practice and dedication to perfect the task. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that I am doing my job correctly and thus providing the best customer service I can to the company."
good,"It was really easy job. I managed to find a way to entertain myself during the work process and managed to get work done and made time go by quickly. Kohl's allowed employees to use their iPods, I would listen to music and sing to it."

good,"•	Perform cash transactions for customer purchases"
good,"I like working at Kohl's, but I do believe my time there is finished I been there a few years learned alot of costumer service! A typical day there is greating and assisting costumers in anything they need and maintaining the store. At every place you have to take in the good with the bad with the co workers, I was lucky enough to make awesome friends and leaders from there! hardest part of the job would be working on the sales floor by yourself once people called out"
good,this was a great starting job for me because the people who worked there were friendly and i also liked the fact that it wasn't too hard. I also loved my managers because they are really understanding.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management.

good,"Kohl's company motto is to inspire and empower families to lead fulfilled lives, and I believe they met those goals.  The people that work at Kohl's are among the industrys best.  Kohl's dedicates large amounts of time to find the 'best fit' candidates so it has successful transition planning for multiple positions.  Kohl's also is an innovator when it comes to advancing into sales operations, to stay competitive in this new age retail landscape.  Great Company that takes care of you."

good,"The hardest part of this job was standing 8-10 hours, but it was very exciting knowing that my skills would be helpful. Protecting assets from perpetrators and profiling everyone who walked in through the door was my duty everyday. it was a great fun job, which is why I got my license."
good,Kohl's was a very fast past job. It was work at your own paste and you monitored your own break and tasks while at work. The store was kept clean and the fitting room was cleaned by sales associate. At the end of your shift if your area was clean you could leave

good,"Everyone is very nice and its a flexible environment. Management hears you out and aids you if you need extra help. You learn to work well with others,"
good,"Kohl's is a very enjoyable company to work for.  My management is great and are easy people to get along with.  A typical work day for me includes anywhere from 6-8 hours a day, about 20-30 hours a week.  I am very knowledgeable about most positions at Kohl's except for the jewelry department.  I am depended upon heavily when it comes to working truck days and merchandising things.  A lot of the time I will usually work point of sales or customer service.  Working at Kohl's I have come to enjoy the sales aspect of working. For the majority of my co-workers, they are pretty great people and know the job just as much as I do which makes it easy to get along with them too.  Management makes sure we know what we are doing before they schedule us on certain positions in the store.  I would say the hardest part of my job at Kohl's is the customer's who aren't happy.  But as time goes on, I have learned the best ways possible to handle unhappy customers and how to satisfy them. The most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers and making customers smile.  The more a customer smiles by my greeting or just talking to them, the review for me looks good and whomever else is around me.  I have actually worked in two different locations for Kohl's and both locations have been fantastic.  (Lawrence, KS, and Independence, MO)"
good,"i loved working here. the management was great! and the employees were very helpful to me knowing i was a new associate. teamwork was definitely very important here, and i would definitely be willing to work here again."
good,I really enjoyed working at Khol's. It is a great environment to work in delivering customer service. I would definitely work for the company again if given the opportunity.
good,"As a part-time job, flexibility in scheduling was just right. Assigned specific department responsibilities with clear expectations. Supportive co-workers and management. Encouraged to train for all areas of the store.  Customer satisfaction is key to the success of the store.  Employees are appreciated and rewarded on a regular basis."
good,They gave me plenty of hours they treated me fairly and I would have loved to work here longer if they paid more. My typical day consisted of customer service checking customers out and putting away recovery items. I loved that the paychecks were weekly but they need to raise their minimum wage!
good,This was my first job good company everyone was friendly only worked there for seasonal but I would definitely work there again.
good,"Typical work day required you to gather the returns from the customer service area, and return them to the floor. You also need to make sure that the floor is cleaned and the shelves are stocked correctly."
good,Kohls is a great place to work in. they work around your schedule as needed. they have amazing management. they care about there employees. they become like a second family.
good,Management and employees are very friendly and understanding of what you can and can't do. Management is friendly but when needed to the do their job the right way.
good,"Kohl's is a great company to work for. They have flexible scheduling and great Associate discounts throughout the year. All of my co-workers work hard to maintain company standards and the managers are forward thinking and always available if you need help. Being in a position where my work gets immediate feedback and directly affects people's shopping experience is a great way to test your resolve and your people skills. As a customer service representative, I constantly interact with people of all different temperaments and some can be a little difficult at times. But, to counter  that, when you've been able to bring about a satisfactory conclusion, you are the first to see how that positively impacts the customers."
good,Great Company to work for. Fast pace and learn something new everyday. Great Management Team and co-workers. I have been with Kohl's for over 9 years.  I enjoy helping customers and my co-workers
good,"As a sales associate in the housewares department, I spend most of my days in that section of the store. I do anything from putting merchandise away, returning items that were returned to their rightful places multiple times a day, keeping my area clean, changing prices on objects, and so much more. I learned how to use a cash register my second day on the job so that I am ready to backup when needed. I also learned to manage my day and decide when my breaks are needed, as they are not taken at designated times. Management is amazing and very understanding, especially of new employees who have lots of questions. The co-workers are very helpful in teaching me things that I do not know how to do or do not know what they are. The hardest part of the job is definitely being on your feet for roughly 6-8 hours, with only a 15 minute break if you work 6 hours, or 2 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch if you work 8 hours. It definitely takes getting used to. My feet are still aching every day after roughly a month of working there, but it's worth it and they're getting better. The most enjoyable part of the job is making friends and the appreciation you get when you help customers to find items they are looking for. It doesn't always happen, but when it does, it makes it totally worth it."
good,Kohls taught me how to deal with irate customers and deescalating a situation. A typical work day was assisting kohls customers with making online orders and checking rewards points. Management was amazing! Saw potential in me and gave me the tools i needed to be successful. Co-workers became friends and quickly became family. Hardest part was learning the ropes but eventually was easy as pie. Most enjoyable part was my whole experience! Will always love KOHLS!
good,Always something to keep you busy. Perform different tasks every day. Management is excellent. Staff is very helpful. Its always about teamwork here..

Co-workers make the experience a whole lot better, they are the people who make your  working at Kohl's fun and productive. i have learned so much from both management and co-workers who have been there longer than i have, from operating our walkies to operating the register. The people in the store are what makes Kohl's, Kohl's."

I have learned how to prioritize and get my work done independently and with other associates. My co-workers are one of a kind. The level of professionalism allows the work to be done efficiently and correctly. Management oversees our progress and gives the recognition deserved and gives us the opportunity to do the same for each other.

Former co-workers were easy going and helpful; making it easier to learn and adjust at the workplace.  The hardest part of the job was at the end of the day when the job required cleaning of the very large store.  Large messes were compiled throughout numerous departments of the store and cleaning them up could sometimes be time consuming.

good,"A typical day at Kohl's would just be me Assigning tasks and getting on equipment to work on special projects, clean up or case pull. What I have learned at Kohl's is to access tasks, drive equipment, learn fundamentals of the company and assist others. My co-workers who I work with in my department are the best I have ever had and would not trade them in. We all get alone and work together.
