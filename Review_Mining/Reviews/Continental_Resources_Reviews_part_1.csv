rating,review
bad,"100 percent the whitest company in Oklahoma. No color in management. They treat minorities like they're less than, and different rules apply. They want you to work endless hours meeting their deadlines while ensuring you are paid the bare minimum. Beware!"
bad,"Management was not interested in training employees."
bad,"Humiliating work environment, poor supervision and management, did not look out for employees basic well bein, did not support efforts to be a team and share ideas, everyone out for themself."
bad,"Poor Management, Zero Diversity, Lack of Vision.  You should be concerned that the CEO is old and owns 70% of the stock.  All decisions go through hime including the most minute, like what coffee is provided to the staff.."
bad,"I worked there and these other people writing reviews, are not being truthful. I worked in sales and they don't have a good understanding"
bad,"Good to keep yourself busy while looking for another job. "
bad,"Depending upon role and position, many positions expect salaried employees to work huge number of hours and require travel over 50% of the time which is not agreeable for most employee's home life."
bad,"Hired with the understaning of my vacation would be my first week of employment was met. Waing for delivery trucks. Unload packages and place on racks for labeling -which is clueless to me about this function. SAP was the software to learn to process all matrerial. The software was completely difficult to learn and my boss was even worse about  it. He had a history of people leaving this position before me. The company was an open concept warehouse with different grouping of tables to seperate departments.Family owned. Old file cabinets, office partitions, desks and and stained microwaves with matching coffee makers made up this early 80's decor. This company rebuilt used eguipment and lease them out to companys. This company does reach out to alot of large accounts and Continental Resources are very succesful."
bad,this place was bad the bosses wont go to bat for you on anything pay is horrible you will be working for peanuts. when i started there they started me at 10.00 an hour to be a rig hand and when i quit i was only making 14.00 that was over 5 years!!! they took our bonuses away and wanted us to work like 55+ hours a week! and be on call 24/7 without call pay.
bad,The management at the supervisor level was great but his boss made life miserable for everyone including the supervisor. Every supervisor I had complained about him. The money and Benefits were great the schedule was terrible because you were constantly on call.  good luck and God-speed.
bad,There was a lack of training offered at the time. No one other than the other new employees explained to me what I needed to do. HR never explained to me that this wound be a temporary job because they were relocating to Oklahoma City.
bad,Understaffed for activity in quite a few areas.  Constant micromanaging and expanding job roles.  Even mundane design and decision making goes all the way to a meeting with Executive team.  Very few decisions can be made at any level lower than Sr VP.
bad,"If it wasn't for my manager and the role that I had it would of been a great place to work. My manager just played favorites and was very stressful to be around and normally I can handle that with no problem but this was out of control! I have worked this type of position before with no problem and been very successful but he just made it very hard for me and was really demeaning to me, I was really left out of the group. In my mind he was a very poor manager that did not see the good hard work that people did just the lazy ones got the good attention! Just did not get it! Maybe he was intimidated?"
bad,Was put in Montana for a predetermined 6 months. Family medical problems at home. Company would not work with employee.
good,I worked as a daylight consultant for 2 years and as a night consultant for about 4 years before being laid off due to rigs stacking.  Continental energy.
good,"AP is the worst department to work for at Continental. Unless you are a team lead on salary your pay rate is no where near what it should be for the work that you do in that department. The department manager does not stand up for her employees and she allows all other departments to walk all over AP. The AP department often does jobs that should not be done in an Accounts Payable department. The Vendor Relations team has helped to recover millions of dollars owed back to Continental in less than 5 years, but most of the employees on that team can't even get an annual raise of $0.50."
good,"Been employed in the oilfield most of my life,  went back to school when I was 36 years old,  have over 30 years in the oilfield,  15 as a petroleum engineer and drilling supervisor,"
good,"Great place to work but it required one to work 8-5 office hours and over night hours at home since the rigs drill through the night. This became to much to bear since you are always running on 3-4 hours of sleep, weekends and holidays included."
good,"Pay and benefits are great, if you get laid off - severance is minimal, but at least you get something, offices are nice and clean, all my coworkers were awesome, but I felt that the company valued profits over safety (employees)."
good,Pay is good but management will stab you in the back. They have a high turnover rate do to that. Field operators help out a lot and they do not micro-manage.
good,"A typical day at Continental Resources, no were days were the same.  My first manager supervisor was appreciative and supportive.  My last manager was not supportive and reactive to my going to HR with a complaint.  HR did not act on the complaint other than to include me in a round of lay-offs."
good,Crazy but successful company and CEO.  Employment was a revolving door there.  Seemed to bring in talented employees but didn't always keep them.  Very innovative.
good,"Company is a lesser player in the equipment lease, rental, and sales of high tech electronic test equipment.  The biggest deficiencies of the organization is leadership/direction from the leaders at mid levels of management.  "
good,"There's something to be said about founder-led companies.  Leaders tend not to understand when they can depend on others for insight and leadership for the current situation.  "
good,Job had high expectations with very little training.  Benefits and salary where good.  Call outs all hours of the night with very little support for issues.
good,"Maintain and record issues and production, daily. Doing repairs and some maintenance Or oversee higher level maintenance, as roustabouts. Manage oil sales and water disposal by trucks or pipelines."
good,"Typical work day started a 7am and ended at 5 pm.  Learning was mostly done in the first 6 months to a year for me, which included on how to operate a lease location for CLR.  Management was the most difficult part of the job for me to get along with."
good,"If you aren't in an essential department, i.e. geology or exploration, the opportunities are slim. The company operates at a small margin of employees, therefore the promotion opportunities are slim."
good,"Very time censored company. Most days were very quiet and productive.  Good place to work just wished they had a more learning centered, skill sharing environment."
good,Senior operations leadership is strong but support staff was not very developed.Need more top down leadership accountability. Would not recommend this job for someone new to the Oil and Gas industry.
good,In early days was able to learn and get certifications across multiple platforms. Good learning experience in hardware and software in industry leading products.
good,"It was a great first job because they didnt expect you to know everything, but it was not what I wanted to do for life so that's why I left. They care about employees though, I could tell."
good,Management did more gossiping and than work. No team work. Very stressful durning my pregnancy.
good,"Great place to work, but you can expect to wake up several times a night to address Geosteering and a 9 hour work day during the week. "
good,"I worked for ConRes for seven years.  I enjoyed working there and appreciated the connections and partnerships they afford their employees.  "
good,"report to office at 7:00am, attended daily meeting involving pipeline engineers and contractors. Disperse pipe line inspectors based on daily activities."
good,"Organize all vendors for completions activities. Coordinate with all 3rd party vendors to set up wellsite locations with everything needed to accomplish Stimulation and WL activities. Ensure locations are ran safety and efficiently. Hold safety meetings at start of all shifts to ensure needed topics are covered.  Watch over all operations to ensure done as safely as possible while ensuring that jobs are done as closely to engineered designs as possible. Checking that all volumes, weights, and concentrations are followed per company designs. Watch over Wireline operations to ensure done safely and to make sure safety rates are followed and proper cable tensions are not exceeded. Also checking with plug and shot depths to ensure proper placements needed for each zone. Costs for location are tracked with Wellview and are verified before any field tickets are signed. All safety and spill reports are checked over then reported to follow all environmental regulations."
good,Processed invoices on SAP and Oildex system and covered front desk responsabilities. Forwarded processed invoices to Production managers and foreman in office. The Customer service position is fun and kept me busy with the ability to learn more about the oil industry from start to finish.
good,"•	Work closely with consultants to continue the development of the Property Department’s automated reporting in progress as well as any future automated reporting. "
good,"Family run. Owners are really nice and they treat employees very good."
good,Received a fair amount of experience working with fellow engineers. Attended various group meetings of several disciplines. Company seems to truly care about its employees.
good,"It has great pay for the job. I would recommend the job to anyone. I think that the oil market will come back at some point. When that happens, Continental will be at the front of the pack."
good,"I never worked for Continental resources however i was a sub contractor from another company. Continental was great, however, I had to relocate so this is why I quit sub contracting for Continental."
good,This position was a good opportunity to experience the oil and gas industry from the view of an operator. This position encourages field experience to expand the knowledge base of entry level engineers.
good,"Upper management is supportive in reaching individual goals -- especially in regards to high visibility projects.  "
good,"Great place to work. Great people, Great pay, To far away from home, but can be done, Management was great to work for. Safety meetings were great. Got enough time off at home."
good,"Con Res was a great company to work for.  The Management, Sales Managers and the Sales Representatives were very professional, caring and a pleasure to work with. They were very attentive to employee needs and very understanding."
good,Responsibilities included Travel Monday thru Friday to all types of Manufacturing and service locations from company database. Companies included were Harris Aerospace in Melbourne Fl.
good,"I applied in order to get my foot in the door. They are good at hiring people who are entry level, mostly because the compensation is not that good. This allows the pay to not be so great, therefore it makes it a great starting job."
good,Only left due to the prices dropping out and I was considered special projects and therefore expendable. They otherwise take care of their employees and have a safe working environment.
good,"CLR is in its growing stages in a bigger city in OK.  The IT department, which i worked, is struggling to build a stable network environment.  I was responsible for initiating and building the investigative or ediscovery branch a the Company."
good,"Learned the ""Open Wells"" computer program quickly. Superintendents were NO.1. Consultants there are Awesome too. Most enjoyable was interacting with rig personnel and doing reports accurately."
good,"It was a fun place to work, with great benefits, including a gym, health insurance, bonuses and stock."
good,My Typical day consist of Processing Leads to the regional managers.  I also order supplies  for the company and Create PO's.  I work in the Marketing Department and I am training on how to work on Events making sure the items needed for Trade shows and other Meetings get to the destinations.  I will also be involved with making sure the management that are traveling everything will be set up for them.
good,I enjoyed the wide variety of jobs. You always felt like one of the team at Continental Resources. The company kept a person busy and would make sure you had all you needed to get the job done right. Cross training was a large part of there success.
good,I very good privately owned company at which to work.  The people make the company.  The only downside is the amount of travel required for the engineers.
good,"Company just got to big to fast and the mangenment grew to big, other then that its a good place to work, a lot of us feel like we are in the dark about whats going on and only given very little information."
good,"The  only reason I am not working there still is because I moved."
good,"ConRes was a great company to work for. They gave me all the tools I needed to start and grow their very first Business Development internal team. When I needed a tool to increase production, I was given it. They let me bring on talented BDRs that were hand picked and then brought through an elaborate on boarding process."
good,"Learned a myriad of sales, marketing, and reporting skills while employed here.  Worked with major manufacturers in the industry to create sales strategies and manage inventory levels.  Much of the training was done on the job which  created a very functional understanding of sales, marketing, and point of sale reporting."
good,"The company is very good to it's employees.  typical day is correlating, mapping, working with the team, developing drill schedules and plans, presenting to management"
good,The job security is great here and the people are great. They need to learn to adapt to other competitive companies benefits or they will lose their talent pool.
good,Competitive pay for the occupation and a very competent management team. I would recommend anyone who is looking for a good oil company to work for to apply with Continental.
good,Great company to work for with fantastic people.  This company started out small in Enid and moved to OKC to be among other oil and gas companies.  The CEO really cared about us and I think he would have tried to make us all millionaires if the price of oil hadn't sunk.  I only left because I never saw oil prices recovering as soon as upper management did.
good,"It is like a big family where teamwork makes the dream work. the company push for innovation and will make resources available to achieve that goal. As an intern, I had the opportunity to work on meaningful projects."
good,"When I first started as an intern, I was much younger than the employees I was working with. It was intimidating at first, but I was quickly welcomed into the group and my coworkers were extremely helpful. They were always quick to lend a hand when I seemed confused or overwhelmed. I appreciated that immensely."
good,I absolutely loved ConRes! The people are amazing and the company has a great reputation and management team. I left because I needed to move back to NY to be closer to my daughter.
good,"They treat their employees with respect and offer competitive benefits (consistently striving to keep premiums low.)"
good,I worked here for 4 years and loved every minute of it. I would still be there but I had family issues that had to be dealt with. I would go back in a heartbeat.
good,Very good place to work.  Very caring management and they treat you very well.  I would recommend them to anyone.  Very good work schedule that consits of 8 on and 6 off.

good,"Demanding workplace and expected to work beyond job requirements and has great benefits and lot of benefits. Also, job is very stable and that is a huge plus for the industry."
good,Start my day early and review my overnight emails to see if anything needs attention right away.  I have learned a lot from Continental Resources.  I love to work with office supply vendors and compare notes.
good,Wish there were an office where we are moving to.  Lots of room for advancement and great atmosphere.  Worked there for several years and in many different capacities.
good,Great Management within my job. Career advancements are endless as long as you want to learn and work hard you can go far. This job is very goal oriented and makes you work hard to reach for the sky and accomplish your goals.
good,"A workweek will keep you busy, but not too fast paced with ample time to meet deadlines. Co-workers were personable and most were accountable.  The benefits are very solid.  The only thing that Continental is not really flexible with are work hours.  One can choose a start time of 7:30, 8:00 or 8:30.  But that's is it."
good,"Family oriented, I spent 35 years at Con Res.  Started as a receptionist and grew to outside sales, inside sales, Branch Manager, and Distribution Channel Manager.  They provided me great training and direction that helped me grow."

good,"Working in the marketing department at Continental Resources, I was directly involved with marketing campaigns. In an administrative role, I learned a great deal about sales, marketing and all aspects of purchasing. I worked for some very well experienced managers in each of the departments I mentioned. The company culture was family oriented and everyone had a can-do attitude. The hardest part of the job was learning all of the aspects of the daily routine in sales, marketing and purchasing. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people, and being involved in a very friendly atmosphere. I also gained a great deal of knowledge interacting between departments."
good,"Awesome benefits for health coverage, stock, 401k and vacation/sick time plus great environment with one-of-a-kind leaders."
