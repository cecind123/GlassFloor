good,"They play favorites. "
good,"I value and appreciate this company for employing and providing me with the opportunity to work with their corporation. "
good,If you plan on moving up in the company then be prepared to do whatever the managers say. If you go against anything then don't plan on staying long. So much favoritism.
good,"Overall Home Depot was a fun place to work, everyone got along and expressed an healthy workplace. Management could at times be misunderstanding but bad enough to not continue to go about the day in an enjoyable fashion. The turnover rate was a little high at times but as long as you did you job correctly and to the best of your abilities everything was fine. Overall a decent place to work."
good,The job isn't bad. Home Depot has a way of sucking you in. You kind of feel trapped like you can't leave. Management is okay but very relaxed. It's frustrating because you can't get management to take care of employee issues. They let a lot of things slide for certain people but expect more out of others.
good,Good place to work but they do not pay employees enough to keep them. Management is great and very supportive. Company culture is for the most part very good. But they best employees usually end up leaving for better-paying opportunities elsewhere. This makes it very hard to keep a knowledgable and well-trained staff.
good,There were not much benefits for the employees. They were not very understanding of uncontrolable situations either and expected a complete dedication to work life over school.
good,Home Depot was challenging because they have so many different managers that are not on the same page.  Part of my job was in the garden department and daily I would be assigned a task and would complete it and then be told by a different manager they did not want that done and I should have worked on something else.  It was difficult to communicate with each manager as each one felt like they had the authority over the other.  I enjoyed the work and my coworkers but found the culture there frustrating
good,"As a cashier, head cashiers and management REALLY push you to get credit cards daily.  It can be really annoying, especially when you are asking, but the customers don't want one and management blames YOU.  The best thing about this place were the employees.  Many were kind and welcoming."
good,"Pays well, hours are flexible, people are fine. The problem I have with the company lies in the management and the environment. It is sometimes great, but typically not"
good,The benifits are good but you are definetly under payed and overworked. The management s too laid back and does not seem to care about a lot of pressing issues.
good,"The Job isn't hard, but it is very physical and the ordering/stocking system is an unorganized mess. "
good,I was in receiving. It was a little complicated because you had to operate heavy machinery. There's room for growth after a few years. The managers are helpful when needed but it can get very slow and the hours get low but picks back up.
good,In my case the work I have been offered so far is very simple and requires very little effort. A side from a few tasks asked of me from time to time that are demanding physically (lifting 90lbs backs of concrete or large boxes or pieces of lumber) this has been the easiest job I can remember ever having. I have been passed over for promotion 3 times now. Each time by someone who had less time at Home Depot and less work experience in general. However all three were much younger than I am which seems to be a pattern at this store.
good,The most enjoyable thing about working at The Home Depot were my coworkers. We were always understaffed for being such a high volume store. The scheduling was always janky and unreliable. Managers were of no help 90 percent of the time.
good,"My trade skills far outweighed the requirements of the job; in the plumbing department. I became over-confident and lost track of my main focus, which is to stay employed."
good,Moving work schedule is makes planning personal time difficult. The workload is heavy with substandard wage compensation. The company operates with minimum staff which pressures employees to neglect personal needs i.e. taking sick/personal time. Generally a stressful environment with poor compensation and not much opportunity for advancement. Good people poorly managed.
good,I had a supervisor who gave me all the physical labor and would not do any when I was not scheduled. Had a female co worker that was not expected to do any physical labor.
good,"The culture of the company was the best part about working here for me. For such a large and prominent company though, it was surprisingly autonomous. In some cases that was awesome and in other cases it really made it difficult to know exactly what was being asked of you in some cases."
good,great job for busy body types. long hours standing on concrete floors. Hr and benefits assistance could really use some better resources. Company Culture was excellent.
good,"Management hire people with no work ethic, are lazy, and no common sense.  "
good,"A typical day at work was just assisting the customers and other departments if they needed help or with any questions, keeping your department clean as well as filled with product for the customers. I can definitely say i learned to be a lot more patient working there than i have ever been. I say working at the location i was at was stressful because no 2 managers did things the same way or the right way so when corporate would do their walks or the manager that does things right come by to tell you to fix something because a different manager told someone else to do it a different way that was incorrect you had to stop what your doing to fix it and help customers in the process. Nine times out of ten though it was during peek hours and there were only 2 people working your massive department at a time , and in order to fix the problem you had to use the machines which also took 2 people to drive and and execute the task properly. Overall though the most enjoyable part of the job is working with the people in your department. they easily made my day just that much more stress free."
good,Still working but looking for full time employment with benefits. Job is ok but need something full time with insurance benefits  enjoy work but  have to have health insurance benefits COBRA expires in near future
good,"work was relatively slow and i learned a lot about time management. the management was very on its own playing field. the culture was fun and friendly, the hardest part of the job was finding something to do when all the work was done. Most enjoyable part was the co workers."
good,"Main focus to your day is customer service.   However, there is many additional functions to the position that is required.  Such as addressing and solving customer issues/complaints, stocking shelves, meeting and beating companies goals on a weekly basis.  As far as learning you mainly taught yourself.  If you wanted to learn anything about the business, you had to find the information yourself or find someone who was willing to teach you.  Workplace culture will depend on what store location you work at.  Some store are really family oriented, while others are very “click” oriented.  Some stores you will leave feeling abused because of customer volume and type of customer base. Hardest part of the job is being able to identify and speak differently to each associate or customer."
good,"Work can be very difficult, but the co-workers are ok. Management is an uncommunicative, unorganized mess that often doesn't talk to or pass on information to each other."
good,The size of the store makes maintenance a difficult task. They need to close for a month to clean it thourouly. New management would not help with more interaction with rge employes
good,Very store and management team dependant on how fun and exciting the workplace is. Can be highly rewarding if you are good at corporate politics. Only recommended if you have open availability in work schedule.
good,"It is a paycheck but not one that gives any sort of comfort for someone in their early twenties. Really this job is only for retired or younger part-time people, unless you're willing to stick it out and hope to move up. The benefits/salary have me barely scrapping by each month."
good,Was slow on offering forklift training. Most days start off the same I would go and see what truck orders I need to put away during putting them away I would help customers and by cutting wood and help put items in their vehicles.
good,This is not a career job. This is more of a filler job or a retirement job. The environment is friendly and low paced. If you intend to learn about the product and just coast through while making sales it is a typical low paced retail job.
good,Great networking place to meet different people and be of assistants. Fun environment it was very cool . Great perks with workshops for families and contractors
good,"good place to learn a lot about home improvement/helpful friendly co-workers/management lacked some skills,needed improvement/ great place to set a career in this field of business and to advance to management."
good,Good place to work just didn't offer enough pay and were always trying to short hours. There healthcare is very high that's why I didn't get to join there stocks.
good,I acquired many skills  working for this company. I was given opportunities to grow and advance. I  made some life long friends and was able to help support my family.
good,"Retail is a hardwork. Balancing your home life is hard to do when you work weekends evenings etc.... No set time "
good,Good company but had poor managers. Management wasn’t in the same path they worked against each other. Which lowered the moral of the store. Store manager was extremely sarcastic
good,Depending on management I can be an amazing career and place to work with awesome benefits unheard of in retail part time and definitely full-time. Or if management and supervisors are control freaks it can be h*# on earth! It really depends on the individual retail store. Not for me with the corporate arena
good,Extremely busy during morning hours. Im the only one there in receiving so its very stressful. I get very little to no assistance during the morning. Me fellow associates are great people but the assistant managers are extremely lazy.
good,"The work is tedious and difficult but is made for in fun moments and enjoyable co workers. It taught me a lot about tools, even more than I already knew, and has made me better at talking one to one or in a group."
good,If you’re just looking for a side job to make extra money than working here is fine for you but if you’re looking to advance in a career look elsewhere. The hours are reasonable but too random to the point that it’s not consistent. The only good thing about working here is you can choose your breaks for an hour or half hour and you get paid time off and personal and sick days. And don’t expect to move up to a different position quickly cause you’ll most likely stay stuck doing the same thing for the time you spend working at HD.
good,"Not a bad place to work if you don't mind being brain dead, zero opportunity for original thought. It's a paycheck though, and some of the employees are fantastic, and the managers are all pretty meh."
good,"Job is good, love working as a team but at that time had a manager picking at me everyday. Other than that  the enviroment and everythign is nice and good."
good,Management was horrible. Promoted individuals who had no idea how to run a department. Managers choose favorites. Poor communication skills between management and human resources.
good,Really just like any store. There aren't any employee discounts and the benefits are not made very clear. The hours are limited in the fall and winter but plentiful in the summer. The pay does not increase by much.
good,The hours really didn’t work for me I was trying to go to school at the same time. I did learn to really multi task in a very busy environment. Learned how to lead
good,Very busy hard work on feet all day no flexibility for scheduling rude customers. Management not too good pay is kind of good. Lack of organizations in different departments.
good,"Ok place to work I only worked there for 6 months, They don't let their employees be creative in setting up the store for a better customer service. etc"
good,As a cashier here I felt very comfortable everyday coming in and doing my duties. The customers were friendly and always asked for help and usually be able to answer them. Even the management made sure to check on the employees whenever they needed anything.
good,management only cares about themselves and when I got injured they attacked me for just doing my job regardless and what they want is harass employees and customers
good,"Not all home depot are the same, the one I worked for wasnt the best. They expected alot from you but didnt want to pay you for your time or effort. Management at the store I worked at needs to focus on their employees more."
good,"The location I worked for was a 3/4 store, IE 25% smaller than a standard store layout. It was also the highest grossing store in the surrounding eight states. For comparison, during my last year my store was on track to pass $80 Million in sales, the next closest store in the region was on track for $8 Million."
good,"if you can not lift more than 50 lbs this job is definitely not for you, very hectic work environment and heavy lifting is required to complete 90% of your work"
good,"A day at the Home Depot is typical retail with great coworkers making it memorable. Store management comes and goes in rapid succession. The working atmosphere can vary from worker friendly to stifling, as the management changes."
good,"Cannot Express my true feelings because of fear of retaliation.  Company as a whole is ok, but only if you have the privilege of working for the select leaders who are genuine in their roles."
good,"Personally However the upper management was terrible especially toward the end of me leaving, and  some of the other supervisors treated associates unfairly. However I did get to learn how to drive a forklift which I hope to use to build a career somewhere else and hope my other friends and coworkers do alright."
good,"Most jobs are a mix of retail and warehouse duties. The associate turnover is fairly high, so not everyone there is an expert in their field. Middle management often complains about low pay and high expectations and that is transferred to employees rapidly. It's a ok place to work temporarily, but not much of a career path."
good,"Okay job that I feel is intended for highschool kids and retired people, I came across all walks of life working there and interacting with customers."
good,Great company to possibly grow. Work is hard and you always have to watch your back. Strange rules as far as calling out and taking time off. Keep your head down and get through the shift.
good,Working there was fun but also stressful and very highpaced. Managers try to understanding but the company comes first. When having health issues or and emergency they try to help but in my experience it did not go well.
good,"A very unexpected environment to work in,favoritism and almost standoffish way of training. Reviews are non existent and communication only happens when you have done wrong."
good,Fast paced and stressful. Management i didnt really like to much but employees got their work done in a timely manner. Cashiers had it the worse. But it was great people who worked there.
good,"had planned on retiring from there in about 6-7 years, unfortunately, the new management changed that plan."
good,Ok place to work needs more communication between employee and management faster response upon request or at least some acknowledge that request has been received
good,I still work for Home Depot. I enjoy it. I like that there is always new and changing things going on.  Training is a high priority and I enjoy most of my co-workers.  There is an opprotunity to advance but it is very difficult. Part time work is the norm and in the off season it's down right starvation for hours (8 hours a week).  The enviroment is relaxed and the customers are pretty easy top please because HD makes that a priority.  I just wish I felt more valued and saw a future with them. They make that hard to see with the lack of full time employment and fair pay for my experience.
good,It has its good and bad my direct supervisor was one of the best that I have ever worked with and his supervisor was just as good.Some of the others were not to my liking.
good,"Because of the training program is a good option for a beginner  but I don't know if will be for a  15 years kitchen, bath and closet designer  experience."
good,"As a cashier, I was able to interact with the customers, which was quite often fun and rewarding. My co workers were the highlight of the job, very team oriented, and fun to work with. Helpful to each other, and comical in the break room."
good,"They were flexible with your work schedule if you were a student. They supplied a lot of training, it was mandatory. It was always understaffed. Never enough help on the floors but many cashiers."
good,"set the truck up to be unloaded before associates arrived, when the arrived unloaded truck when the second shift arrived told them where they were going to be working and packed out store"
good,"No comment, there for a paycheck and that is it. Met some nice people there but I knew at some point I would have to find another job. My job was getting boring and I felt like a robot."
good,"the home depot is a good place to begin when looking for a job, however it would be nice to feel more challenged. the job consisted of doing stock and being organized."
good,"Management at my store sucked, they rarely cared about the cashiers. There was not a lot of recognition for anybody but the full-time employees, rarely was a part-time employee recognized for a job well done."
good,Good people here great way to learn new skills that could take u to the next stop in your career path only issue I had with this company way low pay and low raises
good,"Supply Chain at The Home Depot is a dynamic, fast paced environment. Most people you work with are friendly, smart, and qualified. It they aren't they do not tend to last very long. There is a lot of opportunity to work cross-functionally with other groups in the company. This leads to opportunities to be seen by executive leadership. Being quick, decisive, and accurate with information is very important. The Home Depot is a retail company, meaning, if the stores are open you are working. Vacation is scarce to come by and disconnecting completely can be difficult. This can be understood and somewhat ignored by management because everyone is dealing with the same pressures. Overall, supply chain at Home Depot is a great place to learn how a large company works and how to work very hard."
good,Management needs some work. I got let go over missing paperwork and I feel that I should have been given a second chance. I think if I was given a second chance I would still be working there.
good,"Fun workplace but very demanding for knowing the products and skills necessary in my department. Most of my time was spent helping customers find the parts that they needed.  However, I often had to tell customers how to use products or build things."
good,"At first, it seemed like a good job. However, over time it became apparent that they did not treat minors fairly. Hence my reason for leaving once I had graduated from high school."
good,"Benefits"
good,"Health issues became an issue toward the end of my tenure. Increased stress over reaching sales goals became an issue. Added pressure resulted in hospitalization 1 week  following departure. I truly love kitchen design and would like to return on a part time level if at all possible"
good,"kitchen design for walk in customers, including selling the complete job. This included appliances, flooring, counter tops, backsplash and all the items needed for a installation, including the installation service. Covered flooring, plumbing, electrical departments or any department in the store."
good,"Its a great place to work. They have an awesome attendance policy, just don't get sick with in the first 90 days. You learn a lot about the merchandise."
good,"I enjoyed this job thoroughly. It was back-breaking labor at times, but it was good. I loved many of my customers and developed relationships with them, always offering my assistance, personal shopping with them if they wanted me to. "
good,The Home Depot is a relatively good place to work. For the young person just getting into the workforce it offers a great opportunity to learn and work in a variety of different departments. A new employee can gain vast knowledge about different trades from the training and information received from the many contractors and laborers that shop. Staffing and salary should be better but overall ok place to work
good,"The Merchandising Associate job is the best option."
good,"If you enjoyed working alone and a ton on heavy projects and  receive no credit for it, then Home Depot is for you."
good,"During my time at The Home Depot, I was an awesome worker. However, the supervisor that was over my department prior to me had a problem with me and continued to pick at anything that I did as well as writing me up for problems that I was not apart of. She would report every problem trying to get me out of the job. Needless to say, I no longer work there."
good,"Fun to work there, but I worked fulltime and was on medicaid, they offer ""discounted"" insurance which was $600/month for a single young healthy person, my annual raise was less than a quarter, I just wanted to make a living wage and move out of my parents place. Even Department Heads didn't make a living wage, Home Depot's profit margin is insulting."
good,No opportunity for advancement in the store without major changes. Management is often inconsistent and not supportive of employee needs. Company policy inconsistent in application.
good,"This is an excellent, stable place to work especially if you do not have formal education. For those who have a college education, the forward thinking/planning by management is just not there. Even fast tracked, the road to upper management can take many years."
good,Good pay.dont like the computer long test. But they do want and will train you to work in different areas of the store. Working with the hone Depot is like working with a team!
good,"its a decent place to work if you're a student or live at home. i wouldnt recommend it to someone with kids or people they need to provide for. they simply do not pay enough, unless you get to management."
good,"It is retail, do not have great expectations.  The top management has no clue as to what the employees do.  Multi tasking is the new buzz word.  No credit or pay increase is given for actually multi tasking and actually doing it can cause problems with managers.  I have seen worse but hope to do better."
good,"Hours and pay were to inconsistent to balance bills, when asked to move from part-time to full-time I was told there were no positions I qualified for. When I put in my notice I was suddenly offered positions I could not take. When I turned them down they cut my hours to unlivable pay until I left."
good,majority of assistants store managers are beyond terrible. Too much of a divide between store associates and merchandising team. some associates are awesome to know and very helpful others aren't social to non store associate employees.
good,Either the customers were happy to be remodeling their home and getting new tools or they were unhappy to be remodeling their home or a contractor busy with his/her working day.
good,"Working nights moving product from trucking to the sales floor, and have everything ready for customers the next morning. Was good to do physical labor again for a change."
good,"Working here was fun at first. I was learning A LOT, but then things got a bit out of hand. There became no room for advancement, a lot of people either left or got fired for various petty reasons. Anyone with a position above cashier could write you up for whatever reasons they chose. There was no time for computer training if you were moved to a different department other than cashier. It was just.. idk.. a mess. The manager was great though, and a lot of the people were nice, but soon as you do something wrong, soon as you make a simple mistake, it seemed as if everyone was against you and biting your back out."
good,"Home Depot is a great first time job, and could be an amazing career if you are located in the right district/location.  Management DEFINITELY needs some work here in Omaha."
good,"Trying to stock and help customers with not enough help, manager not on same page. Not caring about changing schedule after already post and u already have plana"
good,Good place to work part time while going to school but nothing more then that. They have a good work environment but just need more help. Family friendly and most of the coworkers are nice.
good,"Stress full, sometimes fun. You make the best out your day, Its retail work, working with public not always easy. You will meet great people to work with."
good,well a typical day at Home Depot consistently taking care of the customer and of course the customer come first. Home Depot pride their self of customer service
good,"Working for home depot was a great learning experience especially talking to all subcontractors however there was a time when you started working there, other workers wouldn't help or had favorites. However, I didn't mind at all I kept my head up and tried my best to keep everyone satisfied."
good,"The job itself depending on the day can be difficult or pretty relaxed as far as stocking shelves is concerned. While we are encouraged to give it our all but don't overexert yourself in reality you are pushed to go above and beyond what should be considered safe.Items that are labeled ""team lift"" or that exceed 50 lbs you are expected to be able to handle by yourself. Management will routinely ask for help with time consuming special projects but you must do it and your task on top of it regardless of how long the projects take because if you stay over to complete them there's a good chance you will be disciplined.If you are full time and have made your availability known it will be taken into consideration then disregarded. As far as recognition goes if you work overnights you won't really see any if it isn't at annual store meetings. One of the best things about the job is hands down the people never have i found a better bunch of people to rely on or befriend."
good,"Unless you are in a supervisory role or an Associate's position that had some career path, you had no clear path to move up in the organization, which was a problem."
good,Great co-workers. Job is crazy like the customers. Management is poor. Store manager is ridiculous. One manager is useless. Doesn't do his job. Tells his associates he doesn't get paid to stand there and get bitched at by customers so the associate has to handle it. Then expects you to do what he wants/needs. Understaffed. Pay is unfair. People are stupid.
good,"No work life balance on weekends for part time associates, everyone is required to work weekends even though this ""policy"" does not apply to everyone."
good,When I started working at Home Depot it was all about the customer service now it became all about the money customer service went down started losing customers it's not a place I would recommend to go back to you I will never work the Home Depot again
good,"A normal day at work consists of clocking in on the time clock, going to the employee lounge and preparing to assist my co workers and customers with their various home improvement projects."
good,"there were good days and bad days,but i made the best out of every situation that i was presented with.i started off seasonal and gradually made my way up the ladder, to becoming a seasonal supervisor which i enjoyed. then the money didn't come and then i began to feel not appreciated and ended up being a bad thing considering the hard work i put in."
good,"Casual, but fast paced work environment assisting merchants and stores to ensure the product mix in stores match the area with no snow shovels in Tucson, AZ"
good,"While this job has many great things about it, if you are not competitive or overly-ambitious, working there is not for you. The people you work with will either be amazing or barely-tolerable, there is no in-between."
good,Management needs to communicate better between themselves. There is favoritism.  If you aren't a superstar credit card getter you get treated differently. Slow periods where some employees get hours cut while others are getting more. Long periods of time when you're just standing there on a cement floor.
good,Customers were rude and always needed a discount based on managers being sweet. Orders were always messed up by quantity or actual product. Delivered weren’t made on time as well as appointments for consultations were. never made. Hours were cut randomly and you’ll be at the desk working 4 hours alone working two different departments.
good,The Home Depot is a very dominant fast pace environment. Job security is poor because you can get fired for basically anything. Your best is never your best they always want more even when you are excelling at any job you are put in.
good,"- 8 hour shifts"
good,"As a merchandising associate i start my day at 5 AM every Monday through Friday and our main duty is to check planograms, stock the shelves, change the price tags, organize the overheads, and dust the bays, as well as some outlier tasks for different classes of products. Another one of our major duties is to complete all the projects that need to be executed in the store like cutting in new products, resetting bays when new planograms come out, setting holiday events such as Christmas and Halloween, among other small things."
good,If you weren’t one of the buddy buddy people with the hr supervisor then you didn’t get anything. They all work together to get each other awards but none of them do any work.
good,"The Home Depot is a good place to work especially for students. They know how to take care of their employees, have great benefits, and special event days."
good,"fast paced at times, learned time management and to pace yourself. Competitive atmosphere, always trying to beat the other employees by finishing first."
good,"It's got some good things but overall, it's your standard low pay retail place that seeks to squeeze the life out of you for those few pennies you earn."
good,"Absolutely loved the coworkers, but the job is overly stressful and the pay is bad. The Home Depot continuously asks you to go above and beyond but never gives you anything in return. Good for a part time or summer job if you don't care and are just there to collect a paycheck, but the lack of accountability, ownership, and support makes working there as a dedicated employee a nightmare."
good,The work place is great. Management treat their favorites way better. They’re so messy. I’m mostly referring to the cashier department. They talk about everything abt anything. Corporate could tell them to keep some information to themselves and they would still go out and tell everyone. They would fire you if they could. They fail to realize how much of a big role management plays on the workers. I hated going to work just because i knew they would start bs everyday. It was tiring. Mentally and physically.
good,"working at the home depot was great when I first started than with new management  came in it became a horrible place to work .the managers play favoritisim ,the most enjoyable part of my job was some of my coworkers and customers it made the work day better"
good,"The hardest part of working for The Home Depot was dealing with multiple managing styles and irregular work hours for full-time employees. This is a pretty negative start but they're were good times to be had as well. I myself found the interaction with my fellow workers and the customers, both regulars and irregulars, was quit enjoyable. You never know who was going to walk through the doors."
good,I came from another store that was very busy and this one hardly has any customer and I  need to work not just stand around.This is a medium volume store
good,They’re very fast paced and the job has to be done they have very good employees and they’re friendly and hard working they’re very fair on the wages.
good,"Home Depot is non-stop activity helping customers purchase what is needed for their projects. I came to appreciate the customers and the importance of keeping them happy. All of the employees became a family and we worked together for the best possible result. As I was given the responsibility of the garden department, getting all of the plants taken care of within the allotted time, became a challenge. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the beauty of this area and helping customers with planning their garden needs."
good,this is a good job for retired people or those who are in college. everyone who worked full time had a second job just to make ends meet. at the time favoritism was the biggest factor in moving up
good,"The Home Depot is  very fast pace work place, You are going to be running for the time you put your apron you till  you take it off. And that's the best part. You're get to work with some of the best people and they make it all  worth it. They have a lot of turn over with associates. You have to be ready to deal with all types of people. The overall company have many great offers and benefits  and insurance is the really great. The store just needed to update a lot of the old policies and way of doing things and that could help with a great deal of the problems."
good,The Home depot was a great place to work up until the last few months. I learned a vast amount of knowledge from the company that will surely help me in the future.
good,"It was a good place to work. I think the hardest part about working there was the fluctuations in the schedule, where you would have 20 hours one week and then 5 hours the next week. One of the other hard parts was the way that management would not back you up when it came to customer requests that did not line up to store policy as well. The best part about working there was working with great people, and making friends with people you would not normally make friends with."
good,"I have worked here for over 2yrs and hated most of it. My coworkers and pay is the only thing that is keeping me here. Management take customers side over their own employees even if employees wasnt there or didnt  do anything wrong. They expect you to be an octopus and do everything as told as it is coming out of their mouth. Don't get paid enough to be the person to run your department or the whole store. Cant control rude customers but allows you to be disrespected. Most of all part time get 2 hrs a month for sick time and full time gets 4 hrs, they dont take excuses of any kind and you will get occurrence for not having time to cover it."
good,Not particularly the ideal job for younger folk who wish to thrive in a company unless you are willing to put forth 110% of your work energy into it. Personally speaking I can't deal with moving heavy freight back and forth but I that's just my view on it.
good,"it was great  most of the time ….despite there are times I felt hints and sometimes, obvious signs of discrimination. not much but nevertheless, can cause unwantingness to work... besides that, the work was easy...didnt mind lifting stuff a couple of pounds over what was specified on the agreement but still, loved the exercise..."
good,"I have not worked there in over ten years so it is unclear how tins are currently. However, when I was employed I did enjoy the the changing work schedule. The pay and the benefits did meet my needs at the time. For the most part I remember an overall plesent work experience."
good,"There’s always something to do but job doesn’t acknowledge as much as they should, sometimes take advantage of your work skills and management will take full credit for your successes."
good,"Only managers and above make any decent money, the rest are at minimum wages. Managers are insensitive to any one below them, they lock themselves at an inconspicuous location and avoid all customer service call. Managers don't even say hello when you walk by as a customer or employee"
good,"Our employees are amazing to work with, but wish we had more to take care of the coverage. Needs better management and see more of them on the floor.."
good,"If you didn't have to make your schedule four weeks early then it would be an easier place to work. I didn't get enough hours a week but everything else is good, management and all. If you're in it for the hours then you must know that you have to schedule your hours four weeks in advance."
good,It's very stressful the pay is good but you will be pushed to your limit starting off it will be easy but as u settle in it will get hard the work environment is very intense
good,"I worked as a Pro Desk Associate and Flooring Specialist. This job can be very stressful due to very low staffing. The more you do, the more they think there are enough employees. Unfortunately this is not the case. Be prepared to work hard and depending on your position, lots of hours. It was very sad to hear co-workers in my same position making much less than me and they had worked there for 4-5 years. Under staffing is their biggest problem. I wish you the best of luck."
good,Home depot had a lot of temporary works with not that many hours. It was a nice atmosphere  to work but I could not make enough money to take care my everyday living including transportation and rent.
good,"A typical day at work was busy. Male dominant department. It was a lot of physical work. I learned no matter how hard you work, it's never enough. The management I dealt with was passive aggressive and unconcerned with employees concerns. You did not have an opinion that mattered and you weren't valued. Workplace culture was male dominant with diverse race. Hardest part of the job was not being valued. Most enjoyable was when I knew I did well and corporate managers saw I did well."
good,I enjoyed working for the company. I was there for four years. I was able to gain training to further my career within the company and my future. Great chances for growth.
good,"It was not horrible working at Home Depot but they definitely need to re-train their managers & head cashiers. Most of the time the cashiers get blamed for everything when they're just doing what the head cashier asked them to. every head cashier has different rules, so what you may get in trouble for with one, another will tell you it is no problem. They need to have a set of rules they all follow. But if you can stick to yourself and do your job then i guess it is fine."
good,"Home Depot is a good place. There are many coworkers, a handful of supervisors and many customers that make it worth wild working at this particular site."
good,I liked the team aspect but the turnover rate and benefits were bad. I enjoyed the opportunity teach new employees and collaborate with others. Would do it again if I had to.
good,"The most enjoyable aspect was having good positive interactions with the customers. I worked mainly in the paint department but if you"
good,"working hard without a good pay. If you need money for your family, do not go there. "
good,"This is a company that at least somewhat cares about their employees. There are a lot of programs to help employees out when they are struggling in life. "
good,"Working there was easy, but dealing with management was a pain. He didn't know what was going on, and constantly talked down to all employees, treating them like garbage."
good,"The hardest job at the HD is a Department Supervisor.  You do every thing form an associate to Assistant Store  Manager does, plus fit in all Department Manger duties.  You may even be a key holder and be the Manager on Duty with no compensation in Pay.  There are a lot of good people in the Company but It all depends on your Store Manager.  Pay is extremely low for what your responsibilities are and the benefits are very good, but way to expensive.  You can get better private medical for half what they pull out your check every two weeks.  Also there attendance policy and time clock system is inadequate.  Don't ever call in sick or go home sick without personal or vacation time."
good,"Overall I learned a lot from the Home Depot, I do feel however they can treat their associates better, and also pay better than minimum wage, seeing as the workers there often end up going above and beyond what their job entails."
good,Needed better store manager in the company in certain areas although they could be more efficient with their customers more often than they are doing.
good,The full time employees are always huddled up and if your accepted great but if not your fired . mgmt closes their eyes to certain employees while not
good,"Management from the supervisors to the store manager needs training. They lack organization and leadership skills, they make poor decisions that leads to less work being accomplished. Like most companies they try to get max coverage with the minimalist staff as possible, but that just leaves to overworking the employees that actually care about their work. This tactic is not working."
good,A typical day is doing the work of many while trying to assist customers in a proper manner.  The management has never worked as a team.  The employees are over worked and in most cases under paid for the expectations
good,A typical day at work was working with customers immediately providing quality service.  Busy all day.  Never any idle time.  The challenges were good.  Learned a lot.  The hardest part of the job was stocking and packing while assisting customer with designs and installations and at the same time directing many other customers to what they were looking for.
good,"I have worked at Home Depot for about 5 months now and I have a major lack of motivation to go into that job because of how boring the job is. And you do the same thing everyday, there is not mixup in your schedule and good luck requesting days off."
good,"Was a cashier, had a terrible supervisor. Don't really like the company. If your sick it doesn't matter you should be there, and they do not accept Dr.'s notes."
good,The home Depot was a good place on long island but I got transferred to Florida now the management is horrible....It used to be like a family but  not anymore...
good,"Went in to interview for a part time cashier An was hired for full time head cashier. I’m going to break this down into sections so I can give a full review of each."
good,"Be careful when you apply, they may hire you for a position you don't want because it's available. Management was prone to moving unqualified employees to sections they shouldn't have been in."
good,"It was not the best job, it is extremely boring and repetitive. Management was never there and were no help when dealing with issues. Pay is poor and long hours."
good,Love the job fast pace busy just not enough workers in order for me 2 do my job in closing you need 2 people so.etimes there can be alot of clashing there if your other associates are trying to close there dept it was leading experience I learn that with time management I can get alot done in a small window of time
good,"A typical day for me at Home Depot includes coming up with solutions for customer issues, placing online orders, answering calls, checking stock, contacting vendors, etc..."
good,"As a specialty associate my job was to talk to customers and find the ones most interested in installs. Every week i needed to make a quota which often became challenging when you could not find any seriously interested customers. This job has helped me learn to better communicate with others and taught me to adapt to new programs as needed. One of the issues i had at my current job here is that the management makes promises to associates they can not keep. These include scheduling issues, days off etc. the most enjoyable part is definitely my coworkers and all the other amazing people that have taught me so much. if i had not had this job i might have not learned many things about homes which i truly believe will aid my future."
good,listen to others chat and the manager say nothing. trying to maintain positive look even thou we had no product in our warehouses during a transition from being purchased.
good,"My store is an $80MM a year operation, is hast paced and what is needed observationally to begin to turn the corner is by the senior management team being held accountable to work in all areas off the store especially with the overnight freight and store recovery team.  Managers should lead from the front and get into issues in all facets of the store operation"
good,A good place to work for someone that only wants part-time work or is looking for temporary work while going to school. High-stress environment dealing with many customers.
good,"Reciving trucks.  Loading and unloading trucks.  "
good,"For nearly the whole time I was working there I had many managers, supervisors, HR representatives, operational managers, even the assistant GM and general manager, were on my side, and helping me through a back injury.  When our GM became sick with cancer a new GM from Atlanta came in and basically did a clean house and I watched almost everyone above me in the company get fired and that basically trickled down to me."
good,"If you're full-time they screw you over. They like to change your ""set"" schedule. Management is made up of drama queens. the benefits are not bad but the pay is awful. I've been there over 6 years and there are people who have been there less than a year who make more than I did. I will say if your are part time it is a great part time job."
good,Would not recommend unless you need a job but always no weekends and some travel as well of you volunteer to do so but nice opportunity for some if they like this.
good,"Experience and performance do not matter in middle management.  it the amount of sucking up and brown nosing that matters most."
good,"get up go to work, arrive punch in. Some people say hello others no, department associates take advantages of breaks, late, absence, not tracked well.  Hard to advance.  mico managed. break work go home"
good,"i loved working at home depot it was fun a relaxing an enjoyable, someday's got really busy an hard to work s but overall was a great work experience."
good,Company is good overall but hours are part time and no one gets what is promised. Can't rely on hours every week and most part timers leave. big turnover because of the hous
good,"My time spent with Home Depot was actually rather enjoyed, and as far as employment goes, it was one of the best jobs I ever had. However, advancement is not ever guaranteed, nor are hours, which is a problem when you have bills to pay. There is a tendency to move candidates from other stores as opposed to promoting from within, which actually hurts morale over all."
good,"Never worked my schedule, it was always come in earlier and/or stay later and get in trouble if I went over 30 hours. Even if I was told by management to stay."
good,"My biggest problem with working at Home Depot is I can never get a weekend off, at least at this store. It doesn't matter if you ask months in advance the request is always denied."
good,"A typical day at work consists of going aisle to aisle searching for customers who need help. facing and organizing shelves, watering plants (garden dept.) the workplace in terms of the training videos are very happy and welcome the associates and the customers, but for me the videos are much different than the real workplace, I feel unwelcomed and nervous."
good,I learned a lot of things about home improvement while working there. I also was able to learn quite a bit about plants while working at the garden register. The environment between coworkers can be quite hostile.
good,"lots of things to do. it was a busy place. Needed a better leadership because the one in place is lacking. I received a forklift license there, That was cool."
good,"The pay is competitive, but the environment is hard to be in some days. Everyone works weekends and you have to fight to get a Saturday off. Customers are often very rude and needy due to the clientele of the store."
good,overall fun place depending on management which change every few years. the most enjoyable part of the job is the culture and the way your treated by fellow associates.
good,"Not much to say here. I work mostly evenings and weekends, and miss dinners with family. Most customers are nice, but some are nasty. It is typical retail work."
good,Their is favoritism among certain associate which affect equal treatment by the managers. It is difficult to advance to higher positions. The pay is higher than minimum but it is still not enough to survive.
good,"It is a fast-paced and very competitive environment. I wouldn’t recommend this job for anyone who would like a flexible schedule or days off."
good,The job had great staff and benifits but the managers were not helpful at all so when u needed them they were no were to be to help and it caused many problems.
good,"My jobs were where ever they needed me. I loved working in the garden area. Was very relaxing, something I wasn't used to in my other jobs. Sometimes would have to look for things to do to keep working. Like sweeping the floor or watering plants."
good,"Although the pay from Home Depot was twice more than my previous job. It has problems with management, and no clear advancement in careers. Plus, at my store, there was rarely any chance of doing anything else with your life besides work due to the abhorrent scheduling."
good,This company is great to work for unless you actually want to move up. It seems like you have to be the best friend of the store manager to be able to be considered to move up
good,Was hired as a cashier. Its a slow paced job and they push for you to get people to get their credit card. Computer training for the registers which needs improvement. management refused to let me move from my position even when other departments requested me specifically. They also refused to give me full-time and I was reprimanded when I took other shifts when people wanted to trade or needed time off.
good,"Hours are sporadic, calls at 5am to come in earlier than scheduled. No top to bottom consistent communication. Employees that are routinely ""no shows"" or last minute call ins still get hours with no negative repercussions."
good,Great company to work for but the choice of management needs improvement.  And it depends on the store you work in.  Your management plays an important role of the morale in the store.  If the management isn't great then you know the outcome of the store. 
good,"Not all Home Depots are the same. I first started off as a seasonal employee in the gardening department at a home depot closest to my home. I genuinely enjoyed it. Managers and employees alike were very friendly to me and customers as well. One aspect that I love about the Home Depot is there commitment to treating their customers in a respectable, helpful, and caring way to get them along with their projects with just the right equipment they need. That all changed when I transferred to a different store as an order fulfillment associate. I was given a great schedule that fit in with my school, however I do not believe that the other Home Depot held the same beliefs or at least did not commit to these beliefs of treating customers as well as employees in a positive manner. Management also changed as I was given a lot less freedom to think for myself and instead was constantly micromanaged by managers that sometimes were rude to me. Employees avoided customers as to not help them and there were never enough employees to help the customers in their own departments so I would constantly have to help them which is no issue, but I have no knowledge in those other departments so I would sometimes give misleading information. Employees in the order fulfillment department were constantly calling out so things that needed to get done, went to me. Any slack in the department, you have to make up for as well as your normal workload which sometimes can be plenty enough. In the end, working at the Home Depot can be a hit or miss, I feel as if it depends on whether you choose the right"
good,Job had interesting times helping people. They don't cross train people like they should. Hard to be knowledgeable about other Dept. areas. They should train there people in all areas.
good,"i would recommend this job to somebody who cold handle a lot of heavy lifting and mind numbing boring work. it was consistent work though, so they had that going for them"
good,The company is a good one but the stores unfortunately are all run differently. I have worked for 5 different managers over 12 1/2 years and the last 3 were the worst. The company claims to put associates first but after my termination and multiple calls to the Home Office I can honestly say that was not true.
good,"You must be extremely ""customer first"" in order to enjoy the greatest benefit of the Home Depot--helping others solve problems.  The people you work with are very team oriented.  You must be prepared to lift items in excess of 100 pounds and should expect 15,000+ steps in an 8 hour day."
good,i was hired  in a particular department then  my schedule change without my approval and now im all over the place.  i like to know where im reporting to and know where im going every morning.
good,I start my shift at 6 am to 230 pm  I find a forklift find my door range to find my received freight to locate through out the building and load it if possible. I have learned a ton working at Home Depot in the warehouse environment that I don't think I would have learned anywhere else. management has been hit n miss nothing else to say on that. the hardest part of my job is not hitting anything or anyone safety first. the most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with some of the coolest people I have met.
good,"A day of working at The Home Depot was about knowing your stuff. We had to learn every isle and what we carried, along with credit card approvals, business owners, and many more but money handling was the biggest thing for we had to make sure every amount was correct and had to balance every register."
good,"The Home Depot is a fun place to work if you work with the right people. Recently we had a new store manager who, let's just say, should not be a manager. Benefits and pay is great though."
good,"You don't have many opportunities for advancement, it is a decent place to work because most of the  people are easy to get along with, it can be stressful but it isn't most of the time."
good,"Good labor force at The Home Depot's Data Center; however, limited upward mobility opportunities.  Competitive in regards to compensation in the market place"
good,"Nice job, wide spaced work areas are a plus."
good,I  had nine years of good reviews at the Home Depot.  When I broke my ankle (not on the job) I went over my medical leave of 90 days and communicated to the main office that I would request an extension because of complications from my surgery.  I was then terminated without any explanation.
good,was a cashier and is everything you expect. part time hours all over the place. work outside in heat at times for garden. day in the sun with collar shirt was not fun
good,"on a rotating basis, check products for inventory, proper displays, cleanliness. Order supplies as needed. Work hours only 24 per week. Hardly any Full time employment available."
good,I felt when I was employed at the Home Depot that I was not appreciated and they do not treat employees with enough respect. I did not have enough to spend with my family.
good,"After working for The Home Depot for many years, it's truly no different than any other kind of retail environment.  They may tout a lot of benefits to working there or things that make them different, but at the end of the day it's just another retail job where you're a number, not a name.  You can and will be replaced by someone who will do your job for a lesser wage.  Your seniority does not mean a thing, as time progresses they will hire people on at a higher rate."
good,Management needs to learn how to treat their employees with respect instead of talking down to them. Supervisor Training would help. I ran a State Male Prison for over 20 yrs and I will tell you that HD has great employees but the management will lose those who can financial leave.
good,Not a bad place to gain experience but does not keep up with cost of living when it comes to raises.Schedules are hard on family life or any kind of personal life.
good,The home depot is a fine place to work if you just want to work sales and never advance. Frequently suffers from poor management and if promoted you will be overworked and stressed.
good,hard to get help from other departments. Too many cliques. not enough training. low work mentality. associates more interested in socializing and doing bare minimum of work.
good,"I enjoyed the management I worked for. Customers were always Friendly. Pay wasn't high enough for the low amount of hours they gave me. The pay would've been perfect if I was scheduled 30 or more hours per week. The scheduling is so inconsistent that one week I would work 30 hours, the next week was 15 hours, and one time it got so low I was working only 8 hours. I have 4 kids and my wife, if I worked 30 hours a week for what I was making I would've been fine, but with my wage and a lot of times working less than 20 hours a week it wasn't enough to pay bills or put food on our table. If I was offered full time with a salary of $25,000 a year or higher I would definitely come back, if I was guaranteed 30 or more hours a week every single week making $10 to $15 an hour I would come back as well."
good,"only a temporary position while I was applying for an accounting position.  overall, this job was a decent job; there is room for advancement; variable shifts; most hires were part-time."
good,Worked there for three summers and it gradually got worse every year. At the beginning I liked most of my managers but by the end barely any of them were bearable. They brought in a store manger from wal-mart and she changed a bunch of the policies and was very hard to work for. By the third year I hated my job so much
good,"easy going and easy people to work with, unless you get that one cross costumer, the seems to fly by, and I like that... some silly policies, but that's any business for you."
good,"I was a tool rental associate for the past 6 years, three of which were full time and then planned to retire. I was asked to stay on as a part timer.  I worked with customers to help them get the proper tool for the project they were working on and then wrote up the rental agreement, answered any questions they had about using the tool and helped them load it in their vehicle. I enjoyed listening to them explain their project or problem they were having and getting them the tool and advise they needed to get the job done.  Many of my customers were contractors or repeat diy'ers who sought me out because they appreciated my expertise and honesty.  I accepted the part time position because I was offered the opportunity to work about twenty hours a week and was told that I would only have to work one night shift and one weekend day each week. From the beginning, I was scheduled between 30 to 40 hours a week and as time went on, management changed and I was pressured to work more evening shifts and both weekend days.  They also cut the staff to the point where it was often hard to give the customer the time needed for the service I was used to providing. I was also pressured to push credit cards and referrals for other projects and services."
good,stand at a till until customer purchase items.  Learn how to approach customer and help customer find items.  The hardest part of the job is to stand in 1 place in front of your till until your break
good,Un travajo estable y un sueldo conpetitivo con prestaciones
good,It's a place to work but with low pay and in a culture where others don't seem to really care about their job and management is okay with that as long as you do the minimum.
good,"Enjoyed working for Mosaic, we were responsable to improve the visual look this would improve sales by almost 15%  for Home Depot. We would Re-set Eight  Home Depot stores, our team was team of the year. Laval, Boisbriand,St-Jerome all the way to Gatineau and Orleans Ontario. Great job."
good,"Home Depot as a company is not super fantastic. They have incredible people working there, but their HR is terrible at hiring the proper amount of people suited to the role and thus they have to overwork people and keep them on those terrible concrete floors for large amounts of time. They seem unrealistic in their goals, thus I won't be pursuing a career with them in the future."
good,"Make sure to always have them explain what they mean, and to Make sure you trainer cares about their job as well, if your trainer doesn't care you're bound to not learn about something that you need to meet company standards, and Management won't agree to help you."
good,Customers and department duties. You learn a lot about the products in your department. Management changes often. The hardest part of the job usually involves an angry or upset customer. The most enjoyable would be learning and new friends.
good,The days can be low but you have your co-workers to keep u busy. Will sometimes need to help out in other areas of the store. You have a 7 minute window of time for clocking in and out.
good,The Home Depot in parkesburg Pa tends to switch manger a lot so you can have one manger you get to know then they get replaced. A lot of drama is spread around the store and word travels fast.
good,"Good not great. Benefits are good. Pay if fine. Flexible schedules. Lacking good management and leadership. "
good,Typical day includes helping customers. Loading truck and preparing orders for truck delivery.  Driving forklift to retrieve materials.  Ensuring that safety rules are always followed.
good,"It was a fast paced place , the process was kinda long they made me go through 2 interviews . Then come in for a mouth swab . Also training was long . They made you take this class they had slide shows and also write notes . It was about 9-4 I think and then a lot of training on computer"
good,"Overall okay to start career as associate, nothing much to gain as in experience other than hourly wages. Growth is very limited and slow as per capability of an individual."
good,"Much is expected to be done. Managers can be informal in the way they interact with associates. Much of the time your duties for the day were ambiguous or poorly laid at to you. You must be fairly good at seeking out and completing work, as you are not always directed to what needs to be done."
good,Home Depot tries to live out their values but seem to lose that vision through management. Pay and benefits was a big issue but career advancement was very difficult and biased.
good,this was a very interesting experience. supervisors pretty much run the store the store manager was hardly ever in. which made store functions a little harder when it came to approval and certifications.
good,The management in our store is over stressed and this is effecting all of the employees. Some of the ASMs are saying that they are looking for new jobs and the many of the ASMs and the most of the Store Managers are looking because the District Management (D253) is vengeful and is targeting many of them. I guess its now a big problem. If the leadership doesn't get a handle on this than our lives will be miserable.
good,"Everyday was a good day at work for me, I learn how to communicate better with other associates, gave me more understanding about organizing different boxes, chemicals stations, safety precaution, and measurements of freight transportation as well as valuable of goods and work ethics. Management at Home Depot was friendly and great communication with associates. The work place was like a family everybody got along and treated each other with respect and love. their wasn't no hard part about the job it was always smooth sailing. The most enjoyable part about the job was the fact it was friendly, loving and caring the respect the gave to us was marvelous."
good,"My job is ok job but I’m looking for something better "
good,It's a job and I'm glad I did it when I had to. It is a good place to get some experience but it is hard to make it a career and put food on the table for family it's a friendly workplace at least for me at my particular store but it is one of those jobs where you get it because you don't really have much of a choice anywhere else
good,Fast pace retail with a strong customer service. I have been told I do a great job and I could use 10 of you. I am underpaid. I make $10.30per hour. Some of my co workers get paid a lot more for the same job No work life balance. If I need a day off I need to schedule it 3 weeks in advance. If you do use a sick day the managers will talk and you will be called out.
good,"A typical day at work consist of cashing customer orders, returning special orders, store merchandise and renting equipment."
good,It was interesting on a typical day. I became familiar with paints and other home improvement items. Management was okay. The customers and the workers made it fun and exciting. The hardest part was maybe dealing with difficult individuals they didn't know what they wanted but wanted you to understand what they wanted to do.
good,"It was an enjoyable work environment. Management tried to promote a healthy team environment but staff turnover made it a constant challenge.  There were opportunities to learn something new daily.  A typical day rarely happened as staffing issues or the store agenda routinely changed without prior communication.  Scheduling was difficult as you were often required to work long days and very late nights, returning early the next morning (less than 8 hour turn around).  As advancements presented themselves they were often accompanied by poor training and/or staff development."
good,"The Home Depot has good policies and company values. In my job as a Freight Team Associate these values and policies were sometimes lost by Freight Team Supervisor and Assistant Store Manager for the Freight Team. This was in part due to the pressure placed on them to get the freight moved from the truck, into the store and on the shelves."
good,"The management is very poor, they don't communicate with each other. Never on the same page. They expect things that you cant get done. In-considered at times."
good,"The pay was low, pace was fast and managers didn't value your opinion. Breaks were inconsistent as well when working as a cashier. The upside was my friendly and helpful coworkers."
good,It was a great company to work for . Homedepot has great service.Always are open to listen to the associates concerns very considerate. Teamwork is a plus .
good,Poor management reflects how your associate worked and treated one another. Other than that Home Depot as a company cares about there associates. As well as made sure they felt safe and protected.
good,while i worked at home depot it was during the winter and people do not usually do home improvements over the winter so it was very boring. there was also no room for moving up in the company to better yourself.
good,"This was a good job, as it's very team-work based and co-workers I found were very helpful with questions you may have. There was room for growth as well and the offered students certain benefits with helping with tuition."
good,"TBD  Cannot share."
good,"Did not like working at Home Depot, upper management was very difficult to work with, and changed all the time. I did enjoy working with the other team members."
good,"The best part about the Depot is the friends you make, the people you work with and working with customers. I learned a great deal while here but it's time to spend my wings.."
good,The Home Depot was a great company when i first started my career. Unfortunately it changed culture along my 11 years and lacked customer service.  Managers were driven up or out even without being lower performers.
good,"Although I love my job and the people I work with are awesome, and the company has helped me in some crises situations. I sadly can not live on the hours that are given to me. I do have some limitations but as far as a ""family first"" company, that is not true at all. If you are looking for a 2nd job, I would say yes, work for the Home Depot but it will be extra spending money. That's all I want to say for now."
good,"Fast paced, fun environment; you get lots of training. Great staff and you get to work in different departments. Garden department was the best! Everybody was very helpful."
good,home depot doesn't communicate with there customers very well and there process is outdated. its full of promises but no support to achieve the goals that are ahead.
good,"You will need to be a self starter and make as many contacts as you can. The company has a very strong culture so you will need to fully immerse yourself in the OrangeLife to succeed. It is very fast paced so being informed and keeping up with these changes should be your number one priority.The most enjoyable parts of the job are the ping pong table, video games and events we have at the center."
good,inconsistent scheduling and limited advancement options outside of sales department. It is a good place to work part-time but there are few opportunity's for people who don't enjoy sales.
good,"Suddenly and without warning, cut all part-time hours by about 70%."
good,the management there is bad all around. the home depot pays their employees low wages for the knowledge required for the job. the health benefits are over priced and pointless due to high co pays.
good,"This was a good place to work temporally. There were times where it was hard to find things to do, but there were also times where there was not enough time to get everything done. I learned about sales and customer service here."
good,I loved this place up until recent times.. My complaints are the same as when I started an have only gotten worse.. Over worked .. Under paid .. Unappreciated.. Decent management (depending) on which manager is working .. Favoritism is out of control .. Getting Homer awards are like pulling teeth .. Sick/personal time is a joke .. If you call off you'll get a point as well as have your sick time taken .. The turn over rate is record breaking/sad to say the least .. Which stems from most of my complaints above .. Most days you'll be expected to do more than you can with no help due to poor scheduling .. No one responds to incoming calls .. Customer service is poor but can be good (depending) on the associate working .. Benefits are somewhat fair (depending) on so many factors.. Safety is taken lightly (depending) some care some don't .. The associates are great to say the least .. I see associates push beyond themselves to make this place a success every single day .. (Honestly) .. Most customers/contractors are great and thankful .. Cashier's do a great job .. Daily.. Service desk is a circus at times .. Needs improvement .. Pro desk is great .. Store manager is great .. The past 5 have been .. Room for advancement is there but only more responsibility not pay .. The freight team is great an pretty much all department associates do a great job .. It's the politics that kills the want to work here .. The potential is there I just hope I'm working here when this place gets better ..
good,"Home Depot is a great place to work, but due to the management that is in place in some store the place of work can become a very stressful place that uses people and instead of helping them grow."
good,Poor Upper Management.  Degrading to employees.  No Work Life Balance.  No support.  Unfriendly competition between departments that should be supporting each other.
good,Very relaxed. lots of support from all management teams. HR friendly. Job security a plus. Family oriented work environment. Large company. All questions answered.
good,Management of front end cashiers are rude very young not in control. They had no respect and don't know boundaries. I've only work in Ohio for Home Depot if I was back home in Tx it would have been different.
good,"Great Place to work but low pay and no pay increase when promoted, If they gave you more than a 25 cent pay raise from associate to manager i would of stayed."
good,"I worked freight which I did not mind at all because that is what I was hired for, I also restock the shelves, broke down the boxes and put it in the bailer. I have done all of this before except power pack down in which a young lady who I felt was to young to be train to be an assistant Supervisor start yelling at me and cursing at me on my second day at work because we had to do power pack down all night Saturday night and we did not get off of work until 7 am Sunday morning."
good,It felt like managers would choose favorites. Those favorites would be helped with gaining forklift license etc. before anyone else. For the most part I would consider it a good place to work temporarily or part-time if you're attending school.
good,"Good entry level job to gain experience in a retail setting. Will be able to interact with all types of customers, different ages and demographics. Work with a wide variety of co-workers. Pay is average, specialty sales does not pay enough considering requirements of the job. Great part-time job, but my experience was that raises and advancement were not based on skills and selling ability, but by conforming and not having a non orange opinion."
good,"i dont really remember alot about working here... i remember they had alot of people(costumers) stealing stuff. some of there managers were rude, and their pay sucked."
good,"I worked on a pilot project team. it had it's share of issues and was consistently evolving as it went along. It is most likely very different from when I worked, so I cannot give a proper review."
good,"This was my first job. It was fun and fast paced. the only reason that i left was the management. They refused to work around my college class schedule because I had an online class due Sundays. When i asked for Sunday nights off, they gave me the run around and basically said they couldn't because they had to work with everyone else's schedule. As if mine wasnt important. They are great managers, they just dont care about your schedules."
good,Working night shifts at The Home Depot had it's ups and downs. Adjusting to the sleep schedule takes practice but with the help of some great coworkers and coffee I had a great experience developing my people skills and getting exercise.
good,"The management has to be your friend in order to receive hours.  With all of your hard work there will be no room for advancement or even something as simple as a department change. I've received about 4 homer awards for catching people at self check out stealing over $800 in retail, and if I was a supervisor, me personally I would have talked to me about becoming some kind of security for shoplifters but no I remained ringing people up lol.  This job is definitely for college students who live with parents,  no children,  or bills unless you are management.  I was even accused for stealing a customers wallet before they reviewed the tape.  Thank God for technology and for my mom for raising me not to be a thief because I probably would have been in jail. I definitely resigned after that one though!"
good,I worked at Home Depot for a part-time job while I was deciding to go back to school.  It was a pain that at that time they didn't hire you to work in the city that you lived in.  I don't know if that's still their hiring practice or not.  The job itself was straight forward.  I worked the registers and once you had the computer systems down it was a mostly enjoyable job except on holidays when we were understaffed.
good,"Good management at the location where I worked. However, it’s still a min. wage job. I think I got paid $8.75 an hr. Very fast paced during the holidays but other days are painfully slow and boring."
good,"for me the hardest part is that you have to be out in garden and suffer hot and cold wheather. We do not have the conditions like a heater or an air conditioner out there, so we have to stay outside and suffer the hard weather, We have talked to management about it and they do not seem to care at all.  the other part is that only management and supervisors get the credit and we as cashiers and customer service are not a part of their team."
good,"A typical day at work is being none stop busy, I learned to move fast and double check everything you do. Document everything, management is all depending on you. Workplace culture is like any other, the hardest part of the job is trying to please everyone. The most enjoyable part of the job, is when you find someone willing to help you."
good,"Great place to work, 100% family oriented, excellent communication between management and employees and a clean and safe atmosphere. low pay, no hours"
good,"I did like the work there because the Home Depot is an amazing outlet. The project shut down so I knew I needed to find another job."
good,"Fun place to with, with good benefits. They offer profit sharing as well as stock. Very good at acknowledging employees hard work. Opportunity to move around with advancement."
good,its not a bad job a lot of favoritism as far as promotions and advancement goes the health benefits are ok but expensive 90+ every two weeks for low coverage
good,Supervisor of a staff of 5. Review and forecast departmental weekly and monthly budget versus prior year to date budget. Administrative duties may include special projects as needed by store manager.
good,to many managers handing out jobs to do that many times was not able to complete. The best thing for me was helping out the customers needs. I made it fun for them and me.
good,I have extensive knowledge in home repairs.It is very rewarding to help explain how  to solve home owners problems to people with limited knowledge.They are always so greatfull.
good,"A typical day is getting changed into your apron and immediately going into your shift, with little to no briefing, as to what needs to be immediately done. And thus, you have to manually go through lists to make sure customers received phone calls or need to be called about their services; all while performing the duties of  cashier and Return Center. Once got into the rhythm it wasn't as bad, but lots of failed communication on the managerial chain results in this not being a fun job."
good,Hiring friends and giving them the better shifts. No recognition for the hard work we put in everyday. Yearly raise of 30 cents is a joke compared to the amount of work you do. Trying to solve an issue with management will have you written up for speaking your mind.
good,"pretty good place to work at if youre just starting, not necessarily a place you can pay rent with but the benefits are good. Allergies could be a mess cause theres a lot of dust but definitely the workers have each others backs"
good,It was just a job. There was little or no interaction. Working and learning all facets of the flooring dept was very good. Too bad they supervisor changed.
good,"I typically worked late evenings and Saturday mornings.  Home Depot is very flexible with their scheduling.  It was very slow paced and often only one or two individuals would check out in the evening, so a three hour shift could feel like a ten hour shift.  The store I worked at went through management changes and morale was low.  Often, departments were understaffed and customers were frustrated because there was no support to assist customers with locating supplies.  Even though scheduling was flexible, Home Depot would often schedule me to close at 10:00pm and expect me to open at 6:00am the next day.  Our team meetings were fun and enjoyable."
good,"Great place for newer retail managers.  Very Cookie Cutter style.  A very structured and follow the SOP only place.  Very little room for someones ideas and creativity.  If you are in you are in, if your not you will feel it!"
good,"Home Depot is a good place to work and have fun. good learning experience, for all ages. Good place for part time work or full time work.Good for flexible  hours."
good,Very fast paced but its hard to advance yet the work is easy.cross training is important to the home depot. You might change job fuctions a cople time throughout the day
good,"In my department Home Depot Exteriors there's need to be more proactive regarding to the job duties, and communication. The amount of work that is required doesn't match the pay. High upper management turnover in 3 years."
good,"worked overnights stoking shelves with inventory, somewhat fast paced, somewhat relaxed, work independent or with group, coworkers were cool, management was ok."
good,Good place to work for students. Wish the pay was better and has more opportunities to advance in a career there.  Enjoy helping customers when they need help and learning new things.
good,"Loved the work, hated the politics and management. You are a number not a person.  THE STORE always comes first no matter what might be happening in your own life."
good,I have a great time working at this store. I felt like everyone was part of family.  I learned something new everyday. I recommend this job to anyone.
good,A lot is asked from employees and managers from the corporation. Although career advancement is possible it was too slow moving for me and that is why I left.
good,I learned many things while working here things such as how to use power tools and I also feel confident to take on a DIY project to build something interesting.
good,"Good benefits for full time employees. part time employees get half the benefits full timer's get."
good,"Good company to work for, hard work is recognized and rewarded, but you may struggle for hours to being with. I found the culture of the company to be very positive and diverse."
good,"It was a seasonal job. Intake from receiving, stocking things. Try to avoid stocking the fertilizer isle. It will give you a headache. Only pays minimum wage, plus the bonuses which are a scam."
good,"I enjoyed working at The Home Depot because I enjoyed meeting new people.  Also, most  associates working there made it feel like we're one huge family.  It's  was a fun job only when it's under the right management.  I've seen managers come and go and I can testify that you can feel the difference in the environment that a store manager can make."
good,"Customer Service , Customer Service and much more Customer Service. Between customers it is a must that you try and maintain cleanliness of floor and orderly presentation of the merchandise."
good,"Home Depot Is excellent in customer service, material of all kind that has to do with home improvement are available and sound advice. Also available is all major brands of home appliances, all brands of power and hand tools. Also available is customer in-home installations of heating and cooling systems, hot water heaters, windows and doors and overhead garage doors."
good,Good environment in design area. Supervision was effective. Excellent support from special services support staff. Received useful feedback from coworkers and management staff. Excellent sales systems.
good,"The Home Depot is one of the lowest paid retailers. They have wonderful employees, but refuse to pay a wage that at least is comparable to every other retailer in the same position"
good,"I enjoyed working at The Home Depot.  It was fun  to work, a little stressful at times but overall it's a good company.  The one major drawback is that it is very hard to acquire a full time position.  I worked there 3 years and never really given an opportunity to work full time."
good,Typical day is usually pretty steady customer flow and usually under staffed to meet customer demand. Multi tasking in multiple areas with high demand for wordlists to be completed
good,Good place to work If you like to interact and help customers. A balanced environment busy and calmed at the same time. Holiday themes and a lot of team work involved.
good,"A typical day starts with unloading freight and distribution."
good,I'd say Home Depot has an excellent training course before you actually go on the floor to help any of their customers. They make sure the employee has some knowledge of what his/her department carries .
good,Cut throat environment. Worked a minimum of 55 hours a week which turns into 70. Culture is tough but fair. Good values but inconsistent leadership and poor communication.
good,"Friendly place to work for. good people, employee oriented culture."
good,"My supervisor would be yelled at for the stupidest things and luckily for us, he didn't take it out on us. Its like the management is completely unaware of what goes on, on the floor."
good,"A typical day at Home Depot would be me assisting and checking out customers. Stocking product, assisting managers in opening and closing the store.  Although there were good experiences working there, there were were also bad experiences. Often I would have to report to the manager about customers trying to steal products from the store. I learned about how to deescalate certain situations where there are unhappy customers. The most enjoyable part about the job at Home Depot was seeing the satisfaction on the customer's faces."
good,"Not a bad place or environment, just not paid a living wage for hard work. There are different shifts for different job types, the overnight workers seem to be looked down upon by the day crews."
good,"I enjoyed the opportunity to perfect my facilitator skills while holding the role of district trainer in the Nashville, TN market.  The ability to interact and teach large groups for new hire associates was a fulfilling position."
good,"Disorganized, customers and some management rude to cashiers especially. "
good,"A lot of office politics and unrealistic expectations. That said, still better than other places I have worked at. There is no union, so job security is up in the air. The benefits are hidden."
good,"Overall, it was a decent place to work. There was always changes being made and not enough communication. Management is not consistent on many levels."
good,"worked nights, work was repetitive, endless, boring, and non-challenging. good job if you need money, but not a good career. mostly stocked shelves and used a garbage compactor"
good,"I was very successful kitchen and bath designer. I love customer service and developed a strong customer base the years I was there."
good,"always something different every day"
good,"Not really my atmosphere, associates were sometimes rude, management wasn't really doing what management needed to do.  At times I felt as if I was the manager when the manager would make me do the paperwork he was assigned to do"
good,"A busy place to work with very little down time.  Middle Management turns over on a regular basis. Good to employees, and decent locations. Holiday weekends they were very good about having catering for the employees."
good,"Great co-workers. It is psychical work but most co-workers are friendly and helpful. Customers can slow you down when your trying to pull orders. Overall it is a good place to work, but its low wages."
good,Was a fantastic place ro work until a new store manager was brought in with her own agenda! Store quickly went down hill! My first 3 years at the store where great! No drama and everyone working together!
good,"I have a great supervisor and coworkers with a well balanced work ethic, we all do what is needed to run things smoothly. We get a variety of customers from professionals to the first time Do It Yourself person and we have to listen to what they are doing so in turn we can rent the right tool for their job. I have learned how to work, run, clean and do small maintenance on more than 200 tools from a cordless drill to a mini excavator E26. I know what each tool is used for and that helps me to better qualify my customers. I do rental and repair contracts on a daily basis. Upper management does not have the want, need or understanding of tool rental, our job is done without their support. It is a multi cultural place with many different people from all walks of life. The hardest part of my job is some of the heavy lifting but for the most part I have nothing bad to say about my job, I love it. The most enjoyable part is my customers and the great relationships I have with them, and just meeting so many different people every day."
good,"My time at Home Depot was short. I worked on the overnight freight team, and dealt with a lot of adversity. all of the pressure to get the store nice and clean and stocked was on us. we were held at a lot higher standard than the daytime employees. I did not like that."
good,"Home Depot needs to work on pay and raises. I worked at HD for over two years and only received a 65 cent raise. Not fair. I was a critical component in the my section, not fairly rewarded."
good,There is a lot of work to be done everyday. Compare to other stores the benefits are good. Need to focus more on the employees like they do with managers.
good,"Mostly part time jobs only offered.  People need full time employment and benefits to support their families"
good,"Have to be a friend or suck up to management to get a promotion,  they don't go off of hard work and dedication,  if your black it is hard to move up to assistant store manager and almost impossible the be a store manager I know first hand."
good,Overall its a great company to work for. The pay isn't the greatest but its ok if its a second job or if you have multiple incomes in your household. Working there was a great experience for me.
good,"I enjoy working there but there is no merit based increases in pay.  After an annual review, you get a minor merit based raise but even if you go above and beyond everything that is asked of you, I feel you do not get the compensation you deserve, as there is a maximum amount you can get, and it isn't much. The other employees are awesome and the management is good too."
good,The staff overall was friendly and outgoing. Management wasn't the best at the time and very unknownable. They would try to make the store fun with moral. There training program for department heads was excellent
good,A typical work day is busy. The face paced environment which was not bad. I learned to be competitive and do management positions and  manager positions.  The culture is very diversed.  The hardest job was the lifting of the lumber and acting like a man in different job titles.
good,ok company to work for. Just a job.  Work the overnight shift.  As stated earlier it is an average job.  Enjoy working there the pay is not great.  That's why I'm looking for something else
good,"All in all its a great place to work if you like a active fast paced job and meeting new people, but there are many downsides to working for this company so i do not recommend it."
good,"Some stores have very supportive management but for the most part, the managers don't help with the associates. They hide in an office. There are a select few managers that actually earn their keep and help out to make the associates successful. However, unless you can figure things out on your own, don't go there."
good,"busy customer service, management unorganized, unclear who was in charge daily, Co- workers fun to work with. Everyone being on the same page for daily output. working with my peers."
good,"Fast paced, stressful, crazy hours, management isn’t the best, low pay fo what you have todo on a daily bases. Work with a lot of customers who are usually upset and not sure what they need."
good,I’ve work with Home Depot for a year now. I quickly learn 6 out of 13 departments. I because the top seller in my store and number in my district. I've trained department heads as they enter their new position as well as associates. I have 6 years of managerial experience.  I have over 15-homer badge (you get these when you are doing something right) Whenever I apply for a promotion I either get overlooked or pushed to the side. I believe it due to poor management.
good,"Set goals for performance and deadlines in ways that comply with company’s plans and vision and communicate them to subordinates"
good,"Great people but poor management. Pay is not competitive but if you lack skills it's a great way to gain some. Management is removed from the day to day, and more or less misses the forest for the trees. There is no real culture here, no sense of belonging it's mostly a day to day grind though some of the other workers brighten this up with good attitudes. The overall feel of the help desk is one of many disorganized cliques that don't work well together. Upper management seems removed from the day to day.High turnover is expected and nothing is done to curb it."
good,I was hired as a part time freight associate.  They provide enough hours for someone who is just looking for part time work during school or summer months. They are flexible and will work with you. The work wasn't anything you couldn't handle and was good hard working experience.
good,"Home Depot was a good place for work years ago, but the under the current management I would think twice."
good,"I have always shopped at The Home Depot and was looking forward to working there.  However, there was no chance for advancement or full time positions."
good,The job isn't bad. They pay could be a little better. The company could also do better with promoting from within. The culture overall with the company is amazing!
good,Ok it was a ok job but some of the leaders were younger and had poor leadership skills. If you want a fast paced job with a high work load and can deal with the stress than I recommend this job for you.
good,Not always given the correct tolls and labor to complete goals on a daily basis.  Would be called daily even after I clocked out with questions from management.
good,I would never work at our local home Depot again unless management has changed hands. The hours and the pay were extremely poor infact worse than anywhere I've ever worked.
good,"It's a very fast pace environment with high expectations. Has OK benefits but very irregular hours. As a result, it's difficult to plan anything other than work."
good,"Poor advancement opportunities unless you play corporate politics. Pay and Hours inconsistent, involuntarily bumped down to part-time. 25 cent raises at most, yearly."
good,"The Home Depot is a good company.  Don't get me wrong, it's a nice place to work IF you aren't looking to provide for yourself or your family financially.  If you just need extra money it's a great job.  I started as a cashier and moved around to another department. No raise, more hours, a huge amount of responsibility with zero training.  I liked the new position but unfortunately The Home Depot rarely hires anyone full time.  So even considering I thrived in the new position, it was given to an inexperienced associate who was already full time. If you want to be a store manager then work here. If you don't, then do not bother.  The political climate is STRONG at the Home Depot. I saw manager after manager leave to another store.  People who didn't even do their job as department heads are now running their own stores.  It's all about the money.  $10 to start.  After 18 months I was making $10.30. Not a liveable wage.  They do offer great flexibility in scheduling.  For students or retirees it's a great job.  Be careful, if you're not part of the in crowd you will get nowhere."
good,Working at home depot help gain a lot of knowledge about the products they sold and helped me became a handy man. It helped me understand customers better and helps me to interact with them in a positive manner.
good,Working at Home Depo sometimes was just better to keep to yourself. It has a great environment with the clients and the staff. A great amount if diversity in the establishment which is always a plus.
good,"I loved my co-workers and management was mostly fair over all. I loved working on decor ideas for flooring, window treatments and paint with my customers. The hardest part of the job were difficult, hard to please clients."
good,The home Depot is an okay company to work for but the hire mostly just part-time employees and it is pretty difficult to get a full-time spot anywhere. The company does a pretty good job at caring about their employees.
good,A good place to work for as many hours as you request per week. Paid sick days and paid time off depends on how many hours you have worked. Must like helping people.
good,"Great store manager was replaced with much less skillful one. "
good,"Although the work place was clean and tidy, the immediate management was disastrous in managing day to day operation. Morale loss was quite quick when I had to work around my manager"
good,"I was usually busy, sometimes there wasn't enough to do cause there would be to many people working at a time. the weekend were the most busy for most stores."
good,You won't have a set schedule if you're part-time. Even when there are full-time positions available they still will give you the runaround. You'll get around 27 or less hours per week and when you ask for more hours there is still no compromise. It's good if you need something part-time with low hours.
good,Crazy place to work at times. Customers always in rush for something they forgot the first time they were there. Always busy which I liked. Company was outstanding in giving me the time of I needed while trying to look after my ailing father.
good,"A typical day at work is easy, I learned how to do returns/refunds, management needs training, workplace culture is friendly and relaxed, nothing hard about this job, most enjoyable part of this job was on weekends when customers would bring in their dogs."
good,"Lower end jobs such as cashiers and stockers is a good job if you are currently in school or other training.  They will usually work with you hours so that you can do both.  The management can get overbearing sometimes though with ""necessary procedures""."
good,It was an ok experience. i found it very hard to be noticed at the position i was working but they do allow you to apply at other positions within the store which is nice.
good,Loading and unloading truck and pulling down materials  and filling orders  taking care orders that in to the stores over holiday . Everyone had special ditties in the ward house cleaning and keeping the building clean
good,Not a happy place to work long-term. There is a very negative culture among management and the associates. Most employees don't get enough training...
good,Family like environment... Often goals are hard to reach in the time frame following a successful period.... Morale and safety are priorities as well as profits.
good,Home Depot has numerous good roles and several roles where they place a lot of the workload responsibility on you. You are required to work like a machine and do whatever it takes to get the job complete.
good,"The Home Depot Has Its Ups And Downs But For The Most Part, Can Be Enjoyable. The Customers Can Be Really Fun, Friendly People Or Rude As Ever. You Never Know What You're Going To Get. We Have Some Great Managers Who Actually Care About And Then Some Not So Great Managers Who Show They Only Care About A Bigger Check For Themselves. So Once Again, You Never Know What You're Going To Get. We Have Fun Associates Who Can Make Your Shift Go By Fast, You Have A Productive Work Day, And Go Home Stress Free. Then You Have The Not So Great Ones. So............ You Decide!"
good,"The service desk deals with returns, customer issues, delivery, will-calls, online orders, phone calls to customer and vendor and special orders. in any given day you deal with most if not all this areas. this is extremely stressful and you have to deal with issues in a timely and efficient manner."
good,I believe that home depot is a good place to work for a steady paycheck. the biggest downside is the pay should be more. sense I have worked there the starting pay has decreased and been caped at below 10 dollars an hour.
good,They will try to move you out if you are not well liked or if you do not jump high enough for the management group. Not the best environment or culture.
good,Was a very fun place to work.....I love working with people and trying to fix their problems. Employees some were good and some really were out to get you and back stab and start drama.
good,"The company takes care of their employees and provides meals, family events, etc. The pay was good for a warehouse associate with no education, but as a coordinator or someone with a degree, the pay was low."
good,"Picking orders per customer requests for the duration of day so it can be shipped out. The hardest part of this job is being able to pick the amount of production that had to be picked in a days time, but I must say there was always someone there to lend a helping hand."
good,The Home Depot is a decent job with decent pay but tends to over hire and cut hours of employees to barley any. The benefits are good but some management gets away with poor treatment of people below them. I have had a supervisor throw a scanner on the floor in anger only to have a head cashier spend 45 minutes trying to fix it. Then the supervisor is rewarded by being up for promotion while the head cashier gets reprimanded for being in the way when she was there first.
good,"Home Depot is a great company to work for. Although, advancing your career is done on a ""who you know basis"" rather than a ""how you perform basis"".I would recommend home depot for students and people who have an area of expertise that relates to what Home Depot has to offer."
good,Management was horrible. Nothing else was too bad but managers were not pleasant. Hours weren't always great but pay was okay for retail. Was happy for a while until they stop seeing you as a person and more of an income.
good,"I've been a part of THD for the past 2.5 years. I've grown a lot within the company, allowing me to be pushed to the best of my ability and really allowing myself skills to shine."
good,"ideal for those looking part time work, and have no hopes of full time for many, many years. I enjoyed the people i worked with excellent family atmosphere. Education , nor experience, nor drive will help you advance in the Home Depot Structure"
good,"I work in Commercial Sales, typical day includes helping commercial customers (contractors), signing up contractors for commercial credit, selling special order items, etc"
good,A lot of people who are hired that don't want to work and very little teamwork overall. The location I worked for had a high turnover with hires. The starting pay is good at $10.00 an hour.
good,"Decent place to work, not a lot of opportunity for advancement or furthering career at my RDC. There are to many people trying to advance on one position and the pay isn't comparable to the work that is put in."
good,although it was in another city -I enjoyed the store atmosphere. . Went through a lengthy training but felt my strong points were not even touched. wanted to do more  there.
good,each day at home depot was always a different. there was always different customers asking for different type of needs. most time i would be on the lift bringing pallets of concrete  or large stacks of wood down to replenish the supply
good,Each manager has a different way they want the store run.   Would be nice if they were all on the same page.  Most of the people you meet are fun to work with and will go out of their way to help you. If you do not want to do a retail job then stay away from this company
good,consistently stopped by angry customers. thrown into departments and barely shown or tought about the products. honestly you learn more from the customers that are usually landscapers that are there everyday. management takes forever to respond to you. one of the managers in particular will curse at you if they are in a bad mood. known for losing and firing good employees.
good,"The campaign you're giving to work in is at least 180 days out, you could not reach your goal for the month due to customers failing to make a payment on their account"
good,"Raises effectively keep pace with inflation and nothing more. Should be considered a part time employer for that second job on the weekends or a few nights a week,"
good,If you are looking for a job that works around you school schedule than most Home Depots are good with this as their primary workforce is part time. They have a decent benefit package but the pay could be better in some departments as the new person hired in a department that does a lot of work gets paid the exact same thing as the person that may be a cashier and doesn't have the responsibility of the floor associate.
good,"Loved working with the Electrical Contractors and learned the industry to the point they thought I was an Electrical Contractor at some point."
good,"the company was good overall but the management within the store played major roles in favoritism, and single out certain people. They should be promoting people that will better the store, not promoting friends."
good,Overall a decent place to work. The benefits were bad as there is no employee discount. Pay was insufficient for the level of work/effort. Toxic work environment. Unskilled managers who don't help their people.
good,Great job for young individuals looking for hands on work experience.  Gave accommodating job training and and work skills to use for future endeavors.   No room for advancement.
good,It was a great experience with better co-workers who to this day I would and will hangout with. Job culture was on another level but unfortunately couldn't quite sustain me financially.
good,"I started at an entry level position and loved working here. As I grew within the company and learned more skills, management wanted to exploit me for more work and less pay."
good,"It was a good job , great experience. Meeting different people everyday , isn't as easy sometimes when busy , but it's an easy job . Some customers aren't so nice but try to help them out anyway you can."
good,"It was tiring emotionally and physically. A percentage of my superiors were bad apples, and another percentage I liked. They mainly determined if you were gonna have a good day or not by their attitude and division of break times. There was a lot of pep talk feeling void of any real compensation for your hard work. I mean, it's retail. But it's a big company and hard to keep track of everyone, so the little guys will be left in the dust if you don't truly and consistently apply yourself despite everything. Good for a first job or a backup job."
good,"Part-time usually consists of 4 to 5 hour days. Full-time is either an opening or closing shift.  You can learn the different departments if you want to, so that is a plus.  Management displays a lot of favoritism, especially towards the young people.  You get to know and enjoy working with your customers, and that is very enjoyable.  Was a very nice place to work for a couple of years, but went downhill with management change."
good,basic customer service job for someone looking for steady routine work. little room for advancement or raises. would be good for student or part time employee
good,"The co-workers are nice and helpful. Management takes care of employees by arranging lunch or other stuff once a week. Managing decisions, however, are weak and instead of resolving problems people pass them down to the next shift."
good,"The employee dynamic at certain stores is fantastic, at others it seems almost toxic. Depending on management, you either have to follow store policies, or they throw them out the window even though you as the employee, if you do not follow Home Depot protocall can be fired. Part time is a good thing, but full time employees seem rather taken advantage of on a regular basis, and if you have schedule restrictions you will either have to fight for those restrictions to be enforced, or get any hours at all within those restrictions."
good,"After almost 24 years, I've become somewhat cynical about working for the Home Depot. The physical demands of my job, along with my cerebral palsy, have taken a toll on my body. I am currently capable of working only 12 hrs/wk."
good,"My days at the Home Depot call center were filled with helping store employees figure out what was wrong with their computer systems."
good,"Home Depot was somewhat pleasant, co-workers were always friendly. Management seemed to pick and choose who they wanted. They recognized most employees, frequently bought us food."
good,"Have regular customers that come in an shop just to see me."
good,"It can be a great place to work if you are part time. Just do not let yourself get overworked. You will only get paid so much no matter what you do. Full time work here can be brutal physically, emotional and psychologically. It is not the worst place in the world to be employed but do not expect to reap rewards that are equal to your work output and/or worth."
good,"Home Depot in itself is a great company to work for."
good,"Company constantly ventures to different experiments in the asset protection field and therefore laying off people repeatedly. Company can also be very political and for the most recent, ran by store operations instead of knowledgeable Asset Protection Individuals. Once promoting with in the asset protection field,  there is a road block for advancement."
good,"one week can have 6 hours another week you could have 26 hours."
good,"Retail environment -goal is to dominate home improvement market through local and national TV, Print and radio as well as You tube "" How to"" videos."
good,"The Home Depot pays well for a mindless job - meaning you don't think about work once you get home (unlike a lawyer or doctor). This is a great job for someone who is willing to work, however is not a good place for the faint of heart."
good,"The Home Depot is a great company to work for and enjoyable because of the live and vibrant culture it brings to the sales floor especially in a warehouse environment. The management does get involved with their associates but only up to a certain extent. All in all Home depot does not really have a workable pace for advancement within the company tends to drag too long and when acquiring for a position whether its within the same store or not , is when you can never receive a proper answer , which causes associates in the company to think that the only placement for advancement is through favoritism"
good,Working for Home Depot offers opportunity to learn about each department and services the store offers. Advancement into management is also available to those who are serious. All employees are expected to be there every weekend and holidays which interferes  with family life..
good,It was nice working there. The customers were not so hard to handle. It was the coworkers that gave mixed messages. Hard to settle in. Management was slow. I changed my cashier password on the training computer. I was given a hard time about that. Not sure why. It was my privacy I think.
good,"I was a part time cashier for 3 years, I was always requesting and putting in for a full time position and was always told none available, or no. "
good,"Typical day at work is usually pretty busy. There's always something do to. Management is pretty good, can be understanding and is there to lead a hand when help is needed. Enjoyable part of my job is how everyone works as a team and how was help each other out."
good,"management is very hit or miss some managers are good while others do very little  and complain that nothing is happening the way it is suppose to. Not very much room for advancement, you could very much get stuck in the same department for a very long time doing the same job."
good,"My biggest concerns with working at Home depot is lack of manager interaction, buts tons of managers. No one is every happy with their schedule, even full time people seem to have rotating schedules."
good,Very unorganized puts lots of stress between coworkers because of not enough coverage. Company wants you to do more but won't pay you more. If you are thinking of working here get ready to work hard.
good,"Good job culture."
good,"work was great at first... then after the 6 month mark, the OT quit happening... and the raises slowed up.   now they expect you to work your tail off while they run the crews short handed."
good,"Poor management has lead to disgruntled employees. The regular employee has little to no chance of advancing because this store is all about the right cliques and who you know, rather than your knowledge and abilities."
good,I liked being a cashier at Home Depot.  The time went by fast.  Diversity of working in different departments.  Working in garden in the Summer was a fun part of the job. The time would fly when the store was busy.
good,"Very fast paced, what I learned while working here is  keep to yourself nobody really has your back. The management was poor, the moment they needed a favor we was quick to do so but the moment the employees needed a favor or a change in things it was a problem and alot of back lash. hardest part was having other people tell you how your job should be done."
good,"Within 6 months of working garden, I was asked if I wanted to switch to full time but said no due to school and pay is not worth it. Management is not the best. The hardest part of my job was probably loading heavy pavers. I currently enjoy my new department."
good,Didn't advance in job. I enjoyed those I worked with in the department. Enjoyed working with the customers and tools. However I was wrongfully dismissed.
good,"Easy straight forward job"
good,"It was a good retail job, your management paid attention to you and people generally recognized how hard you worked. However, it was stagnant,  people who worked there, stayed there. And because of this, your growth as customer service associate was typically neutered."
good,Staff was constantly being moved around to other departments to cover shifts without proper training or notice. This made customer service expectations challenging. I am a hard worker who is always willing to help but I need the tools to do the best job possible.
good,"Go to work, open tills for cashiers, schedule break and lunches for cashiers, picked up money from register when it had too much. Management was okay. The hardest part of the job was when cashiers would call in sick and I would have to run the front end almost by myself. The most enjoyable part was the customers."
good,"The hours here sucked for a single, working mom. They insisted that I work most evenings. I didn't have any say in the matter. Job and environment ok."
good,a good place to grow and move on for me .i worked in the hardest dept. and enjoyed the challenge.I learned so much and advanced my skills.time for something new the next step up new challenges.
good,"-Outils de travail jamais en bonnes états"
good,The paint department was fine and I learned a lot working here. The problem I had was the advancement opportunities were not for all the employees. I felt that was the issue all the way up through management.
good,The Home Depot is normally a fun and friendly place work.  The pay is not the best and THD has a hard time keeping associates.  I think the reason is because of the non consistent schedule and hours required.  This does not allow any flexability for the associate.
good,"Usually job is chill, but they always want something more."
good,"High turnover.  If the GM is good Home Depot's DC's are a good place to work.  If the GM is not good then the goals constantly change and it is difficult to lead your team.  For example We preached take the time to do the job right,  Then it was hurry up go faster.  back and forth."
good,"The benefits are excellent from my standpoint, and the management is good, however, the lack of accountability is overwhelming, as well as the unethical culture of fellow employees."
good,The location I worked at was very busy and fast paced. I was a cashier and worked in the customer service desk. I enjoyed helping new cashiers; it made time go by fast.
good,"The work was very sample to understand. Hardest thing to deal with was customer with rude behaviors. Work environment was always peaceful, and very flexible with your hours."
good,"Trabajo estable después del 3er contrato."
good,"Can be a good work environment depending on management. You work hard, but get paid little. Great benefits if you can get on full-time. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet all day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the appreciation you get - especially from the regular customers."
good,Management has too many favorites.  the rules do not apply to these favorites.  Management is not consistent.  One day you are told to do something and the next to you are counseled for doing the same thing.
good,"They try to do much more with so much less. Their need to hire anybody who can pass the background and drug test, further discounts the weak pay. Remember, someone has to train these marginal hires."
good,This is a culture of power struggle positions. Young people who become Department Supervisors and think they own the store. Then they are cut throat to be an Assistant Store Manger. Once an ASM it's about what you can do to undermine the Store Manger and get his or hers job.
good,I worked at different locations and each locating is different. Some locations are great to work and others not so much. To grow in the company you have to be able to relocate.
good,Work with a team to get trucks unloaded and put away in a timely matter.  This will help you work on your team skills.  The more you work as a team the more you accomplish.
good,"Great place to work, great pay,but fast paced, great if you're a younger guy, because they will dismiss you if you can't keep up with tha other guys, Loved job great hours and pay, but jobs no garantee,"
good,"As a cashier you are designated to stay at your station to help customers efficiently. The hardest part of the job is standing but you do get breaks, just be sure to wear comfortable shoes."
good,Handled all customer disputes to a reasonable resolution. Managed 12 cashiers and 6 lot attendants. Controlled flow of online orders assuring they were properly picked and delivered in a timely fashion.
good,"Start my day with planing how the night will play out. Attempting to over come moral obstetrical, assist the facility manager with any questions she has and many forms and procedures she doesn't know. Trouble shoot and problem solve constantly. If someone doesn't remember a process or has a question about the process answer said questions and sometime provide examples of process or even do process for them at least one time. Control the flow of inventory in the building while performing piece counts and relocating material. Compiling a daily report of all activates completed threw out the night review by day shift. Forecast any obstetrical that the next shift may need to be notified of."
good,"Im sure it depends on the store your at but at the particular one ive worked at for a couple years (owasso). Its not what you know, its not how hard you work, not how long youve been with the company. If your willing and able to bs your way in with management you can skate by doing little to nothing. New employees get brought in at a starting pay very close to people that have worked there for years. Sometimes even more."
good,Complete lack of solid answers to almost any question. Negative mood all around. Co-workers are the most unprofessional I've ever worked with. Worst job I've had.
good,"Fun place to work but hours were not easy with home life. I enjoyed working with the staff there. No real advancement and no advancement with pay."
good,Depending on which department you work in and if you are a favorite of the managers will determine how fast you advance in the company. If you are of little importance to a manager they don't really take the time to help you. They will joke and be friends but don't acknowledge the work you do. A lot of the department heads are usually no where to be found half of the time and leave you with no help.
good,"I worked at THD for two and a half years. During thait time I worked for three different store managers and seven different assistant managers.  When I was hired I was paid $8.50 an hour.  When I resigned, I was making $10 an hour."
good,I have nothing to Say anything out the company. The people that work there are great people and like I said management can use some work. The culture of the company is changing.
good,"merchandising at home depot:"
good,"I enjoyed this place of employment while I was there, however I felt unfairly treated towards the end, given all of my time and dedication to the company. Being the most highly awarded staff member at the store didn't do me any justice. New management really dimmed the environment and comradery at the store. I am  grateful for the opportunities this job afforded m, along with the skills gained on the job."
good,I found myself very often with nothing to do and always looking for some one to engage myself there. The training at Home Depot is excellent however it seemed to be unorganized at times.
good,It is a good place to work if you are in college and just need to make some quick bucks. Hours are horrible. Sometimes I have to work until 12 AM on Saturday and then comes back at 5 AM on Sunday. The manager favors when it comes to weekly hours.
good,Nice place to work you can learn a lot about how to take care of things around the house from customers and coworkers alike I had I great time working there
good,"informative, hours are not guaranteed, hours mostly depend on season, can cross-train which I did to increase hours. friendly associates, team players"
good,"Home Depot was a great experience, but I have to leave. There's little advancement and the work isn't something that you can see different everyday. It taught me many things, but I know it isn't for me."
good,"Running a specific department. I learned how to operated a fork lift."
good,It was a company with lots of young leaders and unsure of the direction they should go. They have some building to do and I hope they have made it a long way.
good,Good environment but management not very understanding or caring for there employees. They would favorite certain people and would treat the rest of them unfairly.
good,"Greet customers while entering and leaving the establishment, scan merchandise, process cash, credit card, and check payments, issue receipts and refunds, maintain clean and tidy checkout areas, pleasantly deal with customers to ensure satisfaction, practice of safe work habits"
good,"Home Depot will start you off with good hours and then they will cut all your hours to 20 if your part time. "
good,WORKING AT HOME DEPOT US LIKE HAVING A SECOND FAMILY. The associates are just awesome. Work loads are crazy and management doesn't really seam to care. Missing a day of work for family emergency could lead to you getting fired
good,"Good first job, nothing more. Be ready for very ignorant and impatient customers. Main thing is to just get to know where everything is located. Other than that you'll be fine."
good,"Working at The Home Depot has been a very unusual experience. "
good,if you can avoiding working here please do save yourself the trouble especially if you are over 25 this isn't the job for you. the pay is way too little to live off
good,Management  needs to make sure  supervisors are doing what needs to be done      in     every  department.     Supervisors need to be more on hands and talking to the crew       what needs to be  done or why this isn't done.     More interaction  so workers know  how they're doing.
good,The people I work with are kind and helpful. Customers are always in a hurry so it's fast paced and there's a lot to learn. The only downside is advancing in the company.
good,"This company is very corporate, the people I work with however are very kind and approachable; I can always ask for help and with them I am treated with respect."
good,"did not like co polices on pay and insurance. had a good times learning about products and tools and usage. telling customer about the tool, or parts and how to use them."
good,"Working Closely with senior leadership to improve and troubleshoot processes. To successfully lead different teams to accomplish our daily target goals. Also running the Operations successfully by utilizing the cross training process. To ensure as many quality hours being used and to build strong teammates. We have cut times that have to met daily at 5pm, 7pm and by 9pm. Watching the team work together and being successful with minimal supervision is very rewarding. I train associates on a variety of ways in the operations how to be proficient in solving issues. Always working on coaching up associates and giving them a sense of ownership. Associates feel good when they are rewarded and spotlighted for going above and beyond."
good,This is just another large chain store that has taken on the idea that the company is more imortant than it's employees. The raise structure is useless.
good,"The job I had at the Home Depot was a good job.  I enjoyed it very much.  I was a bookkeeper and office associate responsible for all deposits, entering employee time, reports for managers, assistant mangers and department supervisors.  I worked independently and was very good at my job.  The hardest part was if there was a family emergency, coverage was hard to find."
good,"Prepare items for shipment. Duties include assembling, addressing, stamping, and shipping merchandise or material; receiving, unpacking, verifying and recording incoming merchandise or material; and arranging for the transportation of products."
good,Managers at store level have very little decision making ability and are expected to be basically robots. This is a company that will implode due to the internal politics. People are placed in posisitions they're not qualified to be in and that happens throughout the company at every level. From CEO to store associates and everywhere in between.
good,"Great company and management, however promises for full time placement were never fulfilled.  The company needed seasonal employment and never filled permanent opportunities with contract employees."
good,the home depot is a really great place to work but some times you may feel under valued. they have great values. you get to learn a lot with home improvement projects.
good,Slow growth in advancement. After ASM level.  Store managers are typically rotated throughout the district and recycled instead of being removed based on poor performance.
good,"It's an OK place to work. It's fairly communist like most modern large scale businesses in America. They engage in a bit of vapid company propaganda, they don't really care about their, employees, treat them a bit like property or animals. Token programs to show ""They Care""."
good,"The company in itself is very good, with policy's benefiting its employees, but fellow coworkers can also be the downside to it as well, and with a management that doesn't always listen to concerns of its employees"
good,Only worked there a short time in the flooring department. Hours were good but the computer system way terrible and there was no one around when you needed help.
good,"Less hours"
good,"Good PT hours few FT positions available"
good,"At first I was working as a cashier for the first six months, then got promoted to full time and worked on the M.E.T team where my main duty was merchandising."
good,"Overall, Home Depot is an excellent company with growth potential. Several locations have a culture that does not promote a healthy work life balance. Managers are required to work 14 hour days to complete job requirements."
good,This position is ideal for a young person looking to get their foot into the door . However it becomes insufficient for those who are seeking to advance their careers . Job security is tenuous and the compensation is inadequate for anyone but a high schooler looking for a part time job.
good,Go work at McDonalds at least you get promoted there. was with this company for 4 years got the double platinum badge and they would not give me a full time position so I left for better pastures.
good,This is a great place to start a career. There are advancement opportunities but they are more about who you know and now what you know. If you can get with the right network of people homedepot is a great company to work for.
good,Employment opportunities this company represents some of the failures of the retail field. counter productive management that is reflective of poor implementations of policies and procedures.
good,"The direct manager was very good, but the upper management did not know what the job required.  So, were unable to give the support needed to do the job well."
good,"Working at Home Depot you had to work hard and show what you know , let them see your ideas. training was always good and plenty of that. Customers where always nice and had lots of questions."
good,Department was always short staffed and most of the time the customers were in a rush and were upset.  They choose set hours and give the full time employees the option to pick there time they want and they don't give them what they want.
good,"Productive."
good,"The workplace is simple for you to be able to gain experience for yourself. It helped me developed perfect customer assistance and product development as a whole. However, the work tends to get difficult at times but highly recommenced it as a good job to first start off from."
good,Always learning new item's that they have or you can get as a customer. I loved learning the tool rental and being in the garden.
good,A typical day would be filing shelves from the overheads and customer service.  I found it difficult at times to juggle all the different tasks asked of me but at the end of the day I know I gave everything I had to give me the satisfaction of a job well done.
good,I enjoyed working at the home depot. It was good exercise. I was in a big department so I stayed plenty busy. I got my forklift license while working there. The hardest part of the job is it pays very little and your annual raises are insulting.
good,"they will work you like a dog. customers are jerks, staff can be really good but can also be really bad. i liked working there at first but once i figured out everything, i didnt like how everything was going."
good,"Loved working with the Homedepot. Rhey iffver good beniftsb, good pay. Rhe people there are easy to get along with.. the supervisors make your day go by fast and good pay"
good,"A typical day at work included waiting on customers which I liked.  I had to learn to get a long with a lot of people from different backgrounds.  The management was really not there a lot.  There were phones to call them on but a lot of time they did not answer, which brings me to the hardest part of the job.  Being new, I did have questions.  I also had to get other departments to pull orders which a lot of times they refused to do.  I guess that was the hardest part.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers."
good,"The actual job itself was not bad. I actually enjoyed working at The Home Depot. The issue was the pay vs the work I was putting in. When selling expensive appliances and pretty much upselling them as I did, I made much more money at previous jobs when I worked pure commission than only making hourly. Even though I was the 2nd highest seller in the store, and I had only worked Part Time."
good,"I actually really enjoyed the job, I love customers and management was always good to work with. The drawback here is that the pay is barely over minimum wage and they work very hard to make sure that no employee that isn't management stays at just under full-time hours so that they aren't obligated to provide any insurance."
good,"Just a typical retail job.  Management was nice enough, though the hours sucked sometimes. Driving around the forklift and the other heavy equipment was a nice break from opening boxes of product and helping customers."
good,Customer service is a critical aspect of this company and your day to day task will require some level of it no matter what position you have been hired for. Management does not really do a good job of really noticing the certain associates that are constantly doing what needs to be done especially if you are more of background player and not in their face about it.
good,The upper management doesn't listen to the employees well. Pay wasn't good. I would have to re do assignments often due to lack of communication. The schedules were good though.
good,"Extensive training. Somewhat varied routine. Hires Senior citizens."
good,"Typical day is watering , assisting customers then stocking and doing inventory ."
good,"I was hired as an expert. The current staffing goal doesn't require expertise."
good,At the Home Depot the customer is always first. Their needs and wants are very important to the company and satisfying them is their top priority.
good,"I worked at the home depot for eight long years at four different stores. The people that you work with grows on you which is a good thing, then the management are over the top and the pay is usually low unless your in the circle of management. Good gig for young students or retired people."
good,"Ok place to work, company is focused on teambuilding and improving customer service. I really enjoyed working with my co-workers."
good,"I wore many hats at Home Depot.  I enjoyed working as a Merchandiser doing plan o grams, seasonal sets and maintaining vendor merchandise.  I enjoyed working in the vault handing the tills, change requests, administrative duties for upper management, running reports, tracking sales, balancing the vault daily closing the store."
good,Typical day for me is to return items ring customers up  get online orders. Call customers to let them know their items are in. Get customers that at in a bad mood and want you to perform magic tricks. You will get in one  day a customer who is in a rude mood. Management depends on the manager some have your back when you call for them others don't. I have learned about lumber products and what customers need as well as roofing. Also for the ESVS at home depot works. The hardest part is the little pay you get for the huge stress and headache sometimes migraines customers give you. The enjoyable part if you make a friend and you can see them and talk to them sometimes during your shift.
good,Decent place to work. Management demands a lot from individuals and don't realize how to motivate or encourage. Lots of Friends and if your not part of their network then your get passed up
good,"If you aren't comfortable working in a warehouse environment around hazardous equipment, this job probably is not the one for you! That being said if you are, this is one of the most laidback jobs you will ever work. non-management associates can wear jeans on the sales floor (at least at my store), we have payday luncheons, a christmas party at a location outside of the store. This feels like one big family. At the same time, there is a high turnover rate because the attendance policy does not cater to those with young families. Advancement goes as long as you know the right people and have nothing disciplinary on your record. Would love to stay on with this company but unfortunately due to circumstances beyond my control at this moment, I am unable to transfer stores."
good,Scheduling and allocation of resources was sometimes misguided. Many employees didn't want to be there. Definitely have to deal with eccentric customers.
good,"I enjoyed the crew I worked with, management was lacking and did little to help us. It was nearly impossible to plan things ahead due to the schedule."
good,There is not much room for advancement although they claim to hire from within.  Management sets excessive goals for leads and credit which are unreasonable for many employees due to the nature of their position.  Management seems to play favorites.
good,"Customer service is a fun place to work you deal with all kind of customers (good, mean, funny, unsatisfied, satisfied etc.). Customer service is a place that you always have something to do."
good,Many good people here and they gave us free food as well as tried to keep it upbeat but we were always understaffed and equipment was in a constant state of disrepair. Great for a first job but not for long term
good,"I liked working for Home Depot based on the fact that I like interacting with customers. However, my store management were not very good, and treated their employees like trash. So don't take my opinion and judge all the stores with it."
good,"If you are looking for a job that has a workout included with it this is a the job for you. People are friendly, customers can be so, so if they get what they want. You need to be a person that can do many things at once in order to stay on the side of management. Be prepared for working hrs that will not work with a family life."
good,Although my time was short. I felt like favoritism had a large role in my leaving. Breaks were hard to get.hours switch to make other people comfortable. And only cared about getting people to sign up for credit cards not any of their concerns.
good,"Overall it was an amazing job. I was there for almost three years. Amazing people to work with, excellent customers. I was working my way up to a Department Head position."
good,I learned a lot at this company. It was a fast paced environment with tons of responsibility. Management was difficult. There was very little appreciation of the massive effort needed to accomplish goals.
good,This company is a great company to work for if you do not mind settling. I wanted to move around in the company to work in a position in my field.
good,Very laid back work environment but never had enough associates to to the job. As of late they never hire full time associates and don't offer competitive wages therefore the turnover rate was always high.
good,"The work is standard retail fare, but the people are nice and management works with you. They only hire part time so they don't have to offer you medical benefits, which reflects poorly on them. Also they pay a very low wage."
good,"They customers were amazing and some of the co-workers i enjoyed a lot. I did not like the work hours of heat i worked in. They had me working outside all day in the scorching sun with minimal water. I could be inside for approximately 2 times a day for 15 minutes each during a 8 hour shift.  "
good,"I loved my job as I was trained in multiple departments. I was also the store captain of the community outreach programs. Great coworkers as well! Management was great the first couple years. Our store was #1 in the district which, given the location, was really awesome! However, they brought in a new store manager and she basically fired all the ASMs and brought in her own people. Our store #s dropped almost immediately. A lot of the full-timers also expressed repeated concerns as they felt they were being pushed out of the company,"
good,It all depends where you working it can be good and challenging you have to like working with the public if you are in the store and if your in the warehouse you must be able to handle the climate changes.
good,"The management staff at my store was not very good at all, very political and selfish, all about themselves. After 19 years with the company and 14 years in 1 store, I couldn't take it anymore and left."
good,It's a okay job with bad management. It is a lot of turnover in the management department. Nobody is on the same page. Managerial and professional skills are very questionable.
good,Worked for them for 24 years and was let go for 3 safety violations. Very disappointing for giving life and blood to a company.
good,"If youre anywhere in the front end, you deal with a high stress and low reward environment. There is more room to grow elsewhere in the store. It is harder to get lift licences if you are a female."
good,management never knows whats going on supervisors constantly argue with each other from other shifts associates never can get along with supervisors and over work the associates.
good,"The Home Depot is overall a good company. They offer various benefits not only for full-time employees but also part-time employees. These include health and dental, tuition reimbursement, and more."
good,It was a good environment. Enjoyed a lot. It was fun. People there treat you really good. You will have a lot of people that will support you with anything.
good,"Home Depot en si es una muy buena empresa, claro a nivel nacional pero en lo que se refiere a la tienda de ensenada sinceramente deja muho que desear, malas administraciones de parte de gerencia y de parte de RH no hay apoyo hacia el asociado."
good,The Home Depot is your average corporate box store. The management only cares about pushing numbers and not the actual work of the employees. Some locations were willing to work with your schedules but mostly they aim to be as thin staffed as possible in order to maximize profits.
good,"I have grown restless and unhappy within the last year or so. I feel there is no room for advancement unless you are the ""teacher's pet""."
good,I enjoy meeting a diversity of people.  I am also able to be myself here.  There are regular customers who prefer to check out through my line because of my customer service skills.  I appreciate these customers.
good,"On an average day I could be needed in almost any department. Management is average with some managers going above and beyond and some falling very short. Fellow employees range from very knowledgeable to highly incompetent and there are a few who flat out lie to the customers just to get a sale. The compensation is a joke being that they offer you minimum wage and ""benefits"" and there is no way to advance within the company unless you want to make it a career. It would take at least 20 years to even become a store manager let alone any real management within their corporate side."
good,it was a fun place to work .they didnt tell me that the job had ended i was still going to the work place thinking that i still had a job.
good,I really like work with the public and helping the home owner  find  what they need to complete their  project.  I was a cahier and I love my job most of the time.
good,What most I liked about the job was helping customers find what they needed.  What I didn't like about the job was that not all management was nice nor supportive.
good,"Landing in this area after leaving Chicago, I took what job was available--a cashier at Home Depot. Although this grind offers little to no options to put my college education to use, I'm thankful for the work."
good,"The Home Depot has a solid moral compass. They aren't about sacrificing their ethics for the sake of a sale, which I love. They also hire a diverse group of people and give a lot back to the community. They offer a lot of benefits and little treats for their employees. Although they push their associates to meet quota, they're realistic about what can and can't be accomplished"
good,"It was a big challenge, the biggest I had ever did, but I love doing it and would do it again in a heart beat. It was grate working with a well-known company as a freelancer. I can't wait to get started on the next one."
good,A typical day at work is fast paced with a 15 minute break and an 30 min to an hour lunch break. I didn't learn any physical work work from the job but I did learn how to better my customer service skills being that's the company's number 1 goal. The managers are nice. The most enjoyable part of the job is the free perks and food we get for the store celebrating their employees and holidays.
good,A typical six hour shift consists of several dozen customers asking where they may find one or more products to complete any type of home project. My main duties include packing down products from overhead storage and filling empty holes in shelves. Most days I move and stack pallets to fit customer needs.
good,"Unfortunately because I was only a seasonal employee I was often first on the chopping block when it came time to cut hours. I was promised part time work at 28 hrs/wk but was lucky to get 15. The coworkers and climate were nice, however given the size of the store it was difficult to get to know everyone."
good,"- great coworkers and warm, open-minded environment "
good,Home Depot has a lot of clicks.  Management is pitiful but pay is pretty decent.  Scheduling can be a nightmare but not the worst.
good,"my specific Home Depot is a very poorly organized and staffed, the standards of job execution is barely above minimal effort. "
good,"Being a Sales Associate comes with a lot of responsibilities; As a Sales Associate I have to make sure inventory is correct, make sure customers are finding everything they need. I also have to answer phone calls from my department and make sure I answered every question the customer has. I translate for more than one department and also the service desk. This position has made my customer service skills grow, it teaches me to provide the best customer service a person needs and wants."
good,"A great company to work for. You will constantly stay busy. Beware of disrespectful and snobby customers. The company's motto "" The customer is always right""so what ever the customer wants they get if they are dramatic enough."
good,"Walk the distribution floor to access the number and amount of truck needed to transport products to stores. Creating a schedule for these trucks to deliver during the times stores receive products. Put this information on spreadsheets for transportation personnel to follow, which trucks delivery to which stores."
good,"slightly higher than average pay, great benefits (especially for part timers, you qualify for medical, dental and, vision). it may be different in other stores but the one i worked at had extremely poor management, departments were not balanced, there would be ones that are fully staffed with nothing to do and departments busting balls solo with no help whatsoever (including from management). stress levels depend on how much they take advantage of you and which department you work in, who you work with, and the management. better then most jobs ive had, but overall a heck hole like most jobs. if your tryna stack some money in a low labor job this is where its at. they swab test now, so even easier to get a job. i worked a sales position, so u have busy and dead days, and they do look at your numbers."
good,"Great benefits, fair pay. Hours you have to be available are terrible. You cannot juggle home life with family and work there. Great job for young people with no kids at home or for retirees just looking for additional income."
good,"They didn't care about your well being but they did try to work with you with your personal schedule. Management was the worst, always favoritism."
good,Employee concerns are never handled well and there isn't much room for advancement unless you've been working there for a long time. Pay isn't really good either.
good,The product is researched before sold and this is giving the customer's confidence in what they buy. Working for Home Depot was a on going learning process but unfortunately there was no follow up.  Positive feed back was few and far between.
good,"Starting the morning would be very slow but eventually pick up and that's when it would get fun. I learned a lot about new equipment I never knew before. I would have enjoyed to interact with management more often I'm not sure how it is honestly. My co workers were very nice and helpful. The hardest part about the job I would say is down time, standing next to a register not able to go anywhere else for hours isn't very enjoyable. I really did enjoy the costumers, meeting new people and hearing/ learning about company's."
good,This company is a strong and ethical retailer with key core values. They believe in giving back to the community and try to take care of its employees.
good,"Although I truly enjoyed my job, there were too many inconsistencies  in overall management."
good,"As with most corporations it is what is available. Nothing special. If you need a job it can be a good place to get by. You need to identify and get into ""clicks"" or you will not last long and not advance."
good,I have had 8 supervisors and 3 managers in the 2 1/2 years I have worked here. I feel like promotions are based more on who you know then what you know. The pay is reasonable for the type of work it is. The facility is nice with a gym and fun things to do on breaks.
good,"Being a Front End manager I learned a lot. I was able to gain a lot on giving customer service and how to handle customers in certain situations. I was also able to learn a lot while being at the service desk, making and releasing orders, answering phone calls, and knowing how to work the different programs. A typical day for me depended if I was opening or closing. As the opening manager I would have to open the registers and do the paperwork that was needed to be done. As the closing manager I had to close all the registers, count the money and make sure everything added up and send the money to the vault where it will be verified and counted. I was responsible for taking care of breaks and lunches for the other cashiers. When ever there was an issue with a register or with a customer I was responsible for helping."
good,depending on your will determine how hard you work some areas require more physical work than others but nothing the average person couldn't handle pay is average good hours management is good for the most part they lack back bone when it comes to angry customers and tend to just buckle under there angry pressure but other than that no complaints.
good,"A typical day was quite routine which was nice. I came in got my assignment and went to work. I learned about maintenance and the need to take pride in your work. As well as working with many people around so safety and being sure I hade a safe work environment for myself as well as others. The management was too inconsistent with everyone wanting to be boss. Though they all had good intentions and all helped when you asked or had a question. The co workers were a big family for the most part, working together quite well. Hardest part was the hot environment working in a factory in the summer, and cold in the winter. The most enjoyable part was the amount of people."
good,"great hours, great job but just not paid well. Benefits are very expensive. I like my job and what I do but the people only care about themselves in the MET division. Poor pay and not good at rewarding people for hard work and dedication. Benefits cost is thru the roof. It eats up most of my pay every two weeks."
good,"you get great benefits, which is awesome, but that s about it. once you hit full-time or get promoted you belong to them. the oay is competitive but not worth what they put you through. one thing that will keep you there are the people. you do make a lot of friends and the atmosphere is mor like family than co-workers."
good,home depot is a great beginning job to pick up worker expiernce like everyy job it has its flaws. but it is a great place to grow. it is a very high paced store
good,"Busy work environment with crazy scheduling. "
good,"A typical day for me at home Depot would consist of me setting up store displays,counting inventory and stocking the shelves."
good,"managers tend to give you orders and no priority or idea of how they want the job completed. Best answer was either ""make it disappear"" or ""just get it done"". Associates on the floor for the most part (85%) friendly kind and willing to help."
good,They hire mostly part time and is difficult to get full time. part time can only get up to like 20 hours a week. Benefits are decent but only kick in after being there for a little bit. Have to constantly deal with aggravated customers because you have to get them off the isle to pull something down off the top racks.
good,Ok if your applying and working in a larger market area. The small market areas don't havfd competitive pay for the areas.
good,"Come in to work, Clock in, get yourself prepared, for example: making sure you are wearing your apron and having everything that's required to be in it to assist Home Depot customers."
good,Home Depot is a good first job. While working Home depot I was able to learn different departments and about the many products.
good,"I tended to work the hours of 8-5 and was willing to work those throughout the work week. I worked every other weekend as per required and per my request. I cashiered, helped customers and eventually got moved u to a garden associate. I had endless amounts of computer training and certifications inside the store. Out in garden was the best time because I could work at my own pace and choose any task I wanted to work on; I was my own boss. I worked the returns and often times the sales floor as well as helping the management to run out and grab some shopping carts. The hardest part of the job was working with customers who brought alcoholic beverages in with them or came in intoxicated as well as dealing with customers who called me names because I helped them and was polite...our bosses never stood up for us. The most enjoyable part of the job was keeping up with busy work and cleaning the front end, or putting merchandise away."
good,"It's a stressful environment and I am looking to expand my knowledge and skill set. I operate the lift equipment and work the heavy and bulky freight. It's hard work, but at the end of the day it pays off. Management is not the best. Used to be upheld, but now its gone down hill. The crew has the good and the bad. Majority of the team is friendly and good to associate with, but there are the bad seeds. I believe the hardest part of the job is how stressful it can be, but I enjoy working independently and as a team."
good,"typical retail and big business, limited vertical mobility, good values"
good,"I worked at two stores, one in Longmont, CO, and one in Tucson, AZ. The Longmont store was amazing, I enjoyed work and I felt like it was a great job for a highschooler. Once I went to Tucson for College, however, I saw that not all stores are so great. The management was horrible, the environment was sad and nonproductive."
good,"comfortable working with people. Team work, multi tasking, learning different departments. Co workers were very helpful. in general a great place to work."
good,"Pay is low, regardless of performance.  Promotions based upon politics, not knowledge.  Ineffective managers."
good,Normal day helping customers for most of your shift. Given small tasks throughout the day to complete by management. Good place to build relationships with associates. Good place to learn customer service skills.
good,Home Depot is a fun place to work. They have very little chance to move up though so you will be working part time with no benefits. The one in Toccoa is just like a family and I really enjoyed working there
good,They will change your schedule without you knowing. Then give you an occurrence without you telling you they changed your schedule.
good,I really enjoy my job at Home Depot but they don't have the hours available that I need. My coworkers are great and most of management is fantastic. I enjoy helping people whether its with health needs or planting a garden.
good,"I enjoyed working at home depot although scheduling was a bit erratic. Very friendly coworkers, great work , My position was seasonal so there isn't much more to review."
good,"Flexibility, accountability and availability is the key to working sales. when working with people having the ability to learn their different personalities, what motivates them and how they learn works to your advantage and it makes them more productive."
good,"Worked diligently for 9 years at 4 stores, all departments. crushed sales plan, had 5 subordinates get promoted. Led the following departments successfully: hardware, am Pack down, Freight Team, Millwork, flooring and Blinds and the Pro Desk.  Took all available prep courses for ASM and graduated EDP in Jan 2015.  Opened and closed the store on a regular basis as MOD at 3 different stores.  Trusted to do job as ASM but got burned out waiting to get a chance to RMA and move up.  Got a job offer with Lowes and put my notice in and left.  Company offered to match Lowes offer but I respectfully declined and am very happy now at Lowes."
good,"It doesn't matter how long you work there; they will fire you!  So, don't mess up!"
good,The managers there seemed kind of rude. They didn't communicate with the employees when needed. Expected us to give 110% all the time when they couldn't even give 50%.
good,The people are awesome to work with but they don't pay you worth anything compared with their expectations. Their scheduling for each department is good and you never have coverage as far as breaks and a lunch goes. Some departments are better than others but overall things could be better.
good,"As an associate, but with a demonstrated knowledge and interest in a specific area, plus product knowledge training and individual development programs, you could rise to specialist, department supervisor and into store management. And that’s just one path your retail career at The Home Depot could take."
good,"I will assist the Scheduler with her phone calls, her paperwork, and prepare employees schedule for finalization."
good,A typical day at Home Depot can be physically demanding. One must be flexible. The working day is challenging and ever changing.
good,"This job can be fun and keep you busy, make your day go by fast. This position requires a lot of patience with rude, angry impatient customers. Managers are helpful when you need an extra hand or teach what you don't know how to work something. Department supervisors, all i can say that you can do a better job than them. You will meet all variety of co-worker, one advise don't let those with bad attitude bring you down or take your smile away. Hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers, all you can do is keep calm and bite your tongue. Customer service depends on all departments, so when any department is under- staff you will most likely have a hard day, but if your a trooper you will survive like i did. The most enjoyable part of the job is socializing with good hard working co-workers who want to succeed in life and care about The Home Depot Customers."
good,"● Assisting customers with transporting heavy "
good,"The Home Depot does have good culture, and working environment. Although it is very separated by power, managers demand full control, which they do have. but associates are not granted with anything because they are a step under."
good,"Fast paced environment , since I have been employed with this company I have learned many things about the way installed sales work, Management staff are easy to approach. One of the most difficult parts of this job is that there are not enough like minded people with the same drive to get the job done. co-workers are friendly in a family like atmosphere. Unfortunately the pay is unequal to the results that a top performer earns for the company."
good,"Customer service is priority every single day, engaging the customer meeting their needs and connecting to both customers and associates. Daily tasks include on hand changes, loss prevention, shrink management. Scheduling associates, making sales, and being a leader in the building. I have learned computer systems, electrical, paint, mill-work, lumber and building materials. Co workers and work environment is great they are what make the company great. Management is sometimes out of touch and can be unfair to associates in favor of Sales. Pay is not great, raises are performance based and may be unfair regardless of seniority and biased depending on store manager. Best part of the job is connecting to my associates and truly helping out people both customers and associates."
good,Mixed paint and helped customers choose the right tools for their project. Learned a lot if DIY tactics and tricks. Management wasn't all that great. some co-workers were not the nicest or greatest people. Hardest part of the job is knowing all the product information and which item will work the best. Most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers and meeting people.
good,"Working on assigned Module for the sprint."
good,Good job for a teen looking for work. The hardest part of the job would be lifting the larger items. I learned how to deal with various type of people with this job. The management there weren't the best.
good,"I begin working as a cashier for Home Depot in July 2015. After a few months I was moved to a sales associate. I have worked in many various departments including appliances, kitchen and bath, and flooring. Within the short time I’ve been employed with The Home Depot I was awarded cashier of the month for September."
good,"Great place to work. Hours are usually very stable. Management and co workers are usually very open minded and friendly."
good,"Not a ""productive and fun workplace with a ping pong table""."
good,Home Depot is a good place to work. The associates are very friendly and so are the customers. Management are the ones that need a little change in their attitudes other than that it is a great place to work at.
good,"I have never worked for a company that will write you up on something the supervisor didn't do. I got wrote up because I didn't remind a supervisor to unload a truck he said he would unload, but forgot."
good,I saw a lot of unprofessional incidents there. I liked working there although it was a tough job and the schedule was not right
good,taking care of customer and making then  happen after along day at work. I love my job because I to take care of customer it's great place to work there is opportunit
good,I really dislike the way reviews are done at home depot. A supervisor can tell you that they know you can do their job but you do not have a chance at advancement. When you will work anytime they call but your supervisor will not. Dedicated associates are not respected.
good,"flexible schedule,ok pay,and opportunity on learning different trade skills. this place company has alot problems towards keeping their employee happy,most ASM play the favorite game, kiss their butts and youll become an branch manager in no time"
good,"Any chances for advancement depend on who you know in upper management, they are not willing to work around your schedule, they do not offer steady hours."
good,This is a company that if your are a woman in this area do not plan on moving up in the chain of management.  This is an great company to work for if you need a part time job only.
good,"The schedule they can change at any time, do not have enough time for family life. requesting days off is hard and more often refused. They keep on adding more paperwork often it is a repeated in other forms."
good,"They are constantly letting people go that have good expertise but are making to much money. Keeping people that have few home improvement skills so they can pay them less, with an emphasis on part time employees helping them to save money on overhead and benefits"
good,"Good company with benefits and tuition reimbursement. Overall, they provide a retail experience with potential to advance."
good,"It is a nice job to have, along with being able to learn from what the company offers (benefits, bonuses, teamwork, and improving your working ability)."
good,"If the air conditioner is working and you are trained longer than 3 days it might be ok, but that won't happen. I wouldn't advise folks to work here if you need steady income or job security. It's made for students who won't to work part time and make a little cash. Not made for families or parents trying to pay bills or take care of a family. They won't hire you full time so they don't have to give you benefits and the pay is not competitive at all."
good,"Procedures were easy to learn, worked at an upbeat pace, unfortunately not much room to grow/advanced, could've been a better work environment."
good,"Home depot used to be a great place to work when they were committed to customer service.The stock plan and return on investment was great. After the 2 founders turned it over to the ex-ceo of general electric he was more concerned w/ saving money instead of making money, by cutting back on the number and quality of employees by putting people on the floor who have no knowledge of home improvement or repair. They have a great idea other companies should do by organizing a monthly kids club where kids come in and build little projects.They call it growing they're customers"
good,"Fast paced work environment, customer interaction, co workers were helpful, enjoyed working in different departments. Left Home Depot on medical condition."
good,"not a bad place to work, coworkers very helpful always something different to do. fun helping people with there needs and projects."
good,Typically cashiers stand and wait for customers to check out. We're usually the only ones who have interaction with them so we have to make an impression. The co-workers can be quite negative at times and it's hard to move up into different positions.
good,Middle Management takes care of their people and each other but the higher management teams are out for themselves and have an agenda.
good,"Its an okay place to work for only part time! and the management is pretty cool but, would prefer a job offering more hours plus, over-nights is pretty hard to handle when you have no time for family."
good,"You come to work to provide excellent customer service and find a way to say YES to the customer! The hardest part of the job is finding time to keep the shelves properly stocks and organized on a staff schedule that needs more motivated workers, but when you get that praise by a happy satisfied customer it makes your day worth it."
good,"The Job is fun for the most part. I learned that everything isn't handed to you and you have to work to get it.Management is okay, they seem to care about the employees. MY co-workers are the best part they make it fun and easy going. The hardest part is dealing with rude customers but it gets easier overtime. The most enjoyable part is seeing the customers leave happy and satisfied."
good,"Short staffed; constantly look for coverage"
good,"great place to start off for your first job. there will always be team work, managers will always see how youre doing seeing if theres any way they can improve with you and the customer service"
good,"Working for the Home Depot in general was not bad - the associates within the store are mostly friendly and accepting.  It is extremely difficult to advance in any manner - promotion is based solely on the single interview and not on what you have actually accomplished during your time in the company.  Human Resources does not help when there are issues, and there is very little accountability for actions."
good,Retail with opportunities for advancement.  Excellent training.  Schedule is rarely the same.  Benefits available when I worked there.
good,The home depot did not have good management while i was working there. it was difficult to do my job sometimes when the management was coming in and observing the department i was working in. My co-workers were fun to work with so that made it difficult to leave the job. The hardest part of the job was how busy the department was during the summer because we were understaffed a lot of the time. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the customers find exactly what they needed.
good,"A typical  day starts at 2 pm and  carries  over  to 11 pm. Customer interaction , fork lift operation and a lot of heavy lifting. Sometime we can get to focused on making that money and  forget to acknowledge the employees that make it work. The most important part of the job is seeing the smiling faces of the children every first Saturday as they learn to be little Home Depot builders. I believe that if they would pay the employees what they are worth then coming to work would be a more Exciting Experience."
good,"My fellow employees where a blast to with, the management had a higher turn over of the company. There was too much people aiming to get other people fired just to advance there position even if the people getting fired where more experienced and doing an excellent job. "
good,Decent company to work for. The pay is ok. Great ESPP. Love the fact that they have a Homer Fund which helps employees who are in need.
good,"I started out as a Part-Time cashier and was promoted to Full-Time Supervisor within 6 months of being hired.  At my store we went through 3 store managers in the 2 1/2 years I was with the Company.  The major areas that made me leave The Home Depot were; work life balance, there was no work life balance at all, and if your store manager(s) (like mine) preferred male supervisors to female supervisors they could approve merit raises.  I was up for a promotion 3 times all of which were for the same position and was told all three times that I had gotten the position.  It was only when the store manager decided to announce that the position had been filled to the whole store that I found out that I was only used as the ""backup"" so that they could fulfill a favor to another store manager by bringing in a different stores associates."
good,"Plenty of nightly freight to keep me busy. Enjoyed working in multiple departments to learn about the setup of the store as a whole. Not a requirement, but a good opportunity to learn reach truck, order picker and forklift (which I had previous experience with.)"
good,corporate did not allow the stores to buy supplies that were needed.  for example toner for printers we would have to print in other deparments to give hard copies for items purchased.
good,"hard, dirty work"
good,"Good place to work, great schedule with weekends off. Get to spend more time with my family. Have the rest of the afternoon off."
good,"Fun workplace, very low pay for the amount of work you have to do. Some managment are amazing and some are only nice to their friends. Very poor job benefits."
good,Team meeting to address tasks for the night. Assignment of departments associates are designated to. Procure products for specific departments and move them to the area.
good,Service Home Depot stores globally. Fast past environment. easy job. Management is helpful. Co-workers are great. Hardest part of job is hours. Most enjoyable part of job is 4 day work week. Ive learned how to to ensure flow in a building of this nature (rapid deployment).
good,"You get your leads the night before and on average will drive about 1,000 miles a week to run nine or ten appointments. Of those maybe half of them will be legitimately qualified and the remainder you need to close if you want to make any kind of money."
good,Fun work place. all about customer first. great co workers lots of product in the store that you've never heard of but fun to know about each and every one of them.
good,"The job in and of itself was very easy, by due to the lack of a strong upper management and this particular store, their was much frustration and negativity associated with this position. Unrealistic deadlines, high personnel turnover, and little real working knowledge of the processes of this position by the upper management made the work environment very stressful and though the pay was adequate, end the end it was not worth staying on."
good,"HD is a great place to gain experience from the pro's that shop there.  Great place for hands on training on to use heavy quipment such as forklifts, reach, order pickers, saws. etc."
good,I was a cashier and they company strived on customer service.  Co-workers were nice and friendly.  I enjoyed ringing customers up and learning about what projects they were working on.
good,my job always kept me busy. At least once a month some time of training was given. I had wonderful co-workers. I met and trained many people turn over was huge. Management tried to keep moral up most of the time.
good,"Love my co-workers and my regular customers. Very political if you want to move up and very gossipy atmosphere so you always have to watch how you say things. crazy hours unless you're one of the few lucky Mon-Fri pro people. Good benefits, but management is poor. Its also a fairly sexist environment."
good,You are helping customers find the right tools to complete their projects. I learned a lot about home improvement. Management is very helpful with all issues. coworkers are great. The hardest part of the job is getting your tasks done and helping customers at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people.
good,"Co-workers are great. , the constant walking and the heat. Co-workers and the customers bringing their children and pets into the store . In this part of the country people are usually very friendly ."
good,"I remember enjoying the staff, work load, interacting with the costumers, and training."
good,Fun work environment. Upper management has to much control over each store and does not allow store management the opportunity to control daily needs.
good,"Great exposure to supply chain and all moving parts of replenishment."
good,"The job and a little monotonous and simple, but the merchandisers are usually a tight knit group. The set schedule is nice. Management can be a little stern and the coverage in the store in terms of sales associates is lacking. All in all this is simple job but is a little dull."
good,"It was a good place to work, the management their was sometime hard to talk to and not supportive of their team. The pay and benefits was good, just wish they had better management team."
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in after class and checking customers out. I learned a lot of things about home improvement. The management was very friendly and leash willing to help, though they did make it very difficult to be a le to get days off that needed. My coworkers were very friendly also and always willing to help. The hardest' art was trying to get important days off, but the most enjoyable part was the atmosphere I was in."
good,I have a very critical position in the customer satisfaction. I Coordinate all the deliveries in which are sold within the store and get them ready to ship out to customers threw our third party delivery company.  This is a very high paced and potentially stressful job.
good,"Working at The Home Depot taught me much about overall aspects of retail operations.  There is a diverse work group, and training is never aloud to slip.  I was disappointed that advancement within the company seemed limited.  My store manager told me getting a college degree would help with my advancement, so I divided my home life and maintained my full time work, and achieved my Associates of Applied Science in Business Management.  However, once I achieved this goal, and spoke again to my Store manager about advancement, she then told me that it did not matter.  This was very discouraging, but it aloud the door to open to work with the Veterans Canteen Service and put my degree to use."
good,In a typical day I worked six hours. It was the slow season so activity was a third of the norm. I learned about some of Home Depots products and their cash register system. Management was not as customer service oriented as I would have expected. My co-workers were friendly. The hardest part of the job was the slow season. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers.
good,"I make and receive phone calls through out the day for quotes.  I make follow up calls to finalize sales and confirm orders.  Emailing and faxing customers to communicate what was discussed on prior phone calls.  I must also keep on eye on passer by customers and help with store questions.  Also check customers out to get them on their way.  And coordinate with fellow associates to load customer orders needed asap, and future orders paid in full."
good,fast paced work environment makes you think on your toes and and there is great growth potential great benefits and saving plans
good,"The job itself was great and wasn't hard at but the chain of command with management was horrible. But I must say with my short time period working there I enjoyed my co-workers, we worked as a team"
good,"Going to school and working it a difficult balance to maintain, but when your employer works you just under the full time limits, so you dont qualify for sick time or PTO, it can get to be frustrating."
good,"Worked here for a little over a month. A typical day at work consisted of stocking shelves, helping customers, and answering phone calls. I learned a variety of tasks but what I learned the most was how to deal with customers. Management was alright but there was a lot of talk from fellow employees that disagreed with a lot of what was going on. My co-workers were phenomenal, the were extremely helpful and a blast to be around. Just about everyone got along great. Hardest part of the job was my hours. It was only part-time and on top of that I worked weekends & closed at night. Not ideal. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping out customers and seeing the sense of relief after I could help them find what they were looking for."
good,It was a good work environment overall. Like any job leafs had thier picks and chooses but as far as work it was good.  Fun people around to keep u motivated.  Job was just a short contract through a temp.
good,"I worked 4am till 12"
good,"The hardest part of the job was getting help.  There were not enough people working to operate equipment and help customers."
good,"The job was ok, except that i worked overnight, and i normally work at jobs that operate early in the morning. this was especially difficult, because I attend school at night."
good,"every one is friendly and the customers are great i just wish the associates got more hours. the manager on duty responds quickly and efficiently,the work is fairly easy and its a great place to be."
good,"help customers,front face produce,down stock product,slow on rainy days,a lot of sales on holidays.learn about multiple departments."
good,"A typical day at work consist of supporting a team of 30+ agents in a call center environment. The perks of the call center include air hockey tables, ping pong tables, and a relaxation room with a piano, comfortable couches and dimming lights.The center has a good focus on its employees and often has events where food is catered, and games are played. There are also several flat screen TVs located throughout the center and an on-site gym with showers."
good,"I usually stock product, I assist with customer service, learned how to be team player, management is a working progress, i work with great people, the people are easy to get along with. Their is nothing too hard at the job,you have to move at a steady pace though. I enjoy helping customer solve any problems that they may have."
good,"As a retail ""expert"" delivering the best service experience to customers at the lowest price point and creating new corporate/consumer value were the core fundamentals, the ""heartbeat"" of my position. My time at HD came as a result of Colorado's legal issues within the Alternative Energy markets, issues that rendered my Inside Sales position at Solar City useless for the past 6 months. "
good,"My co-workers was very cool and nice to me. At first, management was awesome then it turned really bad. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and seeing a smile on their face."
good,"not terrible, but the pay and pay raises aren't worth the trouble.  You need to enjoy this job for other reasons than a paycheck."
good,Home Depot was an ok place to work. I really enjoyed the customer service part of the job and loved working with the customers and most of my fellow employees. I didn't care for the management structure or the corporate nonsense. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management all the time rather than taking care of customers. The best part was working with the customers on the sales floor.
good,Lack of pay was my biggest issue but overall i enjoyed my time at depot. The work wasn't too difficult and every now and then you'd get customers that were a pain but nothing ever too bad. The hardest part of the job for me was that I couldn't get enough hours and the pay rate was to low for me to live on.
good,"A typical day consists of creating game plans for the day or week to ensure my department is well stocked, clean, and in compliance to prevent shrink within the department as well as provide excellent customer service. I have learned how to manage time to complete any tasks while still providing customer service. Management has a way of setting realistic expectations according to business needs and operating as efficiently as possible. My subordinate associates help me tremendously to stay well maintained without sacrificing customer service. The hardest part of my job is completing every task required to meet company expectations as it relates to customer service, in stock, and store appearance. The most enjoyable part of my job utilizing my creative thinking skills to solve customer problems about their projects."
good,Working at home depot is so-so you have to be into working construction or enjoy home improving . Management is not very help when it come to help with very upset customers .
good,"Overall it was a great company to work for, through time you built relationship with your co workers which turns  it a better work place"
good,"A typical day ends up in a lot of manual labor, not matter where you are put in the store. moving lots of freight. and this if you are freight or sales or any other position really. "
good,Fast paced environment. Co workers are great. At times you might be asked to do a million things at once not knowing exactly what is needed from you.
good,I really enjoyed working at Home Depot. I love people and helping others. what i didn't like was the management not doing their best to keep/take care of good employes. making promises of advancement or pay increases and not following trough with it.
good,"I enjoy the challenging situations of inbound call center, and the opportunity to provided excellent customer service."
good,"Schedule not flexible at all. minimum wage too.."
good,when on dutie i ether am working outbound or inbound. outbound is checking trucks in to yard and inbound is checking them out. fill out daily activity log once every 2 hours. do foot patrol of yard in beginning of shift and at end of shift. hardest part of job was learning new computer system. best part of the job was interacting with many people.
good,"Learn new ideas and ways of handling issues that may arise when working in warehouse environment such as safety protocols, and the proper way to use and control machinery."
good,it is an okay job if you're not driven to want better. the rules only apply depending on your circumstances. it feels like a dead end job.
good,"Great place to gain customer service skills needed to deal with general public, however management team lacks interpersonal development skills need to train associates for promotions"
good,"Working at Home Depot was an experience. I was a cashier so I dealt with nearly every customer in the store. I handled large sums of money on a daily basis and enjoyed interacting with customers. What I learned about myself is that I can work well under any circumstance and in any environment.I liked working in the garden area the most! Only thing about working at the specific location I worked in was that the employees higher up (supervisors, etc) where kind of nasty and rude some times."
good,"always learning, great asset and management would like to see me advance within the company, I have received many awards for great customer services"
good,"Start pulling or separating freight to departments"
good,"Nothing like any other job so disorganized, no order what so ever, from management down to the associate. Your basically managing people that think the job is there to serve them not the other way around."
good,The Home Depot Distribution was a good work experience having the opportunity to meat different people was very pleasant with a fun work environment.
good,This work environment will test both your patience and you willingness to work with others in a productive manner. Mobility is a must to be successful at meeting the demands of customers with expert precision.
good,If it wasn't for the group I worked with and our store manager this was just your typical retail job.  The store manager was one of the best people I have worked for.
good,"Monday to Friday and every other Saturdays worked form 6:00am through 3:00pm. Set up merchandise in the department  and get the department ready for the day. Every other day associate learned about new merchandise coming in the store. Are co-worker learned from each other everyday. Management was ok, the most enjoyable part of the job is taking care of the customers important needs."
good,"While I worked at Home Depot they were going through some growing pains.  It was upsetting for management, middle-management and the regular staff.  The business moved from a much-loved location to Dartmouth Crossing - the first business in that park and it seemed like it was in the middle of nowhere. There was a lot of infighting and unhappiness.  There were many good people who left during this period because everything seemed so unsettled.  I have always loved the people I worked with & have remained friends with many of them since leaving."
good,If you're looking for easy money home depot is the place to go. Other than that i wouldn't recommend anyone to work here. The hours were table so was the pay. Management was terrible. I felt as if i was still in high school.
good,"The job was okay."
good,"Nice part time job for high school graduates or college students."
good,The Home Depot was a good place to work. Made friends and continuously met new people everyday. There was a set schedule which was good.
good,Home Depot is a good place for part-time workers. They have a great break room. And you gain a lot of knowledge about various things.
good,Build pallets for multiple stores. Safely secure the pallets and load the pallets on to trailer The hardest part of the job is the mass amounts of heavy product. My favorite part of the job is the fast paced environment.
good,"regular day at work i tending to customers making sles and cleaning the department	and also arrange product displays, stock shelves and take product inventory, according to the Occupational Information Network"
good,Home Depot was a place where you will always have something to learn. Great culture among the associates. Supporting and knowledgeable staff.
good,"Home Depot is a supportive company with friendly, helpful supervisors. However, cashiering is not what I want to do permanently.  I have taken the position to supplement income until I can find an administrative support position."
good,"The job wasn't that bad and the other employees were really nice. I am still friends with some of my previous co workers there. However, the pay is terrible. Especially for a multi billion dollar company like them."
good,Working for Home Depot has been an experience that I could have lived without. I was asked daily by most of the department heads what was I going to close on. They made me feel as if the fate of the store was on whether I made my sales goal.  As my time grew longer with Home Depot so did my stress. I felt like I could never be seen as an equal to the other sales specialist.
good,"I was fresh out of High School, 18, and was thrilled to have this job.  It was basically grunt work, and showing people where things were located in the store.  It wasn't that difficult, but I had some managers that were highly immature. There was pressure from upper management, that streamed down to lower management and directly onto me.  They made demands for performance and tasks that were unrealistic and flipped out inappropriately like children when you didn't meet their unrealistic expectations. It wasn't just challenging, it really was unrealistic.  The raises were a joke. I worked there a year and got a 23c raise. Oh boy a whole year and an extra less than a quarter per hour."
good,"Home Depot was great at first but the more time spent there the more i learned about its corrupt managment. Home depots managers and supervisors did not follow its own policies and neither californias. They would take month to take action against violations and would violate the policy themselves. I had to work off the clock, and also was verbally herrassed by my supervisor. I wanted to take action against this but i was only one man with no one who was willing to fight it."
good,"Competitive Salary but typical person works 80+ hours per week."
good,Except for a select few good managers who actually care the others are doing a very poor job or are deciding to make everyone's day a misery and it comes to question how they ever got the job.
good,I'm a night shift associate. I absolutely love my job and would love to keep it. I am working in the slow season now where all part time employees at night are getting one shift a week or in my case less. I keep getting told it will get better but it has been months. All that is offered by home depot is daytime customer service jobs at not much more time than I have. Its a great place to work and when I started I had a reliable 4 days a week but they do not support you as a valued team member when it means they will lose a dime. I have been very disappointed by the company.
good,"A typical work day is very busy with customers and when not busy. cleaning up my area and placing Items back were they belong. what I've learned at this company is everyone helps each other even if there busy. management needs lots of improvement on how to supervise others. The hardest part of job, is the standing but wasn't as bad. My most enjoyable part is being able to interact with people."
good,"Over all I really like working at Home Depot, I met a lot of nice people some I'm still friends with to this day. But I'm sad to say besides my DH and supervisor it was just to much bad management."
good,"like any typical chain store"
good,It's a okay job. Your coworker become family and its not a job to take seriously.At the end of the day I wouldn't work there.
good,"My work environment was very busy and all about great customer service, I learned that you need to lead by example and be kind to one another, and enjoy your co-workers and team. The hardest part of my job was time, I wanted to be there for everyone therefore I had to reorganize my schedule a lot through out the day. The most enjoyable part of my day was taking care of my customers and also my team."
good,"Positive clean work environment, with great employees, management on the other hand not so great. Trying to have set schedule is often denied for part time employees."
good,Home Depot has great pay if you move up to management.  Unfortunately the hours as a manager add up to 55 minimal per week.  Schedules vary making it very hard for job work and life balance.  If you are single great place to work.  If you are married not a good place to work if you move up.
good,"Mucho que aprender, no hay crecimiento laboral. Demasiada rotacion de personal eso evita que la gente nueva aprenda algo y no dan una capacitacion adecuada al personal."
good,Learned how to design doors and windows. Schedule measures and installations when measure comes back for doors. Co-workers are great to work with. Management was good. Down stocking doors was the hardest part of the job. Done yearly inventory counts to help reduce shrink. Enjoyed helping customers design doors.
good,"managed cash registers, assisted customers, controlled inventory"
good,"I recently left Home Depot after 8 years in the same store and same department. I enjoyed my co workers and repeat customers, in which maybe is what kept me around longer than I should have been. They started me out lower than the part timer(i was full time all 8 years) and after I left I was only making about 2 dollars more than I did 8 years ago. The raises are small 25 to 35 cent a year. There was no work/life balance, many of us worked a closing shift and then the next day had to open, Being tired after a schedule like that I felt i couldn't be 100 percent to the job. YOU WILL WORK EVERY WEEKEND AND HOLIDAY, if you want it off, you have to ask for it at pray to god that no one else asks for it off either.  Too many districts walks, and it seem like they were too busy trying to please the big wigs than to take care of the customers.  Management of course had their picks, they acted like they wanted to hear your thoughts but that's a lie. I am glad I got the experience but I hate that I wasted so much of my life in that place."
good,"It was customer service plus sales, so it became a new chapter in my life. Although I didn't like the standing on asphalt all day it did help me to build confidence that I could do it for an 8 hour shift. I learned to sell to contractors but everything else was prior knowledge that I gained from previous employers. Management, well let's just say I lost my job due to management not being available when needed. Not to say that happens all the time but in this particular case they were needed and failed. My co-workers were a fun bunch, all types of personalities, some I got along with and others I avoided for obvious reasons. I can't say there was a hard part minus standing all day and thinking back on why I was let go I can't say I enjoyed any part of it either."
good,"-Provide customer service through an acronym known as f.I.R.S.T"
good,"Home Depot creates an all inclusive environment with room for growth and advancement. However, it is a very political game. The company overall started with great potential and a great place to work, putting employees and customers first. As the company greatly expanded they were able to streamline Operations, but left the employees and customer service focus behind. Since the changes in the early 2000's they have struggle to attract the best in the field, train them as effectively and customer satisfaction slowly declined. "
good,"The hard part about the job is latters , bosses are bosses and the co workers are cool. most enjoyable thing about the job is end of the day go home."
good,OK  place to work i have no complains.The  benefits are okay if you plan to go to school. It is hard to move up you would have to kiss up alot
good,Customer Care is not a good department to work for.  Once would be better to working in Supply Chain.  Customer care does not hone into their employees skills.  They only want you to answer the phones.
good,Overall helped customers with orders and ringing up orders. Overlooked other employees.
good,"As a cashier there is a lot of standing in one spot, and waiting on people to come to you. It can be very boring. However I did enjoy talking to people throughout my day. And I really enjoyed being at the customer service desk, it kept me busy, which I prefer. Management was fine, just very busy and not very personal. The hardest part of the job was some customers can be very rude and hurtful. The best part would be the customers who weren't rude or hurtful."
good,"A typical day at The Home Depot is very demanding and stressful. On an average day, I'm typically the only associate getting the job done. I work with a bunch of none team players. The management team is conformed to their own ways of doing things which does not leave room to grow."
good,This company was a fast paced environment.  Great benefits.
good,When I started there it was a laid back fun place to work. Customer driven workplace and sales were constantly being pushed. The best part of the job was the people I worked with and the worst part was dealing with irate customers. Management had a lot of turnover which made things uncomfortable.
good,"I learned excellent customer service skills working at the Home Depot. The hardest part of the job was probably learning the merchandise and understanding the store layout which took about a month for me. Other than that, it was a relaxed place most of the time."
good,"Very good company to work for, free lunches every month alot of growing opportunities within the company. the only thing about this warehouse is that many supervisors and managers are externals so they can be harsh on employees at times."
good,"Warehouse Associate (Current Employee), Brooklyn, NY – November 19, 2014"
good,"work hard and not get appreciated."
good,"The people are Home Depot are friendly. However, there is never enough staff."
good,"come in sort out daily duties for the day depending on shift do the opening checklist. talk to management about any safety issues make sure they are addressed in a timely manner, walk around check for shoplifters, write daily reports on the day, help out coworkers."
good,"The training for the Home Depot consists of sitting in front of a computer for 30+ hours watching videos and taking assessments.  Very long redundant process.  Once on the floor, I enjoyed working with all of the staff and management was very welcoming and helpful.  I did not like the way I was treated by the HR (Human Resources) director when I had questions or requests for my schedule.  Overall work environment was laid back with a relaxed dress code and it was easy to stay busy and find stuff that needed to be done."
good,"I was the only female working overnight, i had my own department, i worked alone in my department and i always had the most work. I learned how to operate the reach truck as well as the order picker, and electric pallet jack."
good,Very stressful hard labor if your someone who is lazy but is fun
good,"customers were great, people were great, boss was great. there was not one thing hard about his job."
good,"Typical day depended on the amount of work that was shipped in the night before."
good,The store opens at 6 am which means that you stand around for almost 2 hours without any customers. This is the prevailing atmosphere for the store's daily closing because the store stays open until 10 pm. Many members of management use the micro-manage technique which is totally unnecessary because additional efforts can not be pursed once a steady stream of customers start to visit the store.
good,"I would greet customers, check them out, clean my area, direct customers to were they wanted to go, call for help if i needed it. Management was good, got along with co workers"
good,like working with family. built strong working and personal bonds with my home depot family
good,"They worked well with my school schedule, but that was the only part I liked about working for Home Depot. There was no Incentive to work harder (no raises or bonuses that weren't dependent on time worked) so many of the workers did the bare minimum which meant nothing was ever done. The rules were very by the book so if someone clocked in a minute late for work then they got in trouble but if someone took 7 breaks in their 4 hour shift they did nothing about that. The older people that had been working there for years wouldn't do some of their duties because they had already done for years. Working with customers was fantastic because I could save them hours and they were extremely thankful most of the time."
good,"A typical day for me was to help all customers with their questions. I learned a little more about handling money and customers needs. The management, well they were ok. Most of the co-workers were very friendly. The hardest part of the job was when we were very busy and a customer had issues with what they needed. The most enjoyable part was, the co-workers would help you have a good day at this job."
good,"I usually work afternoons so in my department its tool returning time. I clean everything and help cashier if they are busy. Management could do better. I love the people I work with, they are very helpful and make work fun."
good,Fast paced had to find your own work in order to meet sop standards or get written up management not willing to listen to associates. All about production nothing for employees. The most enjoyable part of this job was your day's off.
good,"Fellow associates were great. Training period was conclusive.  Learned a lot.  Hardest part of the job was the varying schedules. Typical day depended on what time your shift started. Different duties for each shift, always customer service. Management was fluid,. Best part of the day was talking to the customer to inquire how we could help, and watching their face light up when they thanked you for all your help, and said, "" thank you, I'll be back and look you up."""
good,"As far as retail is concerned, it's not the most offensive job you can have providing you're on the part time store-centric team. "
good,Worked for this company for a few years. It was a great company to work for as a college student. Flexible part time schedules with shifts starting at 4am to midnight and even overnights depending on position. Wages suck you don't get hired at minimum which is a plus but its not much higher . Not a good job if you value time with family as weekends are mandatory. A lot of rude obnoxious and foul customers. There's never enough coverage to support the store and the cashiers are pretty much left to take the rap from customers. Management is a joke once in a while you get a good one but that's rare. They are totally unrelateable and unapproachable and are only looking out for themselves and their bonuses. Wide range of employees including young and old of every walk of life made amazing relationships and learned a lot. Limit part time to 29 hours max so they don't have to provide benefits.
good,Working for Home Depot is a very hectic job with too many managers with different direction in regards to how to get work done. A typical day at work would be coming in  and working on the daily paperwork and filling Online orders and deliveries for the BOP IS System while answering multi-line telephones and assisting customer in person.The hardest part of the job is working on a shift that is understaffed with is often. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers and working with a team
good,The most enjoyable part of the job for me is knowing I made a customer happy with my service. I feel that customer service is essential when it comes to having a successful business.
good,Home Depot is a job that I like to keep as a part time job.  Coworkers there are just there to work their shift and go home. Some are friendly but some stays to themselves. the great thing about it is working by schedules and there is no reason to be taking off for doctor's appointment or any other personal businesses.
good,"Lower pay, less hours. Not what it use to be. They use to pay you more when you, now it is closer to minimum wage."
good,"Typical day is fast-paced with phones ringing, pages for assistance, and this time of year looking for other associates to help.  The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing how to help with just about any problem that my customers may have, from plant selection to chemicals to grilling and lawn care.  The hardest part of the job is working with people who don't share my desire to exceed expectations of every person I meet."
good,I am sent all over NJ on unqualified leads and no gas compensation.
good,"It's a starter job, but I know that I can do more than push carts."
good,"the days starts very early.."
good,my co-workers all thought that i was brought in to be a spy or take someones position . which was not true . but over all they thought me the ins and outs of there computer system . everyday i learned something new in that store
good,"Assist customers with their needs - items they require, build delivery orders, assist loading heavy items"
good,The company as a whole is a good company. There is a Value Wheel that is in place to describe what the Home Depot stands for but from the top of the chain to the store level it gets lost in translation. Many times the people who are the least productive are taken care of because the management on the store level are non confrontational and do not wish to deal with them.
good,Inbound and outbound docks with constant merchandise loaded and unloaded.
good,"department manger & inventory manger to product for may diffent department, like garden, pluming,"
good,A typical day of work at Home Depot is a constant interaction with customers and the assisting of said customers in the home repair and gardening needs. I have learned the positive to pro-social interactions as well as the intricacies of customer centered sales approach. The energetic management style found at Home Depot made the environment a fun and productive environment.
good,"A typical day consisted of opening registers and assisting cashiers with correct change and deposits. I provided customer service and answered phones. I had to schedule cashiers accordingly, and transfer cashiers from one lane to another. I also trained new cashiers. At the end of the day, I had to close every register and solve any discrepancies. I had to transport the a large amount of money to the vault whenever I closed the store."
good,Was a great place to start out and learn how retail works. Dealt with tons of customers on a daily basis and enjoyed working here.
good,"I worked in receiving. It is very fast paced and hectic. I liked my job very much. The day just flew by. For the most part I had great coworkers.  I learned a lot about working as a team and about motivating others."
good,"My duties where to keeping the work area organized clean, and safe for customers and other co-workers. It was my job to finish my work area and move on to help other co-worker in need, to finish as team to have stored grand opening ready for customers."
good,"The job is merchandising, making sure the contractor is satisfied with their product placement. Management could use some improvement or skill training. I have learned time management, social skills, detail orientation, and how to supervise a small team. The most enjoyable part of the job, is working with a group of people who know how to have fun while getting the work done effectively and efficiently."
good,"I worked here as a co-op student. My typical work day involved me re-organizing products and helping customers find the best product for them. "
good,"the people were nice,but trying to advance in the company was hard,i would apply for head cashier they told me you have enough experience but we need you on cash"
good,"the home depot was good for the pay and benefits, didnt agree with the scheduling and  concern for my personal well being was rarely acknowledged"
good,A good company to work for however if you go into management your career comes with a shelf life. Periodic 'purges of store management are a routine way to cut payroll expenses and avoid paying out bonuses and stock grants... watch your back.
good,Great benefits and pay but has management problems.  No job security-needs union for job security
good,"A typical work day started with clocking in and proceeding to your assigned work area. Before any tasking commenced I walked every aisle and checked for any safety issues in the department. During that walk through I also looked for any open bays which indicated out of stock items. "
good,"it was busy, different everyday always something new it seemed, the management before I left was hard to work with he is gone now"
good,Helping customers with Transactions and Customers returns
good,"Positive work environment, friendly associates. The company ceased to care about its employees, it becomes too big to fail,abandon the founder's vision and culture."
good,Strange culture with lack of direction and accountability
good,"the most enjoyable part of this Job is help people, find solution to different issues and have a smile from them by the end"
good,"a typical day is dealing with customers ,doing returns and bagging and helping customers find what the are looking for."
good,its okay. There is worse out there. management is very selective on who they like and it shows
good,"A typical day at work included constant interaction with customers via telephone and face-to-face, selling appliances, money transactions, making work space presentable and creating/designing signage and displays to promote sales. Throughout my staty at Home Depot I have learned how to be handy as well as how to deal with complex customer situations. For the most part I had great relationships with my co-workers and with managment. The most difficult part of my job, was that my duties were well beyond just a sales associate. I was an appliance specialist, involved in the employee committee, the sign captain as well as capttain of a monthly kids club, so my presence and abilities were needed non-stop. I mostly enjoyed my time interacting with the children and throwing and hosting many events. I loved interacting with the customers, so much that I gained many relationships with them and I loved being able to use my artistic abilities to decorate the store."
good,Great working environment with my coworkers.  I lenjoyed assisting all the customers including the stores and vendors.
good,Productive however lacks challenge and little support or back up from immediate management.  Co Workers and team members are willing to learn and work. the Hours are great with weekends off.
good,Managament Isnt always there for you. Flexible scheduling is à plus.
good,Good part time place to work. The knowledge needed is learned before employment or learned by watching and listening to other employees or studying on your own time.
good,Wasn't paid enough for the job at hand. Dangerous as well - using vertical panel saws and table saws for low wages.
good,"I love what I sell and what I do, however this particular store within the company is lacking structure and organization. There are those who get away with breaking corporate guidelines and have no reprimand for it."
good,"Well each day is different. You  have 3 shift environments designated to morning, evening, and night shift. As soon as you put on your apron your engaging customers from all over the store. But your assigned a department that you must stay in to better serve your shift. You learn how to stock items, look up items, packed down items, take classes on products, driving machines, and stretching exercises. Management has a hard time with communication with lower class management and vice versa so some miscommunication is daily. Team work is very important in getting things done in the department. If associates constantly leave the department work gets left behind and the ones staying in the department struggle with flooding customers. The hardest part of the job is multiple customers because there is always different mood patterns that can alternate and escalade for better or for worse. The most important thing to do is be patient and take you time. The most enjoyable part of work is lunch and getting out of work."
good,"I started as a cashier, and learned a lot of product knowledge. I enjoyed talking to the customers and learning about thier latest projects. after a while i was placed in a Human resources Assistant, learning how to schedule for 26 different departments and create and maintain new hiring filing systems. There was allot of amenities working there. I won lots of gift cards. very fun experience."
good,"Usually see 3 - 4 appointments a day working with kitchen or bathroom related designs. I work with other designers to solve problems dealing with specific layouts. We also deal with sales and product knowledge. Most design build firms focus of a handful of projects, but as a designer at the Home Depot you are designing and selling at least 5-6 kitchens a month. I think the hardest part is being a designer in a retail driven work place. Management is focused on retail and not the tedious work and attention to detail that goes into designing kitchens so a lot of what we do goes unnoticed. I think the most rewarding part of my job is seeing a project through from start to finish and not only getting a sense of accomplishment from what you designed, but also being able to make your clients happy."
good,"Great place to work, but not really good with advancement.  Plenty of oppritunity if you are in the social click.  Other than that, you are stuck in a position where you are only considered for a ladderal position."
good,I enjoyed working with the public. It was a seaonal job. I scored in the top 10% of employees in successful resolution of issues. I monitored cash drawers in multiple checkout stations to ensure adequate cash supply.
good,"Either you started at 5 in the morning or you came in at 1pm and worked till closing.  Generally worked 5 days a week but store was open 7 days a week. Odd schedules.  Basically helped customers complete their home improvement projects.  "
good,"Very chaotic, I have learned the building materials to building a home, the hardest part of the job is when there is not enough cashiers and you don't get your breaks. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with customers most of the time"
good,Instability of housing market brought company down. Probably wouldn't return.
good,"having fun while working and earning experience while working hard."
good,When this company was still in this location it employed a good amount of people who were looking for jobs. They no longer have a call center at this location but I'm sure there is another one close.
good,Management was not professional and there was little compensation for work given

good,"Customer Service"
good,"A typical day is really different because you don't know when it is going to get busy or if it is going to be dead. When I am at the service desk it is more interesting. When answering the phone you never know what you will get, as someone asking if we have a particular product in stock or if it is just online and how to get it. Some of the customers that are in the store that want to build an order and have it delivered or just put on hold as someone else will be picking it up or it just doesn't fit in their car. Busy day goes by fast and the days that are slow drag. I learned that try your best to make the customer happy and do it with the biggest smile. Management can get testy with us to push credit. Trying to get every customer to get The Home Depot Credit Card is hard because when you get the same customers every day and already have one is a little hard, but they are there helping us out as we need them and they do what it takes to help us to make the customer happy. Co-workers are all different and they are fun depending on the department they are in and if you will see them as your schedule is never the same. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the upset customers that don't want to listen to what you have to say. Trying to calm them down and answer solve the problem at the same time is difficult as they don't want to except the information that is being given. The most enjoyable thing is being able to talk to the people I work with."
good,Great Stepping Stone into HR functions. Work Life Balance difficult to navigate at times. Great Boss and co-workers.
good,"Checking out customers with their purchases at the front end. I learned alot about items and products, learned to make keys, every day was different. Worked with alot of people who were team players and enjoyed meeting different people from different cultures."
good,This job was a huge learning experience for me. My favorite part of the job was the customers. The hardest part of the job was working with management because they would not help you when it was really needed. I learned a lot about the business and received a lot of awards even my platinum watch. The co-workers were wonderful to work with.
good,early to rise early to leave weekends off great management labor intense the work schedule is the best part
good,"My normal day at work starts over at 10:00pm checking to see what appointments are set up for the next day via internet, LMS ( lead management system). If so, l drive to home owner address and observe other homes in the area to evaluate before approaching my clients home. meet and greet along with following the 12 step process ""stairway to success"". Consult and present product line, close sale and complete contracts. This includes finance and federal guidelines to home improvement. "
good,"Walk my department make work list of duties that need taken care of ,delegate that list to my co-workers and then i would check my inventory numbers and freight deliveries for the week. The most enjoyable part of the job was having customers come back and thank  you once they completed a project."
good,this job isnt all to bad good people. They pay isnt good so looking to better myself
good,"Work is what you would expect from a big box retailer. Toss you into the deep end and get to work. Not much in the way of training your answer loads of questions stock and do inventory. Co workers come and go weekly and management is either Jaded and grouchy or fresh faced and ambitious to go up in the company. Nothing in the way of advancement but the flexible hours and better than minimum wage pay make this a wonderful job for a college student. In this regard highly recommended, though it will be hard to eek out a career in the long term."
good,Co-workers are friendly and the compensation is good.  Work life balance can be trying.  Challenging work.
good,No upward mobility.. Cut your hours in off-peak seasons if your part-time.. you get  a 1% pay raise annually..
good,A lot of good people to work with.  The potential to move up and advance is very difficult.
good,It is great company to work for but advancement is minimal. Learned a lot about customer service and dealing with the unordinary on a daily basis.
good,"Job not so hard. Setting planograms, assembling displays, and signing BSR's. I have great co-workers. The hardest part of my job is during holidays and resets which you all know in retail holidays are always kind of rough. Management is okay."
good,"Over see two departments order stock ,stock and pull for customers."
good,"Home Depot is a job where you don't need to exert yourself to much, as over achiever as I have been described, most of the associate at the home depot had told me constantly not to do to much, I set high goals for myself and pride in providing exceptional customer service and to provide an enjoyable and knowledgeable associate who visit our store. "
good,"On any given day I could do a range of things. Some days were dedicated solely to helping customers while others were dedicated to store maintenance. I learned that not all of management had the workers best interests at heart. My co-workers were genuinely nice helpful and supportive. We worked as a team on many occasions to get projects completed. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the large amount of dust that accumulates in a home improvement store. The most enjoyable part of this job was seeing the look of satisfaction on customers faces as I helped them locate everything needed to complete their projects,"
good,Pushing freight on a graveyard shift for 12 hours.  Not a lot to describe.
good,Always keeping me on top of me feet. Need to know everything. being able to tell customers where items are located. Being able to take care of top clients and contractors.
good,"a typical day at work would require me to check my inventory ,and make sure that my associates are keeping their tasks done and if they have any requests of me. I learned patience and communication skills. I learned how to multi task and work efficient in a very busy work environment. Higher management was not the greatest, they were very unreliable and most of the time clueless. My co-workers were excellent, I noticed once you can relate to someone they will comply and give you their all. The hardest part of my job was, not taking every situation to heart. I am a compassionate individual who believes and dedicates myself to what I take on."
good,"Greeting customers, handling money, checked customers items and assisted in loading customers items in their vehicle."
good,it was a great experience. it was my very first job. i loved that we could wear whatever we wanted. i hated how management was with there open door policy. it seemed as they never listened.
good,"birthday party hostess and server, i managed to make tips off of huge parties of 40-50 people, but i quit because they didnt have propper cleaning supplies or sanatary tools for my job."
good,The Hardest part of the job was stand on your feet for hours and the never ending line of customers.
good,the store was just unorganized from the moment I went in to interview until the day I left. I would not recommend anyone to work at the location I had even tho most of the store managers and people I worked with have since been let go for varying ridiculous along with some very justified reasons.
good,Helping customers find what they need for all of their home projects. The management staff was very knowledgeable . Meeting people from every walks of life is very enjoyable. Making sure there is enough staff at hand to meet customer's needs is very important to this job.
good,This job is mainly for if you are in high school/college and just wat some extra change
good,"- I would do paperwork, run cash strips, count money, answer any customer questions, and sell product."
good,"Serviced products, not allowed to help customers, poor management,   always cut hours from 28 to 20 without notice, worked from 5 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. ,always off on Saturday, and Sunday."
good,"I sold Impact Windows, Shutters, Siding, Roofing, Gutters, Insulation."
good,"I would clock in at 5 am, or 2 pm. I would check with my department manager and see what need to be brought in or down from the top, check inventory. My co-workers and management were ok, the hardest part of the job were dealing with the rude customers. The most fun of the job is when they would throw holiday parties"
good,"while working at Home Depot I learned a lot out side of being a cashier. I learned about the different products , what they are used for and even learned how to use some of them. They had classes to teach associates how to better our customer service skills even more. I filled in for other departments when they were short staffed and learned even more about the products and company."
good,Would go back to work there at a drop of a hat....liked the environment
good,"Basically your replenishing stores across Canada, so you deal with the same locations and the same products day in and day out."
good,Go in get a brief team meeting about stock prices and how much need to replenished on the floor.  Restocked shelves. Worked independently no inaction between co-worker or management.  No advancements.
good,"Set appoints with prospective customers. Set up measures of space for design. Work is self starter type. Co workers were professional and helpful. Hard to concentrate on customer design with calls for help from other departments.  Most enjoyable for customers to come back to tell you how they ""love"" their new kitchen and bring others to me. Good feeling to find customers that really like your work."
good,"Home Depot can either be fast-paced or slow at times, depending on when the customers shop.  There is no shortage of stocking the shelves, nor usual maintenance so there is always something to keep busy with.  Home Depot does a good job of training for department knowledge but has lost track of how to actually schedule training classes as opposed to a few years back, when training was actually scheduled as part of the work day.  The co-workers are usually excellent for the most part.  The hardest part of the job are the late hours and the odd highly opinionated, picky customers. Win them over with kindness is the mantra, but it can still take a toll on you when the day is over."
good,"Home Depot is currently scaling down it's full-time work force to part-time with no benefits. If you are a retiree or student and need a temporary job, The Home Depot is your company."
good,"Fast pace, low slow hours, Co workers fun to be around.. Hardest part of the job was learning the process for changing the receipt paper."
good,"Lots of driving, some overnight travel.  Management is poor, compensation is good.  Average room to advance."
good,"Fun people to work with, but management won't work with your schedule."
good,I did not agree with the way people advanced. Some managers are good and some are not so good. It's and ok job but you have to fight against favorites and politics.
good,Typical day was to help customers find all the product for there do it your self job.      I learned the retail business.   Management was good till they find one that want to fire people then any little thing even if was not your fault they fired people   Co workers most was great to work with
good,"The upper management has become more threatening this part year.  Human Resources has effectively been replaced by a computer, 3 strikes and an employee is terminated, no matter how small the offense."
good,Good place to learn many new skills. You just won't be home a lot.
good,"Customer service is top priority, but ability to multitask is required for maintaining stock, updating price, building displays. Work alongside top performers, and others who avoid responsibility. Management is not supportive to employees as often as they are to customers if there is a problem. Working in the community to solve problems, includes volunteer spirit."
good,"No more product knowledge, morals, merit, or metrics accountability."
good,"the management  is unorganized, but the people are friendly"
good,"For the most part, my co-workers are what made me enjoy my job here. Management was very poor except for a select few. Management was harsh, unwilling to help you advance unless you were sucking up, and for the most part rude. I loved most of my co-workers and customers but hated feeling like I was always being watched for an excuse to get rid of me for someone new."
good,"Management gives you key tasks to perform threw  out your topical day."
good,Needs better management but overall a good place to work. Learned to assist a diverse group of customers.
good,"Working in the paint department it was almost always busy. Keeping the aisle clean and stocked, knowing the products, having an eye for colors. Most enjoyable part is seeing the customers' happy when things turned out great, most challenging thing but also fun is fixing a color issue with paint or stain."
good,"A job where if you don't mind being a body to block massive mobs of drunk and angry soccer fans.  Security Officers recieved radios and escort VIP (important soccer players, or for whatever event that was going on), majority of the younger crowd was on gate security and scanning at the entrances.  Co-workers were in cliques and many were students trying to transfer to the Staples Center."
good,It was an easy place to work for but customers were very rude. Management did their jobs but their attitudes weren't all there
good,"Home Depot is a good place to work, however that is by department. There are a few departments that lay off and change over every 2-3 years or so."
good,This was one of the most difficult jobs for me. I was night time freight and it takes some getting use to in order to work those hours. Once that get over come then its nothing but green lights. The job is very physically demanding and very time orientated. It's very fast paced job can sometimes be over bearing but you just have to stay on top of things. It was not my dream job but it does pay very well which was a plus for me at the time but sometimes it just seems like the work and having a life out side of that don't add up.
good,Being a cashier they would often forget to give me breaks. there would be times where I didn't get a single break all day. It was a great way to mingle and social network with contractors. The management didn't really seem to care about the customers as much as they did making money.
good,"When I go into work; either it be a co-worker, customer, or management, I was being taught something new everyday.  Working here has been a knowledge place to work in home renovation, especially since I own a home.  As part of the management team we are given several tasks which can be stressful, but it has to be put aside to get the job done. But at the end day its all worth it, because we have completed our goal (making sure our customers are satisfied)."
good,"Home Depot is great at promoting a sense of team work and values for employees. I manage a team of 6-8 people in my department. I have learned that there are many teaching/coaching/and management techniques to adapt for individuals. I have learned to work the various reports given to the department supervisors to complete and use these reports when ordering and managing my dept. I have also been given the opportunity to help develop the next set of dept. sprvsrs, as I am given time to work with associates individually. There are multiple reports that Home Depot expects the dept. sprvsrs. to know. It is very tedious and demanding work that once you are finished you feel accomplished. On going training and learning give me a chance to keep as a well rounded employee. The co-workers are usually very friendly and into team work. ""Not my dept."" is a phrase we don't use. I have been given the opportunity to learn several other departments, with this knowledge I am able to cover breaks and lunches-even allowing me to lend a hand when there are call offs. Most of my peers are seasoned dept. sprvsrs. They are always willing to lend a hand and explain any report I happen to get stuck on or any situation that calls for a second opinion. We are very much a team. The hardest part of my job is balancing all the reports and responsibilities of being a dept. sprvsr. There are times when my peers and I are the only management in the building or the only associates on the floor assisting customers. My customers always come first. If I have to stay late to accomplish a task then I do so. The other"
good,"I work afternoon shift"
good,I don't feel like they appreciate my work so that's why i'm looking for a better job
good,"I enjoyed the customers, they seemed to make you smile or its so easy to make somone else smile .that was my favorite part .Stocking shelves maintaining your department and satifying customer was the job. The co-workers at that time where not happy at all becouse of changes, Made it difficult to work as a team. My goal was to make everyone smile before end of day!Of course completed my job"
good,I never look forward to going to work because some of the people I work with like to take advantage of people in my position and for what we do the salary is not enough.
good,"They would work a little bit with my visitation schedule but not as much as I would have liked. The pay was ok, but could have been better. The staff members are all friendly and great to work with."
good,"con bastante trabajo estrés presión pero con el suficiente espacio para desempeñarlo sin jefes que estén estresando o haciendo mas difícil el trabajo, aprendí a trabajar en equipo con comunicación y orden limpieza organizado, en cuanto a gerencia poco interés de su parte hacia las diferentes áreas pues piensan que son de otro nivel o mundo mejor que el de una persona normal, mucho compañerismo y respeto de mis ex compañeros con un ambiente de trabajo agradable, la parte difícil no existe cuando uno mismo tiene las ganas de hacer las cosas bien, lo que mas me gusto fue el apoyo de mis compañeros para hacer las cosa bien."
good,"A retail job with more physical demand than usual. Not a bad place, but don't expect them to go out of there way to see that you are a hard worker. You usually need to kiss butt to get ahead."
good,Day at work consist of helping customers find the supplies they need to fix their house hold issues. Ordering product and restocking  shelves along with loading and unloading freight from customers vehicles and semi- tractor trailers. Co-Workers are always busy walking around helping customers along with restocking. Hardest part is trying to remember where everything is at. 
good,A typical day would be always on my feet non stop working. I learned had to be good at customer service. Management was alright always did what they asked. My co-workers were fun got along with everyone there and still keep in touch with some. The hardest part would be non stop moving and always on my feet. The most enjoyable part would be helping the customers out and having them be happy with me at the end.
good,"Work, co-workers, and management were easy to work with."
good,"I traveled a lot. Every day I traveled to a different location. I learned manual dexterity, working with a team to achieve a common goal, and use of tools, while being safe. Always aware of safety rules. The most difficult part of the job was the salary and lack of advancement opportunity."
good,"The job is okay, i wish i had more working hours and i wish i could move up in the company & further my work with the Home Depot."
good,"i work at home depot and its at the rdc out of winchester,va and it a ever nice clean nice place to come into and work at . everday we have a meet and talk about what are goal as a team going to do that night and that how we need work harder as a team and on what they like that we did the night befor and how to inprove are work to make it easyer on are self throuth out the night and then we are a sight to the spot were we will be working for are shift . some nights are alot harder then other beacuse you git give more stuff to place on pallits and some nights go ever easy and feels like you could be giving more to do.. "
good,"very nice place to work just very difficult rotating schedule every week but management is very nice helpful, active training program"
good,"Its a nice place to work as far as a summer job or to make money when in retirement but not as a career, my co-workers are nice; the most enjoyable part of the job is working with people."
good,"Overall it's a good company. Something's in upper management need to change, like the way District Managers treat there Store Managers."
good,"  I worked at an RDC as a Pallet Builder and was baited in with benefits and an equal chance for advancement among three-hundred fifty other rapidly employed members of the RDC. Later finding out the majority would either be laid off due to it  being a seasonal job (not mentioned in the job posting) or would work far less hours than desired from lack of incoming freight."
good,"A typical day at The Home Depot for me involves working various reports, making sure merchandise is and will be available and customer service.  I have learned to manage my time and do a much better job prioritizing what needs to be done daily.  I  enjoy the day to day training of associates.  The hardest part of the job is the imbalance between work and personal life,  I feel like I am not given the tools to succeed especially when my counterparts at other stores speak of their stores."
good,"ok for a side job "
good,"Management obviously has their favorite. The schedule are not set and have been changed on people without notifying them making some issues. But I did learn a lot, I learn very good customer service skills, I learned about different products. A typical day as a cashier is ringing up different customers some doing some very interesting products. As a special service associate you see some very interesting orders come through, talk to a variety of people on the phone with something new every day. As a lot attendant I get to spend most of the day outside pushing carts and loading for people unless needed inside."
good,its a great place to have as a first job. not really a great plave for  advancement
good,"no oppertunity to advance, no job placement assistance, laid off after 16 years"
good,I work 6-8hours a day. Managing cashiers. Giving cashiers breaks and lunches and handling money.
good,"If you like getting written up all the time then this is the place for you. I learned many skills that helped with my job, and I also learned that the Home Depot does not stand behind it's associates. The management staff has many favorites and they don't like to deal with associate problems. They like to pass the buck to others or pretend like they don't remember what they talked to you about. The hardest part of the job was always getting written up no matter how hard you tried. The co-workers talk to each other way too much and they gossip a lot. The most enjoyable part of the job was the day that I quit."
good,"Very busy most of the time, always something to do. Co-workers are wonderful, nice people. Typical day is just checking our customers, locating mdse. for them, doing returns when on service desk. Management always listens to ideas, grand corporate policies seem strange though. Hardest part of job is the standing when at a register for 8 hour shifts. Best part of the job is regular customers, and good attitude of co-workers."
good,i learned a lot about customer service and the products the job was fairly easy my co workers were great but the management needs improving and work hours were always low
good,Great work staff. Reasonable amount of hours. Co workers were very friendly
good,Home depot teaches you various different skills that you can apply to home improvement as well as interacting with the public. the work is very demanding and straining on your body depending on what department you work in.
good,"The company itself Is great, I love working in that type of environment."
good,"My ovrerall experiance there was very good, they could do a little better job on making sure that their training exercises accually macth what each store requirements are. With better follow up from the DH's (Department Head)"
good,Providing excellent costumer service is number one priority.
good,"The job was very easy, they taught everything i needed to know and there were always people around to aask when i was unsure of something. The managment seemed to change very quickly, i think they hired 3 new managers in the time i was there and only one new lumber assosciate. quite shocking, managers are typical aspies who think their farts are gold but they have no real power and they almost never fire anyone, good job if your fresh out of high school or want to make a little extra to pay for that car earlier."
good,"Home Depot claims to be a veteran and military friendly company, yet they are not hiring nor promoting us when we are experienced and more qualified. The life at Home Depot has management mostly sitting in the back office and not providing support on the floor. There is always an issue with getting the correct equipment fixed so that we may reduce the risk of on the job accidents."
good,Love working the people there and the customers... good products that I don't mind selling to people as I would use them myself. But you work hard for little compensation.
good,you never know whats going on they dont practice what they preach one day they want one thing the next they want another and they prefer that you kiss their rears
good,Manage sales and operational duties by all associates in store. Help customers in a high traffic environment. Solve problems and questions from associates and customers. Write reviews and hiring staff as needed. Problem solving and team work was the hardest part but when things came together it was rewarding. Mostly management issues if any came from Corporate office so not many to deal with.
good,"Weird hours, will cut your hours when they want to, and sometimes give you very few hours."
good,over worked for nothing. never get a thank you. get raises once a year. get a bouns twice a year but dont expect much.
good,"A typical day of work is customer service and maintaining the shelf, making sure the product is available for the customer."
good,"A typical day at work for Home Depot would be to help customers find merchandise,answer any questions they may have about starting a new project for they home or business."
good,i worked here 6 years and for the most part it was good. there was a core group that was family but management was all about who's butt got kissed. advancement was not based on qualifications. the insurance benefits are very good and the pay was above avg but i was hired in the good old days. today people are started out for much less.
good,Poor management not enough room to advance no job oppertunities given to employees
good,Management is under trained or experienced. Most issues are due to a poor management philosophy.
good,"My location didn't run like most, the upper management on site was inattentive to the big picture, focused on trivial and ignored major issues. Coworkers made the place great generally, but the store manager is a fool."
good,"Reveived inventory, ran fork lifts, researched discrepances"
good,my co-workers are so good they help me in the starting days of my job
good,"Easy and relaxed environment, pay and work/life balance not the greatest."
good,Working at the Home depot was a very good experience for me.I gained a lot of experience that i can take on the next Business i work for.The only dis advantage at the Home depot is Management.The Management Team should Have meetings and discuss the professionalism.The working with Associates part of their job is very poor and needs to be improved.
good,The starts finishing the work from the previous shift.
good,Home Depot is a good company but they didn't pay well and didn't really care about the LP department
good,"Overall it is a very convenient place to work because you can take two 15 minute brakes and 1 hour lunch. But on the downside, the schedule can be a pain in the butt because it changes all the time and sometimes you have to close today and open the next day."
good,people you work with are friendly. you build relationships with customers because they're always in there getting things they need for their projects.
good,Needs better communication btween management and Employees
good,try to start a day with a smile
good,"it was a nice job place to work as a teen, i learned alot and made enough money to buy a truck and groceries"
good,"It is retail, so there are some long days, depending on what level you are at, and what volume the store does in a year, your hours can be anywhere from 55 to upwards of 85 hours a week. A typical day in the summer can start at 4am and you will be there until around 6pm. If there are visitors from corporate your days can be 18 hours long. The best of the job was the associates that worked under me, always worked hard as they respected the people that were not afraid to be in the trenches with them. Advancement in the company can be very difficult especially once you achieve salary level management. The salary and bonuses are very competitive and it was a very difficult decision to leave the company. Realizing a much more work life balance was necessary for family, the decision ultimately was very easy to do."
good,Work was ok. Pay was very low and raises were very low.
good,A typical day is fast pacd to meet customer demands in a retail environment
good,"Overall company is solid. Problem is there is such a drastic difference in management from store to store. Some stores are fun to work at and some (like the Olean, NY store), you have to wonder day to day if you will stay employed due to very poor management . Home Depot is also a big company that has decided that your qualifications, experience and hard work due not matter if you are making a significant amount of money. Rather than have one person that knows what they are doing, they would rather pay two people the same and if they do not work out then... oh well, we will hire more. Back in the day Home Depot would pay people what hey are worth and treat their employees well, which in turn the employees treated the customer the same because they loved their job and going to work everyday. The other down side is that Home Depot used to care all quality products right down to the nails and screws (which by the way are way over priced). They get you in the store with best price on the wood, then over charge you for the screws and nails. Now they carry junk made in China just like everyone else. They have decided to take care of their price match guarrantee by making their products exclusive name brands made by the name brand companys so as you cannot price shop the products anymore. Example is the tools sold are still the same as ""Stanley Tools"", just now they have the name ""Husky"" on them. Now they are taking name brands and labeling them HD brand. You also no longer can count on them having the item you purchased or the parts for it because when you go back next year with a"
good,"I handled managed accounts for contractors. I built their quotes, compiled material list, and located products for them that we did not carry."
good,"provide customer service, assist with office duties such as payroll, memos, telephone calls, invoices, balancing cash, customer order of blinds and flooring"
good,I enjoyed working for Home Depot! A typical day includes incoming calls and product knowlege support.
good,"I would put my stuff in my locker, put on my apron, clock in. Then I wold go see the front end supervisor so they could tell me which register I would ring on until my break."
good,"Typical day starts at 4 A.M, I'll wait for security gate to open. Start my day with clocking in find a scanner, walk my department for safety issues, stock not placed in overheads and evaluate what needs attention, prioritizes my duties. Assist night freight team if needed. Complete my store readiness check list that is through our data base network. Start to clean and decontaminate product, down stock any empty hole on shelves. Have this completed by 6 AM. Store opens start assisting customers, store associates with questioned about pricing and outside customer phone calls and make keys as needed. Continue with down stocking, at 7-8 A.M. department store associate arrives at delegate what they can help with, such as pack down list, bay maintence and customer service. Finish my pack down list from the scanner and have that completed by 10 A.M. Finish my day with customer service direct department associates."
good,Need to focus on other things and reward those who help you make money. Hire more people to work. Stop working a skeleton Crew and sending money out the door.
good,"• Responsible for the provision of an efficient and effective reception service, and for administrative support to other staff as directed by the supervisor"
good,Great place to work if you can get around the drama. Alot of gossip and and unfair system. thats the worst of it other wise its a great place to work
good,I used to supervise the front end and also worked in the vault.
good,Customer service
good,The people that work are nice people but they will work you as much as they can for little pay. Working your way up the ladder was like pulling teeth it never happened.
good,"The managers are mean, co-workers are lazy, and its a very uncomfortable place."
good,"Schedualing is sometimes hectic and not always done according to your availability even if they say they will. Management seems very unorganized and very guilt trippy. Co-workers are awesome and very understanding, everyone there is going through the same thing."
good,"Attention to detail, problem solver, Ambitious, go-getter"
good,A typical retail store selling residential building materials.
good,"Working with the general public helping them find their constructive needs. Most of my coworkers are very friendly and caring, almost like a family. I get to learn all the aspects of how to build a house, what works for some and not."
good,*work sometimes hard to follow with out some reminders i learned a lot about costumer needs and how to help them
good,this job is great if your looking for something part time. advancement is possible but not on merit based on how friendly you are with your superiors. the pay is above minimum wage. its swing shift so ver rarely you will work the same hours as the previous day. if your looking for a reliable full time job then you should have manager experience and apply to management. in this position you can expect close to a minimum of 30000 a year and up
good,you learn a lot of skills that you can use around the house being a home owner.
good,great co-workers get alot done with minimal employees.overnight restock crew great with afew exceptions
good,I enjoyed my co-workers.

good,"I enjoyed working at the company, I just preferred more hours"
good,"hugs, were plentiful from the time you start your work day until time you leave for the evening. A lot of customers were the kind of customers that got use to us and were like friends instead of just customers. The hardest part of the job was irate customes and thieves. The best job at Home Depot was being a Head Cashier."
good,Definitely not a good place for a student to work at. We used to get out at 1 or 2 in the morning and then had to go to school the very next day or in a few hours. Once or twice I had to leave at 1 and still had to work the early shift at 6 am. It is just crazy
good,"working for home depot has advantages and disadvantages just like any corporation, you have mis-managed management and associates who dont pull there own weight, but I as a former employee I found my best pleasure working with the customers, making there designs come to life. But on the down side of things when you work for a company that doesnt want you to be honest with your time alloted for designing I dont beleive thats fair to the customer and to us, but all in all this isnt a bad company to work for."
good,Decent and easy days depending on where you work.
good,"Paris, Tx. Home Depot #6566 is a great place to work with great people to work with, BUT the management in the store are back stabbing and lazy."
good,"I liked Home Depot because you knew what you be assigned to the night before, for the following day. On my time on the freight team (overnight), I was stationed in the paint booth. It was a very physical job that wore on the body. The workers were great"
good,There are great employees and lots of employee incentives. However they say they will work around family scheduling needs but they will not.
good,This job was different as far as when it came down to management and how this store I worked for cared about their associates.
good,As an appliance specialist a typical day consists of interacting and assisting customers with product knowledge on major household appliance products. Assuring each individuals' needs are met when selling appliances is the primary goal of an appliance specialist. The hardest part of the job is meeting sales quota in a low volume store. The most enjoyable part of the job is assisting people with their vision for their projects
good,sale help people you learn lots of things. learn to drive forklift.
good,"We did work, and it kept us busy. We got trained well enough to understand the job we was doing."
good,"Depending on the store the job might be better or worse, I have learned that communication is key to a good work environment and my store lacks that. Management doesn't communicate with each other or to the employees. They seem to spontaneously make new rules and procedural changes. These seem impossible to know until you come into a situation when you need to know of them and then find out everything changed weeks ago. The lack of positive feed back is also stressful. Unless you are on managements good side, you will never get anywhere in the company. Hardest part is not being provided the amount of training you need to work in certain areas of the store, and there never seems to be enough staff working; the turnover rate is also very high at my store, so there is no point to learning peoples names. The most enjoyable part is when you actually help a customer and they are happy someone took the time to listen to them and really help them. Also the people i work with (not management) are awesome for the most part. As stated before, the turnover is high so there are not many of us that have worked there for over 3 yrs."
good,"an 8hr day, in a busy environment, task execution is very unpredictable."
good,Very often the work load exceeded the resourceses and manpower available to conplete the task. Managers did not seem to grasp the concept of utilizing manpower throughout the organization to accomplish large tasks. Very often a multi-person task was assigned to a single individual while other employees stood around idle.
good,I was a student working at the home depot part time. This company wastes a lot of money and has a large turnover rate. Management caries slackishess attitude toward their employees and the promotions are hard to come by. Overall a so so place to work. Benefits and matching 401k are about the only positive things.
good,"I loved being a cashier, the people working there were amazing. There rules in how to be a cashier were ridiculous though and I would never work for them again."
good,"The co-workers are great and management is great. However, it's difficult to try to have an outside life with the schedule most times."
good,"The worst thing about the job is the schedule, and also the unfair pay."
good,Nice place to work if they have enough people to help assist the customers.
good,There is a lack of communication from management from corporate office and even management inside the stores. Very unorganized. Overall is a learning experience and does provide chances for advancement in your career.
good,"There is a strong sense of community between Home Depot employees. After work parties rocked, good place for a first job. Difficult on the 'lifers' there, and always was understaffed. Working Garden was great in summers, but selling flooring the summer after was horrible."
good,great place to develop your communication and sales skills.
good,I had great experiences with the customers. Built strong relationships with regular customers and contractors.
good,At the home Depot the work load was steady. All associates knew their job. and were able to preforme at a high rate. the jobs were complete on time. and we had a fun time doing what needed to be done.
good,"I did not like how hard I worked cutting blinds for hours, not selling kitchen designs, and only recieving a ten cent raise."
good,Staff is usually under manned to handle peak periods. Product select is good.
good,Average retail workplace with poor management and not enough recognition for your work.
good,"excellent place to work. friendly staff, helped to ease the new employee stress. competitive pay."
good,The people who have been at Home Depot for awhile don’t pay well unless you started 20 years ago. What I got paid was pretty terrible for being with the company for almost 7 years. Benefits are good though. I loved my coworkers but corporate is not the same as it used to be years ago
good,Very fun place to work and meet new great people every day was a fun productive day in different ways hardest part was dealing with very difficult costumers but in time i learned how to deal with them
good,"Overall, I enjoyed the people at The Home Depot.  Be prepared to work hard both mentally and physically.  Although I was fortunate enough to have weekends off most employees do end up working weekends."
good,It's a really good place to work its just the pay is horrible compared to other companies and the amount of work they expect from you!  But overall the workplace itself is not bad.
good,I feel that (at least in my department) the store was generally understaffed. The expectation for one person to close an entire Building and Lumber department is unrealistic.
good,A typical day at work looks like clocking in then sitting at a cashier for 4 to 8 hours depending on your hours. I disliked this job because I feel like I couldn't apply myself. I like to keep busy and actual have things to do. For me this job is not for me but the environment was excellent.
good,"This is a place where lot of scope for learning and new technologies."
good,I do not want to do this part. Why do I have to do this part? Why is the software not allowing me to move to the next screen. I feel like big brother is watching my every move by having to do this part.
good,Offered overtime often. This helped with my kids costs with school and activities. I can pay my bills in advance because of extra income. Being able to pay my bills in advance helps with easing financial pressure
good,Home depot is a good company to work for but the management at my location are lacking severely. HR and management need to pay more attention to the needs of their workers.
good,"A typical day of work consisted of managing the cash registers, rotating locations to gain experience from each side of the store, making sure there was sufficient cash in the register for the next available employee, and greeting customers into the facility. The management crew was good, they were on schedule and constantly supervising making sure duties were done correctly. The most enjoyable part of the job was creating new friendships and developing a relationship with customers."
good,Worked part time for HD after retiring from other company. They were flexible with my hours to honor my PT status. Enjoyed working in a fast pace environment.
good,Fast paced so the day goes by quickly. They only start off at $11 where as Lowe’s starts at $12. Some management is good and other management is bad. Good at working around your schedule.
good,"typical day was doing bay reset, including moving beams, and setting the right product placement, setting holiday displays, and changing price tags.   easy to get along with the team."
good,"Home Depot is a great place to start learning how businesses get far with all the associate care, inclusion and equality across the business. It's one of the few companies that if you put in the hard work you will be noticed. But once you start climbing that ladder that is when you really need to rely on yourself. You'll get some training here and there but to make it in the business on the Merchandising side you are on your own. You have to seek out the answer you have a question for or the question you don't even know your asking. Also the whole ""We care about our associates"" goes as far as the leadership takes it. If someone can produce numbers even if they do it the wrong way they get advanced within the company. I've heard it time and time again, ""If you ain't cheating, you ain't winning."" All this being said it brings us right back to the fact that you are just a number in a big box company."
good,"Okay, so the hiring process is kind of desperate. They're looking for people and after that a year later, they get rid people. Training , they give you training, but it's not enough. There's too much to remember. And don't get me started with coworkers, they get an attitude if you ask a simple, regardless if it's stupid or not.  Customers already know the vibes in the store. They can sense if it's a good working. There are a few managers. All of the managers cannot take it all from the employees or customers. I can sense that they are stressed out from the customers and other rules and regulations. They are some good managers and bad managers. My position was cashier so there's a lot of pressure. You can't leave the registers and the cashier lead ""rotated"" cashiers but 90% of the time, the cashier leads left the first cashier to the gardening area. Customers are freaking crazy! They think that they deserve a discount, even though all of the managers said no discounts during orientation but customers threaten cashiers and sale associates for discounts. If the manager would have come up and say something to the customers, then the rest of the employees will not be threaten by them. If I was you and scent that this environment is not for you, just leave."
good,"The management of this company do not engage there employees to participate in the daily decisions even though we worked the floor every day,"
good,Get to know the managers as soon as possible and stick next to them like glue if you wanna move up. They do work with your schedules really well and respect your hours.
good,"8 hour work day. You come in to work Monday - Friday clock in to work , have a meeting before the shift starts also break every 2 hours 30 minute lunch. Meeting after lunch and last 30 minutes housekeeping"
good,"pretty much busy at all time, manageable environment and good assistance from other associates. working here as order fulfillment associate gives me the chance to get to know every part of the store and also broadens my mind"
good,This is a ok weekend job and a temporary full time job unless you plan on staying.  If you stay and want to move up the pay gets better! But regular employees wont feed a family on your wages. You learn a lot working with this company.  You even learn from the customer! Over all I say give it a shot! If you like it ... go all the way and you will see the benefits!
good,Home Depot is a good company for those who are interested in pursuing a career in the retail industry. For the most part I do not feel it is my place to be because of my career path.
good,"Fun people and it is ok to work here,most workers are friendly and helpful."
good,"order fulfillment is not a hard job, but it can be made into one that is not ideal. They did not allow me to change MY availability from school to summer schedule, so i did not get to change my hours for the summer. I had to get another job. The pay was not worth what i was tasked to do."
good,It’s a good job to start off while in high school not much more. They don’t offer any benefits to part timers. 80% of their employees are part timers.
good,The company shows favoritism to others which is wrong.the company doesn’t like giving out too many hours.full time is for people who are favored.i work hard and try to mind my business
good,"Great company that is run well, individual teams can be hit or miss.  Typical pro's and con's of large company corporate culture.  Benefits okay but on the lower end vs. other large organizations."
good,"Not a bad place to work while working towards a degree. I’d imagine the experience varies from location to location. Overall would recommend while working towards a degree, or if looking to get into management, otherwise better options."
good,"Very heavy workload in freight, for what they pay you. Management is aweful and rarely chips in to help. Zero appreciation for anything you do. But has good benefits."
good,just another number here but its overall a decent place to work. get shifted around a lot. management is nice but could do a better job of helping excel.
good,"The job is very dull and boring over time, management was VERY prejudicial and had their favourite employees and would threaten others of their jobs if they did not meet their expectations despite many others going under their radar even while doing less of a job than you. They would guilt trip you and make you feel bad, you practically could not have a sick day or else they would address that with you."
good,A great place to grow once you've made the proper connections. Offers valuable resources to develop yourself and in turn grow your career. Has extended the opportunity to grow.
good,"poor management, i did not mind the job but some of the employees were cut throarts, you had 6 min difference for the whole day to clock in at the given hour you are suppose to. listen in on a private phone call"
good,"They all have a main goal, which is to keep the shelves in-stock. They are big on customer service and they like to see motivated associates. It is a fast paced job, it gets busy and a little hectic. Working at home depot means working at home depot, it does not matter what department you are in, the customers just see an orange apron. The day can really go by fast or slow depending on the people working. It helps if you learn how to drive equipment. Hardest part of the job is maintaining it clean because customers always mess everything up."
good,"I worked part time in the plumbing department and when I started I was told I would be scheduled 28 hours per week based on my availability. For about 3 months I worked 20-28 hours per week. At the end of July, my hours and just about 75% of all part timers were cut to 6-10 hours per week.  My starting pay was 9.75. per hour. Again, you can make more money working for McDonald's ."
good,"Overall a good first job, the pay offered is definitely not appropriate for the amount of work expected , hours can be better but managers are usually very lenient and open with your availability"
good,"A typical day would consist of, helping customers and opening credit cards. A lot of pressure to open Home Depot accounts. Some coworkers, chose not to participate. "
good,The company now seems much more interested in shareholders than associates.  Pay raises are only annual and small.  No employee discount given.  Sad for a company that used to be a great place to work.
good,"Down stocking merchandise for the customers, setting seasonal displays and end caps. Enjoyed seeing the finished products we displayed and built for the different seasons"
good,Skeleton crew is the usual the benefits are very high especially if you have a bigger family they charge an additional $25/child weekly if you have more than two. Communication is weak from management to the lower levels. Someone who doesn't pull their weight but jokes and stays on good terms with management gets recognized more than an associate that works hard but keeps to themselves.
good,It was a very stressful job since training ended. I worked through kens crew they got me this guarantee job at home depot but it was too stressful especiallly in hardware department. Not the type for me. They wouldnt pay me benifits til a full year of working there i cant even take sick or travel days off when I worked there. I dont recommend people working at home depot hardware department.
good,"Management needed some work but I liked it. The lumber department was the hardest department to work in and they were always under staffed. This made it just that much harder for you and you get paid the same as the person that was hired to water the plants. "
good,"Providing great customer service is the most important thing along with product knowledge. It is also in one's best interest to learn as many of the departments as you can. If you are employed there long enough your fellow associates will become your ""work family"". The best part of the job is getting to work with good people and helping customers."
good,"Heavy lifting, shelf stocking in warehouse setting. Ineffective management. You stay for the people but leave for low pay. Constantly stocking and restocking shelves and customers are relentless."
good,"cool as a college kid trynna make some money but not  good full tie gig if you got bills to pay. Flexible with the scheduling but par time scheduling can be very rough. 6pm - 12am, 2pm-11pm"
good,Home depot is a good place for students to work. Its really easy and they don't force people to do overtime. You work your 8 hours and you leave unless a manager asks you to stay than its up to you. The best thing about HD is the workers. There are people of all ages working there and its really mixed. Sometimes you are left by yourself and it can get really stressful byt overall it was a good job.
good,"I enjoyed the physical demands of my job, however the continued drama, lack of problem solving and ineffective leadership created an environment not suitable for me."
good,"If you have great team work with others and others with its great. You can choose your schedule, flexible. Best thing about working was the atmosphere..."
good,"Its fun to get by but not a good job to have long term, you make quality connections but overall hard to move up in the company because it is more of a popularity contest."
good,"Chronic understaffing coupled with poor pay leads to high turnover in a high pressure environment to make sales goals which are unachievable at best. Expect angry customers and employee callouts daily. Benefits are nice, but thats about where it ends."
good,"Great place for college students looking to make money and pay phone, car, gas bills. Great place to learn about how retail is operated. Company could do a better job training new hires"
good,Working for The Home Depot was one of the best jobs I ever had. Working in the position I had was not only rewarding on a day to day bases but also the right amount of challenging.
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, management was a big issue with my store. Granted all of the other associates made it quite fun and a homey place to work."
good,everyday understaffed management just sticks anybody anywhere so getting screamed at customers because associates do not know the department that customers need help in and they treat the associates that work hard unfairly
good,"A typical day would be answering customers' questions like product questions, what they need for their projects. Will help place orders and help with any order issues."
good,"not at this time I did not feel that I had a management team that was willing to training or promote with in or schedule fairly, most felt the same and all left the store."
good,The hole store needs to rethink there managers the employees are unhappy over worked and unappreciated for the work that we do this store shows alot of favoritism
good,"Typical day for me is to view incoming trucks, prepare the inventory tags for the product coming in. Bring in old product from storage area to fill and restock the shelves. Off load the trucks then tag everything. Organize what is going to come in the store and what is going to go in the storage area. Reorganize the storage area to make everything fit. Organize products and merchandise for other associates."
good,It wasn’t a horrible place to work. The compensation for working in lumber wasn’t near enough. It was a decent job until they find out how hard you work and then they over use you until you get burnt out.
good,Think it's Interesting place to work.  As an outside sales consultant it can be rewarding if you put 70 hours a week.  Problem is no work life balance.
good,"Management was sub par. Fellow associates were generally easy to get along with. Felt like just another cog in the wheel. Personally the late night hours were not for me. I am a 5 am riser and working past 10 at night did not work, especially with the managers who seemed not wanting to be there themselves."
good,This is a great job for those just entering the workplace.  This is great for learning customer service and the retail marketplace of a giant corporation.
good,management went down hill after 3 years managers started choosing favorites and home depot started loosing all the hard working associates management started treting there associates badly
good,"not that much more to say, good steady work but with low pay. management is ok and will help you with most things from schedule changes to lifting heavy boxes. if the pay was better i would still work here."
good,"My experience at Hime Depot was an ok experience. At first I loved it , it was fun and I was a learning a lot, then all of a sudden everything changed. The management got more strict and unfair, which is when I decided to quit my job."
good,"This is a job that you work during the summer between school years, do not plan on working here permanent full-time. Also, I suggest working a position that does not need to be outside often,"
good,"Home Depot for the most part was an enjoyable place to work. Unfortunately, if you work part time the hours and schedule are all over the map. Employee attrition is high."
good,"I love to work ,I have 15 years work expeience.Homedepot has Too much politics choices at homedepot but great benefits. Ok job , Looking for better opportunity to grow in."
good,Don’t deal w inappropriate things from customers and co workers! I was told by an asm “you’re a girl you should be used to it” and from someone in my dept “no matter how big you wear your shirts or sweater we can still see how big your chest is” i did not report this bc the dept was already so small we needed him and he’s protected by a DH as well so nothing would have gotten done tbh. I’ve had so many bad experiences here w customers making me uncomfortable to co workers saying inappropriate things that quitting was the best thing to do. You shouldn’t be used to hearing inappropriate things at work.
good,management are not people persons. they hold you back from getting promotions and expect you to pick  up the slack for lazy workers. will not fork with your family life
good,"Overall experience at The Home Depot was not great.  It’s a very political company, with open turf wars, like between IT and business.  Some managers have contempt for their own employees.  You meet a few good developers at The Home Depot, but not enough."
good,I would say management could have done better. Either they weren't involved at all or to much involved and critiqued far to much. It was nice working evenings and that I was able to have some form of independence on the floor. Overall it wasn't a bad job
good,It is a fasted paced work environment very hectic but they do throw a party for most holidays. They also give a bonus check once a year. They really do give you much of a raise each year though.
good,Fast paced with lots of demanding customers with lots of needs.Very good team of cashiers under me.with this comes lots of responsibility on the front end.I maintain all the money and keep everyone going in the same direction.
good,This job is not as describe. I was very excited to work at the Home Depot until I started. Got very disappointed after the first day but I hanged on for two weeks that they started playing with my schedule. Why ask for school Schedules if you’re still giving me shifts while I have class? And giving me shifts when I stated at my interview that i cannot work after 6 because of my kids. Then they are giving me 65pm-10 pm. . McDonald’s respects more your school life than the Home Depot
good,Bad managment. Only concerned with metrics. My WFH supervisor did not like the way i worked. Sup Manipulatd me and subjected me to write ups and then fired me. All the time i was on site i never had any  to problems. Wrongful termination if there was ever one. Management sticks together.
good,"Enjoyed working with some of the other employees, and to help customers on getting what they needed for their problems and products. Management needs a little help on knowledge and communication with employees and customers as well."
good,Soso company some employee treat you ok but some boss don't & they don't take doctor notes. If miss 5 days in 3 months they fired you & can't come back for 7 years.
good,"Working for the Home Depot was stressful only because we were severely understaffed and most associate's lack motivation, It made daily routines almost impossible to complete because we did not have enough associates."
good,a typical day was making sure employees were doing what they were suppose to be doing.  You had to make sure things were getting done in efficient manner
good,"I was hired as a freight team member which meant you worked nights, takes some getting used to. I wouldn't recommend it if you have a family."
good,Too much nepotism is involved with selection process and racial divisions within the higher ups...managers ignores SOP and dictate their agenda instead of company policies..
good,"If you have any integrity and desire to contribute to the results, you’ll be worked to the ground. Many talents are taking for granted which is extremely discouraging."
good,"I find there is so much missing at The Home Depot. I enjoyed the association with my fellow employees, the customers, and the fulfilling feeling of completing projects. However, management is so sloppy. You have been warned."
good,"There was a big chunk of time where I would cover so many shifts I couldn't work my own at the end of the week because of overtime. Depending on where you were working (lumber, garden or returns) it did get really slow or really overwhelming. The management only cared about how many home depot credit cards we sold instead of the customer surveys that praised the employee that assisted them. The schedules weren't very flexible because they were always short staffed."
good,"Our store was top in district. With new manager, we have fallen. People quit and no replacements. Glad to be transferring. The crew will be missed. Can't wait to move."
good,It was a job for me during college. I had to leave because they would schedule me for too many hours and my grades began to slip. I wanted to work during the weekend but they only scheduled me for the evening and night shift.
good,I worked 7 to 4 off on weekends but some ppl was not happy about that so after 6 yrs got moved off 7 to 4 and had to work weekends I didn't ask for that I worked my ads off to get that spot just so some new ppl could get upset and and talk to mod and tell them it was not right then my rent money got taken and nothing was done so that's when I left for lunch and never came back
good,If your working there as a first job after high school or just to make ends meet while in college then this is a job for you. It is a great stepping stone job.
good,I was a order picker which made me very stressed because you have to keep up with the constant deadlines. Make sure every delivery is ready for the next day and to get the deliveries out for that day while also being called constantly to grab stuff for other people. It gets stressful really fast and it is to much to handle when doing it alone.
good,"I had keys and managerial duties, opening and closing the store and dealing with customer complaints. However I was still getting paid less than 14 a hour while the assistant manager was paid over 60k a year. I was basically running the store while actual management would show up late or leave early."
good,"I do think Home Depot is a good company in some positions, and some stores have better managers than others. But my experience had the worse of both ends which let to a stressful day to day job. Rather than an opportunity to climb up the ladder."
good,"You want to go to work, do a good job and go home. You need to have thick skin in order to work there! Customers treat you like your stupid and take advantage of the return policies. No support from managers"
good,Merchandising Execution Manager has no life driving from Baton Rouge to Lafayette everyday.  The work was great along with the people but they said I would get reimbursed for mileage.  Then they reneged on that deal so I had to leave the job since it was at least 110 miles a day to an from work on my dime.
good,poor turnover / what I enjoyed most was taking care of my customers opening up charge accounts. Helping them with special orders and just making sure that they had everything they needed to start and finish there projects The hardest part was all the rules that change daily depending on the manager in charge.
good,"I really enjoyed the time I had spent at this company. The 401k benefit is great. They try and work around your schedule but the pay is only minimum wage. Management was horrible at the time I worked but now they cleaned house and I believe the ones in charge now are great! I would definitely try and get back into this company, however the hours in the wintertime are very low. Unless you’re full time of course. From 20+ hours in summer to maybe 8 in winter and that’s just not right, but it’s understandable because slow shopping. This would be a great starter job for anyone! Even if you don’t know a particular department, they have excellent training videos."
good,"When I joined Home Depot it was due to a career transition.I found many opportunities to gain product knowledge and be a team member in the Paint, Hardware and Plumbing Depts. While I enjoy the fast pace and helping customers I found that a greater percentage of the team would not go above and beyond to serve customers."
good,"A typical work day at Home depot is what you expect from any part-time job. Workplace culture varies depending on management the hardest part of the job was balancing the work schedule and your college schedule. Since home Depot was my first job, I've learn alot about the work environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was the coworkers I meet and work with."
good,"It is not a bad place to work, it just wasn't enough for me. The department is great but as far as the compensation for being a supervisor, it is not up to par."
good,So yes I was a hot headed young man when I started there. I did a lot of growing up there. Good management gets moved. Bad management doesn't last. Give it time. Without fail they will dig that hole. Learn everything you can. it gets you places. I had a good manager who got passed up for promotion due to him being a white male. They are attempting to fix the bad culture. Good luck to you. Bad department heads are a plenty. Do your best to outlast them. A lot asms come from the outside.
good,spent 13 yrs and there were challenges worked hard through out the years and made a number of amazing people who have made a great impact during my time there.
good,"The Homedepot has great benefits and competitive pay, however management drives a very unfair workload. Upper management relies heavily on favoritism. Only a handful of associates are entrusted to do everything with no extra benefits compared to mediocre associates. As a department supervisor, my loyalty is constantly questioned due to variables outside of my control. Nothing is ever good enough and praise is hardly given despite the amount of work achieved."
good,I am a foster parent and the company don't care about any thing but work.  The work was good but its hard to balance being a foster parent and working for that company
good,I worked part time and was already working full time. I asked for ONLY 20 hours a week but continued to receive closer to 30 so had to resign. Fast pace environment and I mostly interfaced with contractors who knew what they wanted for the most part.
good,I had good management and poor management that let all the other associates stick to their own departments and it promoted poor cooperation and was never remedied.
good,Working here can be fun at times but others it can take a lot out of you. I only work 4 hours but you feel like you want more after all the physical strain. I'm ready to move on for more now.
good,"I did not work for Home Depot too long, which was fine because it was not enjoyable anyway, only about a few months but through those few months a few things ended up happening that negatively impacted my experience."
good,"Cashier work is honestly pretty bad. Customers are almost always snarky or rude and a lot of the older men that work there don't like women, some of our reviews in our website repeatedly say this. A lot of hour inconveniences such as hours being changed a lot, requested days off get denied often and management is either everywhere or nowhere. The pay is decent for a first job but difficult for anything other then that."
good,"As the headline says already: Home Depot is a fun place, if you don't need money.I actually like it. I have been through a lot of layoffs and worked at places where you got paycheck deductions for going to the toilet, so this is actually a very nice environment. The worst thing is the inconsistent scheduling, closing one day and opening the next. We live in a low wage economy, so what do say .... Otherwise, my managers are nice and take care of business, but of course different people in different stores always have different opinions about that. For teamwork, it is what you make of it, with the usual mix of stars and skunks you find everywhere. Overall, I like the people I work with a lot!"
good,"Put way to much stress and responsibility on the Department Supervisors of the low pay they get. Customers are rarely nice or understanding and the company normally sides with them even when they're extremely wrong, vulgar and often violent. Raises and recognition for good work it rarely given. Almost impossible to get any sort of promotion or move up and they tend to prefer to hire out before developing and raising up their own employees."
good,"Low pay for the amount of work you do for the distribution center, advancement was unfair do to most of the ones advancing were manager favorites, didnt enjoy my time there at all"
good,You can gain a lot of valuable knowledge working there. They try to make you feel more valuable than the average retailer but in actuality it's all the same. The management leaves more to be desired. My particular store does not follow corporate policy in regard to attendance.
good,"I liked working at Home Depot because the company gave me employment during the summer months when I was not taking classes. However, the culture was unproductive, with many tasks falling on the shoulders of few productive employees."
good,"Good pay and hours available. Just don't expect to have managers who care sometimes. You will get stressed out after going full time. Because some people  get lazy. Watch out for corporate, it's 50/50. Favoritism is a given"
good,"Mainly because of the fact that you're checks are heavily taxed for things you are not able to receive (health care, and 401k if you never sign p for it) as a part-time employee. Also depending on your management is what will make or break your experience there."
good,The company has very high standards. At times it it feels like their expectations are unrealistic. The most difficult part is the constant turnover. This is because of the competitive job market and low pay.
good,Great benefits but upper management is not the best because they really don’t take care of there employees but the pay is great and the employees are good to work with
good,"A typical work day is busy. Specialists are goaled weekly and departments work as a team to achieve those goals. Customer service (skills and appreciation of your customers) is something you are definitely given the opportunity to hone in on. Additionally, sales techniques, understanding of store, district, and region goals and efforts to reach those goals are developed over time. Speciality departments require at least 6 months of training and experience for an associate to feel confident and in-control. Customer quote follow-up is a daily requirement, as is taking incoming calls, solving cust. issues, and selling orders which have been quoted. Lots of valuable experience and the pay is fair."
good,This job title has or a career at the Homedepot is very easy to get into and grow if you have the right mind set to go forward. There are many operations and titles you can do and is very diverse and easy to chose.
good,"The part time job at Home Depot was in Sales. The pay was nearly minimum, but they offered good Health benefits. The schedule was not fixed which made it impossible to do other job."
good,"Personally wasn´t the job for me. Not a good work environment in my opinion, but others loved it. Really just depends on who you are. Wasn´t that difficult of a job."
good,"Working there gave me plenty of time to focus on my studies. The job is not stressful at all, however, there are peak seasons like Christmas and other holiday celebrations that can take a toll on you. Overall I recommend this job for students and starters who are searching for experience in the workforce."
good,"They have done quite a few thank you celebrations for the employees.  The celebrations have always been in the form of lunches and gatherings. Overall, a decent job."
good,"I learned how to effectively manage my time between multiple tasks throughout my day. Between customer service and assisting the supervisor with the day to day activities. The hardest part is mostly how well you deal with stress, it can be a very stressful job when you’re understaffed and there’s a bunch of things to do. The most enjoyable thing is then ability to work with and interact with different people every day."
good,Fast pace environment with a lot of customers daily extra busy on the weekends and not to much career advancement at that particular location it could if changed
good,I would most likely not work their again unless they weren't understaffed because during my breaks I would have to work during my break because we didn't have any else working the same position as me after it was fine just lots of heavy lifting.
good,"Tasks that are already impossible to do given the man-hours available to each department are eclipsed by a constant scramble to make the bottom line look good at the end of the week.  Management thinks they can let blood from a stone having us leave our departments to peddle uncompetitive store credit cards.  Meanwhile, the resultant disarray of the aisles makes customers wait on un-stocked shelves, which drains even more of our productivity in getting things down from the overhead or otherwise searching the store for mislocated items.  More stress is compounded when it causes people to quit."
good,"its a average job, low pay, fast paced at times. clients can be stressful. cant support a household or family on there current pay scale.most work two jobs"
good,The people that work for home depot make the job a very family like culture to work with. As far as the pay goes it is not enough to keep up with the cost of living. Home depot pay is for the people that like helping peoples and is not really their for the salary (retirees).
good,"Management makes or breaks the company you work for"
good,A typical day at work at home depot involved arriving and first if you arrive in the morning signing in and completing the store checklist for the morning.
good,"A typical day for me starts with dragging pallets around, that I know will only need to be put back on the truck later at night making it a completely redundant task. Later I help unload a truck that we're supposed to put completely away while being understaffed and with no help from our supervisor who is just supposed to watch us that's all. Management seems like a bunch of chickens with their heads cut off, no communication whatsoever to supervisors or associates alike unless they need you do something immediately. The company culture is one that speaks of always being there for the associates, but that is hardly the case, with the massive workload being continually thrown on those that are actually willing to help The hardest part in my position is the manual labor, lugging around 80 pound objects continually by yourself in hard to reach positions with and without machine help. The coworkers are the best part, but with the high turnover rate it's difficult to actually form a meaningful relationship with any of them."
good,"Good part time job. Friendly co-workers. I like helping customers, that is the most enjoyable part of the job. Management is very helpful too. The hardest part of the job is when several customers wants you to help them at the same time."
good,The work environment wasn't too bad but the management at that particular location wasn't great. They wanted more work done with increasingly less employees and time.
good,"The job is enjoyable. You find yourself being bored as a cashier more than busy. I worked in both returns, cashier, and sorter. The Home Depot does not distribute hours once it is in slow season they will dock your hours without hesitation!"
good,"Valuable skills that included working with customers, learning how to work around the store, restocking isles, cutting wood, and flagging down forklifts properly."
good,"It was the first job that I took and while the benefits and pay were satisfactory to me, this job just wasn’t meant for me. Not a lot of women work overnight freight and I understand why. I only experienced one sexist encounter because one guy thought it was amazing that I could lift heavy objects. It bothered me but I kept working. Scheduling was a joke, and I had to check my schedule almost everyday to see if anything changed which was most of the case. Overall if you are a night owl, this job could work for you. If you’re not, stay away because I had to learn the hard way."
good,"A great place for a starter job, but rarely pans out for career-oriented people. Monotony is prevalent at the stores and customer interactions range from pleasant to over-reactive. Management is hit or miss where the mid-level managers do most of the work and the senior hourly associates and higher management become complacent."
good,It's a great place to gain experience and build many new relationships with co-workers and customers.  You're able to work in many different areas at many different hours of the day.  The workplace culture is highly dependent on the store manager.  The most enjoyable aspect of working here is your coworkers and job security.  Lack of leadership will make this a challenging environment to work in.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo pero demasiado exigente para el salario , descuentos injustos"
good,"it could be good company just if they pay fairly .promotiin isnt fair but .time is flaxible and we could meet really good people .imployees need better training .nobody care if you cant active your benefits ,propbly because of fast and stressful invironment ,promotion system and raising salary  isnt fair ,for part time employee situation is really bad , cut hours and veri minimum wage ."
good,Home Depot is a demanding structured company that excepts 100% at all time. The challenge for Home Depot is work/life balance. Slow to react to the needs of the associates.
good,"Home Depot Lumber and Building Materials Sales Associate"
good,"Customers act like you’re a mind reader and you should know anything and everything about there problem! Management is hit or miss, sometimes they’re great sometimes they’re terrible. But if you’re thinking about working here DO NOT work on the unload freight team!"
good,"I came to the Home depot after spending 4 and a half years in the US Navy and i find the pace of the store to be far too slow. It is a great place for those just starting out to learn a few skills and get experience while working, I unfortunately  am underutilized given my skill set."
good,"Good place for retail expirence, it is what you make of it if support is given. Training is impersonal, and rushed to cover the floor. Little one on one"
good,"The plus of MET Team is set hours. The down side is starting pay, The MET team work can require some skills and people who our self driven. At the starting pay they offer it is VERY hard to get anyone but UN-skilled labor"
good,"Working at Home Depot at times could be stressful due to management attitude.   I did feel I had to opportunity to advance and gain more knowledge in the customer service area.   The work atmosphere makes you feel like you're working on ""thin ice""  around management.    Job was nice to be able to assist customers and do stocking when not busy."
good,"Very busy atmosphere for managers."
good,A typical day at the home depot required first and foremost good customer service. The company called it qualifying the customer.  Don't get the customer what they didn't need but to get the customer what they really needed. Always get the customer all the best products for their projects.  Always maintaining a clean and organized store. Keeping all products instock for the customer.
good,If you are going to school it is a good job but to plan a future around home depot is a long road. I was beat out for a position i had been in for years by three females in a row because the supervisor was a female and time and time again she picked less experienced people so good luck guys
good,For a Billion Dollar company the Sales Organization was run in a very  Dis Organized fashion. The left hand did not know what the right was doing. Confusion on many levels with a attempt to be more Employee oriented .  Corporate managers were in charge of Sales teams who had never actually Done sales which created a lot of confusion and lack of respect from the team. They eventually eliminated most of the in Home Sales organization I was a part of to start over.  It will be awhile before they get it right and unfortunately they have the deep pockets to take their time. They will continue to experiment .  A shame because they have been in the In Home sales arena for 15 years.  Best of luck in your sales career but you're better off trying your luck some where else.
good,"If work part time, they refuse to provide at set schedule. They allow a 15 min break every two hours. As a cashier they push you to get Credit Cards. You're usually ringing customers, cleaning, managing your cash drawer, or standing in the aisle way waiting for customers. The management at my home depot was trash to say the least. But my Head cashiers were some of the kindest people i've ever met."
good,"Started out great. For the first year Home Depot seems to really take care of you and seems to take care of you as a person. However, as the years go on it is incredibly easy for an employee to get lost in the shuffle. As soon as a new appliance associate was hired, I would personally be pushed off to another department so they could get all of the hours. Hours were never consistent, which is understandable for part time, but it is extremely frustrating to come in for 10 hours one week and then 38 the next. Lots was requried for an employee to do, and sometimes way more than what the job descriptions required. Supervisors played favorites, but were at least courteous to all employees. "
good,A big difference between the different stores and management. Good quality of training. To many online training classes. Nice co workers. Safe environment.
good,"Home Depot prides itself on its culture and the benefit to you to work there.  Unfortunately, the practices they employ generally result in unnecessary competition between employees all vying for the same position.  Additionally, there are multiple departments that all handle the day to day activities.  If you need to call in for the day, you are dealing with one department.  If you have questions as to how something should work, there is another department.  If you don't have all of the tools needed to do your day to day activities, there is yet another department for that.  It is incredibly overwhelming as a new hire and there really isn't a well constructed resource telling you how or what to do or even where to go.  "
good,"A typical day here is not too bad, and as a cashier it was fairly simple. Management was unapproachable, more so the higher up the ladder. They said they would work with students and their needs, but ultimately did not follow through with what they said they would, when it came to schedules and availability."
good,"I worked for The Home Depot for 11 years and I enjoyed my job and the customers, the last management/corporate atmosphere was not particularly good and was stressful. I was very well compensated for my work/efforts but paid the price physically and have had 8 surgeries related from my time at HD."
good,"Not enough pay for any hourly associate based on what is required from an associate, managers struggle and depend way too much on the hard working employees. Lack of communication, and respect"
good,great people to work with but the H.R. department is seriously lacking and the management never seemed steady. lots of people who don't really know how to manage.
good,This is a very challenging place to work.  The daily plans are based on a company goals.  The communication  from management helps to the well operation between departments. Long hours to work.
good,As a Assistant Manager you put in many hours. You work various shifts including open mids and closing. sometimes a combination of all 3. The biggest challenge is figuring out how to manage your time to get the amount of work you have to do done on time. They do provide you with a decent amount of training to learn your job but you also have to figure out how to fit that in also.
good,Excellent opportunity to build sales experience and make A LOT of money! The entire outside sales .org changed and it all went down hill.  Accountants got a hold of it and ruined what was otherwise a great job. Benefits were awesome!
good,"This particular Home Depot has cliches. If you are apart of the cliche you are good to go if you are not watch out. No matter how well you do your job you are rarely able to advance unless you are apart of the cliche. Also, if you do your job to well they don't want you there. This job includes back breaking work with limted perks."
good,I worked at the service desk.  I liked the people I worked with but their was little downtime to review job procedures with more experienced employees.
good,"Was very busy with customer needs, the first manager was great to work for the next manager had no clue on how treat his employees. Fired people that been there for years."
good,"If they would listen to their employees and not care about kissing upper managements butt so much it would be better. Dope coworkers, and pay could be a little better but oh well."
good,Home depot is typically very busy and stressful and is a fast paced job. But overall Home Depot is a good company to work. The hardest part of the job is dealing with retail customers.
good,"Did not look forward to going and have to deal with a few of the rotten apples. Pay was not fair at all. 5 years, able to drive forklift, order picker, reach trucker, operate two saws, key machine, $11 per hour. New employee, first job ever, first day on the job $11 per hour."
good,"Your leader in the building who is the Store Manager has to be a good manager and able to control stress and make calls all day, if you don't have a solid Store Manager in a busy store like Encinitas then the store and moral is going to suffer.  Which in turn turns into bad customer service."
good,good chances to move up and advance in the place.... as long as you work hard you will do great  lots of cleaning customer satisfaction a must! keep them happy.
good,Enjoy working there love hours my job deleted due to computer systems  ima paint flooring decor price changes as well as divation cost from supplier to vendor.
good,"Really nice call center. Great co-workers. A lot of activities, gym, game room, huge break room and multiple vending machines and free coffee, tea, cup o noodles, etc. Majority of supervisors and managers are fun and supportive. The director is very involved with employee's on the floor and has an amazing personality. BUT, company policies do NOT apply to everyone equally. There is a lot of favoritism. It is a very safe environment as there is strong security presence, inside and out. The systems software is HORRIBLE, makes for very stressful customer interactions."
good,"I worked as a cashier at Home Depot.  It was a good place to work and I enjoyed it.  Problems were not always addressed by management, and people were promoted based on how well they were liked, not on how qualified they were for the position.  As a part-time person, this did not affect my work much."
good,"The management for the most part is pretty nice. If they don't like you though, they'll find a reason to get rid of you. We were constantly understaffed. The day is usually not too busy, but there are moments where I wouldn't stop ringing up customers for 30 minutes straight. There are times you would get scheduled to work up to 7 days in a row, but you'd also get scheduled once or twice a week. Even with open availability it is hard to plan around your schedule even though they make it 3 weeks in advance."
good,"When I worked at the home depot I was responsible for stocking product, ordering product, cashiering and helping customers. It was a fun place to work all in all."
good,The job was ok. I felt like i was being watched to the extreme there. I was uncomfortable and i felt unsafe. The coworkers were great and helped me out.
good,"Over the years the company changed drastically. When I started the company was very much associate based. We where family. "
good,Typical day @ work starts off cleaning up after the previous shift just so you can make room to perform YOUR job. Management enables the lazy workers.
good,"This was a part-time job for me while I was a student. The pay was somewhat low, but I my intentions for this job was to make some extra cash and experience while I was in school."
good,I spent 5 years at this job at at the beginning it was. So much to lwarn and i felt like it was overwhelming. As the time went by and. I secured my position in the company i started to feel like i was not gettin compensated for my work. I had to get another job to get where i needed to be to support my growing family.
good,I would coming in the morning stock my department and get the store ready for the day. I would have to help spot for forklift drivers. I had to unload trucks and help customers.
good,It was a good place to work while going to school.  I found that the management was not really that great in managing the employees. There were not great incentives to getting the workers to work harder.
good,"Management is fair, in regards of job description it's nice for teenagers that are still in school and they are willing to work around your schedule at all times."
good,Customers coming in are your majority. Do your job and have fun. Customers can bring in their pets. Makes you smile. I feel management is held back from solving internal problems
good,High schoolers and Teens along with newly graduated teens love the workplace. It enhances whatever other job you may have. Some really great people work there. My customers were my greatest pleasure
good,"It was my first job and at first it seemed okay but during my time over at Home Depot, it began to get harder and harder, the staff there are so tough on me, at first they liked me but it was all a lie just to get under my skin"
good,I enjoyed working for the Home Depot for the amount of time I did. The time spent training was very short and simple that led me to working on the floor a lot sooner.
good,Home Depot wasn’t very organized the docs were either very full or completely empty they were be times where we would have to pick up a broom and sweep or do anything to look busy because there was no work over there sometimes would be too much work to the point where we would have to stay over which to me is not a bad thing however they would give us a last-minute call out for overtime management was good the coworkers awesome and  The facility was kept clean which was something I did like.
good,I would have stayed with this company if they could have provided me with more consistent work hours weekly. I enjoyed my coworkers and the customers Id see daily.
good,"I found Home Depot corporate office to have a lot of redundancies."
good,Management was not the most reliable and did not have employees back when it came to school or other previously committed engagements. I loved the culture and the job but I felt neglected by my superiors.
good,"I worked at Home Depot in marina del Ray its one of the biggest store in California, we get a lot of business and for the most part its very busy and fast paste, you can move up fast if you work hard i was promoted with in about 1 year earned about 13 badges i was grate with the Customers and my cashiers that i supervised loved me but i was let go because i asked if i could leave early i had did 5 1/2 hours and was in pain from a previous car accident i had not healed but she felt that me being a supervisor i needed to work though the pain."
good,Not a super intense place to work . They have multiple managers some a good some are awful . You always remember the awful ones  . Department heads are usually good people .
good,I loved the Associate culture there but it’s very much a self made atmosphere. Leadership is weak at best and dishonest at worst. Rather than lay-offs they fire about 20 or so people every winter.
good,"If you are a cashier, be prepared for the days where you are basically doing nothing other than wait for a customer. If you are a back office associate, focus on time management. Supervisors lie to not get in trouble with store manager and ASMs"
good,it was an ok place to work at. i had a consistence schedule that was a plus. job was easy but boring. I have decent co-workers but management wasn't that good didn't allow me to acquire additional skills need for future and better-paying positions
good,"Advancement opportunities were biased, pay was terrible, raises were once a year and were usually 25 cents. Would have been a great place to continue as an employee but cost of living dictates life and Home Depot was unwilling to compensate accordingly."
good,Home depot is a good company to work for if your willing to have a temporary job or to rise up in the company just needs a lot of patience and is a lot of hard work and should be taken seriously because it is a very well known company and it is known for its efficiency and hard work.
good,Working as a team makes things easier and faster. The hardest part is organizing. I enjoy my coworkers they’re great people with personality and very cultured.
good,my department was always understaffed and as a deliveries coordinator i did my boss's job and no one noticed until i left i was offered more to go back. I declined. Screw that place
good,"Had real great experience working here. Staff was good, Managers were superb and the general environment was exceptional to work. Was really happy!! Kudos."
good,"Home Depot is a great job if you are retired or a teenager looking for pocket change.  Unfortunately, the salary offered to all new employee's makes it impossible to provide for yourself and definitely does not provide for a family."
good,"Communicate with vendors regarding back order abilities and "
good,Good place to work health insurance good manament great at my store. Retail hours and have worked that life for 24+ years and need a change.  Need at different look for customer service
good,This company is ok if you like to work long hours for no reason. The company is not one for advancement and the pay rate is pretty much minimum. If you need a job this is the one for you. But do not plan on making this a career.
good,"A typical day at Home Depot is hard work and labor, one has to stay aware of their surroundings while maintaining a good work pace to complete their tasks, while assuaging customers."
good,"The Home Depot is a highly motivated and successful business.  Their formal management, that is Store Manager and ASMs are extremely good people managers.  Their Department Heads have a great deal of responsibility but little experience managing people and are extremely underpaid.  Also, there is only one DH per department so if the DH is scheduled for the morning, or has a scheduled day off, the department is not technically supervised.  The same is true of the department managers.  There is an assigned MOD, who has the watch of the entire store, however, that manager is only assigned to his department so the other departments do suffer a lack of home management by the ASM or DH assigned to that specific department when not on duty."
good,I gave 200% to this job often working 6 days a week as well as 12+ hour days only to be harassed by the assistant store manager about a rumor he heard about me putting in applications to other jobs.
good,"The Home Depot has an easy applying/hiring interview process. I interviewed and was hired on the spot after applying a couple weeks prior online. They have so many open positions that they will probably hire almost anyone on the spot just to fill vacancies."
good,"Busy most of the time, lots of employee appreciation efforts on  managements part. Could be better pay.***********************************************"
good,"The Home Depot was not the most friendly work environment due to the fast paced and hurried work environment. Management was encouraging and wanted the best for the company,  however that took away from some social interactions. The position of Lot Associate was likely the most strenuous position physically, due to lifting and pushing for most of the shift."
good,"Half of the managers were incompetent and difficult to work with. Associates generally got along very well, some departments more relaxed than others."
good,"Managements could be all over the place. If you're at least semi-competent you won't get fired. More hours than you can handle if you're a student. Amazing benefits if you're full-time, part-time.. They're negligible. "
good,"The Home Depot is a fantastic company to work for. Many benefits that actually benefit the employee. However, if the store manager isn't fit, then it is a difficult place to work at. My coworkers are now some of my best friends. But the management needs help. They are one sided when listening to fellow associates complaints."
good,Home depot at least the one i worked at was okay to work at just dont get stuck cashiering when you are supposed to do your work in your department they do not care
good,"If you are someone who has the ability to sell product well, then you will be successful in this work environment. Not a lot of room to grow or advance, management is not supportive and does not reward initiative taken by employees."
good,"So far, it's been the same thing, day in and day out. The truck would come in two hours before my shift would begin, I would assist my coworkers in unloading the remainder of the trailer, and then we'd get to packing out as much product as possible before we would leave at the tend of the night, typically between 5:30am and 6am."
good,I’ve learned how to use pallet jacks direct the guys driving the forklift show to unload boxes off trucks management was great good communication skills the hardest part was when employees didn’t show and the most enjoyable part was the teamwork
good,"The H.D. by itself is a good company, however the store management is disappointing. The turn around of people joining and leaving says it all. Good for part timers and students."
good,"Too much having to ""kiss up"" to management to get promoted. People would be promoted who lacked the drive and intuition to manage a crew. People of quality and integrity needed to operate and manage effectively without having to micro-manage."
good,"I learned about all sorts of lumber and roofing material. "
good,"Home depot tells you all kinds of nice happy things that they will support you on your growth and well being. However all the time, while showing you shiny things they they absolutely kicks your legs out from under you. They understandably want you to do your job to the best that they expect, while all the time taking away they tools you need to do that job. I am completely understanding of customers that are hard to deal with and I will completely empathize, but when we cant Even get our systems to work daily. It did become very frustrating and then they told supervisors to just keep pushing us, that truly told me my company did not for one have a hold upstairs, but didn't care about downstairs either. I am really looking for a company that truly knows where the bottom starts."
good,"At that time Home Depot was a new developing public DIYS company, which was awesome. Learned a lot about customer service and management. Culture was great and so were the employees."
good,A lot of favoritism among supervisors and management also not willing to work with your schedule in certain personal life matters of time needed off they tell you to save or use sick time as if it’s for personal use instead of used for actual sick time.
good,I learned a lot of customer service skills while working here at Home Depot. I don’t mind working there but I would like a higher wage for the work that we do there and for the people that we have to deal with on a day to day basis.
good,"I spent most of my shift picking up everyone else slack.   I did alot of my supervisors work and she took all the credit.  Customers liked to be rude and humiliate your lowly waged job with all sorts of egotistical remarks and comments.  I felt bad for all the assistant managers because they were not trained properly and were always lost and over worked and stressed, which lead to alot of customer complaints.  It felt like a stressful, chaotic circus being there but it helped me survive college and for that I am grateful."
good,"Un buen trabajo,pero el tema de un bono grupal es el impulso principal para buscar otras opciones"
good,Nice place to work just supervisor treated his workers badly. if you cant work fast paced this job is Not for you and you really have to be a people person to work at The Home Depot.
good,"a typical day in a high sales store is extremely fast paced ,i learned alot through the home depot training programs ,very competitive , the best part is engaging with the customers"
good,"The job was okay."
good,I had fun working there. Most nights stocked merchandise and cleaned my department. Most of the managers are very capable but a select few make your day miserable.
good,"Typical day: Walk in and help customers with whatever project or question they have about a thing-a-bob not working right. They really expect you to be a tradesman or intermediate level handyman. Expect some of the aforementioned ""pros"" expecting you to do their job for you and know what parts they need for a job and how much. "
good,Solid Company that has a good structure. Opportunities overall involve driving Training and focus on Retaining individuals through more one on one engagement.
good,"In plumbing it's mostly cleaning up the aisles and bringing down merchandise. Sometimes there are celebrations with free food, which is cool. I learned about how to fix various kinds of plumbing issues."
good,On a nightly basis trucks are to be unloaded manually or by lift equipment. I am responsible for securing the store by setting the alarm. I am in charge of a group of associates and assigning their projects for the evening shift. I drive multiple pieces of equipment
good,"overall its a decent place too work, for me it was annoying because i went into the job with more skills then my boss in my department and basically was running the department and was suppose to get a raise and never did because of rules and it really bothered me."
good,"It was a fun place to work, got to work different areas so was able to learn a variety of things in the store. Was able to work the hours and time of day that you would like to"
good,"If you like working on stand up equipment moving pallets all day, you will like this job but be very careful!  If you screw up and damage anything or even if it isn't your fault, you will be taken off the machine and will have to unload trailers for 2 weeks while management ""waits"" for your urine test to come back!  Management is in a totally different world than the warehouse so expect very differing views of things such as pay, benefits offered and general outlook on the world as a whole.  All in all, it was an OK job but don't expect to make any real money working for them.  Took an outside firm to tell Home Depot that they needed to raise the starting hourly rate to $14/hour from $12/hour in 2016!"
good,"Worked during immediate flood recovery. Train wreck. Too much drama. That said during calmer times I can see where HD would be a good place to work. Management had a hard situation. "
good,if your not a favorite you don't get anywhere all they want to hire is part time people so they don't have to offer benefits. departments slack on helping the customer the customers then the customers get a mad a the cashiers
good,Most employees were friendly and helpful.If you had a question there was always someone there to give you a answer. Night crew was under staffed and had poor management.
good,Worked with great people and enjoyed the work! I Learned fork lift skills and merchandising. Leadership could have been more constructive on the merchandising team.
good,"Everyday, I unloaded trucks all day. The goal was no less than 3 per day. My partner and I would unloaded between 4 and 6 a day. I learned how to do every function in the warehouse. I was a supervisor multiple times. The management was not the best. They treated us like we were just another number on a piece of paper instead of the fact that we were the main reason things were getting done there. We were treated very poorly. The hardest part was not the job, but the fact that people expected so much out of me and acted like I was just a piece of machinery and never even paid attention to the other employees. The most enjoyable part was I know that I was great at my job so it became more of a hobby that I was getting paid to do. The environment was great with the other employees I got to work and talk with."
good,"A typical day at work was relieving someone on register, greeting customers and checking them out with their purchases as quickly as possible.  Small successes at offering other products for the customer to buy for their project; ""Add-ons"" as they were called by management. Learned many facets of cashiering and big box retail.  The management was satisfactory when I was first hired but changed frequently.  Ultimately, it was not for the better.  Staff was 150 people and variety of backgrounds.  The work environment with staff was fun and competitive.  The hardest part of the job was standing for so long and lifting heavy objects.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers and staff."
good,"Environment is ok. They nerf you do a better job weeding out the employees that really don't work, leaving others yo pick up their slack. And management doesn't support its employees like they promised"
good,A good place to work at the beginning but as time went on changes were made and the hours along with the stress level sky rocketed. Eventually shutting down the warehouse.
good,"great hoursWorking for Met at the home Depot,The issue lies within home Depot,We are Met,We are paid by venders to take care of their products,but we are home Depot employees only in the sense we work in the same building, we have a lt of same benefits but it is not a very good relationship always between storeside and Met or store management,we clean and set up most all store and products and,underappriciated,but store associates feel we get special treatment.Either way its too many games and a lot of gray area."
good,Some real nice coworkers with a friendly environment. Some things need to be tweeked but they are working at getting everything to run smoothly. Overall a decent place to work
good,"Friendly employee, pretty good staff. Store is well stocked and pretty clean store for the most part. Good mark down practices and sells. Always hiring."
good,"I will start by saying that my Supervisor was the best part of my short time here. She was always tentative and listened to me when I had concerns or suggestions for things that needed to get done. I would have stayed just for her if other life obligations didn't become priority. The only other downside to working here was the sheer amount I was in charge of. Most days while I was in charge of at least 3 separate departments because of how understaffed we were. I applied to work in gardens, but many times I would have to help customers and work in woodwork, lighting, or kitchens."
good,"Generally a good corporate company, but sometimes a corporate mind-set becomes robotic and cold."
good,Good job if looking for retirement or after-school job. No room for real advancement within company. Job application process takes a long time and depending on location of store it takes over a year to move from part-time to full-time. Benefits are sub-par and can help make a good start to retirement but definitely not the end-goal to solving the issue of being safe for retirement.
good,"•	Received order selection & processed, palletized, and loaded the merchandise based on requirement"
good,"When I first started there, management was wonderful;  old seasoned pros.  Then started bringing in young people with way less experience than we had in my division.  Then morale went in the toilet.."
good,"It will work you harder than some jobs. I believe the management staff has changed since I've been there, but they were pretty terrible. Not sure if retail corporate jobs just attract power hungry morons or what.... The front end supervisor was a control freak, his head cashiers where awesome though. The boss staff was a mix of a couple of really decent people and some jerks who just really enjoy sucking up to corporate bosses. They have stopped having as many true specialist and started hiring part timers with little to no training in their departments as well as under staffing for a bare minimum coverage though which seems to be a trend among retail store environments though."
good,"The Home Depot maintains a fun workplace atmosphere but has a very hard time paying for experience, hard work, and dedication. It is not uncommon to see an employee making $1-$2 over starting pay after 5+ years of employment."
good,"Waiting on 100 to 200 customer per day, assist with locating products and processing payment.  Lift to 50 lbs to 100 lbs a day, job require standing all day."
good,When I first got there Home Depot was very beneficial to me but over time and as we changed management teams the Home Depot has changed it no longer gives out the homer awards and the wage they pay us are not right because it’s psid evenly all across the board when everyone job title is not the same and some people jobs required more then the others
good,"The job was easy and we had a lot of fun on my team. We worked in every department throughout the store. THe workday started early, but, we were done by 2:00 pm"
good,"The environment at Home Depot is completive, fast paced in Spring and during the late mornings to early afternoons. Some of the staff is friendly but most of the other hands not so much. Management definitely needs improving and do more for the associates not just the favorites."
good,"I didnt work at Home Depot long enough to really write a review but I dont see any way around it. I worked in the lot, It was hot and sometimes very slow."
good,Not enough pay and no overtime or advancement. The schedule was set and never changed. I had to change to night stocker just to work a full 40 hours. The pay still was lacking.
good,I think I owe it yo myself to strive to do better in my career for my family as well. I work hard and take pride in my work and it is not recognized as it should be.
good,Working for The Home Depot is a positive experience with a lot of opportunity. The environment is friendly but the pay doesn't always feel like it reflects the amount of work you do on a day to day basis
good,"Days were enjoyable, employees were like family. Learned a lot about tools, appliances, paint, flooring, etc. The Home Depot I worked at became a training facility, for Managment."
good,"No review"
good,It was a very stressful place to work.  It was very cut throat and there was no care or concern for the employees. We were just bodies there. Your opinions or input was neither desired nor wanted.
good,"the home depot is a good company to work for, however I feel for the work I did, I felt like I was underpaid.It was also difficult to advance to other departments,"
good,"Really great company to work for overall. "
good,Working at Home Depot after being at home for almost 10 years was a great transition back into work force.  I enjoyed interacting with employees and customers and resolving disputes in my role as a Custom Order Specialist (COS)
good,"Is not trueful in the family values, they will say one thing then say another.  Associates are not nice or respectful unless you are in their circle. Sad but true. Very few excellent associates. Yet those get ignored."
good,Home Depot was a great place to work depending on management.  I left because of racial profiling and lack of promotion even though advancement was promised multiple times.  Management was prejudice against females and inter racial relationships and tolerated prejudice to be allowed by management and supervisors. If you have good management it is a great place to work as long as they keep out the old boys club. Working there was like being a part of a family and the employees were great.
good,"Set Up Cash, and any supplies for your station, "
good,"Management alone was horrible, let alone the saying that customers were always right. There were times where the customer would try to return something we were specifically told NOT to return. When the customer would ask to speak to the manager they would accept and allow customer to threaten us, as well as then being scolded at by the manager for "" Not taking the situation into our own hands"". Management was absolutely horrible. If you did what you thought the manager would of done, you got scolded at, and if you asked you got scolded at. Either way you couldn't win with management."
good,the home depot working in human resources was a typical position of communicating interpersonaly with customers and associates. The poition required great interpersonal communication skills.
good,"- Got along with managers well"
good,usually had assigned duties that did not take the entire shift and then we assisted customers and looked for work to do.  The crew was fun to work with and the supervisors were there to help.
good,A lot of pressure from management to sell products and customer satisfaction surveys.  Always hours available.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with unkind customers.
good,"The people here are very helpful,caring and very knowledgeable when it comes to helping customers,they are also very patient when it comes to rude are hard to feal with people."
good,Great place. A lot of people to meet and a lot of things to learn. It's a good experience. I've learned a lot of things that helps my thought everyday life.
good,"Needs more teamwork than buddies. Some need to be screened better before advancement. "
good,I enjoyed working at Home Depot it's a good company to work for. everyone there is nice to work with of course you gonna run into some negative people but its ways to handle that. I didn't get along with a certain worker we were always somehow bumping heads with one another. I went to the manager in charge told him what was going on we all sat down and try to figure out what was the problem and how we should handle it it's not a hard job to work.
good,"I'm hoping my experience at Vicksburg Home Depot was not typical. Benefits we're non existent. I applied and interviewed for one job, was put in another. I was pregnant and put in one of the most labor intensive roles. Lifting assistance was never available. Bonuses were not always given, even with proof. We ran through three store managers and two department managers in three months."
good,Okay place to work no very strict on breaks. Met some cool people while working there. The management was okay kinda confusing at times would take us of priority projects to fix minor things in the store.
good,"When I worked at Homedepot I grew with the people I worked with. It was a fun environment and a good place to earn awareness in retail and customer service skills. The only thing I did not like from the store was that if I were to work in one department a manager from another department seeking help would pull me and place me in his department to help. I was more than glad to help out with that but the dishonesty of the management after denying that I would provide help when asked was what led to them firing me. I would ask for more hours and was granted them but was another reason why my termination was followed up because after I was granted those hours, the same manager ,which I don’t wish to name, went behind my back and said I would steal hours without asking. Corporate needs to follow up on who they hire and need to make better decisions on the people they choose for management."
good,"It's a good high school job, but as you get further up the ladder, the demands of the job get more intense. Sometimes management expects you to favor the job over other aspects of your life."
good,"They like to promise employees an then not follow through, very poor communication with manager to employees. They push credit way to hard even when we have barley any customers. Seems like they are there just for the money an could care less about their employees."
good,"typical day at work was lifting placing items in its area to be pick and delivered to area to be stage or wrap. "
good,I learned merchandising and managing things and how to take lead and start working and finding solution by myself. The hardest part of the job was to be awake
good,"Customer service, helping the customer find what their looking for."
good,Pay does not match the hard work one puts in at the Home Depot. Work could be hard at Time especially when you’re the only one in your department. Demands on you could be more then the average person could handle.
good,"Relaxed, fun workplace. Some employees are old and grumpy. They were hard to get along with. Management is easy going but do not take that for granted. Learned all customer service skills through The Home Depot. Hardest part of job was standing on hard floor, which is nothing. Easy job working at The Home Depot."
good,co-workers are always willing to assist new associates learning their tasks and navigating the surroundings. tutorials are always available on the computers.
good,I recommend this more as a temporary gig. It's not worth the wages. Moral is not very high here. And there is really no job security so once theyre done with you youre done
good,"It really all goes back to a Bernie Marcus saying that we still live today: If we take care of our associates, they’ll take care of our customers, and everything else will take care of itself."
good,"I didn't see myself going very far with this job. I was looking for something temporary as I was a Junior in high school. Something that could keep me busy after school and also I could make some extra money."
good,"Thoroughly enjoyed the interaction with customers, helping with their needs and helping solve their  Do It Yourself issues.  Compensation for work was very sub par,  Employees were expected to have extensive product knowledge and were expected to facilitate installations of high dollar flooring projects, activities that would normally command a decent wage but we were only paid minimum wages for services.  Fast food employees were better compensated."
good,Working at The Home Depot was a different feel to what i was used to doing. The job was more physical rather than mental. The change was good kept me active.
good,working at home depot was one of my favorite experiences supervision was minimal supervisor was available to solve problems. there was a lot of turnover but overall not a bad place. favoritism was there but after a while you learn to ignore it
good,This is a good place to work if you are looking to advance in the positions. however the working conditions can be harmful to people with allergies and breathing problems.
good,This started out great then it came about numbers and hitting goals. New policies were enacted that mirror other major call centers that make the center a stressful place to be. No one ever said anything good about the company only complained about the changes and how difficult it was to hit goals which were based on customer reviews and you could do everything right but if the customer was mad at the company and gave a bad review it was your fault even if the customer praised you in the review for trying to help. nothing was companies fault
good,"Its always a different day when you're working in the Freight environment. Though trucks tend to arrive mostly on schedule with minimal damage, the operation process is much needed for improvement. The company has recently adapted an accurate inventory management system that enables associates to track any in-stock products on pallets in the overhead. Although the company provides community service projects, there is a lack availability to provide customer service throughout store hours & communication seems to be the popular cause."
good,just a regular retail job with no more career advancement to the kind of job or as all retail company you get a limit to go other than that the job it self real fund and good
good,if your in school need training  or need    some kind  of work for two weeks  or a year or two or long term  go for it  .in the special seasons and no one applys they take any one that can walk and talk.
good,"Evaluate department needs for the day. Meet with Assistant Store Manager for daily goals and instruction. Customer Service Driven company. Challenge was staffing. Fairly new associates felt under paid vs tenured associates. As department head completing weekly reports, driving sales for the department vs comp. Communicating with associates the goals, and needs/work list. Most difficult part of the job motivating associates to really focus on giving customers a quality shopping experience daily. But rewarding as well. Most enjoyable was hearing customers really appreciate you helping them solve home project needs. "
good,"Easy minimum wage job. "
good,Not every employee was friendly at Home Depot especially the managers area of the Home Depot wasn’t the best benefits of part timers wasn’t the best for us
good,"Was  a good job , just lots of night shifts. A lot of running around and lifting heavy items , learned to use a ballimore. Also Great working environment.."
good,Very fun environment to work with others and customers. There is a lot of room for advancement no matter how long you have worked here. There are many opportunities if you are a fast learning and work hard.
good,"Honestly Its a fun and great environment but the do',t pay living wage for quite a bit of physical labor. I also realized that upward mobility in the company is rare."
good,"Home Depot isn't a bad place to work overall, depends on what store you get. Everyone has their own click and some are like high school drama. For the most part, it's a job, so clock in and clock out."
good,"Fun place, great customers. Management does not hold lazy people accountable. In fact harder you work the more work they want you to do. And those that are slower and work less get less work to do and are never written up or spoken too."
good,"Fellow employees were often friendly and helpful to one another, though some would be resistant to providing assistance. Scheduling for days off is first-come, first server no matter the severity of the day needed."
good,"Good company overall, but opportunities and prosperity varies among the many different store locations. The ability to transfer and grow with the company is difficult to achieve and often result in losing good employees due to attrition."
good,"lacks cleanliness "
good,"Management could be better, coworkers are great. The work can be tedious and frustrating and there usually isn't enough equipment for everyone. You regularly have to stay over to finish work."
good,"Must be willing to work hard in order to keep your position as an associate. Pay and Benefits are outstanding but management is poor which can make your work experience a bit difficult. As long as you have a good focus on your job and don't get distracted by anyone or get caught up in drama, you're able to have a great experience."
good,Once you have a target on your back you are sure to be fired. Management wouldn’t allow me to broaden my career and move departments. No set days off and wouldn’t allow me to work any other shift but closing. I was there 4 years
good,"Home Depot is a great place to work. They have a tuition reimbursement program that has helped put me through university. The company encourages diversity and hires people of all different backgrounds and demographics which I like. "
good,"too many favorites in this company, management can be okay at times, hours all over the place, don't really work with you. co workers are nice and helpful."
good,I learned a ton from the 13 years i worked total from home improvement and repairs to growing in as an associate learning the ropes. The hardest part is having employees trained properly to help work as a team.
good,"its your choice if you like it. wasn't my cup of tea since I am a disabled individual...you want me to keep writing cause I have no more, blah blah blah."
good,Job is not bad for part-time although the pay is not enough for cost of living. Management was good at my local store and they treated employees well overall.
good,"in my position you have to multi task and be able to handle pressure. Sometimes it can be ok with the people your working with, other times it can be very stressful"
good,"Staff was nice and supportive. I had one really bad experience with a customer screaming at me. Management is ok, not really understandable when sick or death in family."
good,Your typical day will start with a problem that needs to be resolved immediately and usually 2-3 major store projects and 1 district project that needs to get done that day before you go home. The culture is changing and the roles are changing both for salary employees and hourly as well. The hardest part of the job is the daily stress and the hours worked. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers with projects even though as a manager you don't get to do it much anymore because of the changes in culture.
good,"Would like better pay for the jobs we do. Most have a constant schedule with two random days off a week. They 401k. Takes working there 10 years to get 3 weeks paid vacation, but they give one week after one year."
good,"Can learn new departments , a typical day at work is fast paced and sometimes stressful. I learn many departments such as, Paint, appliances, kitchen and bath, service desk, returns and Head Cashier"
good,"Micromanagent present "
good,Not Enough Money.....no room for advancement.....Garden department was a lot of heavy lifting and physical work....not complaining.....just a VERY physically demanding job for little pay
good,I would work for this company again under the right leadership. I felt discredited for the growth I applied to this company and yet still learned a lot from some exceptional employees.
good,"Learned how to handle a wide array of cases with customers.  Enjoyed the satisfaction of keeping customers happy and receiving recognition, it is a great motivation to keep tackling the job at hand.  The job is shift work, made it difficult to keep up with a work life balance."
good,"The company does not pay employees enough to live on.  Don't get me wrong they are a good company and stand by their employees through difficult times. "
good,"As A cashier the job is easy and the pay is good. The store management is not understanding of school schedules, or being sick.The head cashier is a micro-manager who loves to make sure cashiers are standing in the walkways so they are in the way of everyone, but its in the name of customer service. If there was a better culture of understanding and not having to stand in the way it would be a good entry level place to work."
good,"Have no Comments towards my current work experience.  "
good,"You work hard and play hard.  There is constant training happening, with the chance to learn a different area.  There are advancement opportunities in some areas.  If you have a good manager and they like you, you can do well.  The down side is they are not the highest paying company."
good,"all depends on what management you have whether its a pleasant workplace or not. when I was first hired on the store manager there was wonderful and had everyone working well as a team. She got promoted and moved and we acquired a new manager that had previously worked for Walmart.She was a pleasant person, but had no idea on how to lead the type of people that work for home depot."
good,You have to stay on your toes .. You are always being asked to perform a task . You cannot slack off otherwise your work catches up on you . A typical day at work for an order puller is very busy . We perform tasks that no one else in the store does . We are often looked upon as store support .
good,thankful for my current position. there are opportunities to grow and get promotions at the home depot. It has competitive pay. its one of the highest paying jobs in my area without having a degree or being certified at something.
good,"Working at Home Depot is a good job it your are a Highschool student, which I’m not anymore. I need a job that gives me more hours since I want to start going to college in the fall, so I have summer to try and save money."
good,At this location There was a lot of drama on the front end and a lot of backstabbing. Head cashiers were not loyal but always got the most credit for everything. The communication sucked. If they want things to change on the front end then some things need to change when it comes to communication.
good,"Typically offered 27 hours of work per week, but pay is low and cannot manage on this salary for long; however, this job helped get me through college while studying full-time; supervisor was flexible during exam periods; management is less professional."
good,Good place to work as part time. can learn a lot. but if you are looking for career growth it is not the place. better place for students and part time job seekers.
good,Trained to perform one function than moved to one with no knowledge.  Looking for associates to be helpful and provide assistance to customers wherever; then penalized for leaving the Department to help them.
good,Hours are inconsistent and days. Some departments lack team work. There is opportunity to grow if your dedicated. Stock program is good. No over time very strict
good,"Great Company to working If you have plans to grow a knowledgeable understanding of everything Home Depot has to offer, "
good,"In this company, it seems that management is out to get you. When it comes to their associates it seems they take great pride in joy and doing what they can to get you out of their. You are very disposable and easy to replace is the image they paint in many of their associates head. True or not; this is the reality to many associates."
good,I liked it at the beginning but it wore thin. I needed something new and challenging. The same thing day in and day out got to me and I was feeling fulfilled at the end of my shifts.
good,Working for The Home Depot started of great until they started reducing our benefits and reducing our annul raises to a quarter. The work loads that my job required for compeltion for rediculous.
good,"I started work at 6am off at 4pm. Came in to morning meeting with management, after meeting go to work station to begin workload. There  were  several employees per shift. The most enjoyable part was how management enforced teamwork, and created a healthy work environment. The part I disliked was having to leave early because of light work load."
good,"Each day changes at the Home Depot which is not a bad thing always it keeps you busy and learning. I was able to work in multiple departments with in the store I was able to learn a lot of things while employed with them. As far as management they were terrible, I felt like most of them didn't truly care abut the staff and the ones that did care couldn't really make decisions  because all the decisions had to come from corporate. The hardest part of working at the home depot was feeling like you didn't matter."
good,"The associates are really nice and though home depot is a busy workplace, i am enjoying everything because Im learning. I am able to communicate well using english language confidently and I am learning a lot of different cultures through conversing with customers. Schedule should be strictly followed which I learned to become an early person. Home depot is a busy home but I enjoy it."
good,"I always tell my friends and coworkers about the days I worked for The Home Depot. If you are to work for any of the big box home improvement warehouses, THD is the one!"
good,The job was okay  but but there was very limited opportunity to advance. The Pay was fixed and not possible to Rise any more than once a year and shifts were fixed with no way of changing them.
good,Very nice place to work if you are in school. Overall management is pretty good coworkers are pretty helpful work environment it's really nice non stressful very competitive
good,Home Depot was a pretty slow work environment unless its the weekend or holiday. It was boring most of the time. I had to find stuff to do until a customer needed my help.
good,"Enjoyed running around the store fulfilling customer orders for pickup.  Store tended to believe that deliveries were priority, though the corporate policy was the opposite.  Don't ask management for help.  Even with two people sick one day, they had me do the same workload as 3 and wanted it in 4 hours.  Lead, supervisor, Asst Manager refused to find help or assistance or adjust workload so one person could accomplish the job."
good,"Unless you're a manager, This job should be something temporary while you focus on going after your career goal. Lots of demanding physical labor out in the hot summer sun."
good,"Overall working at home depot was fine, but when you hire crooked management, the whole work environment changes. And not for the better. I would recommend working here, just not the one in Shreveport,  LA."
good,Depending on the area you work the direct managers are fair. New Store manager and he has let a lot of good workers walk out the door because they ask for a $1.00 more an hour. There has been a select few to operate the machines. Personal have been waiting over 18 months for the hands on training.
good,"Home Depot feels like a different job at each rung of the employee hierarchy. Your peers are friendly, helpful, and know exactly what you are going through. Managers are constantly seeking the approval of Supervisors, and on multiple occasions will sacrifice your reputation and standing to save theirs. Supervisors are all level-headed but you rarely see them as a low level employee. This all makes for a very political and cut-throat environment that only shows itself once you get your boots on the ground at the company. Personally, my supervisor at the garden department was great. They gave us the constructive criticism and advice we needed to do our job. The real problem was in the middle-level management. These are low-level employees with added responsibility to oversee employees but also take orders from the supervisor. This middleman position warrants them very little authority, so most make up for it by treating the low level employees as a means to an end. I ran into many problems with my manager. I was often trying to do the task they asked me to, but didn't realize I did something wrong until the next day, when my supervisor was telling me the manager did not approve of my performance. This was an all too familiar scenario after my months working there. Poor management styles were covered up by throwing an employee under the bus and using them as a scapegoat. "
good,The store was busy in spring summer and fall but very slow in winter.  My favorite department was the garden department.  I also loved that you could bring your dog shopping.
good,the company itself is a good company but unfortunately depending on which location you are at some management does not lead by example they give you alot of task to take on with no rewards i knew pretty much every department and would cover and work in  different departments getting paid at 12.00 ph.
good,Starting pay is the bare minimum and they require you to work a minimum of one weekend day.  NO PRODUCT DISCOUNTS for employees at the store on merchandise.  Very physically demanding and mentally taxing job. Not worth the measly minimum wage they offer.
good,"I learned many skills, made some friends. The management and general clique-likr atnosphere was stressful and unprofessional, though the store has since been mostly replaced with new managers and employees."
good,"The management team at my specific location always put themselves first before the associates that they managed, they also were lazy and worked when they absolutely had to otherwise they would not. If you want a team to follow and be motivated to work diligently for you. It is always in the best interest to treat your team with respect and appreciation for everything that they do for the store on a daily basis. "
good,"Home Depot is A great company to gain experience with, you learn new things, and its 401k plan is not bad either, but if you're looking for a job where you want to build up and be truly successful in i would not recommend such a company, not saying its impossible, my point is they would require you to work long hours barely ever give a nice raise out and you would be giving your soul to them."
good,"working at the home depot is fun. I enjoy the culture and people here, however the management team has issues with favoritism and hiring from within. I appreciate the opportunity to work here none the less"
good,Just an okay place to work. Like most places it all depends on your manager and the store manager. They try and dumb things down and simplify everything so much so you don't have to think to do your job.
good,Easy but higher up have no idea what they are doing most are new . Supervisor on other hand are well trained .numbers are a little hard to hit due to limited amount of works and also has it slow days
good,Home Depot is great! The environment is very relaxed even during busy times. Home Depot takes good care of their employees. I really enjoy working at the Home Depot.
good,"its a solid place to work, and the pay is ok.......the management is not all that great but youll get over it .....they have paid training and good benefits"
good,"It's a game of survivor, especially the longer you stay.  Inconsistent days worked.  Good pay, but you earn it.  Good workout.  Luck of the draw with management."
good,The Home Depot is a fast paced work environment with plenty of opportunity for advancement. The hourly compensation rate is not up to par with today's cost of living at entry level and long term positions. If you are hungry they do like to promote from within which can get you to a decent pay rate at the upper management level. The Home Depot makes a great part-time job or skill building opportunity for those with minimal work experience.
good,"In the beginning of working with Home Depot, the hours are great but sooner or later they cut our hours completely without notice. Manager don't really take enough care of their associates."
good,"The customers make working as a Home Depot Cashier fun! Our store is mainly a contractor store, so I've gotten to know our clientele and have built a relationship with them. "
good,A high volume work environment that expects and delivers a best in class retail experience to both customers and their associates. The culture at The Home Depot is inclusive and offers opportunities to all.
good,Home Depot is a large company that provides service and goods to a large array of consumers. The hours of operation are convenient to both shoppers and employees.
good,"Company is undergoing major changes and reduction of pay is an issue. In spite of record growth and performance, company is looking to cut costs by changing pay structure."
good,"My supervisor was great, my co workers were great. HR was horrible. I had to quit my first job, because they wouldn't work with my schedule even through I was told they were. took on a different job to cover the car payment when my hours were cut at HD because of the slow time, they  wouldn't work with those and those were a fixed rate and I made more money. I was passed up for full time to a male."
good,"Hard to get a full time position."
good,Although the company is outstanding moving up is very hard to do. There also seems to be a bit of a disconnect when it comes to management. Some managers are very good at what they do and are truly there for the associates they manage. While others seem to have power issues.
good,I was a hard worker I love to pick up heavy stuff in more make sure every thing is where it should be at in the work space is clear in clean the hardest
good,this job was a good working job . always busy always working always going from one task to another . never a dull moment . very professional work environment . Good benefits and great atmosphere  .
good,As far as job duties and management of departments the job was great. In regards to my particular location there was one manager who made everyone's life miserable. Very inconsiderate to his employee's job hours were very inconsistent in regards to scheduled times. I'd find myself closing at 11 pm- 12am and having to return back to open at 5 am.
good,under staffed misinformed employees teach you one way to do something then tell its wrong couple days later and all the time you spent setting up was a waste
good,"This is my venture into retail  I have learned a great deal on marketing customer sales and relationships.  Home Depot offer great tools for sale associate development.  My struggle is scheduling.  It is not consistent.  My start time varies and days of week worked vary.  "
good,"A typical day at work: Clean up for the full-timers who refuse to do their job, constantly help any customers and or departments associate any time, on feet all day up to 9 hours."
good,Management unprofessional but the hours  are consistent.  Not very flexible and training is adequate at least until you get on the floor.  Must be able to provide full flexibility on the weekends.
good,I've been with this company going on three years now I'm not impressed with how management fails to make the work place fair for everyone. If your in school and need flexible hours this job i s good place to start but i would not attempt to make a c asreer out of this place.  This effort is a waste of time do to the little respect you receive as an employee
good,"Part time work was personally rewarding but also exhausting schedules are generated by a sales algorithm and it leads to a chaotic schedule for part timers, managing the schedule manually is nearly impossible after a year."
good,Im good with people and working with others. Working there has been very competitive. I didnt really like working with this company. And I`ve done a lot for this store.
good,"The hours as for MET employees at home depot are great. I worked a 6-3, Monday through Friday. But, the work is not very challenging and as a result the pay was very low."
good,I had a job injury and they didn't took proper care of the situation.  They made me resign after filing a lawsuit on the company. the management was ugly. You never knew who was your manager. The corporate was friendly tho.
good,"I enjoy the people I work with. It was a challenge at first because I had not worked in retail before. It is a fast paced job. Accuracy is a must."
good,"Place is very cut throat and tit for tat with crybaby type fellow employees, but the place has a great eye care benefit for $10 Mo. if you work there, this is a must have, esp if you or your family uses glasses/contacts."
good,Worked as Customer Service Associate.  Had excellent rapport with customers.  Management was sketchy and inconsistent.  High learning curve with lots of employee turnover.
good,Don't know enough. Just started first week.A lot of hard work unloading the trucks. The sorting process is difficult to learn; but the process serves a purpose.
good,"Evaluation and repair of small engines, outdoor power equipment and handheld electrical devices supporting customer repair needs, day-to-day operation and maintenance of equipment in the tool rental department."
good,"Good locations near mass transit , able to learn product information."
good,Place would be better if the supervisors and managers could coordinate on what needs to be done. Doesn't help either that favoritism keeps some of them from taking steps to deal with the problems that may occur on hand with an associate.
good,"I get expectations for high performance, but I don't get less than marginal recognition and compensation. Home Depot for lack of better words threatens SALES Specialist with write ups if they dont meet or succeed company forecast for sales and plan. Its the constant pressure to out perform your past performances. That's creating a stressful environment that can propose  behavioral and health issues"
good,"Overall HD is a decent place to work at."
good,"As a store, Home Depot seemed fairly well-run. The non-pay benefits were very good for unskilled work. However, the highest level of in-store management displayed a fairly typical corporate lack of compassion and dysfunction. The manager that took over six months into my employment worried my coworkers and I, and was an untrustworthy individual that put short term profits over long term store health. Night workers were treated as disposable, and generally working conditions, especially after the store closed were very poor. Shortly after I was hired, about two-thirds of the night employees quit or were fired. Untrained replacements were hired on part-time at low pay with no hope of advancement. Raises were small enough to be virtually unnoticeable."
good,Was an ok job lot of people get hired for season and then let go very busy and sometimes stressfull dealing with costomers which was some times difficult because lack of organization also they did not give extra money for people willing to get certifications to drive the different equipment so lots of the employees do not bother to get and have to bother the ones who do.
good,"It was a good place to work, it just was never a comfortable place to work at. The team was great to work with however the managers seem to be keeping things to themselves."
good,"Loved working at home depot wish i would have stayed looking back at it now the daily work it seemed i was doing something different every week so that made the daily grid easier, the only down fall was the low raises and working different hours  ever week but i would still refer any one to apply there"
good,It is a good place to work if you don't mind getting physical. Pay is fair but the job does require alot of physical activity plus customer service. For the most part it is a great place to work
good,"Good, positive environment, Although there are personal issues brought to work. Not enough hands on training before starting, dealing with customers by yourself. Hard to get a managers help when needed."
good,Company was under different management back then. Most of that has changed. My personal feeling are outdated at this time been 11 years since I worked there.
good,I learned a lot about my position but there are somethings that need to change for accountability purposes instead of it all falling on one team. One of the asm's is cool though
good,"a job you can live to like, but you can't adore. the hours are good, but you have to sometimes pitch in and do two even three peoples job to cover someone else to look good..."
good,"The work environment in The Home Depot is very fast-paced and systematic. Management was not willing to reach a common ground regarding work hours which was the main reason for me ending my career with The Home Depot. "
good,"Need more overtime. Need well spoken people, meaning the management team needs to get together and help us be a team player. No one speaks up because they feel they can't speak to a manager because we don't have a listening ear."
good,Customers Service is a big thing there. You always need to be on your toes engaging in customers and asking if anyone needs help in any department. fast-paced
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with on a daily basis, but I did not like the upper management.  It was a very limiting environment for a talented designer."
good,It is a place to work till either you figure out what you want in life or you figure out if you want to bleed orange forever. They are probably one of the best retail places to work for a cause they somewhat care for you.
good,"a typical day at work was stressful, that being said i did learn how to multi-task. i also learned how to manage my time and money. The most manageable part of the job was helping customers load and unload their vehicles."
good,"Christmas Season was pretty fast and after that it slowed down. They aren't great at Scheduling, I would sometimes come in 3 hours after my last shift."
good,"A typical day at Home Depot is pretty simple. Put your apron on, go and sell appliances and try to restock as much as you can while your their. Everything about Home Depot was great except for the managment. They talked to you like you are beneath them. There were always three managers on shift that all had a long list of chores for you to do and would pile it on you and expect it to be done in the 4 to 5 hours you worked their for the day. This being said, it did pay pretty well if you go for Appliances or Flooring."
good,"The average day is a steady pace and if in my position was fast pace which I like. "
good,my role as a supervisor is to delegate and and assist with the roles and routines of the associates in my department. being one of the leaders in the building my roles also extends to every other department throughout the store. mandatory monday meetings helps to give us a broad look into the business which helps us to grow the business.
good,"Home Depot gives most people a chance to learn and grow, I have not had that experience. I have tried many times to learn new things but have been denied other rolls in the company."
good,"However poor human resources dept, Career is as good as who,s hinny you are kissing. Do as your told only. I was able to turn around one of the worst accounts in profits and cleaning within the company, I had 66 handicaps of 71 team member and was able to make account profitable and create a team environment."
good,Good company to work for. Management could be better. Pretty layed back. Customer service is important. Do your research before leaving the company. Follow directions
good,"Simple tasks, low stress, good for anyone in school. Start the day with a morning meeting, and assign roles for the day.Typical work includes restocking shelves, dusting, straightening merchandise, and reordering product."
good,"since a new manager leadership has dropped. a family oriented environment no longer exsist. no one can help. your out to learn by yourself. "
good,Take care of customers in need of any kitchen or bathroom design work. Help customers find what they need. Determine what product we offer will best fit their needs.
good,"A typical day at home depot in the mornings is slow until you get into early afternoon. As a cashier you will typically be waiting for someone to get done shopping so you can ring up their stuff. You are expected to keep the area clean and if the phone rings you should always answer it. Customers do come to you and ask where something is or about a product but if you don't know then you will have to call the right department to help. Sometimes you will work out in the garden area where you might help water plants or even prune the plants to make them look good. I've learned that you can't always please someone, multitasking isn't really my thing, I've also learned how to take care of plants and keep them looking nice. "
good,"I needed a job close to home until my kid was old enough to take care of herself. It was hard work that didn't pay well but served it's purpose. They do seem to be focused on taking care of their people, just not really in the money department. They have profit sharing so the longer you stay there the better the deal gets, but you have to skip around to different departments if you want anything more than the 3% annual increase. Terrible work/life balance for management, once you go salary, they schedule you 50 hours per week which seems like it should be illegal but I guess is not."
good,"Good place to work if you can make friends, management plays favorites a lot. People will get promoted just for saying the right things as opposed to doing the right things. Benefits are ok, but expensive. Lots of good people to work with."
good,"The hardest part of the Home Depot is the management, what mood will she be in today? My SASM would hang up the phone on me on a regular basis, was unresponsive to pages and her mood changed by the moment. This created a very stressful place to work."
good,"if they payed closer to Costco or other top retailers they would improve the service. Being paid the minimum results in minimum service. Their scheduling is almost intolerable. Multiple half shifts, or six hour days spread out over a week instead of just packing it into three or four days."
good,"Was nice to work at but the hours were inconsistent. Would be okay if you had supplemental income. There was really no room to grow and move up, lack of opportunity. Wish there would of more opportunity to grow, I would of never left."
good,"I wasn't planning on staying too long ,they dropped my hours and I had to get a job at waffle House making 3.00$ and hour I need a new job asap,I would love to work at the hardware store!!"
good,The job was good in pay quality but with the work done should of paid better.  But the environment was not so good. They worked us like slaves and nothing anyone did was good enough for the management.
good,"Bad management, Work to personal life is all one and not kept separate, the management is unqualified, however you o learn how to drive machinery, become safety orientated and learn new skills vital to working"
good,"Working for the Home Depot for almost 15 years has been a great experience. As a manager I love waking up every morning and helping my associates and customers. This is definitely my drive and motivation every day! The hardest part of my job is the work life balance. Although I love what i do daily, It often make me neglect home and also time for myself."
good,"Home Depot is a good place to work if you like receiving 99.9 percent complaint calls, which is what we receive.  There are issues such as delivery issues, that have not been adequately addressed since I started working there.  With around 1 billion dollars in online sales the OCC's should have their own delivery company owned by Home Depot and it does not. Instead it continues to rely on delivery companies such as UPS and Estes which constantly lose and mishandle and damage items.  Concerning advancement its a company that manipulates its employees instead of appreciating the hard work that they do. For instance, I have extensive administrative background and credentials in training.  I have discussed all of this since training and it has been ignored.     Management speaks in half truths when it discusses performance barriers.  Specifically it doesn't discuss the internal and external builtin performance barriers such as delivery issues and technical (computer) problems with the customer driven programs we work with daily (such as CDA and CRM) but instead through the metric system (promoter or demoter) and other means it attempts to blame everything on the employee including the increases in handle time associate with a longer call because of these builtin barriers. The Online Contact Center works on a promoter and demoter survey system as discussed.  When a customer complains that there is an item in an order that the associate discovers was lost or damaged in transit for instance and the customer gives the HD associate that assisted a low demoter survey on the call the survey"
good,Was a good part time job to keep you busy and keep your personal skills sharp. Mostly only part time jobs offered and managers had very little leadership or management training or skills. Fine for us that needed little guidance but not a good program for developing others. All in all a good job for part time.
good,It’s an okay place to work.  I’ve learned a lot while there. I just wish they paid more for the experience you gain and how many departments you have to cover.
good,co-workers are good people I believe they could have better management and human resources they don't know how to talk to people. but shift supervisors were great and the warehouse associates I worked with were awesome. so I would has its 50/50 working there.
good,"Stocking shelve and helping customer find what they needed I work well with other associates workplace was always clean and friendly "
good,"Good company, however,supervisors and managers need much more training in people skills.They know the physical aspects of the job but their relating to and delivery of information,instructions and advice is seriously defective and need much improvement Management tends to be vindictive when criticized Need more professionalism and openness in promotions and awards of associates"
good,"Busy on holidays"
good,Home Depot started off well and then managers changed. The new manager had an agenda of changing out the employees at his current location to bring in his team from his old location. Despite being the only Overnight associate to receiving employee of the month I was still not good enough to work under him. Which caused my departure
good,"They need to appreciate employees more individually and give a chance to see how managers will treat employees in front of customers. I left for higher pay and same benefits somewhere else. Individual hard work was hardly rewarded as much as they try to say it is. If they had more benifets like free health insurence i would have probably stayed, but they dont."
good,"Not where I see myself in the future, I strive for something better.. Hours constantly being cut,  believe other or not everything was always highly unorganized.."
good,"Will take 10 years to make average hourly wage. This company could pay more because they push you to sale, sale, sale. They keep a very close eye on sales. You can add many skills to your abilities and yet get no raise. No incentive only adds burdens"
good,"I enjoy my job at the pro desk.  More than anything I love my customers.   I work with customers to find what they need, help build projects and put together quotes for materials."
good,"Home Depot is a nice environment where meeting all goals is the daily task with assuring saftey is always first, enjoying your job, and helping the customers."
good,its hard and customers can be rude but if you put in work and have good customer service skills you'll go far. always be on time and be a team player that is key
good,Fast pace but great place to work . The team work is awesome. Its hard to advance but if working with the right team once your there it would be well worth the time
good,"management wasn't very helpful when it came to explaining and making sure you knew what you were doing, overall the job itself was a very good job but they need more help when it came to the work load."
good,Work overnights in receiving from 7PM to 3:30AM. Hard shift to adjust to but you get use to it. The job is physically demanding and requires you to be on your feet most of your shift.
good,"Not fun anymore, management has started changing the rules too often. First they will tell us we can do something then the next week the say we aren't allowed to anymore."
good,"I would'nt recommend anyone to work here , management sucks & overall I feel as though the supervisors abuse their tittle & isn't fair to certain associates"
good,"A typical night in the home depot shipping and receiving department last from 7-11 for first shift. There we unloaded dangerously packed trucks, with an impossible timer looming over us. Made for a few injuries and accidents."
good,"Home improvement and building supply retailer that provides a number products and services to consumers. Home Depot is considered the largest home improvement retailer in the United States. The company was founded in 1979 and now has location in the United States, Mexico, China, Canada, and Puerto Rico."
good,very unsteady customer rate witch will put the hard workers on a busy day as the cool kids sit around with management.. I liked the friends ive made but will only recommend it to younger kids who just need money
good,It's a fast pace to be working at day goes fast working with a lot of people you get to work with all types of people with different types of projects
good,Flooring was face paced department. Has many subsections of things to sell and stock. Days when by fast. Also next to garden center where you could fill in and water plants.
good,"As long as everyone was doing their job efficiently, everything ran smoothly. The only problem I had was miscommunications and managers playing favorites even though it would hurt the team but that's everywhere."
good,"I love learning daily, and I also love my co workers. Sometimes I feel that the managers should be more involved and a bit more understanding when it comes to issues."
good,"not fair pay, no encouragement to move up with company, lack of communication from management to employees... management does not seem to care for each associate.."
good,There are a lot of good people that work at home depot. I enjoyed working with the public more than working in the background.  there are good and bad managers.
good,Recommended if you are not raising a young family. The company requires a lot of your time as a salaried manager. It is recommended that you are a department manager to better balance.
good,Home Depot was a great stepping stone job and surely thought me lot. They also helped me to grow and further my knowledge working with people and in Plumbing and HVAC trade.
good,In contrast to my last store the Eugene Home depot does not give much advancement and normally has you in the same position for years on end without thought of moving up hard devoted employees. With that being said i love working at home depot for the customers and its ability to offer great customer service.
good,"I originally loved it.  They cut back on staff and customer service was no longer a priority. In my eyes and a lot of customers eyes.  I worked with some fabulous people and some great customers.  However, the corporate policy seemed to be, let's bend over for the shoplifters and the people who are trying to defraud us.  No matter what they project, they only care about the stock holders. Not the customers and certainly not the employees.  Don't you dare say anything to the shoplifter carrying out a vacuum cleaner you just saw him pick up off the shelve.  You don't want to offend anybody.  One call to the customer care line and your done."
good,"A typical day at work involves cleaning up the sales floor and restocking shelves before and after ""power hours"" (9:30 - 4:00). During ""power hours"" your entire focus is centered on customers. The hardest part would be clearing customers out of aisles to bring a pallet of merchandise down for a customer. The most enjoyable part would be spending time with customers and listening to what they have to say."
good,"equipment training through the company"
good,during winter do not expect more than 12-15 hours a week even if trying to get cross training. the crowd is amazing to work with and everyone is super friendly but the missing hours some need to simply pay for a phone bill is very short in the winter
good,It's just a place to work.  There is nothing out of the ordinary that you wouldn't find in any retail setting.  Training is minimal and turnover is high.
good,"-fast working environment"
good,"Making friends among the associates and customers was the best part of the job.  It was also a good physical workout.  However, you are just another employee there if they know you only want part-time, and are not looking to advance.  I really have nothing more to say."
good,"I really enjoyed working at the home depot store, I did not like or get along with the store manager. she is a very hard woman and was very much into herself and not the employees."
good,"It’s just for extra money, immediate supervisor is fantastic, but the hire up the chain you go, I feel management cares more about the bottom line than it’s employees. Pay is low for what we do, but the hours are very accommodating, that’s the only reason I’ve worked here for so many years."
good,From the time you come in to the time you leave you'll deal with more then one customer who will need your help finding items around the store                     .................................................
good,"Keep on working until your shift is up and they make sure all frieghts are done. i learned that, all the time there is a new rule been push to us all the time."
good,There are long hours during the work week. Just enough time every day to get home and sleep for 8 hours before starting again. Company offers great benefits to employees.
good,"I enjoyed my time with the Home Depot , I learned a lot with the company and  grew both professionally and personally in the roles that I took on with the company"
good,needed a full time job but I could only get a part time job at the time. The home Depot could pay a little better and management changed too much. They have good benefits if you work full time
good,"Start your scheduled shift. Help customers with there merchandise....help to check out, assist with pricing. Call lot attendant when customer needed carry out."
good,"great company to work for. good hours. good pay. free food.The Executive team is out of touch and does not believe in their people. They reside in an area of the building that is closed off to all other employees and rarely ever interact with staff. Over the last several years 8+ jobs have opened at the officer and executive levels and many good, qualified internal candidates have applied. Only one opening was filled internally."
good,Lack of motivation.Limited career growth. Not a good working environment. Coordination between management and employee is not visible. keen to achieve sales target and good customer service.
good,"went in at 5am to 130pm 30 min lunch took care of flooring department stocking and repairing tile  area. customer service ,product knowledge for the job from start to finish"
good,"Considered a career job, but with the wage they offered and with no options for overtime, that is a bit of a stretch. Customers typically come in needing help, so you always stay busy."
good,"Shifts were very inconsistent"
good,"A lot of the people you work with are lazy and kinda rude. there are  some diamonds in the rough but for the most part you are a floor mat for the higher ups to wipe their feet on. Its pretty competitive so either you take it or you drive yourself mad trying to fight it. the work as a merchandiser isnt very hard. It can be tedious actually. it depends on what type of store you work in. if you are able to get on your supervisor and district managers good side you will have a cake walk, they play favorites here. they do teach you a lot though and from what i heard benefits are good although i did not participate."
good,Good company w/ hard-working friendly people & fun team environment.  Home Depot is a great company to work for but the starting pay is not competitive. Turn around is very high. Great hours for FT students in a merchandiser role.
good,"Arrive at various shifts, not many set schedule positions available. They will not let a part time associate have a set schedule either. Which is crazy, many people need 2 part time jobs to make ends meet and they expect you to be open for any schedule even as a part timer. Nothing really hard at job, lots of good people work and are customers there."
good,"Pay is not commensurate of experience for associates in specialized departments.  Good culture, although every one starts from the bottom of the pay scale and needs to work their way up.. Easy commute."
good,"Flexible hours"
good,Its best feature was that the home depot was real diverse. Another plus to working there is that you have a option to migrate departments every 6-8 months. There was little to no career advancement opportunity at my location.
good,Started off as a cashier and got promoted to Customer Service Manager. Overall this is a good company to work for. I learned how to be a great leader.
good,"Bonus was good when store profits were good.  wonderful matching 401K plan, good benefits with economy.  pricing was high like all insurances.  Good when it had to be"
good,it was a nice place to work but would not give full time hours when ask. The work was stressful and the managers worked with the associates when they need some time off.
good,I liked the people that i worked with they were awesome. My problem came in when I decided to switch departments. The Manager that I wound up working for was ridiculous. He used to have this way about him that made my skin crawl and I'm a man so I could only imagine how women felt around him.
good,sometimes a good place to work at sometimes I really hate it I recommend this job to students. I as a student have learned a lot working at home depot.
good,It’s not bad. Of course there is a few bad apple supervisors and can pay better but great benefits. It’s hard to advance because they say they hire from within but hire military background applicants.
good,"A typical day at work, would consist of me repetitively taking phones sales and creating customer quotes for large orders. which would consist of but not limited too wood,appliances,special orders,siding lumber, drywall. Basically all products Home Depot sells. The people customers contractors and associates, were very pleasant. Management are OK but don't hold associates accountable., which makes jobs harder. The hardest part for me was dealing with taking on the responsibility of other supervisors for their departments they are in charge of. It was difficult to successfully manage my job and theirs, but i did it with ease and with a successful outcome for both. The most enjoyable are the associates but especially my team they are great!"
good,"Good part time job with flexible hours. The pay isn’t great and it take a long time to buil up any sick time but for a second job or a kid in school, then it’s an okay place to work."
good,"The home depot was a fun and productive workplace. However, the compensation should be increased because the job is tedious and working with the public and dealing with various personalities can be daunting at times. Also, the associates spend entire work shifts on their feet. The company does, however, provides incentive in the form success sharing checks and occasional free breakfasts and lunches"
good,Guaranteed 40 hours a week and no mandatory overtime with overall nice people. Pay is a median when compared to other warehouses in the area. Management is average although my current boss I enjoy working for.
good,"A typical day at the Home Depot would include assisting customers with their projects, offering advise on different products and the pros and cons between them, seeing repeat customers come back to you for advise, stocking the shelves with new freight, maintaining the merchandise areas and the store as a whole, providing a safe working and shopping environment for both customers and associates."
good,"fun place to work"
good,"Great job, needed to obtain a better opportunity. Need to improve with hands on training. Several people needed some insight on certain areas of training and no one was able to help."
good,"Worked at first as a lot associate then eventually got a position in the Flooring Department. The job is steady, the raises are not that good its something to do part time I think"
good,The company needs to do a better job paying the employees.  They need to do a better job on how to manage and tell people when they are doing things wrong.  There is favoritism big time and everybody gets away with everything and nobody is held accountable for their actions.  The only way to move up in the company is to kiss the management's behind.  It is not fair when it comes to moving up in the company.
good,"They hired me when i didn't have a job and no one else would give me a chance."
good,They never gave me a raise since I work there I been early so I can get at least 20 minutes extra time and they say I can't do extra time that's why I wanna work at Best Buy better
good,"people pick favorites here and it sucks, my yearly raise was out beat by the minimum wage by 2 days. its hard to book days off without complication. the people there are great though, youll make really good friends and bonds with the community. hard to move into departments or part time to full time and other people get moved constantly"
good,The hardest part is dealing with management. Meeting people and accomplishing goals and deadline. Getting to know your associates  and being their leader instead of their boss.
good,Everyone around was very upbeat and easy to get along with. Only complaint would be the difficulties trying to get in touch with management on several occasions. Other than that the pay was good and job was enjoyable.
good,Customer service for all carry out. Pushing the carts back inside the store. Cleaning the lot. Line up cashier support. Pick up the materials to the customer's special orders.
good,Never enough help you are constanly jumping from department to department because they are always understaffed. you will not move up in the company if you Don't Kiss up to the Managment. Those who work really hard always is required to do more. The consistent schedule is a joke go back to the way it used to be so it will be fair for everyone. if you are a new hire you will be closing alot.
good,"Nor bad for corporate retail. Back when I started the position, we were given a competitive wage, plus drive time and mileage. Of course, all good things must come to an end and eventually these perks dropped off."
good,They could.make their policies more single.parent friendly and adhear to them not all of us can do all of what they ask us and raise kids on our own they need to fix that
good,"I held a position at home depot as I was attending UMD working on my BS in Mechanical Engineering. Although, there were many negatives to that position, some things were picked up for the future along the way. For example, time management skills and getting into the mindset of finding things to be done during down times."
good,"I like the work just not enough money  to survive."
good,"Lots of career advancement opportunities. Can be hit or miss. Management has high turnover, which means as an employee you are always expected to adjust to new management which can be difficult. I have had both ends of the spectrum; wonderful managers and horrible ones."
good,"Would recommend this job for someone who likes to stay busy and is a team player and there is advancement opportunities, part time is 20 hours a week and you can pick the days and hours that work with your schedule, full time hours are set 6am-2:30 pm Monday thru Friday, holidays off with pay"
good,"It feels like home, but management needs work. I worked very hard and was promised more hours, but the manager lied and now im quitting so I can go find another job because Im tired of asking for more responsibilities and proving myself and dedicating time to a company that doesn't recognize its employees."
good,"I did really enjoy working there but unless you're willing to bleed orange, its not a permanent thing. No advancement for anyone who has a brain and a sense of career direction. There's really no where to go when you're a full-time student because they are willing to work around it but you won't even be considered for full-time employment because management doesn't think a 20-somethin can handle it."
good,"Hours will vary dramatically.  Working weekends is mandatory unless asking for the time off 3 weeks ahead of time."
good,"A typical day was pretty easy but could get stressful. I learned how to drive the forklift, electric pallet jack, and the stock picker. Management was good at first but has a few issues with communication. The associates that work there are varied with some being focused on their jobs while others don't show enough effort. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the uncertainty of what shipment were coming in. The most enjoyable part was helping customers."
good,"Typical day is good if the weather is pretty expect to be busy, if it gets cold expect slow.  I have been there a year and have been doing the same thing.  I have tried to advance but I am told I do great where I am at, basically you have to really know people and kiss, to get consistent hours, and be friends with those who make the big decision.  A person with no responsibilities, this will be a great job, but for someone who does it would be a supplement.  The culture is ok is all I am going to say. I enjoy the atmosphere and I enjoy the work, customers are fun."
good,"Fair company to work for. Lack of advancement and competitive pay. Helping customers solve their project issues is a highlight, but they will work you to the bone for as long as they can while paying you as little as they can."
good,"work 10 hours a day it goes by super fast, management it s pretty cool as long as you are doing your job. everyone wishes they payed more because yes we do lift a lot and I feel like management doesn't really realize how much we work hard."
good,Home Depot is a very busy place to work the days go by very fast because you are always busy. The safety of the customers and the employees is very important to this company.
good,Was never properly trained besides the mandatory videos. Had to learn as you went on. No communication within departments. Customer always came first even if it made the associate look bad. Often made new rules that were counter productive.
good,"Professional significant progressive business, providing exemplary customer service in a dynamic, fast-paced environment.  Requires the ability to multi-task, prioritize and troubleshoot."
good,Hours are all over the place. Customers suck. Pay isn't that good. Management is good and most employees are nice but retail sucks and you don't have weekends.
good,do not get paid enough for what you have to deal with.  understaffed in all departments.  work most weekends.  customers are rude.  work all kinds of different hours
good,Was my first job and learned a lot about customer service and home skills.  Was able to take what I learned at Home Depot and applied it to every day life.
good,"I am very comfortable working here, the people here are very friendly and the management is good. Though I have been promoted to shift lead and promised higher pay, having worked there for a month as shift lead I have not received my raise."
good,"Although the atmosphere was mostly good and fun to work in, the management is very poor. I believe they need to look into a new store manager. He is hard to approach and doesn't listen to what the employees have to say."
good,Working at The Home Depot is a good stepping stone for someone who is starting out in the work field.  However with the lack of career advancement opportunities available to the associates along with very minimal annual raises makes it difficult for an individual to make a career out of working at The Home Depot.
good,"typical day of work as a cashier would start with a brief discussion with my manager about the work I was expected to do for the day. Sometimes this would consist of the manager telling me what register I was working at and nothing more. Other times I would learn about another department that I was going to help for part of the day, or a project at the front that I was going to be in charge of. The days that I spent in other departments were usually right after large shipments, where my manager would need help getting as much merchandise to the sales floor as possible. The projects at the front were typically displays that I would be organizing or new promotional items that I would be putting up in place of old ones."
good,Extremely fast paced. Deal with a lot of customer and associate issues. Very customer service oriented . Good company to work for. Have to start out part time
good,Felt like I was working harder or doing too much for what I get paid for . I would really bust my butt off for a low paying job . I also felt like I was being picked on or they was favoritism there workers . To where it lead me to walk off .
good,"If your are willing to put in the years and work toward management;the opportunities are there. Just know you will be working with a mixed group of motivated people (majority don't wanna be there, or just wanna get paid but not work)"
good,"As an Assistant Store Manager I worked an average of 12hrs or more a day. I learned a lot over 15yrs with the company."
good,"If you choose to be part-time, you seem to get screwed over with hours. They keep hiring more people instead of giving the hours to those who are already there. They pay everyone the same even though they expect the associates to work harder (do more) than the cashiers. They used to pay the associates more but things have changed for the worse."
good,"A typical day at work would be working at the pro side cash register, handling many customers throughout the day. My job was to be fast, efficient, and knowledgeable."
good,The Home Depot is a good company to work for as a cashier if you don't mind working under 20 hours a week. Pay is decent and the other employees are great. Overall was a good job I just didn't get enough hours
good,"Management is hard to get a hold of sometimes, so you have to help customers as best a you can. Make them feel that you have control over the situation until the MOD shows up."
good,I enjoyed the job. I learned more about home improvement aspects and how to assist customer with specific product requests. I would reccomend this job to anyone who enjoys hard work and are customer friendly.
good,It's better than most retail companies in terms of work culture. Pay is very low and there is never enough help. Segregation of duties is not applicable. You are asked to do your job and others at the same time.
good,Learning to deal with every type of customer imaginable I thought would  be my down fall but other associates helped me learn how to deal with them. I moved up quickly until mangment changed and then flat lined try to transfer out several times but was unsuccessful. A big co.like that is alot like highschool if you don't want everyone to know your business keep it to your self. All in all it was enjoyable.
good,I have met some really great people over the years.  The MET is technically a separate entity and our team has a great dynamic.  Good co-workers make a huge difference in the work environment.
good,working here was a fun environment.  I learned a lot about bookkeeping and customer service. The hardest part was dealing with customers. The most enjoyable part was making sure the customers were satisfied.
good,"Worked here during school and boy was it rough. Sleep was scattered all over the place and after asking for a day job, it wasn't approved so I eventually had to quit."
good,"A overall good company to work for. However, they don't take care of the employees. If you've been with the company 5-10 years, other new hires will start out making more then you with a significant amount of lesser knowledge..."
good,"Your MET team makes your experience at Home Depot worth while. While in MET with Home Depot worked with a great team who had each other's back and helped with lifting or big projects. Fast paced, interesting but LOTS of cleaning bays and seasonal displays!"
good,The only thing I can say is if you are offered to go to training and told that you must get a corporate credit card and get reimbursed. Do NOT do it. Other than that it is a great place to work as long as you can live with a minor lack of direction.
good,Home Depot has a very productive staff and coworkers that look out for one another to provide excellence service for all customers products and projects.
good,"Great place to make new friends but the pay is very low. No overtime ever."
good,"It is a good place to work, benefits are decent, pay is above average. Management and promotions could be worked on, not so good in that area, only promoted if you are cool or in ""the in group""."
good,Hard to advance in company. A typical day at work consists of customer service and restocking merchandise on shelves. Management isnt really helpful when it comes to solving customer problems and scheduling leaves many departments with lack of manpower.
good,"I worked for The Home Depot for 7 years and I learned a lot but was also used a lot, and pushed to the side a lot, see I started in the garden department and then I went to the hardware department, but I was also a backup cashier and tool rental associate, I was also a door greeter for quite a while as well but with my time I helped out in almost every department in the store helping customers find what they needed, in they I gained multiple awards for helping customers and other associates, the problem was is that we had to many different managers and each one was doing different things that worked and didn't work for the store, and also I kept getting pushed aside when it came to becoming a department supervisor, the company never gave me a chance plus I was only making 10.30 an hour for being there for 7 years and after a while everyone was making 10.00 an hour so pay was awful."
good,"It was great in the beginning but as soon as I was promoted inside "
good,I loved working here as a second job to offset my income.  The job was so fast paced it just became too much of a demand for a full-time job at such low pay.
good,"OK place to work for. Plan on working all holidays and weekends. The work schedule that is provided for you will vary. You will open one day and close the next, there is no set schedule."
good,it was an ok place to work. met cool people store managers was also cool but not so much of the other lead people up front & just way too much work for so little pay
good,"Regular retail environment, lots of customers and tasks to stay busy. Many varying departments give a great opportunity to learn many things about helpful skills and tools. Great people and friends can be found here but recent pay cuts lead to many knowledgeable/skilled craftsmen to find work else ware. Management is run of the mill retail leadership with metrics on the brain. Overall good work environment."
good,Buen trabajo la verdad y me gustó trabajar para The Home Depot si uviera contrataciones otra cosa sería
good,The company itself is an amazing place to work for. Your personal experience will depend on the store your at. Management in some stores isn't as strong as in others.
good,"i dont have much to say. just that they hire everyone "
good,Home depot is an educative workplace. They are always looking for ways to improve. they engage with their employees. Home depot is more focused on the progression of the store than the happiness of their employees.
good,"It honestly is a simple as heck job. Have two braincells to help customers, and be nice. That's literally all that's necessary to do well in Home Depot."
good,i worked for them 10 years but i wasent going any where so i left it was a great place to work the fellow employees where great the mangement team need a change
good,The job goes by very slowly and tires you out. Lots of walking and physical work. The people there were not fun to work with but the job pays ok for a teen.
good,"It's a paycheck, but that's about it. I was happy to have benefits for a while, but not at the expense of feeling tired and bored all the time. Management stops doing things a certain way only to revert back to it a few months later."
good,Decent place to work if you need a job asap. Could be a little annoying with scheduling and the clock-in system is kinda of out-dated  needs some work.
good,"Home Depot wasn't like it used to be over a decade ago.  New hires get very low wages and very little chance of getting full time work. However, some people who work hard due get extra hours or offered full time work. I was offered full time but I had a job offer after college."
good,constant changes and work is hard. you work  schedule all over the board. you work life is very difficult. if you get into management you will work longer and harder hours.
good,"Very productive workplace, but not many hours and seems unappreciative. I have learned better customer service techniques. The hardest part of the job seems to be dealing with staff sometimes."
good,"I left this company because of the downfalls of upper-management. When several coworkers had to be let go from un-business-like conflict, management was very slow to look for new hires. Three coworkers were only replaced by one during busy-season for the freight crew which caused a great deal of stress on the associates with little to no help from upper-management. Middle management did fine trying to compensate though."
good,Good part time company to work for but found it hard to advance even with a degree.  Pay is also not great which is the reason I moved on.  I kept asking and showing that I was ready to move up but nothing was done about it.
good,I liked training and being an effective part of something great. I love that I have learned many skills like installing household fixtures/flooring. Many associates I have worked with have become like family.
good,i like working with the home depot because you have all kind of costumers asking you for help with all their needs in the store. the hardest part of the job is when there is not many asociate
good,in order to gain any respect you need to work hard. You must comply with Home Depot standards and promote the credit card and survey endlessly.........
good,Like most big retailers it's hard work for little pay. You can only get hired on as part time and when you prove yourself  they may offer full. Most locations have really high turnover which seems to make it under staffed which in turn makes the job even harder.
good,"I don't like working for home depot because they are as slick as a snake. When it comes to their employees."
good,It was a fun place to work at until some of the changes came about with a new CEO.  They made it tougher for all managers but since then I hear that things have changed back
good,My daily duties at Home Depot included moving and managing different stock as well as gathering carts and providing personal care to special customer needs.
good,Too many in supervisor and management positions that shouldn't be there. There are unnecessary changes that does not improve anything for the customers or employees.   A lot of bullying to the employees.
good,A day in the life of an employee at The Home Depot is fast paced and ever changing.  There is never a shortage of tasks to complete and maintaining high levels of customer service is a constant focus.
good,I loved it at first but then I moved away and to far of a drive not making enough for the long drive that I make to and from work but great people to work with
good,"The Home Depot is an OKAY place to work, if you are okay with not being recognized for the work you put in. Are payed less than a lot of the work you put in, and don't plan on moving up"
good,"Like any other retail store be prepared to deal with different types of customers. We work in a fast pace environment, sometimes we have the time to train new employees sometimes it is self taught depending on the situation. You will be required to train using the company computer for a few weeks before stepping foot on the floor. Know that you will not be able to remember everything from computer training, its easier to have hands on training. Be able to initiate task when given, don't be afraid to make mistakes as we learn from our mistakes. There are times when the store is short of employees so be prepared to do things on your own.Take things one step at a time, don't stress, because working for the company can be stressing especially on a busy day. Management is so and so depending on manager on duty. Some will respond to you on time and some will not. Enjoyable part of the job are the employees who work with you."
good,Inconsistent hours and kept cutting my hours when its short handed in the department and so then pay needs to be higher and weekly pay instead biweekly pay
good,"Work is fast paced, the more you learn the more they use you. Totally not worth the pay though unless you work at cash register. Pretty decent labor along with computer work and orders."
good,"Great employees but not all, there was one employee that was making it miserable for a lot of workers. It was reported to management, they didn't care. That's why I left The Home Depot."
good,Fun place a lot to learn but once you learn everything its a breeze . The management is horrible but the place is always cleaning. The hardest part is they change manager to much.
good,This job in general is good. The people there are pretty friendly. The Home Depot is not a bad place to work. The people you work with are usually really nice and definitely a great learning experience.
good,Great as a first job. A lot can be learned from all aspects of the company. As for growth in the company there's very little to none unless you're willing to bleed orange.  Learn as much as possible so you can apply it to future jobs.
good,"Good place to work. Get experience in customer service, different departments, and lawn care.  Every six months you receive a success sharing bounus, and on special occasions they feed very well."
good,Decent place to work. They push cashiers to get credit applications from customers but there are sometimes benefits to getting them like different kinds of rewards.
good,"stock, order merchandise,help customers find what there looking for or questions they may have.Meet goals that are set for your department. coming in on Mondays at 4am. for store manager to do a walk thru your department."
good,"Overall was a good experience. Working must be fast pace and efficient, working with others as a team effort. I learned more people skills and being more friendly."
good,Some of the customers are amazing and I loved some of the employees but managers pick favorites and give them as many hours as they want. They are also more focused on sales then they are the customers and employees. The staff came together when I had a close relative pass away and it really made me appreciate them 10x more.
good,"No support from management, nor do they understand when you have issue arise with the family or children.  Very quick to write you up but not a word when you go above and beyond your job requirement."
good,Repetitive work  10 hour days. pay made it worth while but raises were slow. moving up becomes difficult due to the amount of stress put on associates without recognition.
good,"Started working here while in school and it helped for the juggling process of school/life. Worked part time till I needed more cash, then asked for over a year to move up in the company, I was made false promises. Finally moved over to the MET team for a better schedule and work load."
good,Great place to get out of your comfort zone and grow as a person. Also allows one to learn about effective communication and problem solving.  I have gotten to make new friends and grow individually through this place.
good,"I actually liked working for home depot. I worked there for almost 5 years. I started out as a cashier and then got promoted to head cashier. I was constantly moving around helping customers, cashiers and my lot techs. The only down side they don't really pay you very much. Its a great part-time job if you are going to school. I was understaffed sometimes but most of the time I was properly staffed on the front end. I was the person that was always dancing around making the front end fun."
good,"This place is pretty good for part timers. They have flexible scheduling and some benefits. Most Home Depots are so spread out people wise its hard to find help. If you like to cater to contractors, then this is place."
good,Come in to work clock in go out on the floor and do your job. Don't expect anyone to help you figure things out. You are on your own. If you're late once or overly friendly management will threat to fire you. Hardest part about Home Depot was doing your job and others taking credit for what you did. The best part was when you have a satisfied customer and they come back to you.
good,"Home Depot is a great company to work for if you don't mind working very long shifts including nights, weekends and holidays.  The salary for members management is decent and the bonus structure partially compensates for the terrible working hours.  Overall a good company with plenty of upward mobility if you can overcome the scheduling."
good,Management is very nice very structured environment. Pay is not too good for what you're going to be working. If you're thinking of a promotion anytime soon this is not a good place.
good,very hard stressful work.tiring and repetitive.Working on night crew is the worst.with all the hard work night shift dose it feels like day crew dose nothing and still gets all the attention from management.
good,This company gave me a chance to advance my skills by certifications for both the sit down and stand up forklifts. From there I polished my skills and furthered my knowledge.
good,More challenge every day. Good work place and nice anbians. More people to know about  this job. Long hours duty no overtime and we have holiday  pay. Its all
good,depending on your job it can be stressful. home depot have a good culture theory but depending on the store management--that determines if the culture is carried out
good,"long time ago for me. when i worked there the job wasn't bad. i worked opperations. had a lot of fun with my coworker, we got along great. pay wasnt good."
good,"I found that while I worked there the store manager believed that cashiers were not in a position to talk at any point during his walks around the store, he would tell the department managers to talk with us. Great benefits"
good,"Hours of work are all over the place in a given week and not close to 40 per week.  Too many part-time workers; hard to negotiate a full-time job."
good,"There is always new things to learn every day. Coworkers are great and the teamwork is exceptional. I worked in the tool rental department, helping customers get the tools they need to get the job done right."
good,"There are days when we are fully staffed but due only hiring part time personal it is hard to have the right amount of staff and becomes stressful. I learned a lot about home depot. Management can use a lot of help....I believe there is too many Chiefs and not enough Indians. The hardest part of working there, there is no unity. No body wants to help each other. No Team work should I say. The enjoyable part is meeting new people and helping them and putting a smile on their face when you are able to assist them with what they are looking for,."
good,The work place was very fast and the expectations were attainable. A lot of complaints about management though since the never seemed to be on the same page on decisions when asked a simple question or not following through with promises or backing up employees when a decision was made on a customer issue. Hardest part was dealing with people's expectations. The most enjoyable part was meeting those expectations plus more. I learned a lot skills that could open doors to other jobs. And for that I am thankful.
good,I would say it was an ok place to work. If you work full time you'll get your hours. The management at my store has gone down. It seems like they don't care.
good,"Come in, grab pallets and silver carts to pack out.  On slower nights, work on packing down overheads.  Depending on the shift unload a truck and organize the merchandise onto pallets and silver carts."
good,Why do I have to write a review? Clearly Home Depot is not too great if I'm here looking for another job now is it? They over hire and then cut long term employees hours !
good,"Great place to work if you dont mind  SHEETY pay. Dont expect any real raises unless youre shifting up from associate to department supervisor or things like that. "
good,The culture is great at Home Depot. It is a very casual place to work at. Most people at Home Depot feel like they are underpaid and only have part time jobs. If you really need a job apply if not I would not really recommend. They are very good at working around your schedule if you go to school that's why I work there.
good,This place is a joke. They only are nice to certain people. and offer position advancements to those they like. Managers are lazy and some are rude to employees and customers.
good,"There was a lot of stress due to lack of proper scheduling and allowing for number of employees to work where needed."
good,"It was an okay place to work. It was a very busy store and sometimes you would be alone because they would put multiple people on break at the same time. Most of the people were cool. But they don't accept doctor's notes. If you call in sick, that counts as a no show."
good,"Good place to work, Sometimes your hard work is not appreciated and they consistently stay understaffed making it hard to complete projects. It can be a fun and a good learning experience. If you apply yourself and show your worth you can move forward in lots of time."
good,"Not many negative comments about this company. The company is great for holiday events, just needs to work on work and family balance. Great benefits, somewhat great supervision."
good,"my experience working for Home Depot was enjoyable, I interacted with several members of management and met some great people. The work expected from me was more than what the initial job description required. and while I don't mind working, I believe they should have had a separate IT person instead of the person balancing the vault"
good,"As an associate this is a great place to work with excellent benefits, success sharing and an above average starting rate. As a middle manager the job is very intense with little recognition. I struggled to find a work life balance and found myself turning int a workaholic. I would not reccommend this postion as a new mother or anyone with young kids (espcially if you want to be an involved parent)"
good,"The over night shift, was a great experience in general not such a bad place to work for. Good experience working as a team or by oneself, some nights low production and other nights an overload of work."
good,"I worked for Home depot, shortly after graduating and the workplace culture was great with friendly faces and the most enjoyable part about the job was working outside in the Garden center. I learned patience and how to be more passionate about customer courtesy."
good,"Cuenta con un buen ambiente de trabajo, es un lugar al que da gusto ir a trabajar"
good,"Great starter job, but very hard to get on fulltime. You can be there for years before becoming fulltime. It's good if you're looking for a part-time job. Benefits are great!"
good,"As a cashier you have to have great customer service skills, able to handle money, learn how to handle upset customers on a daily buisness, and know how to work in a team atmosphere."
good,"A typical day as an Assistant Store Manager is 11-18 hours long depending on what time of year it is and what's happening with the management staff.  This job was by far the hardest of my career, but also responsible for getting me the next jobs on my career path.  People know that Home Depot is hard work and if you survive 5, 10, or 15 years in Management you are a cut above the rest in the job marketplace.  Be prepared for work to be top priority over everything else in your life if you join Home Depot management."
good,"My day is spent on a cash register checking out customers and assisting them in finding items or leading them to special services that we provide. I get two breaks and a half hour lunch per my eight hour shift.  Most days we work short due to call outs or lack of scheduling. This makes it hard on the cashiers because we are always visible not like our fellow sales associates and take most of the complaints. This is a high volume store meaning it is the number one shopped Home Depot store in the area.  And we are never scheduled as such."
good,"Started with HD when the first came to Indy.  Helping lead and develop the stores and teams in the district was fun.  Once established in the area, there was a big shake up, there were some new store managers and new district manager.  It wasn't unusual I guess, 3 years with the company and 3 store managers.. but the new one was doing some unethical things.  When things got pointed out there was usually a confrontation that wasn't handled well."
good,This was a very average job and the coworkers were amazing and friendly however the management leaves much to be desired as they don't do anything.
good,Poor overall if you're seeking job security.  Not impressed with many managers' willingness to know/learn about products in departments other than their own. Not impressed with the higher up attitude of taking advantage of the worker by not hiring on more full-time workers. Many co-workers and customers felt ripped off and gouged by the company overall and major manufactures of the product lines.
good,Labor model of HD stores runs a bit tighter than some other Big Box retailers. Dept. managers jobs are more about managing numbers and inventory and less about managing people. I preferred the latter.
good,"Pretty low key, easy job.  Requires minimum skills, for minimum pay.  Opportunities to advance, but the lack of good management often results in missed opportunities to put the right employees in the right seat."
good,The new CEO has made some unpopular decisions with regard to wages and benefits package offered to full time associates effective 2017. In addition there is very little promotion from within anymore at this company.
good,"The stores feature a corporate attitude and a local feel for the associates. There are are opportunities at the store level, but the ladders to growth are slim and slippery. If you are planning a corporate career, the store is probably not the best place for you to start."
good,"My colleagues are awesome to work with. Politics do come into play when trying to advance. Some work life balance is a bit difficult to manage with shifts being all over due to retail. "
good,"there seems to be some smoke blowing but for just a ""9-5"" job it will be there unless you need beni's because you are lookin at over 600 a month"
good,"Home depot is a great place to work if you love helping others, the amount of customers wondering around not knowing what to buy or where to find it is high. Customer service always first, management was the worst from working 2-11pm and having to come in the next day again at 5am was my nightmare, it happen 3-4 times a month, hardest part of the job was keeping up with fast pace customers. The most enjoyable part of my day was seeing a happy customer go home with a bright and big smile."
good,I like that they give you the opportunity to grow depending on the management. workloads are unfair for kitchen designers being that we will cover three departments at once.
good,"OK place to work, the company doesn't always work with you which can be fustrating. I would say a good place for a part time job. Hard to get a full time job at times."
good,As a sales consultant you are asked to work at the store every weekend without additional pay. You also have to run bad appointments with no pay or compensation and you are not allowed to pre-screen the appointments in advance.
good,"I've been with HD for 5 years as a full time sales associate.  My co-workers are like my second family, but management lacks in many areas.  Pay is terrible for the amount of work required, raises are minimal.  Benefits are a plus."
good,"Home Depot is a good company to work for if you are looking for good benefits and pay.  Due to the competitive market they are always trying to stay ahead of the game and it is a very competitive work environment.  If you have good networking skills and like to change around to different positions this a good fit for you.  The hardest part of the job is that it is fast paced, so it can be very stressful.  Going over and above the call of duty and working proactively is seen as a good leader in the company and moves you to where you want to be."
good,Focus on customer relations and projected sales.  Company focus changes often.  Team approach and individual sales plan key to success.
good,"While the hours were good at times, the lack of management and carelessness from the managers really made me dread going to work on a daily basis. While they did work around my school schedule at the time, they eventually forgot about me going to school and ruined my schedule."
good,Home Depot has a great training program that will prepare you for many future jobs. As a manager there for 13 years it is overall a good company but it has a terrible work/life balance. Of the fellow managers I have worked with we all agree that the training is great but it is at great sacrifice to your home life.
good,"Home depot is a really great place to work. the staff tends to be really helpful, and caring, a very tight knit community, however trying to get training is about as effective as wiping up an oil spill with a 1-ply gas station napkin."
good,"I was a cashier for a year. During my time I had four different supervisors. For a month or so I didn't even have a supervisor.  The assistant managers do not care about their employees. They talk to associates about how annoying other associates are. It's very unprofessional. The managers also HATE when you ask them for help and it shows on their faces, even though it's their job.  "
good,"Not a terrible place to work but I was verbally attacked and management at the Home Depot in Racine did very little to correct it. I reported the attacks to management many times before leaving the company. I offered to go to a different department, but I was turned down due to a policy that restricts transfers before the probation period was up."
good,"you have good days and bad days anytime you work with the  public, I've learned how to alter paint colors, different sheens, which ones are best for which rooms, how to finish furniture etc.  the hardest part of my job is to deal with difficult customers, and I love laughing with the customers."
good,"Great company to work for when you first start then u realize that no one stays due to great review, but crappie raises even though they tell you that they clear a million dollars a week."
good,"Not very organized. Co-workers are somewhat team players. Not too much room for improvement. Management shows a lot of favouritism. If you enjoy customer service, this is not a bad job."
good,"fast paced, amount of work can be overwhelming if you let it. above average info on training and expectancy. very few leaders are great to work with. they understand the challenges and your job, not just being a people manager. some co-workers are great to work with. try to keep to yourself as much as possible and stay focused on the task at hand. minimal pay and pay increases for physicality of work."
good,"A typically work day consent of walking the store to make sure it fits with safety compliance. Opening up different departments, and making sure the store grand opening ready. manage me team , to insure  the shelves are stocked so there will be any empty holes. At 10:00am power hour begins were we focus on customer service.  "
good,It was fine just overly strict managers . Easy job. Decent pay just a job I guess.  I only quit because of family obligations. But yea the managers are just kind of mean about things and don't seem to know what's going on with new hires.
good,"Staffing specialist"
good,"learned about home improvement things "
good,The company was alright I went into the company 2007 and that is when the recession hit. I had to be very multi diverse job which I do not mind but with a staff of 5 of a very large store it was overwhelming at times. Management did not update computer systems when they were suppose to for the departments so special orders were coming out wrong and some of their policies of the store was not good the customer did not understand the 10% restock fee if they brought back a special order. Severely understaffed store
good,"Home Depot taught me the safety keys for working heavy machinery around customers. Performing difficult tasks flawlessly such as driving machines through narrow aisles, picking and receiving orders, palletizing merchandise, and loading and offloading trucks."
good,Very nice family-orientated working environment. Low compensation and very little chance to advance and benefits are not much worth mentioning about. Not very work schedule friendly.
good,I've earned a lot about the construction process while working at the Home Depot. There are so many knowledgeable employees to teach you exactly what is needed to complete a project so you're able to pass that knowledge on to customers.
good,The job was a good job. I worked with Amazing people including management. The problem was that we weren't valued as employees. Our benefits wer subpar. And ultimately we were seen as expendable.
good,"7am review all orders, do filing answer phones, help with customer. it was ok. personnal  reason i had to leave.great working conditions."
good,"most of your work is grabbing carts but sometimes you have to help customers with items to their car."
good,"Worked here for almost a year, with management knowing that I had 3 kids, including a baby.  My schedule was from 4pm to close the whole time I worked there - and 36 hours a week - which means that I never got to see my older kids and the baby didn't get to know the family at all.  I had to take her to overnight day care until I got home from work at sometimes midnight or later.  It also means no benefits.... except for the time off every few weeks to comply with employment laws and keep me part time."
good,my experience while i was employed at home depot was very good. I learned how to use various power tools etc. My co workers made sure I learned everything I needed to learn to i can meet my job requirements.
good,"-Very average retail store to work at"
good,"There is little room for advancement in this company. The company, as a rule, is sexist and does not believe that females can work in the typical ""manly"" departments."
good,"My typical day at work could range from assisting costumers all day to handling machines, such as fork lifts, reach trucks and electric pallet jacks."
good,"I worked for Home Depot in Georgia and in Colorado. It is a great compnay to work for because it does allow transfers if you are thinking about moving."
good,I enjoyed my time with home depot I only wish they didn't cut back the jobs in my section I think I could have advanced My co workers had good work ethic
good,"The environment among certain peers was very friendly and fun, certainly among my younger coworkers it was a joy to work and to help customers meet their needs and wants. Among management or older coworkers there definitely was a clash of opinions and work-style such as following rules strictly, even at the expense of a customer. I found it very difficult to stay in my station (cashier) while i watched an elderly woman or man attempt to carry a 20-30lb bag of mulch or soil, it is against my values to not help our elders and to offer our assistance to them."
good,The job was a good learning experience/environment and had great opportunities to succeed in the company but the pay and benefits weren't to good
good,"Good place to work. I would work there again if the opportunity arose."
good,"An ok place to work, not very fair to employees and not very understanding of certain situations. Would work again under certain circumstances."
good,"Lots of repetition, both physically and mentally which leads the job to be both hard and tedious and especially soul draining. Efforts to make the average associate feel important and empowered come off as disingenuous corporate jingoism. Not atypical, and not unexpected, but genuinely tiring as the surreal nature of high spirited corporate culture is entirely unnatural and again not remotely close to regular human interaction. You are asked to be obsequious while at the same time suspicious of every customer being a thief while trying to bilk the customer for every red cent. It’s impossible not to become cynical because being genuinely helpful and going out of your way to help the customer will inevitably create a vulnerability to be exploited by the terrible few, and when you are exploited you will be found at fault. The company protects itself under a vague interpretation of ‘doing the right thing’ where if you somehow fail to find the exactly perfect balance between helping the customer and protecting the company’s profits you’re the one in the wrong and need to be coached in a manner that still leaves it up to your interpretation. God help you if you interpret incorrectly and God help you if the customer you’re helping makes you regret being kind."
good,"I liked working here. It was easy, and fun at times. The supervisors were the main issue. Ton of pressure to open credit cards/pro extras non stop, and bad attitudes. Very hover like behavior at Providence location. Also, very strict 3 strike tardiness policy. Would still be there if it wasn't so strict."
good,"The company culture is totally different from before with the seasoned leadership from within.  The previous team of leadership applied the principles of core values as the preach.  The present team in general who mostly came from the outside, only preaches core value but does not apply it.  There is too much politics in the company in general.  Most Lead Management in store level as I see and learn from other associates from other stores, observes the impartial and unbalanced treatment of employees.  What is clear at present is whom you know than what you know.  The practice now in general is that you have to be in the top management's blessing as your best talent. The original culture that respect and value for employees' welfare is non-existence. if you are a highly principled person who is not into work politics, this is not a conducive work environment for you.  But if you are a person that loves corporate politics, it is the best pllace for you."
good,Great place to learn customer relation skills. Showed excellent customer relation skills by making each experience more personable. Received several Home Depot awards for customer satisfaction.
good,"You have to love what you do, in order to make a career at Home Depot. It is a great company to work for. The people makes it a great place along with the customers. Management team, like any other business can be hard. That's just how the business life goes."
good,I learned great customer service skills and commercial contractor skills. A typical work day would be switching between departments throughout the store to assist both the Do-It-Yourself and Commercial Contractor customers. Many of the store management were always very helpful. The hardest part of the job was during inventory count and reorganization where it was very taxing physically. I enjoyed working mostly with the customers and making a difference in their shopping experience.
good,typical day working for the home depot as a supervisor includes solving customer issues as they arise while effectively managing your associates to ensure that all assigned tasks are completed in a timely manner. i learned to better my customer service skills as well as time management and other good leadership qualities. the management team has its ups and downs but generally seems to care about the associates. my co workers are a great team of supervisors who try to keep the workplace fun to keep our associates motivated through the day. the hardest and most enjoyable part of my job i find is managing the multiple associates i have while also ensuring  that i give customers grade A customer service .
good,Working at Home depot was crazy.I use to be the only guy in my department trying to take care of 20 people at one time. the hardest part of this job was leaving the cutting room. Once you get in there your trapped forever
good,nice bunch of people to work with. The job its self is OK for being retail work. The work load is a very good balance and you always get your breaks on time
good,It can be a great place to work at until they change out your management team multiple times and give you the worst batch. Management team only cares for itself and doesn't value the associates that are working to get them their bonuses. Coworkers and supervisors are great and can work as a team.
good,"Management plays favorites and lets them get away with almost anything. New store manager is good so far, still learning. Many policies not adhered to, but only non-favorites get disciplined."
good,This is a good job if ur going to school or dont want full time. You wont get full time here or they will give positions to people who dont deserve them. Favoritism is huge here. Mostly in front end management.
good,"Completing projects of various sizes (IE: a section of a bay to entire section of a store)."
good,"being certified in all of the fork lifts, I was always helping pulling down materials for customers and my fellow coworkers, helping customers with any needs."
good,This company is oriented to certain management skills. I have learned that the company is only concerned about selling and sometimes worry about some of their employees overall but not really interest what you got to say. Like brush you off and try to treat you like a child and not actually adult per conversations. When comes to events to be noticed on what you accomplished but you just don't get recognized at what you had done for company at all.
good,"Work was well paid but exhausting. It was almost worth it, and I had intended to stay till they decided suddenly I was seasonal, not part time, and was let go with no prior warning or time to find another job."
good,"Great warehouse environment, good pay, very team oriented, great hours management is there to help even after your initial training, sometimes the work can be little too much"
good,"Ok place to work, too many schedule changes no advance notice to work into your family life. Feel threatened if you do not agree with their schedule changes, high turnover and management is not the best."
good,"This store lacks direction and good leadership. It is severely understaffed and needs a manager who is visible to his co-workers and gets involved with the business on the floor."
good,"I LOVED my job as a Freight Associate at The Home Depot in Logansport, Indiana. It was an extremely easy job, and my direct supervisor was absolutely great! That being said, the managers play favorites, and don't even bother to hide it. On top of that, other than myself, and a select other few who had set hours, the scheduling is absolutely hay-wire, with barely any coverage for people's lunches, and in between shifts on some days, and on others, there be 3 people in one department just to cover a lunch. I ended up pretty much teaching myself the sales departments (with the help of the associates in their respective departments to give me pointers) in order to help out with the coverage shortage. As far as favoritism goes, unless you've worked there a decade, already made it to department supervisor, or are a cashier, pretty much, you can expect to do all of the aforementioned associates work as well as your own, and you'd better be quick about it, too. Don't get me wrong, the management at the Logansport Home Depot are great people outside of work, but, truthfully, I do not feel they're fit for management, and the fact that most of them have been managers in other Home Depot stores concerns me, as I cannot see how any company could keep employees with such management as those who don't even make an effort to ATTEMPT to hide their favoritism."
good,"I love working for the Home Depot the atmosphere is fast, fun and friendly. We are a family at the Home Depot. They provide advancement opportunities within the company. My only bad thing to say is the pay rate is not very good it will take me 5 years to reach your desired salary I need now to live with the way the nickel and dime you."
good,"Home Depot is a great place to work if you are going to school or just need to work part time.  Co-Workers are the best.  Most department heads don't do the job that they need to do and therefore puts more work on the department to cover.  You MUST be willing to do a lot of lifting, moving and climbing up and down ladders."
good,Employees were expected to be available 24hrs a day 7 days a week and start times changed day to day (no shift work could start at 6am on Monday and 2pm on Tues)
good,"A typical day on my job can be either super busy or steady constant work flow. as long as you have great time management and can prioritize your  workload there shouldn't be many issues if any.I have learned a lot in the company , it's more in depth than described. I love the problem solving portion. My team is awesome we communicate very well with each other and work wonderfully. the hardest part of the job is communication with other co workers and some supervisors.The most enjoyable part of the job is getting it all done in a timely manner and no errors."
good,"I would report to work and begin preparing the lumber yard for customers"
good,"Ok place just dont try to make it a career.  Nice co workers, nice customers (for the most part).  When I worked there the hours were all over the map but the more years you put in the better the schedule gets."
good,"An average position, nothing particularly outstanding about the position or the company. Some good coworkers and decent management. Although being understaffed was a constant issue."
good,I loved the people I worked with but the management was poor. It's a great plans to work and easy to move up but the front end supervisor was unprofessional.
good,Everything was fine working here until we had new management come in. Ever since then our hours have been cut drastically. I started to get 17 hours if I was lucky. Some people say they get 8 sometimes. Coworkers are the best! They're about the only thing that makes you want to stay. They're all friendly.
good,"unorganized communication between chain of command, especially from the very top.  Working for the Homedepot has been trying at times, but overall it's a good company to work for."
good,"A typical work day at Home Depot was usually a productive work day for me. I learned news things everyday, because I educated myself and the customers at the same time whenever they needed product knowledge. Management could do a little better with the scheduling of shifts, and giving better pay increases. Co-workers usually were decent, and did well assisting customers. The hardest part of the job was opening the next day after working a closing shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning bout things in all of the departments and sometimes being able to move around the store."
good,"My head supervisor is very approachable. you have opportunity to learn a lot of new things."
good,"I experience very reasonable expectations from the managers, and they give bonuses to all the employees based on sales.  Also, I learned a whole lot about home improvement while I worked there."
good,"A typical day can be slow and sometimes busy depending on the season and the time of day. The management team are pretty good at giving direction and guidance. The co-workers are great people, but the hardest part of my job is dealing with upset impatient customers. The most enjoyable part of my job would be communicating and helping people with their problems and giving them solutions."
good,"It's another day at work every other day."
good,"Although the company appears to be centralized, your experience will vary from store to store. Your ability to communicate with management will be crucial to your advancement within the company. These are the people who can choose your path into higher positioning or they can use their influence to stagnate your growth."
good,i ran the tool rental department. i had a 5 man crew that i had to do monthly reviews for. we had weekly team meets where i would talk about new product and department numbers for the week.
good,"I've learned a lot about home improvement and many different things on how to install and make sure everything is in working order. "
good,"Customer Service is the number one priority for The Home Depot(THD) but customers are not able to expect good service due to short of employees working on the floor."
good,Home Depot was a good place to work as a student part time during the school year and closer to full time in the summer. It would be considered a typical retail experience for a big box chain.
good,"Helping Customers out with questions about home products. Down stock in your department making sure you have your department stock, clean and safe. Management some are good.  Co Workers are fun and friendly. Hardest part of the job is Time management by helping Customers and doing your daily task what the Management gave you to do being stocking your department etc. I enjoyed the Co Workers."
good,"This is a good company if you're a store manager or regional manager, other than that you have poor benefits and not enough hours for my type of work ethic. management is usually very fast paced which is good for numerous reasons."
good,"-stocking product to shelf so customer can buy their needs, i learned that no matter what customer is always right and you have to value their opinion,the management is good too.very supportive to the employee to the work standard,the team is very supportive o each other,the hardest part of the job is is you have to get up so early to work,i always enjoy with my job"
good,The Home depot requires you to become an expert in your department. It does a fantastic job taking care of the customers. The employees are supposed to be felt as if they are important when they are disposable. The pay is low when you take into account that you have to become an expert as well as managing your department. The management will have biased opinion on individual and will at times prevent them from working at their optimal efficiency or block them from being promoted
good,"good place to start your carrier,"
good,"I had to travel 35 miles each way to get to Home Depot.  I had to work part-time, 4 hours a day, so I was basically standing on my feet  and working for gas money during the week.  I had to work most weekends and holidays for 8 hours a day, and I was only making $125.00 a week after tax. That's alright if you live close to the store, and you don't have to live on much."
good,"The best part of working at the Home Depot is the relationship that you grow with your Coworkers. The down side of the job is the workload and compensation. Skilled employees, such as the forklift operators, reach truck operators and overnight freight workers don't get as well compensated as the other employees."
good,Through the home depot I was given plenty of opportunities to improve my knowledge however there was no ambition to progress and make progress up the chain of command.
good,"I've worked at Home Depot for a year now, I have great co-workers and I'm lucky to have an amazing Front End Supervisor to work with.  It's been a year of changes for my location with our management team, but even with all the changes, working at Home Depot is not bad. Typical expectancies for working in a retail environment, as long as you don't take anything personal, do your best each dy work is go smoothly."
good,The job is okay but management prefers to choose favoritism instead of doing what is right. A lot of the co-workers also get away with coming into work high..
good,"Home Depot has changed a number of times and ways over the 12 years that I worked with them."
good,"They give you a task then tell you  all the ways you cant do it.never how,when,where,just tie your hands ie.You need a spotter,you need to do it only between these hours,you need to pull these orders but nowhere to put them,"
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at home depot is the satisfaction you get when you help a customer figure out what they need for their project. When a customer gets what they need and thank you, it gives you a little sense of accomplishment."
good,"However I am looking for a different line of work with more rewards, both professionally, financially and personal satisfaction."
good,Working at Costco was pretty good. Plenty of opportunities to help and meet new people. Fast paced and exciting. Work life balance is demanding depending on your shift.
good,"*The people you work with are great"
good,Good place to start entry level job and gain experience.  Accepts diversity in culture and has good training for employees.
good,"Learned how to multi task and get things done, great opp to interact with executives. You'll have great managers and very bad managers."
good,overtime is never mandatory. management wasn't the greatest. coworkers were awesome. work was easy enough to where you didn't stress during the day
good,"Over all a fun place to work, depending on where you were.  Its beeon a long time ago, so its vague on how it was.  I was there for set up of store so it was interesting"
good,My main tasks Would involve taking care of parking lot. Help customers load products into their vehicles. when i was a cashier I helped customers make their purchases. The co workers where easy to work with and get along with. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people i worked with.
good,"This is the main reason I quit after working at THD for 8 years.  It's typical retail I suppose, but the balance as a salaried manager is terrible because you're ""on call"" 24/7.  And being retail, there is no set schedule, so you might open at 5am on one day and work til 5pm, then come in at 1pm the next day, have a ton of freight, and not leave til 3am.  Very exhausting."
good,"Unappreciative management, deplorable hours. More interested in their numbers than customer service.   Procedures are not standardized from store to store."
good,Overnight freight team member. Unloads receiving trucks of lumber with forklift and stocks store with receiving lumber. Dedicates time to process shipping orders and sign off on purchase orders. Works mostly independently but at times delegates task to coworkers when necessary. Great professional relationships with all coworkers and management. The hardest part about the job is that there's a lot to get done with minimal time. The most enjoyable part of the job is the free range to be independent on own work task.
good,"management is poor and creates low moral"
good,The hours were not flexible and you were required too work late. They would be understanding for keeping you too late if you had school. Very hard labor and difficult tasks. Associates were friendly and supervisors were understanding.
good,Good place if you want benefits and hours. Bad place to go to someone for help. Sometimes you are left alone in a department with no training and get bombarded with customers. High turnover rate so nobody even gets a chance to get good at their job.
good,Home Depot  brand name is an excellent situation for an outside sales person with great products to offer customers.  Too much expense in amount of travel required.
good,"Every day is busy at a home improvement store. I handle multiple customers at one time, operate two large tinting machines and shakers at once, maintain three aisles of merchandise, and take information from customers. I learn so much daily from customers and other employees about all things home improvement. Our management is about half and half when it comes to working with you. The hardest part of the job is lifting 5-gallon buckets or carrying four 1-gallon buckets around. The most enjoyable part of the job is mixing paint and helping customers with their painting projects."
good,my experience is a up and down one it was cool when i started then the changed all the rules the cut everyones hours just google home depot 23rd st to see
good,"Develop and maintain relationships with commercial contractors.  The worst part of the job is the ""dumbing down"" most of the systems"
good,easy money part time very little hours.. but worth it if your interested I learning about logistics and building homes or doing projects
good,It's a great place to start off when you're going to college but not a long term solution for a career. This place becomes quickly about who you know and not about how great of a worker you are. With uneducated and inexperienced management favoritism is plagued throughout all levels of the work environment.
good,"Home Depot is a great part time job, and a great full time job for single people. the company has a lot of great benefits and programs set up for associates. The major downside is the schedule and the hours."
good,"Hard work, good pay, culture has come a long way and appears to be improving. Store Management plays a big role in the culture of each individual location."
good,"With this employer, I must say I've learned a lot, from Pest Control to Contracting. This location literally drops the opportunity to learn in your lap, all you need do is ask. They really empower the employee to give the best deal, or make the customers day just that much better. The co-workers varied, some were fresh off the block, but most actually were plumbers, roofers, gardeners, contractors, the employees really knew what they were talking about. Hardest part of the job was probably the expected physical labor,it could be really intense. By far the most enjoyable part of the job, came from Home Depot events, we refurbished houses, built playgrounds, held a plethora of Customer Appreciation events, in which few employees would make popcorn or throw a BBQ, and just talk with our customers. My absolute favorite event is held on Saturday, easy projects with paints specifically meant for children ages five and up, where they can make things like bird houses, paint them, and they give every child their own apron, and after completion of their project a badge to go on their apron. Management was always hard to contact."
good,"Good company to learn from.  The compensation is set up where it penalizes performance.  Sales managers that do not grow business YOY do not have targets increased.  Managers that were top performers had monthly sales budgets more than double, thus drastically effecting their income.  Mediocre perforemers would end up making more because if they marginally beat targets they would be able to maintain consistent income.  The pay schedule is not designed for people who crush their initial targets because it creates an exponential curve."
good,"Overall I enjoyed working for Home Depot. The hardest part of the job was feeling like I had to take being treated badly by customers otherwise I'd lose my job, the lack of stability in scheduling and not being able to secure a full time position. I learned a lot working there and enjoyed assisting contractors with building orders when the Pro-Desk was closed. My co-workers were awesome to work with and I've maintained friendships with a lot of them after leaving the company."
good,A typical day is filled with deadlines and great customer service that is expected of you . the most enjoyable is being able to assist your customers
good,Not to much room for advancement and they only work most people part-time with little chance to become full-time. Had to meet a sales quota which I usually surpassed. They do a lot training to make sure employees know what they are selling.
good,I loved working for home depot until I had to move. its been so long that I been there. If I had to go back I would love to. The associates was friendly and the customers were also but I don't know how they are now cause its been 9 yrs since I haven't been working there.
good,They will not work with you concerning medical emergencies and favoritism is shown most of the time. Very unprofessional management.
good,"Interacts with 3rd Party Vendors and monitors the Company's 2300 service stores nationwide. The hardest part is working overnight, however the payoff is its reward of knowing you are part of a team."
good,"Following directions, Speed with pace. Learned organization. Management constantly changing, must adapt to new style of directions. The Hardest was finishing early met more work. Lol. But over-all a fun place to work."
good,"Love working with my home depot family, you learn how to deal with pressure. Cashiers look out for one another. Management is always there to listen to you if any problems."
good,"I have a set schedule, I am involved in safety and training of new hires. Unfortunately compensation is not fair for the line of work or skills. No room for growth or advancement as the pay scale is very low compared to other retailers and experience level I have."
good,Fun people to work with. Lousy pay and false promises. No benefits for being part time. Management keeps feeding you lies to keep you employed. Like telling you that you will be moved to full time soon.
good,Not a lot of room for advancement they tend to play favorites. My co-workers are pretty nice. A typical day at work for me includes putting product on the shelf and providing good customer service.
good,"Being a member of the Inventory/Planning/Replenishment organization at The Home Depot was both challenging and rewarding.  There is opportunity to learn many aspects of the business, however, many members of the organization struggle to maintain a work/life balance.  I appreciated the hard work, but would have enjoyed more freedom to try new processes to help streamline daily/weekly/monthly tasks."
good,"If I have anything negative at all to say about my experience it really just boils down to my interaction with one or two individuals.  The work is exhausting, but not technically difficult otherwise.  Most of the employees and even most of the management individuals were all great people and all very helpful.  In the end my interaction the aforementioned ""one or two individuals"" is what led me to ultimately dislike my time of employment at The Home Depot."
good,"Initially started out as a good place to work, the company had a great set of core values that management took pride in as the building blocks of such a successful company. Over the years Home Depot has changed having had 3-4 CEO's in the pass 12 years the company has abandoned the entrepreneur spirit and focus of the in-store associates. What I liked most about my job was having the opportunity to work with different people and building great customer relationships. Eventually the politics and change of leadership changed the company morale for the worst."
good,Liked the company ... Management Team wants results with no training or direction to get that training...only way to promote start at the bottom and work your way up...
good,"Started as a cashier and worked my way into several departments. Cross trained in many and was eventually promoted to dept. supervisor. then i found out that they only given you significant raise if you work your way to Asst Store management. If you come in at a low wage (like i did) then you will be stuck gaining 50 cents here or there. Supervisors work really hard, but is not reflected by pay. And that too bad because they ARE the backbone of the store and what i can see the company as a whole. They did pay well once when Arthur Blank was the CEO. Since then they have taken a turn for the worse hence why people make fun of the place today saying that employees run when they see customers. The good old days when they brought in Contractors to work paid them great wage (because they can SELL the whole job) which was smart (Arthur Blank) are long and gone. Bring in New CEO that's concerned with profits then you get low paying wages, poor customer service and in return even poorer sales as you see today. I have to say the great thing is when i worked there i DID learn allot. When you manage a department your trained to run it like and individual store. Profit loss reports, scheduling, wage hours, ordering, shipping and receiving, time management, Sales forecasting, etc. I do owe Home depot allot for the development of my Managerial skills MOSTLY due to those great managers infront of me that showed me the ropes and setting an example how a REAL business should be ran like."
good,Fast paced environment requiring constant learning and technical skills. Strong basis on metrics & performance. Strong company culture and team building activities. More improvement needed in management & personnel management.
good,"Management was not very supportive, only concerned with bonuses for themselves. Some red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,Great part-time job while attending college. If you are direct and professional with manager; they will help you out and work around your schedule. They will also train to operate heavy machinery.
good,"A place where the fully prepare you for the industry you are in. Management would constantly review your performance , so that you can improve on a daily basis."
good,You could always count on your fellow associates but Managers were had trouble keeping up with my updates on Tasks. Store Meetings were Fun. Some customers were problematic but that wasn't really the big issue.
good,"It was full day of ording, for all employees, working on clients . I did my department reviews and what ever it took to get the job done."
good,The hardest part of this job is going out my way to do things not only for other employees but management as well and not being recognized or noticed for any of it.
good,my night at home depot if loading and unloading trucks and stocking we are allow to listen to music while we work and my co-worker are friendly.
good,"Typical corporate environment. Most laid-back retail I have ever encountered."
good,if customer service is your thing than this is the place you want to work. Home Depot puts customers first no matter what.
good,"I developed and implemented the training programming for the incoming artists in the Print Production Advertising department. My day-to-day activities including the design, creation and review of multiple market pages for the store advertising layouts. These included two of the heaviest departments - D21 and D28 - as well as the most market coverage on the floor. The layouts were developed to interact with a database to provide correct pricing for each market."
good,"worked there for 9 years had some great dept heads and some good night managers, but like anywhere else if the management likes you your in like Flint if not you wont last long and they will look for any little reason to get rid of you. I got caught up in the Obamacare health issue 2 years ago, depot then decided to remove all full timers and anyone over 50 with 10 years and plus that had the full time benefits and replace them with cheaper paid par time associates in high school or college with no benefits. the total was over 3000 on the eastern seaboard alone that was let go under their new 3 strike rule ,where if you made 3 mistakes in your position in the first 6 months you were canned. Of course Depot has a squeaky clean image due to a great law firm that they have to keep things quiet, so this never made the media,or the news.....so I really don't have anything good to say about them.."
good,"I enjoyed working in the environment and it was a good learning experience... it taught me quite a bit about household upgrades.. it was a veteran friendly workplace, so i was introduce to quite a few miltary veterans, and was able to take in a lot of wisdom and knowledge"
good,"Helped customers find products best suited to their needs. Handled transactions as a cashier, helped customers carry out heavy objects if they needed a hand."
good,This is your typical remodeling company without the worries of job security or financial stability of a company. That's it
good,"A typical day at work would include selling gas and diesel to truckers and cleaning up the outside of the store, taking out the trash and cleaning the in side when everyone left the store at night was how we usually ended the day."
good,Management liked to play favorites and were always changing what they expected of people. You go in with one expectation of how you were expected to do your job and then when you leave you find that their expectation of you changed five times in four hours.
good,Flexible but a retail schedule. Good benefits. Bad Pay. If you want more to life than work while at school any retail job can be an issue if you are full time. I would recommend if you are a student to choose part time here. You still get benefits and a more flexible schedule.
good,"The people are awesome and work is challenging, Management is awful. It is a decent place to work if you are in need of a above average salary for a retail career. Advancement is slow for most and short term for those who make it to the next levels. Management is horribly trained, and micromanages most folks out the building. The company has a skewed accountability issue. Those who work hard are inadequately rewarded and at times held accountable for staff who fail to perform their duties. Ultimately, they over work and blame their top employees and ignore the issues with problem staff. Company set sales expectations are usually highly unrealistic and as you advance your available scheduled hours will begin to shrink due to your additional cost, on a roughly .25 cent-.45 cent quarterly/yearly raise system. Most jobs are cross-trained and you will get great experience with customer relations and available systems knowledge. Typical lifting of 50-100lbs for most sections and pretty standard encounters with the public. Major plus, you learn a ton of DIY skills and will probably be amazed when you can do some really complicated stuff for your own home."
good,"Working at Home Depot was a learning experience,long hours and not enough worker.I had some great co-worker the management staff was great  overall i had a great experience."
good,"A typical day at Home Depot starts after I clock in and then proceed to the Pro Desk, since I work under them, but not necessarily for them. Usually I log onto our computer and check orders that haven't been completed yet, make a list of orders that have been completed but have somehow glitched into the system, at this point it's an IT issue and must be resolved through the IT department. Once this is completed I either use my handheld computer to complete orders this way or I complete through our computer itself then I set up the location the order or orders can be found and tag them with a yellow tag. What I learned was basic warehouse logistics. Management there is a mixed bag, because there are both good managers and then there are managers who will throw an associate under the bus to save themselves and not take responsibility for their actions or lack of knowledge. 95 percent of my co-workers are good hard working people who are easy to get along with and will help when needed and expect the same in return the other five percent I avoid as much as possible when I can. the hardest part of my job is customer service, or simply helping a customer, because I keep my knowledge of the store down to what I see on my pull sheets or my handheld computer. I'm very driven in getting my job done and not ending up doing another persons job that I'm not trained or paid to do and it takes away from me getting orders done in a timely manner because if delivery orders don't get done before the delivery date or I hand the delivery off to someone else to finish and it doesn't get done even"
good,"The only thing I miss about this place, are the people i worked with. Management, at the time I was there, was terrible. After 2 years in, I got fired for missing work because my grandfather died... The company as a whole, though, I can say nothing negatively about. I'm sure this place has replaced management since I was there. I don't miss it though."
good,"As a department supervisor you are expected to accomplish the tasks of multiple people. Fast paced which is nice. The values of the company as a whole are great but in each individual store i think the message gets lots in translation. I enjoyed my job, worked with many great people and learned a lot abut leadership. The hardest part of my job was feeling unappreciated and always feeling like the workload was always increasing. The big issue I found was that instead of developing associates who were less productive and teaching them to be great employees they would instead over work good associates because they ""knew they could handle it"" and ""don't have time to waste trying to train someone else. It is a great company to work for with great benefits. If they spent more time  just saying thank you to their associates or even just asking how they are it would make a huge difference. They treated their associates like another number."
good,"Good Company as a whole, At Home Services has only been established for 2 years, this portion of the company is not run properly by management, Still needs work"
good,"a typical day at work was coming in at 9pm seeing my team and greeting them all, unload a truck if we had one, have a meeting to see how we were going to handle the night, and then start pulling stuff out and working, we had first break and lunch at midnight and second break at 3am and usually got off about 6am. i learned alot. about both people and the work place, i learned how to operate every machine they have, learned where almost everything went and was. most of my co workers were great and hard working but thats from the team that i was on, cant say much about other associates, there wasnt really a hardest part of the job other then getting a super big truck done with minimal of people somtimes 3 or 4 people. most enjoyable part of the job was that it was all easy to learn and i had a great team to work with."
good,"Solid company with pretty good benefits. If the powers that be like you can way up the ladder, but if for some reason they feel you are too old or don't fit their view of a great associate then you are stuck. Promotions go to the people they decide to promote, often times before the interviews. Working hard and working smart is no guarantee of promotion. If you hang in their and get your annual raises, but no promotion they find a reason to let you go when you reach the top end of the pay scale for your position."
good,"You can learn a lot from all the different departments."
good,"Work (as a Freight Associate) wasn't too demanding physically. Barely any schedule flexibility for new employees. Lots of jockeying for promotions, causing tension/animosity in the work place."
good,"A typical day at work would include coming in with a smile and greeting customers, making them feel welcome.  Bring a customer to the register, ring them up, and ask if they want to sign up for a Home Depot credit card."
good,"All departments have very knowledgeable associates and when any co-workers have questions from customers that they cant answer, everyone always work together to get the customer the correct answer or product to provide the customer service our business stands out for."
good,"They talk a lot about how important cashiers are. Last people customers see. How important we are for shrink. However, cashiers are almost the lowest paid associates in the store. Only lot attendants are paid less. I would care more if I was paid more by this multi-billion dollar company"
good,"Hours are different per week, I  like my Dept head and fellow associates, it's a busy store so there is always something to do."
good,"A typical environment where there is a team orientation, and common goal. The coworkers understandable but clear hierarchy of management positions. Very enthusiastic employee assistance program called the Homer fund."
good,"The company itself i not bad to work for, but the building I work in lacks major.  They dont pay worth anything and it very hard to get your hours"
good,la empresa requiere de personal con mayor nivel educativo y en las areas operativas una mejora en su rotacion
good,"Home Depot wants their employees to work anytime of the day, holidays and every weekend. There is no time to spend with your family. The management have to employees to where they are always snitching on each other to try to get a head. Most employees have been there over 15 years and have not been offered a chance to move up."
good,Very productive work place where the associates learn a lot about every little things needed in a home. The management makes sure that all the associates are properly trained to do their job. The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationship you develop with the customers. The hardest part is the schedule.
good,A typical day at work was fast paced and energetic. My co-workers were upbeat and fun to work with. I learned to use a lift and key cutter. The hardest part of the job was lack of people and equipment to get big jobs done.
good,"Typical day at work is stressful."
good,"A typical day at work consists mostly of customer service. I am scheduled mainly during what the the Home Depot calls ""Power Hour""; which are the busiest hours of the work day. During these hours we actively look for customers to assist to ensure that they are able to locate everything they need for their project."
good,"Home depot corporate office is a good place to work in the city of atlanta due to the fact that it is based in atlanta, the benefits are decent, and the pay is competitive but raises are bare minimum."
good,Very hard long days of lifting and standing. Being paid for one position while fulfilling more than one job title at a time. Good raises of the bat but they slow down after the first year. Management prefers to outsource for managerial jobs rather than to promote within the building. Favoritism is a HUGE problem but the other associates are easy going and easy to work with for the most part. The break room had an ice cream machine.
good,"A typical work day is as monotonous as the previous day. Cleaning bays and beams like a poorly paid maid. The average customer ..a man,,, comes in to grab a product and could care less about how clean a beam is or if it had label residue on it. Projects were left unfinished by the night shift consistently and were left for day shift to complete. What is the point in having a night shift if they can't do the job right? Supervisors pick their favorites to fix things left undone and half done or done wrong by other employees, instead of going back to them to let them know what they done wrong. If you want it done right go to your favorite employee in the first place. They hire new employees to do the same job you are doing, same title, and pay them $2 more an hour. On top of that you have previous experience plus Home Depot experience and they ask you to train them. HA NO! Sx harassment was over the top between supervisors and other employees. When you report it they do nothing. You constantly do jobs like stocking product and straightening shelves that in store associates should be doing. And they only promote the other favorites...not the ones they ask to fix stuff. Interview all you want the one getting the promotion has already been chosen."
good,I was only part time so I didn't get to experience a lot but I tried to take advantage of the training in different departments.
good,"My typical day consisted of fielding calls for departments, assisting in over the phone salts, and cashiering when needed. I learned a lot about different products in a hardware store, as well as what to recommend for different projects. The management changed often and frequently were unavailable when needed, All the co-corers were enjoyable. The hardest park was not being to reach an associate when needed, and not knowing what/how to help a customer."
good,"Work life balance is the complete pits. You can never do enough work and when you do, there is more to do. Store totally depends on the store manager in place, so does your career"
good,"The SSC is different from most corporate headquarters. It's a very laid back environment. Almost too laid back. I could not believe how the people dressed. Nothing wrong with business casual, but some associates took it too far. It's a different kind of place from the dress code to the types of leaders they have in place managing the associates. It's just different.."
good,"Work freight, help customers. Learned about products. Knowlegable. Fun to work with. Getting some customers to understand what they need for there projects. Helping customers with there projects."
good,"The Home Depot is always a busy store full of customers that need help and direction. My two main departments were Garden and the paint departments. The garden is the biggest dept. there's an inside and outside a normal day our biggest priority would be helping customers with any questions or doing our best to get customers what they need. Also making sure that the dept has a great appearance for our customers. Every customer that comes through our doors has a project to fulfill that is with paint, hardwear etc. our duty was to make sure they took the correct item. I learned that communication is key, getting to know what kind of idea the customer has and then coming up with the solution if not an idea of what the customer could use to finish their project. The hardest part of my job was the overload and no coverage in our paint dept most of the time there would only be one associate when there need to be 3 because the paint dept gets really busy."
good,"Its a place where you have a good chance to get hired seeing as they are always hiring, but it will not be the best experience for most people. Management is lackluster at my store and the customers are rude at times but nothing different from a job at any other retail store I'd like to imagine. If you are a cashier be prepared to hate your job. I worked my way up the ladder slightly to tool rentals as a tech and i love it due to minimal customer interaction.The customers were too demanding at times which made me feel less enthusiastic about my job."
good,"There is room for improvement for this company. You are being judged by how you react to each task, instead of being thankful for what you have completed. The assignments that are assigned are expected to be completed within the shift plus all the regular duties that needs to be done such as pack down, clean up, front face, security tags on high value items, assisting customers in every department. Yes I am in hardware but I have to help customers in lumber, plumbing, kitchen and bath, electrical. I have no information or experience in those departments and once i asked for the manager's assistance and he requested that I need to try my best."
good,"When the economy went south I joined Home Depot thinking it would be short term.  Stepping into a lifeboat is good if you are on a sinking ship.  At some point you look around and realize ""oh no!, I'm in a lifeboat""."
good,"I have to say, working at The Home Depot wasn't that bad.  If you keep in mind that it is retail.  They provide a lot of training and want to help you to succeed at your job."
good,"Home Depot was a great place to work, they allowed you to have some fun during the night hours and even allowed us to listen to are own music (if it did not impend or distract other people working). You can learn allot about the products there even just by stocking them given you may need to know that later when you need to do you're own house repairs one day. The basics of the job where pretty easy to deal with unless you have the contracted Merchandising team in, then it gets pretty bad and you run behind for the night in the sections there working (always leaving a mess behind and leaving you're team to clean it all up)."
good,"My day always starts Overseeing that the OSHA Regulations, fall protection, scaffolding, excavations/shorings, HazCom and industrial Hygiene standards where applied	CAZ safety supervisor. •	Created, revised, and enforced schedules for man power. i learned new city and county codes. The hardest part of the job was the weather the most enjoyable part of the job seeing the customers faces when the job was complete."
good,"-Flexible with scheduling my work around my classes"
good,"Stocking items and making sure the department is clean and safe is a typical day. Customer service is there number one priority besides safety for both workers and customers."
good,many members of management where there for themselves and no others but looked for you to do your job as well as theirs. gave praise but ruled with iron fist and no room for error. trying to come up in company meant you had to bust your butt and do as many jobs and juggle many hats to have them see what you are about.
good,"I would either open or close my department on days I was working. I would gather merchandise for customers and help them find what they were looking for. "
good,"every day is the same very repetitive work "
good,"N-Store Services, has showed me how to live life and still get down to the nitty gritty. The hardest part of the job for me was knowing that I could be severely harmed by the unsafe actions of someone else, that is very nerve wrecking. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to explore the different cities and see new things that were out of my normal scene."
good,"If you like to learn about construction products it can be quite fun."
good,Good place to work with good benefits. The hours are all over the place since the store has such long hours. Hard to manage a life when you work until midnight one night and come back at 8am the next morning. Very rough when you live over 45mins away from the store.
good,"A typical work day includes general store maintenince, customer service, shelf maintenece, down stocking of product. While with The Home Depot, I learned money handaling, point of sales system, inventory management, customer service skills. The staff are generaly friendly and easy to work with and will help out in situations. The most difficult part of the job is not knowing what to expect when you come to work from a workload perspective. The best part of the job is customer interactions and solving customer problems."
good,"If you enjoy working retail and customer service, Home Depot is a good job for you. You meet a lot of wonderful customers and enjoy the people you work with."
good,"Physically active, always moving around."
good,Management is extremely uptight and judgemental. They are not good at working around your schedule. Not the best job out there.
good,A typical work day at Home Depot for me includes managing the money and taking care of all the cashiers. I make sure everyone gets to their breaks and lunches on time and has all the information that need to do their job.
good,"i learned much about garden, lawn care, and the stores inventory."
good,"I love the work environment of the Home Depot but I feel I get unnoticed and instead the managment telling me how I can do better, I am told false information about why I didnt get a certain position."
good,"Good for people who are retired and who are just starting in the work place."
good,"As a cashier in Home Depot I thought I would be making more money than I actually am.  I started off at $8.60 per hour about a year ago and after very good performance I got a 25cent raise.  So did most of the cashiers.  Home Depot has a false reputation of paying well.  They do offer benefits for part time employees, limited vision and dental plans which were very useful for me.  I tool full advantage of them.  Very few people are offered full time employment."
good,"I liked the job and many of the people I worked with, The downfalls were the chaotic work schedules (no set schedule) many closings followed by openings staying until 10:30 or 11:00 pm then back in at 5:00 am. then next day of 9 am til 6 pm then 1:30 pm til 10:30 pm then split days off usually Tues/ Thurs. lots of multi tasking and dealing with situations beyond control with little to no acknowledgement from upper management on the workload vs the low pay. Lots of Favoritism and cliques without room for advancement."
good,"The work was okay, the customer service was awesome for me because I was able to talk and work with customers on a daily basis.  I miss that."
good,"It was a good environment, I think there were faults however I think any job has its faults. My co workers were extremely helpful and caring, I think there was some confusion and reorganizing happening in management, people moving and transferingl"
good,I enjoy working at the home depot but i have been trying to get full time and they keep giving me the run around. The amount of work we have to do with little to no coverage is tough and my department supervisor has no idea what she's doing half the time.
good,"A typical day at work, would be arriving to whatever store you are working on that given day at 9pm. We start off by stretching and going over what needs to be done in the store. At 1 am we have our first break and at about 3:30-4am we have our lunch and you also have the option of taking another 15 min break after lunch. Management is pretty good, and the co-workers as well. Hardest part of the job would probably have to be getting acclimated to working overnight and the rigorous hard work we do when it comes to setting steel and moving product. The most enjoyable part of the job would be getting recognition for your hard work and being rewarded for it. They would frequently get us free meals etc. and a bonus check if we meet our goals."
good,This was an easy job that was intuitive since I had previous experience working in construction field. The management were  easy to get along with and so were the co-workers.
good,It's a job. Crazy hours with no regard to personal lives.  Lots of weekends.  Instituted MIT and that did not go over well. I'm sure there are worse jobs out there.
good,"This company is what you make of it. I loved creating beautiful spaces in customer s homes.  I loved seeing their"
good,"The coworkers, management and customers were always great to work with. This company also has good training. Very flexible with the schedule."
good,"Home Depot is a good starter job, it's not good pay, no real advancement at least I was never given the opportunity when I asked for it.  Working with co workers was a positive experience."
good,"Did not stay but not to bad of a position and job requirement.,.It was a count down for 4 hours to pass. The chemicals is my biggest problem and the adhesive on the SKU labels."
good,"Great place to have a job. Little opportunity for advancement. Like to promote from within, but not the most qualified."
good,"Great job, with great benefits, but due to the hiring and firing of managers every week ,it makes it a difficult place to work at."
good,"Good memory, Positive attitude, and a good sense of urgency is needed to work at my Home Depot. Front End associates are busy and friendly, the Sales associates are multitasking and fast-paced. Managers are normally delegating, and solving problems with customers. The only real down side to the job no set scheduling and  being understaffed. Its probably the best group of co-workers and customers I've worked with."
good,"I usually worked late shifts, but sometimes was called upon to work early. During the day, I would usually help customers with finding products, cutting lumber, loading their vehicles, retrieving stored merchandise, and online orders. Sometimes I would have to unload trucks of merchandise, ie. cement pallets, lumber bundles, ladder bundles, etc. I would often have to manage merchandise on shelves. When Closing, I would have to secure merchandise stored outside, clean equipment, manage merchandise, and sweep the department. I learned about tools, lumber, hardware, plumbing, electrical equipment, and other various home improvement merchandise. Management was flexible, but demanding. My co-workers were a very interesting and friendly bunch. The hardest part of my job was Closing. I enjoyed working with customers."
good,"Its some time hectic but can be enjoyable ,depending on the person. If you like fast past and continuous movement then work freight is for you."
good,"Una empresa muy exigente en lo que se trata de servicio al cliente, pero muy exagerado ya que a veces te ponian falta en tu forma de atender sin justificacion, lo cual no podias generar bono por una llamada de atencion de estas, los compañeros muy buenos, la gerencia muy buena siempre incluyendose en los problemas cotidianos de la tienda, la parte dificil del trabajo eran los meses sin intereses ya que los clientes exigian esta promocion sin siquiera haberse informado primero, lo que mas me gusto fue el ambiente calido y humano tanto para asociados como para clientes."
good,"Performance measurement for advancement was ambiguous in the workplace. I found it useful that The Home Depot required preliminary computer tests to help us develop product knowledge so that we could offer project advice and recommendations. However, many of my peers and management seemed disgruntled and unwilling to exert full capacity in performing job duties. I value my retail experience because I learned to engage people cordially yet professionally."
good,My typical days starts at 6:30 AM and doesn't end until 7:00 PM. THD is a very fast pace environment that always gives you a challenge. Management is like any other company; some managers are great and others are not.
good,"It was an O.K. employment, but there was little challenge for me."
good,"The Merchandising Team is the best part of the company to work for. They are in the store but not totally part of the store. There is a different management structure and a strict M-F schedule with 6 of the major holidays off with pay every year. It is physical work but the main priority is store appearance rather than customer service, we only help customers when there is not a store associate available. We complete all of the seasonal resets and major projects in the store."
good,Knowing your products so you can help contractors purchase the correct items...everything needs to be quick which is good the day goes by fast.
good,Average work load on each employee up into the closing shifts. Friendly staff and extensive product knowledge for all employee.
good,"There was no typical day at Home Depot, as circumstances and job duties always changed. Some jobs that stayed consistent were the responsibilities of opening and putting outside presenting products( lawnmowers, rakes, tractors, ladders etc). Other duties included cleaning the lot, providing loading assistance when needed ,and any other work that needed to be accomplished on the days agenda. "
good,I was a merchandise execution rep. It was an okay job. It didn't pay well but responsibilities are relatively low. You will learn a lot of of neat DIY things along the way
good,I really liked Home Depot as a company and I worked with great people in every store I worked at (3). But the management teams made it a drag to go to work every day. It was hard to move up in the store unless they really really liked you. There was a lot of favoritism and the same people received awards every meeting.
good,A typical day is Customer First. Help customer checkout in a fast and friendly services. What i learned is different every day.
good,"No different than any other retail working environment. If you've ever worked at Walmart or Lowes, then you know exactly what it's like to work for Home Depot. They always had my back and were always there, but the pay wasn't good enough to keep me."
good,"If you have to work in a retail environment, the kitchen designer position is fulfilling.  Being a kitchen designer allows you to use your knowledge and skills, as well as, your creativity.  However, it seems that a lot of their new personal are lacking in experience and training."
good,a typical day would be helping custumers making sure they are satisfied when they leave my register and store.
good,But depends on your store's management team.  They can be rough on PT employees who need to balance multiple responsibilities.  No PT health benefits.
good,Management if laid back for the most part letting the crew I work with do what we need. It's enjoyable having a set work schedule though the week
good,"Worked in Garden, Hardware, and Paint. Ordered Paint products."
good,"I would start out my night entering about 15 minutes early with my work night survival kit which consist of sandwiches, an energy drink, and a gallon of water. Once it gets closer to clock-in, I dawn my apron and get ready to head to the time clock and clock in. Every night we start out with a stretch and a briefing of how many trucks we received and expectancy time of completion. We are then split into sections in the category of what section of the store is heavily impacted for the night and we execute. What I've learned from management is that we should lead by example. If there is a heavy night, I would be working right beside my colleagues and associates to let them know that I respect you and in turn the respect of those that work with me, The hardest part of the job is the last twenty minutes pushing through the pm to the am. In summary, the most enjoyable part is knowing that there is a job, we completed it, individually accomplishing the task for the night, and getting ready to see what mystery is to come for the next night."
good,"Customer service, punctuality, hard work, good co-workers,"
good,"Overall I'd say home depot was a great place to work. In hindsight I made some poor career moves (taking over reporting) but the company is a great place to work. Unlike Amazon (where I work now), Home Depot was slow to implement projects and was hurt by bureaucracy."
good,Time went fast and had fun helping people. Sometimes there where more customers than we could hanle.
good,"A Typical Day at work involves answering phones, running reports, assisting customer, running sales, and taking returns. "
good,"I have been there for 23 years,i have learned a lot. Made many freinds over the years.I think management could be better."
good,"A typical day at work includes; Maintaining the cash registers, light cleaning and restocking, fast and providing fast and friendly customer service. Promoting company credit, and Sales (Kitchen/Hardware/Plumbing/Lumber/Garden/Electric). Slow-paced (alot of standing around)-[Located in Ludington, MI]"
good,"The company produces a culture of micromanagement, and it's somewhat difficult for even the most qualified individuals to make it very far. I'm sure that in most jobs of this caliber it is to be expected, however, I am never truly thrilled about coming to work, although I love the people I work with. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers all day, keeping lines down, and working with people with minimal education. It is, however, enjoyable that most of my co-workers are pretty down to earth."
good,"Too much ""good ole boy network"" to deal with it.  To advance, you must ""know"" someone."
good,"easy to meet people "
good,"took me a year in a half to get a 95 cent raise from 10.50 an hour,,management wasnt all that great wasnt getting any hours company really didnt look out for it's employees,i got more experiemce on forklift and electric ride on palletjack,my co workers was ok people to work with"
good,"A fast paced environment. Always something to do. Never boring. I learned many aspects of the construction business working at The Home Depot, as well as the ins and outs of operations and merchandising as pertaining to retail. Shared a special bond with the majority of my coworkers. There were many challenges, but there was always a helping hand around to ensure that all projects, and/or customer needs were met."
good,"Home Depot has the right ideas, mostly they have them on paper and not all stores follow the values. If they can get moral up with employees then great rapport with customers will be sure to follow."
good,"Overall a great company to work for. The schedule can be tough because they are open 7 days a week. Work environment really varies by store; some are great, some are terrible. If a store has good managers, it's a decent place to work. If a store has managers that don't care or are scared of customers, it is a nightmare. Negotiate good pay going in because raises are impossible to get. Benefits and time off are ok. Customers are pretty cool for the most part."
good,A typical night at work consisted of restocking shelves. I learned how to organize and keep track of inventory. Management was great. Most coworkers were great to work with. The hardest part of the job was the night hours. The most enjoyable part was getting to work alone a lot.
good,"In a typical day at work in the paint department, I would mix paint for customers after asking all the necessary questions to determine what kind of paint they need for their paint job. I would also help customers find particular items they needed in my department and answer any questions they had pertaining to painting, staining, etc. During slow times when there were few to no customers, I would stock items on the shelf and ""front face"" products (i.e. straighten up items on the shelf and make it look good).At all times, I would make sure I was maintaining a clean and safe working environment (sweeping up debris, immediately cleaning up any paint spills after blocking off the area and wearing appropriate attire, keeping the desk free and clear of unnecessary items, making sure no products were leaning or protuding in the aisles, etc.). I learned how to better multi task in this fast paced environment. I am generally shy, but having been required to talk to strangers on a daily basis to do my job, I became more comfortable talking to people and am now able to speak up for myself more efficiently. My coworkers there always had my back and I had theirs. We were always willing to help each other out whenever necessary and worked well as a team. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was being able to joke around with coworkers and customers alike. I love helping people and it warms my heart to be able to make people smile. I actually like fast paced environments because it challenges me to work harder and faster. I think the hardest part of the job was the physical strain the"
good,"Operations Management includes supervision of front end processes involving sales and return transactions, as well as special services and lot support. In training to oversee the back end processes, including receiving and freight teams to ensure that merchandise is received and stocked appropriately. Learning how to maintain and operate all store equipment and systems as well as how to manage daily financial operations. Training to develop a command of store standard operating procedures (SOP’s), especially those involving Safety compliance."
good,loved meeting new people each day.  Helping customers looking for items.
good,"A typical day is cleaning and renting out tools, with great co-workers and management. The hardest part of the job is not being a full time employee."
good,"Cross merchandising manager, I was in charge of all display's set up and tracking of product. Working with vendors and management to increase sales."
good,"Great job for someone who likes a daily challenge and multi-faceted job function with plenty of people interaction.  I honestly learned a great deal about business management, leadership, and many other topics.  "
good,build rep our with customers load vehicle i work on the forklift alot so i would be on that for 50 % of the day - working with coworkers
good,"There was a distinct lack of care from the management that trickled down to all the employees. One of the last issues that I saw before leaving involved a fantastic young associate who was helping a customer with some wood stakes. It was after the man's shift had ended and he was no longer wearing his smock or steel toe shoes. The Opperations Assistant Manager walked past him and said ""Are you wearing steel toes? Are you still punched in?"" and when the associate said ""no"" the Assistant Manager barked back, ""then no helping!"" and he stormed off. "
good,"A typical day at the Home Depot Mondays and Thursdays are major pack down days when the pack down list is generated and we all have to team up together and get it done within the department.Mondays I do light ordering only on keys, have to make sure all my first phone duties are done like looking at y out of stocks making sure they are correct, doing inventory opportunity worklist which is something different every week to ensure product is placed on the shelves and priced correctly and counts are accurate. i have to make sure my shrink plan is completed every week by friday. I have learned about how to understand the numbers in the store. On weekends I do receiving duties like returning things to the vendor, basically cleaning up the receiving department. Making sure things are in the hazmat containers, getting credit for certain products in the store, calling vendors to see where the product is and key receiving products. The Hardest part of the job is the amount of work they expect to get done in a day but i manage to get it done by delegating it to my associates. Enjoyable part is working with a great group of people."
good,This was my first customer service job. This is where I learned to service customers with a smile.
good,This particular store has bad management problems. There were 5 department heads that quit in a 1 month period. It is very sad to see the store going down.
good,"Fun work environment, hands on and true retail."
good,"As with any company the employees make the business. At my store I enjoy working with the Assistant Store Management, Department Supervisors, Specialty Department Associates and Sales Associates. As with any organization management will make or break the flow. At my store in Upper Marlboro our current General Manager began in February of 2014. He is very personable person but has made the dreaded mistake of being a micro manager. More than half of the stores staff has been at this location for more than 5 years, and are dedicated to doing a very good job due to their character. These people as my self are good at what they do and do not need to be micro managed. The general manager would do well and show mastery of his position threw more a 50% delegation of duties and concentrate more on marketing his store to increase sales then the corporate minimum. He is stuck in the late 1990's teck bubble corporate cultures were spending $7.00 to make $2.00 in real sales was the normal attitude. The customer base has become accustom to getting what they want instead of a retail respect for the store. As well, Billionaire and former presidential candidate Ross Perot once said of General Motors, ""to get that company to make a decision is like trying to get congress to go to work"". The GM takes an extremely long time to make a decision on staffing issues and changes he wants in the store. This is the results of his micro management style."
good,"The Home Depot use to be a great place to work. They use to promote an family like work environment, but now has declined to become just like every other corporate retail company. They offer a lot of hard work for little pay and with no expansion taking place growth with the company is at a stand still unless someone high up quits or is fired."
good,"Provide the best customer service for various departments in store such as assisting co-workers to lift heavy merchandise to vehicles, answering concerns/problems in their household and find the solutions, & going above and beyond of the average customer service they’d expect."
good,"A typical day is pretty much stocking shelves and helping very needy  customers. Its a good place to learn new things although you're learning thru reading labels and contractors that you are supposed to help. I enjoy my job only because of the ppl i work with but for the most part I would only keep my positon as a part-time job. At this time i am full time and i feel like i rarely see my 11 month old. The schedule is never set. One day you could be closing the next day you're opening and the day after youre a mid shift. The occurance system sucks bad. Doctors notes do not help you as far as excuse absenses go. If youre on a final youre on it for 6 months so if something happens to you or a family member during that time and you do not have the personal time you have to come to work not matter what unless theyre dead, or youre termenated. The benefits are nice but alittle pricey. Growing in the company isnt hard to do for some but then have others where its nearly impossible."
good,"This position helped me develop good time management.  This was necessary to keep up with high shrink items in the region, safety issues, positive trainings, and floor surveillance.  This position also enhanced my ability to perform in a team environment at different levels of the organization. I had to interact with floor associates, department heads, store managers, district managers and regional managers.  The most challenging part of this job was getting all the associates and managers to buy into loss prevention's shrink control processes.  The most enjoyable part of this job was working with team members from every level to achieve one common goal... ""protect the company's brand through unsurpassed customer service."""
good,The home depot is a good place to work with good benefits. I just wish the compensation was better.
good,"I learned a little bit about every department so I could help customers."
good,"Position was overall an enjoyable opportunity except continuously changing the requirements of the job. Typical day was computer generated cycle counts of product and entry of data. Customer service. Teamwork with associates. Looking for product up in aisles. "
good,"Working in the garden department I enjoyed. We could work in the indoors or outdoor section. The managers and staff were all friendly. Overall very nice work environment. The job included a lot of lifting and interacting with customers. Nice place to work if you like seasonal work. When they start cutting hours, they will slash them to the point you want to quit. Seasonal they'll have you working 35-45 hrs a week, which is awesome. They decided to keep you and change your status to part-time and devour your hours."
good,Great company to work for depends on which store but overall great benefits.
good,its worth it if your living close to the shop . But some the bosses and manager are ok and some are not .. good work area plenty nice people .. if you work together you can achieve alot of work .. stay on task and your great.
good,"I was a cashier and helped customers find products. Learned alot about home improvement products. Things I never saw before, interesting."
good,"too much fun ."
good,"A typically work day is where employees help each other to resolve either phone or person customer problems; its a consistant learning about customer issues and how to handle it;The management is insuffient. With schedule meetings during peak business hours;low morale boost of  little to no recognition of employee performance; on the other hand co-workers help each other out with a great deal of teamwork, even thou they put with alot of mico management and faulty equiptment that constantly breaks down.The hardest part to put with about this job, is mainly two things(1) Customers attiude towards customer service-people can be very disrespectful, arrrogant, conceited and down right rude.We go a long way out to help in thier product of purchase or problems what they confront with the product purchase. And people wont give you at least a "" thank you for your help"". (2) Stealing-How certain people will go out of their way to steal any thing from items as small as a battery to as large a chainsaw. Security is extremely poor with on site loss and prevention uncover personnel work only serveral days and a few hours per day.Security should be 7 days a week , during store business hours. Even with their security camers employees can see whats happen but for safety reasons, will not engage in stopping the theives. By the time the local authorities are call the theif is long gone.The most enjoyable part of the job, is the employee atomsphere, how outside sporting activities such as softball league which we compete against other store is a good idea, other sporting activites need to be setup"
good,"When i worked Home Depot i experienced a fun, happy environment. There was a sense of pride at what they do, it did not matter what your job description was, everybody did they're job. I had no problems with working there and if I could work there again I would."
good,"As a member of a merchandising team which serviced 10 stores, I found the work repetitive, tedious and unchallenging."
good,"I started at home depot as a lot attendant im a vary hard worker and vary particular about how i do things so it was a good fit to start with i was 17 at the time and could not go in any other departments at the time. I was originally shooting for the position of tool rental tech which the managers promised me. I did eventually after 2 years move to rentals but not as a tech but as a regular associate being told that i needed to go to special training that they also continued to promise me never got lol. as well as no matter how much i beg for full time i never get it my attempts to show my value to the department are unsuccessful :P This well watching them hire ppl in the positions i want that never last longer then a month often leaving because they cant stand the bs or being fired. "
good,"It's a job that pays...and that's about it. Your work schedule will always be erratic, they only give fixed schedules to the people who have 20+ years under their belts and you can forget about ever getting hired on full-time."
good,"All in all it was a good job to have if you had a permanent  job.The pay was ok but we only work four hours a night, that sucked because there was no overtime. Home depot is a good job for a college or high school student."
good,The job consisted of all things HR form recruitment to benefits to terminations.
good,"Accomplishments, good days, bad days, adjusting to changes love to learn new skills"
good,The company opened a call center but does not appear to have proper direction.  The center closed 1 year after opening.  Could have been better.
good,"Because I worked in the Garden area and I am a horticulturist, I thoroughly enjoyed my work.  I was able to convey my knowledge to customers, therefore empowering them to garden more wisely in an arid climate."
good,"I have worked with The Home Depot for 11 months, and the experience was excellent in the lines or customers, but poor in the line of management. They play a lot of favorites, which makes advancement near impossible. After 6 months your obligated to qualify for another position in your location. I've spent 5 months getting the finger practically, talked to each manager and supervisor even direct supervisor of my department and the department of my choice at least 3+ times and was completely ignored. Even following up with the direct supervisors regularly was completely fruitless. I was promised to be reviewed twice within a week, which never happened; I'm not the only one whom this has happened to, the others I know have given up, plan to change jobs, or have either moved already. They rather get new hires and lower part time hours overall then consider switching you. "
good,"You have the opportunity to learn a lot of useful information you can take with you after you leave. Pay won't be great, but should be better than most retail establishments."
good,"In the position of Merchandise Execution the hours of work were great, 5:00 am to 1:30. Pay isn't the greatest but is not a bad inbetween job."
good,"managers tried to create bonus opportunities."
good,"Too few employees to do a good job, many departments go understaffed for hours at a time, the bottom line is the most important thing. Stressful place to work because they are always trying to get rid of people so as to bring in cheaper labor."
good,"A typical day at work at The Home Depot cannot be labeled. Every day here is different. I could either be running the front end whether it be coming in at 5:30am or leaving at 10:30 at night. I could be working the service desk, or I could just be on register."
good,"I really enjoyed my time working with The Home Depot. Very fun and active environment. However, advancement opportunities are not easy to come by. I just wish I would've been able to carry on my employment at a higher level with The Home Depot, but I didn't see myself going anywhere so I decided to leave and find something better! But Overall I enjoyed just about everyone there and I wouldn't trade that experience for anything!"
good,"extremely busy, productive, fast paced workplace. I learned leadership skills and how to operate numerous machinery. The management was fair there was nothing hard about my job. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with so many great personalities we worked as a team to get the job done."
good,"It was a nice company to work for. A typical day there would be easy going at times. My co-workers were ok I really kept to myself though. The management was good at times, but there turn over rate is high."
good,"A typical day at work consists of me sharing my knowledge of lumber and building materials to assist customers in their projects. I've learned about managing inventory, associates, and work loads at a retail level. I've also learned much of the construction trade. My co-workers are hardworking and self driven. Day and night work crews work in union to ensure a grand opening everyday. The most challenging portion of my job is multi tasking to optimize my time in assisting as many customers I can. The most rewarding part of my job is ensuring that our customers receive the best service that can be provided by empowering employees to make the decision to do achieve the companies goals."
good,Great place to consume knowledge and get an ok paycheck to help kids through college or for the constructions workings to do things when they can not work on a site anymore.
good,"Associates are awesome, Management can be very annoying at times. A typical day at work for me, was very taxing as I was at the service desk. The hardest part of my job was doing so many things at once, and extra things, all while expected to do my job"
good,"Through interaction with associates and customers, I learn something new every day. The most rewarding aspects are repeat customers who look for me when they come in and the relationships made with associates and peers."
good,"Good place to start working as a teen or retirement age."
good,On Daily received daily projects to have completed by the end of the shift. Consists of Reseting bays to remove old products that have been reduced to clearance and to put in the new products. Relabel with new price labels and New tags for new products. Scan bay with store handheld phone to put new product into the stores system.
good,"I've worked for Home Depot for the past year and a half. In that time, I have been promoted, but passed up for a full-time position in favor of someone who is less qualified, but is a single mother of two children. I was told by management that their decision was based on the fact that I have two incomes and the other candidate only has one. I like my job for the most part. In fact, I love it sometimes. Home Depot is all about taking care of customers and making an ""emotional connection"" with the community. I love this about the company. However, they fail to make an emotional connection with their employees. Sometimes employees are pushed aside and degraded in favor of a customer's needs. Sometimes qualified employees are passed up for opportunities simply because management believes they don't need advancement as badly as other candidates. There are pros and cons to this company as there are with all companies. Home Depot pays well, but management looks for every opportunity to keep you in your place."
good,"A day typically consisted of working with a lot of different type of people.  Some are nice and pleasant, some are not at all.  I learned a lot about basic in home construction and the tools.  The part i enjoyed the most was working with a bunch of people, the hardest was having the jerk come in and try to ruin your day."
good,Good work environment. You can learn alot if you show the interst. Running fork lifts and other equipment was fun to learn.
good,I enjoyed helping the customers find the lumber they would need to complete the projects they wanted to start. I really enjoyed the people I worked with and I enjoyed the job itself. The hardest part was the varied hours from week to week. You were never put on the same schedule and that made appointment making or family planning challenging.
good,"As a cashier the most stressful part of your job is... well there isn't one. If you have a line there's a button to push for help, if you need a manager they're a phone call away, you have at least two head cashiers during your shift. "
good,home depot is just like any other retail job the managers come and go as the store does good or bad
good,The environment was all about helping customers as they were number one and always came first.  It did not always work this way however and we ended up doing tasks most of the time.  The management was fun and it was a good place to make friends and enjoy your coworkers but when it came time for advancement they would prefer to move people up that had less skill and qualifications simply because management liked them.  The job was not a particularly hard one yet while advancement was not as simple and fair as they would have you believe if was a fun place to work and I did learn a lot about sales merchandising leadership and talking to customers.
good,Fun and knowledgeable employees. A great place to work for if you are into construction and helping people with projects.
good,"On a typical day I would be swamped with costumers and workers asking me off the clock questions, mainly as soon as I get to work and lunch, I chose not to take breaks"
good,"Good hours, works well with school, but didnt enjoy customer service."
good,"I worked as a bilingual sales associate and freight employee. I was tasked with assisting spanish speaking customers meet their home improvement needs and after store hours I was responsible for maintaining stocks of merchandise and storing the excess."
good,"Swiftly, professional, and promptly assisting customer's getting all heavy merchandise into their vehicles. I've learned patience and wonderful customer service skills from my daily interactions with consumers by working here. Management is fair for the most part. My co-workers are great people to work with. The hardest part about my job is the outdoor work in all weather conditions. The most enjoyable part about my job is getting to help people which is something I whole-heartedly love to do as well as being able to keep my body toned by the lifting. Fitness is also a major hobby of mine."
good,"A typical day at work included constant interaction with customers via telephone and face-to-face, selling appliances, money transactions, making work space presentable and creating/designing signage and displays to promote sales. Throughout my day at Home Depot I have learned how to be handy as well as how to deal with complex customer situations. For the most part I had great relationships with my co-workers and with management. The most difficult part of my job, was that my duties were well beyond just a sales associate. I was an appliance specialist, involved in the employee committee, the sign captain as well as captain of a monthly kids club, so my presence and abilities were needed non-stop. I mostly enjoyed my time interacting with the children and throwing and hosting many events. I loved interacting with the customers, so much that I gained many relationships with them and I loved being able to use my artistic abilities to decorate the store."
good,Co workers fun to be with. Management ok. Sometimes in some bays it could take awhile to fix as some need alot of work to be done in it. The only enjoyable part of the day is the Staff in Met and the store.
good,Great customer service and hospitality for the customer but not necessarily for an employee.
good,"Get to work place, prepare work place and help customer and provide customer service. Restock and manage the work environment, making sure everything is clean and prep ed."
good,"Nice Place to Work, lower on the pay scale compared to its competitors."
good,There is no guarantee that each department that one transition into will be a pleasant experience. Coming to work you have a responsiblity to do your job but it's a plus if you have management that care about the well being of their team. Unfortunately that doesn't radiate throughout the company. But I believe the most enjoyable part about my current position is helping the service providers and the working with some great co workers it make the job achievable.
good,"Constantly doing something. Learned pricing, inventory, customer relations, and product knowledge. Management at the Syracuse store was very helpful to increase your knowledge of store   operation. .The hardest part of the job was the hours I had to work. The most enjoyable part was making friends with fellow associates and many customers who depended on me to help with their problems."
good,taking care of customers is top priority. learning new experiences and working with different cultures. the hardest part of the job is trying to take care of all the costumers with to few employees.
good,"I loaded and unloaded trucks upon arrival. I learned how to use forklift. The management were pretty strict on meeting deadlines, they were overall cool. I didn't too much get involved with other co-workers. The hardest part of the job was the maintenance after the work was done. The easiest part of the job was loading and unloading"
good,"This was a good job for a long time, but when management was changed, there was a lot of mirco-management that went on. I don't mind being told what to do, but I prefer doing things my way. If I've been doing something one way for years, I don't like being told I'm doing it wrong."
good,"You learn new things daily."
good,"As a cashier, you clock in and check in with your head cashier and they assign you a register or have you relieve someone. management is typically trying to help you in most things, coworkers for the most part are fun to work with and are very self knowledgeable."
good,"You meat and greet customers as they enter and leave the store, always have a smile on your face and willing to help out every customer.  As a cashier you check out the customer in a timely but accurate manner."
good,they work well with school. managers are strict but you get to know great people and build a team with your coe-workers
good,"Hrs. 5am-2pm;M-F;No overtime;Service store bays to Home-"
good,"Very hard labor, I was an excellent teammate for co-workers, and a excellent trainer."
good,"A typical day at work for me at home depot was working as a cashier at either the regular register or at the returns desk. I also did a lot of training on the store computer so that I would be qualified to work on the sales floor as well as cashiering.  I learned how to work well with others because everyone had to work as a team to assist a customer. I also learned how to be a cashier because I had never been one before. I worked at The Home Depot for 2 years as a cashier and had it down.  The management for the first year and three quarters, but a new store manager came in and things just seemed very different.  The hardest part of the job was probably sometimes when lot associates would call in I would fill in sometimes and having to have to load bags and bags of mulch or bricks. The most enjoyable part of the job was probably getting to work with a great group of people."
good,"many different task, busy work place, poor managment, co-workers were okay"
good,"there were people stealing money from the company , that is all I have to say and I actually knew who was doing it"
good,Full time but they are never satisfied. The threat of lay off every week
good,"My typical day at home depot, involves being a paint mixology, well providing excellent customer service. I also have development phenomenal multitasking skills."
good,Enjoy working at Home Depot. Good employee working environment. I learned alot.
good,Worked as part of a team that set up and maintained displays and product for companies that sold their products at Home Depot.
good,"good team, good hours. learned how to time manage well. hardest part was carrying the heavy beams at times and most enjoyable part were some of my co-workers"
good,A typical day at work consists of getting ready in the morning with my casual work appropriate wear and putting on my apron. Talking to customers all day is a must and is quite enjoyable. Being through in scanning all the items in the cart and keeping stock. I learned about having multiple responsibilities and being able to do multiple tasks which made me multifaceted. Management was always on point. Working with co-workers was always nice and having great team work. The hardest part of my job was getting more hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know co-workers and customers that would come in and show you pictures of the improvements in their house that you helped them accomplish.
good,"A typical workday consists of managing stock, packing down merchandise and helping customers complete home improvement projects."
good,"Aprendi a mejorar mi servicio a los clientes, a la gerencia actual le falta mas seriedad y ser mas profesionales, excelente equipo de trabajo, lo mas dificil que no se cuenta con metricos establecidos lo que mas me gusto es volver a trabajar con clientes externos e internos me gusta trabajar en cajas"
good,"Making sure your department is stocked and clean. Ensure the department out of stock on any merchandise."
good,"Working for The Home Depot for the past three years has been a great learning experience but after all i have seen and been through it was not worth the last three years of my life."
good,Typical day is working with customer on ordering and answering question about product.  Helping department heads with pricing departments and working with customer and employees and vendors.
good,Great environment to learn more about home repair and maintenance from the true experts
good,"I enjoy working at the Home Depot. At the present time, I am a cashier. My co-workers are team plyers and have nice personalities. The hours are different every week and I have to work weekends. the hours are not flexible enough for me"
good,"Culture taught from Atlanta, GA is something to really be proud of. As with any corporation, execution at each branch is dependent upon the location management and is hit-n-miss. Overall, an great organization."
good,"Having never worked in a retail environment before, I have learned something new every day. Multitudes of avenues for gradual advancement in shop, but difficult to advance to management position at the corporate level. I thoroughly enjoy working with the customers, as a natural salesman. Stressful environment as they tend to trim overhead by under-staffing, undermining customer service, but overall not a bad place to work."
good,"non managers staff are good people willing to help with anything."
good,"A lot of opportunities for learning new things, great at customer service, understanding of different areas of construction and building materials."
good,"Typical day is, come in find out what happened the night before and find out what I need to get done for the day, that's if my coworkers show up and not call off. What I have learned from working here is you need to work really hard and multitask to survive, also take it upon yourself to find the answers that you seek. Management doesn't always have the answers you seek, if they don't know they tell you they will get back to you and never do. So I take it upon myself to find out what the answer is, or problems that need to be solved. Only one of my coworkers busts his butt as much as I do, the others just do enough to get by and watch us as we do most of the work. Management doesn't hold them accountable. Hardest part of this job I'd say would be trying to get some sort of communication from management on up coming changes so you can learn something new or get a project done on time. Most enjoyable would be some of the people that you get to meet are pretty down to earth."
good,"Repair of lawn equipment purchased at Home Depot, working 3 pm to 11:30 pm, McDonough, GA. Not all parts or tools are available to complete a job and must be ordered, slowing down the process of the repair.  I would prefer a job working 7:00 am - 3:00 PM"
good,"Being in hot, Houston, Texas weather pushing carts."
good,great place to work if you are going to school not a great place for family life
good,"This was a great place to work, I met a lot of great people at this job. the hardest part of this job was the amount of change that occurred in short time, it forced me to be able to deal with an abundance of change in a short period of time, with this being said, there was no room for advancement within this inside vendor group. The management and co workers were great as well, helped out with anything and everything we needed to get the job done.  the most enjoyable part of this job was being part of a team that worked together, with everyone on board."
good,"i had fun with lifting the the heavy bags and lumber oh and helping the customers every chance i get,however the managers were a bit immature with their position."
good,Another company trying to hire only part time work. Pay is close to minimum wage for regular associates.
good,"Working nights was tough on my marriage, but the crew and management made the job worthwhile."
good,Allows me to use my skills as a carpenter. Meet somebody new every other week or so. Allows me to be outside and stay physcally active. Work can be part and/or Full time and I haven't worked a weekend for a long time.
good,Revolving door of temporary hires and lack of communication. If you work hard and provide excellent service you'll move up the ladder quickly.
good,"On a typical day work day I help customers, cut wood and load shingles, drywall, and sometimes wood."
good,"When I arrive at work the first thing I do is punch in then go right to my department.l Once there, I will immediately meet someone who needs a key duplicated, therefore, I  will make some keys. After that, there will be customers with questions about projects they are doing and need advice on fasteners, or tools, or a variety of other questions that have to do with (lumber to gardening). It does help to be knowledgeable in all areas, as for myself, I have become knowledgeable in most areas of the store. Management is there when an answer to a specific problem needs to be resolved, but for the most part the sales floor people are given a wide range of freedom to make a decision on our own. We all work as a team to share the load of responsibility and we all do our share. The hardest part of the job is to replaced the returned items to there shelf positions. Sometimes there are many many items to put back and it takes hours to accomplish. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you solve a perplexing problem for a customer and receive a happy ""thank you"" and a grateful  hand shack ."
good,Very organized with an awesome system that just works. Grateful for the opportunity.
good,"it was fun at first, everyone was friendly and helpful, retail customers will be retail customers, theres always some crazies in the store, management sucked, some people worked as much as 12 hours a week, NO OVERTIME WHAT SO EVER, i've only had a 28 hour week once out of the 10 months i've been there, the regular hours were 12 hours a week, dont give you good pay!!!"
good,"Open registers for the business day. continue to provide customer service through out the day. Teach, train and coach associates on new and old information that is in effect. Other associates are supportive of each other. management weren't always helpful at completing required task. The most enjoyable part of the job was to help other associates learn and grow and continually expand their knowledge of the business"
good,"I liked the work I was doing, the schedule was perfect, management was terrible."
good,I was a cashier. When I was not cashing a customer out; I was cleaning the store that was by the check outs. I also made all the signs for the products that were on sale. Sometimes I would help a customer take their products to their vehicle; if there was another cashier to watch the check out. If I was the only cashier at the front I would find another employee to help the customer to their vehicle.
good,My overall experience was great. I learned a lot. The pay was great and I was able to move up and advance. The hours we're great and they were willing to work with me if I needed time off.
good,"Good place to work, descent pay with good work life balance.  No overtime aloud."
good,Working at Home Depot has allowed me to learn great customer service and how to multitask. I love meeting new people.
good,"Great place to work, and learn. For a company that you mostly work exclusively for due to flexible hours, the pay should be more, for talented people who wants to or must work two or so jobs."
good,"A typical day at work is never knowing where you may be working: returns desk, the front end, self check-out, , the pro register, outside garden."
good,It's an okay company to work for. you stay very busy helping everyone that comes through the doors
good,Overall I enjoyed working with this company. The atmosphere was fun and the coworkers were nice. I met many nice customers and enjoyed helping them. There are plenty of advancement opportunities if you apply yourself but be prepared to be underpaid.
good,Horrible for advancement and refuse to let anyone have more than 30hrs a week
good,"Home Depot has a process for promotion that requires the store and assistant managers to agree that you should be invited to ""RMA"", which is their management interview process.  A poor relationship with immediate managers and you don't have a chance."
good,Loved the hours i worked fit well with me. Just no room for advancement at all.
good,Schedules were all over the place. Not able to keep up with family culture.
good,"Good place to learn about customer service, how larger corporations work, and pretty good chance at advancement if you want."
good,"A alright atmosphere once you have a great team. I learned valuable selling skills and how to make the best out of work situations and build strong bonds with customers. Management sucks but you have to make the best of it. My co-workers are amazing, the were a great support system and very knowledgeable. the hardest part of the job is dealing with moody and unpleasant managers, and sometimes the constant saw dust and industrial materials make you sick. when I walk through the door I immediately get a headache. The most enjoyable part is the company attempt to give back to their employees with success sharing and Christmas parties."
good,"I like working at Home Depot. I would help out all depts., never a dull moment. I like to be on the move so working here was fun for me, always so busy. Unfortunately I got pregnant with my 3rd kid so was unabile to work as hard."
good,"I love to be busy, and I was ALWAYS busy.  My position changed twice while I was employed here, which allowed me gain valuable experience.  My co-workers were exceptional.  Very dedicated associates.  I loved the variety in my position."
good,You work your butt off and still get paid minimum wage. The best part of the job is the people. Its like you are one big happy family.
good,"Liked the fast pace you had to work at, makes time go by fast. A lot of good co-workers that were helpful when needed."
good,"A typical work day can be enjoyable one day, and very aggressive the next day with customers who believe that they have control over everyone that work at a store. working at a building materials store, I learned to be patient, and deal with people in friendly ways, and to provide the best customer service to all customer."
good,"Great place to work due to my schedule restrictions. School from Monday - Thursday and only available on weekends. Culture around the regular workday was laid back and customer based. Can learn a lot from trainings and events. If you want a flexible work schedule and a bit of benefits, an decent place to work."
good,Start your regular scheduled shift they try to work around your needs while still giving you 40 hrs. a week. Learned everything there is to know about job that you are doing. Management is not all that great (high turn over for management) Co-workers are friendly. Not really hard to do the job. Some of the co-workers are cool to work with.
good,"After 8 years of service this company in now forcing people to take cuts in pay and hours to keep a job. They hire now at a low wage offer little to no benefits to new people and what  they do offer is costly and covers little. If you are a student or retired this may be ok for you, if you have a family to support they are no better than Walmart. Sadly they have fallen a long way and have little to offer."
good,I enjoyed working for home depot the co-workers where fun and very respectful they welcomed me with opened arms. The hardest part of my job was having to tell a cashier they are not meeting the company policy. the most enjoyable part of the job was having dependable co-workers and the customers that shopped there were wonderful.
good,This was a good part-time job for a university student.  I worked in lumber so I got plenty of exercise as well. I did not like how random the shifts were and I often found management could have handled certain things differently.  I enjoyed working with the other employees in my department and my supervisor was very approachable.
good,A good place to work as far as retail goes. There are maybe one to many layers of supervision but aside from that it was a good environment. You learn about what you sell and there are advancement opportunities.
good,"It can be a great place to work for some. Very much a variety of duties and you learn alot. Most the co-workers are just great and willing to help one another. Management changes so hard to say how I would review them. Hardest part of the job was hardly any weekends off to be with family. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping people. As far as job advancement, just depended on who you were and management."
good,"A typical day is:"
good,"I enjoyed working here due to the type of business it is...as I am a DIYer. The location was perfect. I am very people oriented, so was always happy to meet and talk with customers's , help them with their purchases, answer questions. I did not enjoy the long hours standing on concrete so much, but it was not as so bad really either. I made friends easily with co-workers. The hardest part of the job was getting let go, as I was only temporary, plus the pay was very low. Management seemed to be a bit cliquish, and I was not always sure where I stood, although I feel I did a great job for the company. The most enjoyable part was learning about products, and definitely the customers."
good,"management kind of freindly, but not too much interaction."
good,"As a Receiver, unload trucks and distribute to sales floor.  In Garden Dept., assist customers and keep shelves stocked.  Learned inventory control methods and sales techniques.  Management was nice, fair, but firm.  Co-workers nice and helpful.  Hardest part of job was helping customers with problems.  Most enjoyable part of job was talking with interesting customers and drivers."
good,"great team work, associate are well coachable and willing to learn about new product"
good,"warehouse environment , ships products to the stores  they supply daily"
good,"the management at my store was good, my coworkers were really nice"
good,"The people are pretty friendly. There is a lot of just standing around. You are only allowed to clean at certain times. A job is a job though, i would clean floors with a tooth brush if they told me to."
good,"The Home Depot is a stable company, has well- thought out innovative ideas, and is customer focused.  However, there is no advancement, and the hours are not accommodating if one has a family."
good,my first job as freight manager. not a good experience. Benefits were  good. Some of the co-workers were very hard to work with
good,It changes from time to time. But normally I am attending to the customers and answering any questions and concerns they may have.
good,"hard to get fulltime position, even full timers get hours cut weekly."
good,The harder you work the more is expected of you but when it comes to your raise it is vary small not worth the hard work.
good,average day of helping people with store products and how to use them....
good,"Working as a garden cashier, you are able to learn so much about gardening and the customers are all so friendly"
good,not as fun as us to be standing on cement isnt fun coworker stab u in the back they wnt my job because i have set hours and weekends of ive learned that everyones out for them self there hardest part of my jobs is standing on the cement all day but i do like the customers we have fun 
good,"Different working hours,"
good,you learn a lot about different projects plumbing gardening hardware building flooring feels good when you have the knowledge and put it to work by helping customers. 
good,I like this company but the upper management in my store is terrible.
good,"Working at the service desk I have to work with customers special orders. I've learned how to work with vendors, making sure the customer is 100 percent satisfied. Management works with you to make sure all of your questions are answered. The hardest part of the job is having to make sure everything is in its correct position and that the customer receives exactly the correct product with no mistakes. The most enjoyable part of the service desk is when you and all your co-workers work in sync and the customer is satisfied.  "
good,"Staff isn't well informed."
good,Home Depot was a great experience to learn about everything in the market from advertising to gardening etc.
good,"A typical day at work was stressful because the managers were on top of everyone watching everything. Managers also put a lot of pressure on their employees to make sales. I learned how to interact with people, getting to know customers like that the next time they came to shop I already had what they needed that way they didn't have to go look for it. Well, I'm very easy going meaning I get along with everyone so my co-workers were nice people. The hardest part about my job was to do ""returns"" because our store had over like 50,000 products. The part I enjoyed the most the bonus checks the employees would receive for making higher sales than we were projected to make."
good,"A typical day at Home Depot would be fun but hard work would always be included.My first task would be to grab a electrical jack and start pulling out freight onto the floor so it could be worked.Working at Home Depot i learned how to opperate a forklift,how to be patient with my work and others around me.Management at Home Depot was pretty awsome,Best Managers.I had the best co-workers.There wasnt anything to hard for me to do at home depot,im kind of a solid guy.I enjoyed every minute working at Home Depot"
good,"For the most part this place trained everyone pretty well and paid alright. Some of the managers would forget what you did exactly if they never worked in your area, but they were always willing to sit down and talk about how to get everything done by the end of the day. They also would listen to your ideas and help you implement improvements to your area."
good,ive learned a lot about merchandising and how big companies are ran. 
good,"I started working at Home Depot when I was still in college and have learned alot of skills that I believe that will help me succeed in my future career. Home Depot has taught me the importance of team building, great customer service, time managment, interpersonal skills, and more :administration, microsoft applications, data base, bookkeeping, etc. "
good,"It's a job..."
good,Stock and sale paint and accessory items to customers. Mix custom paints to spec.
good,Typical gas station job with cash handling and customer service.
good,-work was typically busy in millwork department
good,Enjoy working with most customers. Enjoy working with my fellow employees. Most times am busy with customers or putting out stock.
good,Customer service was my main priority. I was last working in the lumber department. Management was good. My co-workers were very nice. I learned alot about lumber and how to drive a hi-low. There wasn't anything that I can remember that was hard about the job. But I did enjoy making customers happy.
good,Load and unload freight for shipping and receiving. Inventory function set up new sku and generate cycle counts. Works at a fast and safe pace with accuracy.
good,"I have successfully managed several highly profitable businesses with very happy and successful employees in the last 20 years. The HD is a good place to work until they start to micro manage the stores which drives down store moral and motivation. The processes in the late have become a large distraction to the goal of profitability and customer service. The bread and butter at times seems to get thrown away in order to focus on fluff and appearance, plus the fact that it is a warehouse store has been lost sight of as far as a managerial standpoint goes. The less than 2% pay increase given per year will not come close to maintaining with the cost of living and inflation, therfore it will force employees to seek a higher paying job by default. The success sharing bonuses are nice but fall far short of making a true incentive to associates to make the effort to provide excellent customer service. Store management is pressured push associated to drive sales without any additional regular or consistant compensation to perform that way."
good,"The employees would stand outside and wait for the customers to give cash and assist them to their parking spot, and let them know where the stadium is located."
good,the things i learn from work is about customer service being able to react with the customer problems. the hardest part of the job is the people that work with u. Some people dont really work as a team sometimes when things go wrong and it gets everybody confuse most often.The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new friends and being able to u hands on activities i never use before.
good,"Every day is different but walk my department and access what needs to be accomplished for the day, see who is working on the schedule, and judge what kind of customer flow to expect. organize my associates and give them my expectations for the of what I would like them to accomplish. Provide customer service, check sales for the past couple days, check inventory levels, place orders for product, work various reports that are required on a weekly basis, do various maintenance on the bays in my department cleaning, down stocking ect, and whatever else the assistant manager needs help with that day. I've learned a lot about home improvement projects, problem solving, how to read sales reports, and improved my ability to manage people. The hardest part of my job is disciplining any employee in the store that is older than me because of them not performing their job to my standards or that of the company. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people that I work with we are all a team."
good,its fun if you like helping people but sometimes you get rude customers
good,"A typical day would be processing work order weather it was flooring, or walls. Train employees on how to process an order."
good,"Working at Home Depot, like any other retail position, has its benefits and disadvantages."
good,A typical day was taking 5-10 inbound calls per day and making outbound calls from lead in's from the company website.
good,"I spend the day helping customers and answering the phone. I'm learning how to process large orders for customers. My co-workers are great guys, and the management guys are easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is standing around, since our store is not busy. I most enjoy interacting with customers."
good,"Working for the company is okay. Their down with their assoiciate are no discounts, management don't lead by example and alot miscommunication with one another. The co-workers are the most messy, gossping over grown people i've ever met."
good,The workload at Home Depot was rough as one might expect. I learned a lot about products & how to operate machinery. My co-workers were hit or miss but I had no issues with anyone. There were lots of managers & they were unreasonable at times but okay at the end of the day. The hardest part was the physical aspect *lifting very heavy materials*. The most enjoyable part was operating the machinery although it was also nerve-wrecking.
good,"I have worked for Home Depot for several years, but is very hard to keep the job and be able to raise a family on the pay they pay. Management advancement does not compensate you properly for such an advancement."
good,"A company that seems to re-invent itself very election year. Does mostly with down-sizing and revamping job titles and taking away company perks, such as bonuses. Looks good on paper, but the employee usually suffers."
good,Responsible for helping customers in checking out and informing customers on products. Assist in all departments to help when short staffed.
good,I didn't have a lot of opportunity to advance in this position
good,"Home depot I worked in the receiving area the evening shift. Had lots of trucks to unload and receive, and most of the time alone. We didn't have much staff and if we did they didn't show up all the time."
good,"constant motion with no down time for managers, lack of personnel to complete task due to payroll controls."
good,"While I enjoyed working at Home Depot, the local management was extreme. I never mind working hard, but the attitude of the district management is that unless you are at the store 24/7, it is not enough. You could work a 17 hour day and then they would ask you why you went home. If you are single with no kids and don't mind working hard, you can move up."
good,scheduling could be better
good,Worked as a cahier and also handled returns and exchanges at the service desk.
good,"Some people of management are not fit to be managers. They didn't follow procedure, but when it was brought to the attention of people above them, they find loop holes. It's irritating. As if they are only in it for themselves. I've learned that in order to get through the day at a job you don't like is to find people who are willing to entertain you. My co-workers were awesome. I don't believe that there was a hard part about the job I did, but I will say the most enjoyable part about working for Home Depot is getting to meet new, interesting people everyday."
good,You've been there before you tell me. Its a home supply super store with corporate mentality.
good,"Enjoyed the interaction with customers and providing answers for their needs, but as a Home Depot employee felt used and abused"
good,Home Depot was a good place to work. Most of the people i worked with where friendly and fun to work with. Working nights was fast paced to make sure shelf's where full and store was grand open ready.
good,Face-to-Face customer service
good,Solving customer problems by learning what they are trying to do and offering the best solution to there budget.
good,"Not a good place to work in a bad Economy, easy layoffs, terminations, scheduled hours reduced, No bonuses for Mgt. means harsher - kindness from both supervisors and managers."
good,"loved working here, just wish someone would explain how some of the human resource aspects work for and or against employees."
good,Due to downsizing my job changed to part time. Unfortunately I need full time work. While I enjoyed the learning exprience while working there I do need to find full time employement.
good,Great pay and that's about it. Management does not care about employees. Even attempts to fire employees for getting hurt on the job. Cuts hours without notice.
good,Home Depot Had Its Good And Bad Days At Times. The Management Team Wasnt Up To Part Or Organized
good,"A typical day at work is assisting customers with murchandise, and learning where and what each murchandise is located throughout the store. The management was never available to make decisions when necessary. My co-workers was always willing to assist customers. The hardest part of the job is trying to find a merchandise, and the most enjoyable part of the job is obseving customers stealing things from the store and as soon as they walk out without paying and approach by store security they are so surprise."
good,"this was a very productive place, great people, awesome customers... everyone paid attention to details"
good,"5am start. Check communication book for any indoor reach truck and/or order-picker request(s) for a customer and/or management. Do outside cleanup of compound area eg.skids, product, garbage, etc. 6am off-load products using the fork truck and detail receive. Put product on shelves 10am Lunch.11am Customer service only until 2pm. Computer work invoved checking stock for customers, if shelf is empty. Make Management aware of product required to order or would special order directly .Train new associates about products and policies where required (go to person). Hardest part: not allowed to fill holes on shelves when there are no customers, and seeing texting on the floor during work hours. Enjoy working with customers the best by listening, learning and helping them with there projects. Enjoy driving and training others on the fork trucks ( I was a trainer for the store)"
good,"Process countless transactions,offer credit cards."
good,leabed how to use scanners on the night shift where i recieved product and organized it on shelves after hours and assembling displays for new products was a typical day
good,"hours are variable, management is good, hardest part of the job is conflicting tasks from management, i learned alot about all the departments"
good,A typical day would be coming in and setting up your war board to run the frontend and it actually turns out the way you planed it. I learn many things but learning all the in and outs of inputting all your information in the computer. Some of the managers are great to work for but others need to go back to school to learn how to interact with thier crew. My co-workers are good hard workers who are willing to share skills they learned. The hardest part is getting call in and having to reset your war board to maintain floor coverage. The most enjoyable part is know you helped a customer and really bmade their day.
good,Great Company to Work For. However Management has steadily declined.
good,"unfair work distribution , lack of communication between managers, lack of consistent team work, favoritism of shifts from management.Not a great place if you want to grow in a career."
good,"Great people I worked with, and met alot of good people. Managers were biased, they didn't communicate with each other very well. Always received conflicting work lists or information about a customer needs. Worked you hard with very little support."
good,Promote and generate new credit accounts and sales leads for all of the installation and credit programs.
good,"Assist customers,down stock,clean area,help co-workers. Learned more about products.Nice to work with most of the time.Co-workers are helpful.No hours.Helping customers."
good,"The company values at Home Depot are great. The youthful work environment is more suitable for young adults ages 18-25. At this age the worked aren't concerned a great deal with work; they idle and hang around the store doing nothing, like in most retail stores. If the company addressed the slacker attitudes of it's younger workers it would be a great place to work."
good,"A fast paced work environment, which required a great amount of customer. I learned to manage a great team of employees and it prepared me to be a leader in retail. It was a pleasure working along dedicated employees. The most difficult part of the job is not being able to assist a customer due to lack of merchandise but the most enjoyable part is getting a great smile from a customer because you was able to provide customer service to the full extent."
good,hands on customer service. Sold flooring and wall products.
good,"this could have been an amazing job, I guess the problem was it was only temporary/seasonal. I loved working outside in the garden area, got to meet some great people. got to help some great people. would love to work there again but its hard to get in there and once again its a seasonal job."
good,A day in Management at the Home Depot consists of very long hours sometimes being 16/18 hour days. This kind of work schedule is for a specific type of person. The Employees are great to work with and it was fun to develop and manage them.
good,"Great Company to work for, good benefits and advancement but all I have to complain about is the lack of values when they choose managers."
good,"my work place was always busy a typical day at work consist of a short break, back and forth walking to supervise front end staff, assisting customers with complaints, refunds, orders etc.. my co workers sometimes gave problems but i just stuck it out and did my job, some of them made your day just fly by and fun , hardest part of my job was that my schedule was all over making my daily life activites very hard to manage. i enjoyed coming to work helping my customers and building a reltionship with most of them keeping them coming back"
good,"A typical day at the Home Depot includes lifting and measuring wood, and processing a great deal of transactions in very quickly while using the appropriate measures to insure that the customer is satisfied. A lot of the time if you are a cashier, customers who don't find assistance on the floor, while usually take out their frustrations on you. To handle this correctly, you have to apologize for the mistakes of your fellow co-workers, and find help immediately. You really have to have patience, because as with any job in retail, customers can be extremely nasty. If you handle situations correctly, the job is rewarding. My co-workers were mostly around my age, and very friendly. My supervisor was very understanding, and helpful, and a real friend. Hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who are inconvenienced daily, having to wait for other departments to bring missing SKU numbers, and lifting heavy objects. Most importantly, the benefits are great. Associates receive paid holidays, and a decent amount of part-time hours. Associates are also rewarded for store success with checks, and receive discounts/perks everywhere (except Home Depot)."
good,Home depot is a great company to work for the typical work day depends on where you are working in the Store I have learned a lot about retail management and customer service the hardest part is to me I think is all the changes being made everyday the most enjoyable part is helping customers solve their problems they are having with their home repairs
good,The most enjoyable part of the job has to be they are willing to show me new things all the time.
good,it was the worst place i ever worked they would favor people make good workers pick up peoples slack
good,"The job is easy once you learn the systems that they use to order. The customers are very unique and each one comes with their own set of opportunities. The management team is good, with their strength being one unified vision of where they want to be, with the company vision in mind. I think they have opportunities in the communication area, when it comes to standards and guidlines."
good,Multiple managers who don't communicate well between each other and associates. More of a popularity contest to get a full time position. Part timers just get hours cut if the sales aren't high enough week to week
good,"Home Depot is awsome to work for. But unfortunately they don't pay what your worth, due to there advancement policies. I understand the situation but I also need to pay my bills as well. I have been in charge of many large warehouses and would like to advance as I still have good years in me."
good,"Go to work ten mintues of hearing supervisor talk about nothing then its off to our work areas. eight hours of stocking, face forwarding, receiving i learned to operate machines such as ORDER PICKER, SLIP TRUCK, REACH TRUCK. The management was what they were my co-workers also like me hard work employees. The hardest part of the job was trying to tackle some of the backed-up freight due to downsizing. The fun i had their with the company parties"
good,They give you opportunity to learn new things and cross train in departments so you can learn a lot about different home improvement things.
good,This is a home improvement store so I learned various things in different departments. Management I don't really want to comment on. Most co-workers were fun to be around and worked together. Hardest part of job was learning the different departments. Most enjoyable part were the customers.
good,"The benefits are by far the worst I've ever seen. I was full time, and I was paying like $300/month for medical insurance that had a $25 co-pay, vision insurance that gave me mediocre coverage, and dental that was on par with the vision insurance! Job security is there if you're in management, but they're willing to cut every line they can to stay above their set profit margain. I can't tell you how fast the lay offs came. I know it was when the recession hit, but wow. I mean it's as if they needed an exucse to do it, and that was there moment to shine. Walked in one day, and asked if they needed any help because my cousin needed work, and the rep tells me that their policy is to hire Per Diem, part time, and temporary customer service reps. . . .Wow. I don't think I need to say anymore. Great one stop shop, but I won't be looking to the big orange for employment any time in the future"
good,putting orders away running equ and doing it in a safe way. got along good with all of my co workers and management went to school for 15 months to do hvac
good,Home depot seemed like a great place to work. It was very friendly and easy to learn. We had great benefits and great holiday events... However they do not have an HR avaliable to you and they look down on turning people into management. They often hire new people to management instead of promoting within.
good,"A typical day for me can range from emptying carts full of merchandise into the aisles to using a reach truck/pallet jack (both manual and eletctric)/ forklifts to retrieve merchandise from the overhead racking as well as using ladders to retrieve smaller items. The management in my particular store don't commuicate as well as they could, but it's getting better than it has been in recent memory. Most of my co-workers are amazing people who most of us feel going to one of them to talk about anything from work-related topics to something that may be going on in one person's personal life. The hardest part of working there is curbing your mouth/temper when customers are rude/pushy/nasty or ask a stupid question because of how they phrase it. If they'd phrase the respone in a better manner, it'd be a better company to work for. Also, the rate of pay isn't so great, but the health insurance, discounts, and bonuses could sometimes offset it."
good,home depot would be a great place to work at but the management is not so good. when i would talk to the manager about serious problems he would laugh and i thing it was a nervous reaction. they pay well and give raises when they are due.
good,Very good employer to work for. Great pay. Opportunity to meet many great people.
good,"Fun atmosphere and good teamwork among coworkers. Extensive job and product knowledge training. Lower level managers are helpful and knowledgeable. Upper level management, however, can be intentionally obtuse and unhelpful. The most fun part of the job is working with customers and teaching them how to complete various projects on their home. The hardest part of the job is dealing with problems caused by outside sub-contracted installers. Overall, I enjoy the job. My only major complaints are the very low pay, and very high priced health care plan."
good,"If you want to gain experienece working with diversity, or a teen just graduating and need to get their foot to the ground, Home Depot is a good place to start. Its a fast pass enviroment. So quick learning is a must. The another part of the job is to get use to standing on your feet. And if your just want Part Time you have the choice of picking days and hours."
good,"Working here was not too bad. Work hours were good, benefits are good if you become Permanent/ full time. Customers can be irate at times but they always handled it well."
good,"customer service, management not really on there job. Empoylee never to be found"
good,"working at Home Depot was a different environment i was new to being around people since Ive worked mostly all warehouses but I'm very adaptable and friendly and the co-workers were also friendly I answered phone calls down stocked and front faced and data entry , the hardest part was going from full time to part time"
good,"I help customer in all areas, Cashering, stoching, customer servise. and merchandising."
good,I learned about the construction industry. Working with the tools and materials of the industry allowed me to gain familiarity with those tools and materials. It was an opportunity for incredible learning.
good,"loading and or unloading trucks with stand-up forklift, very repetative - very friendly workplace"
good,"i learned how to,"
good,"*Applies to the Rapid Deployment Center only, Not Store side*"
good,"Customer Service is the primary task of each day. I have learned the many features of toilets, bathtubs, faucets, vanities, showers and countertops. Management attempts to provide scheduling to meet employees lifestyles as much as possible. I find satisfaction in my job when customers seek for me when they return as they have a confidence that I care and will look for a solution for their needs."
good,Stock shelves.
good,Over all I would have stayed if my health health have not gotten in the way.
good,Its pretty sad that they see the benefit in paying a bunch of money just train somebody and 3 months later lay them off.
good,I enjoyed my time at the home depot they had great opportunities and bonuses
good,"My main objectives were to make the store look presentable for the next day. Restocking outside/inside garden, lumber, and cleaning aisles. I was trained and licensed to operate the machinery at the store. The management team at my store are very easy to speak with and very accessible. The co-workers can be hit-and-miss, some work hard and behave normally, others slack off and are difficult to work with. The hardest part of my job was getting used to the ever changing schedules, rarely did anyone ever have the same shift day after day. Mine went from 3am-noon, to 9pm-6am, and now my day schedule never has the same shift twice. The most enjoyable part of the job was looking over the store before my shift was over knowing that everything was taken care of and done properly."
good,Needs some improvement and more consistency
good,"A typical day at work is walking around the store helping customers and meeting their needs. I always tried to get a laugh out of them, you know to break the ice. Then we would talk about their projects. Show the customer their options. I learned that you can not take things personal if the customer is upset for one reason or another. Also the store software and cashiering hours of training. Management is positive and helpful. The co-workers are the best, they're always ready to help you when you need assistance. The hardest part of the job for me was meeting the quota set during this ruff economic period. I really enjoyed assisting others with their projects and giving them the advice they were looking for and making many friends."
good,Working with the customers and being able to help them is the best part of my day. I love to put a smile on their face before they leave the store because I am the last one they see. It can be challenging sometimes when they don't get the help they need from the sales floor team.
good,"The Home Depot is a good place to work. I started as a sales associate but moved over to the freight team after about six months. I made the move primarily because the freight team had a fixed schedule whereas the sales associate schedule was constantly changing. I didn't find anything about the job to be particularly hard,although I did have some pretty difficult customers on occasion. Management was competent overall, but most seemed more interested in their careers than in the overall success of the store. Ironically, I worked with some of the best as well as some of the worst co-workers I have ever experienced. I really enjoyed helping customers find solutions to there home improvement needs."
good,A typical day at work for me would be unloading merchandise from trucks and getting orders ready for customers.
good,my typical day at work was always a good one i enjoyed working with different customers and there needs i learned how to use my skills with a better sense of knowledge my co-workers are great i still have friends that work there it felt like you would be going to work with family the hardest part of my job was sometimes not being able to give the customer the satisfaction that they would deserve for the reasons that we would not have the item on stoke ir nor be able to get it for them
good,"Its ridiculous the amount of freight we get, and were supposed to be a slower store. They expect us to have 8 hours worth of work done in 4 hours, on a daily basis."
good,"Overall a great company to work for, Needs to be a better split of work / life balance though. Often times worked 12 or more hours per day."
good,Always learning something new.
good,"It was an enjoyable time, I would still be there if I wanted to work in that environment. I am looking to expand my experience."
good,"good pay,"
good,"Working here was fun lots of projects to do in the departments. Saturdays kids can come and do little home improvement projects, free hot dogs. Great awards and compensation for good work being done on the job."
good,good job to have if you dont mind working anytime. not so good if u need a set schedule. pay is ok the benefits are good and u get them early
good,"Worked for The Home Depot in Ma. a few years ago before relocating out of state, Started in garden and was moved to appliances before leaving. Not a bad job for part time, but would not choose to make it a career. Just glad I no longer need fulltime employment. Management seemed to be fair, but large employee turnover."
good,"learn new task work with helpful people get your hours but no weekends off only mangers and pets gets weekends off,good pay every week.rotateing shifts,works different departments,under new mangers."
good,The pace is fast you are always moving always picking up items. The work depenes on how many trailer are in that day.
good,At least that was true a decade ago.
good,Home Depot is a very good company to work for; I started out as a sales associate in the Garden Department. I moved up in the department to a lead and a trainer. I left so that I could get more benefits and better hours.
good,Would not reccommend for full time work but can learn a lot working for HD but cannot advance unless you are mgr favorite.
good,"At first I loved the job and the people that I worked with even though I never worked so hard in my life. As the management changed, it soon became who you were friends with that got the promotions. I did get the opportunity to learn a product line for which I since have grown within that industry - but NOT with Home Depot."
good,"Give themselves advantage among their competitors with their strong customer service values. Family oriented enviornment among associates in the workplace. Personally wouldn't recommend that store to work at due to favoritism, but I believe somewhere else with The Home Depot would be an enjoyable workplace!"
good,"I enjoyed working there and had alot of opprotunity to float and learn new areas.They kept telling me that they were going to start me in their management program but then we would change managers and I would have to prove myself all over again.I recieved several awards while there but that did not seem to make a difference.Even though I worked between 30-40 hours a week I was considered ""Part Time"" and so my benefits were taking almost all of my check."
good,"Fun place to work, was easy to advance. Home Depot has great benefits but the pay could have been better. I loved that Home Depot supported the community."
good,I was always happy to go to work. my teammates were great. I always was learning new things. they thought me how to drive several forklifts.I got chances to learn about different departments.
good,"I liked working for Home Depot, but eventually lost my passion. Scheduling was willing to work with my school hours, and the pay was good for what I was doing."
good,"Job Work/Life Balance is very poor at the Home Depot. The company does not mind working you passed your scheduled hours but don't want to pay you over time. They require you to cut your overtime on your lunch break and if you are a closing associate they do not consider giving you the weekends off so you don't get much time to spend with your family. When I was a closing associate working from 1 pm to 10 pm I only got to see my kids when I sent them to school in the morning and by the time I got home they were in the bed for school the following day, and I never had the weekends to spend with them."
good,It’s an easy place to get accustomed to and the environment was well kept as well as the staff I learned easily and I never felt lost everything was very easy to handle as well
good,Home depot teached me alot. It was an okay experience they don’t have alot to offer but just learning how to work in that environment was great for me.
good,"I have worked for this company for a couple of years now. I have learned how to drive machinery, how to work most departments because I was moved to the department or because there was a lack of stuff to fill the department so I had to learn to help my self and customers on my own. I have worked hard and given them all they have asked of me, over time, not work in my department to go help them do other things, which meant they were understaffed in the department they took me away from but yet the expected me to do juggle that department and another. Within the past 6 months, I have stopped working so hard because I would see other employees getting paid more but they would take very long breaks or multiple smoke breaks, or simply not do their job. I got frustrated and I saw no point in trying anymore. I would ask for raises but they refused or say they don't have the funds to do so, but yet they give the people that don't do s**t one. At this point, I'm just staying here until I find a much better job. There are really nice and hardworking people here that deserve a lot more than others but unfortunately, they aren't appreciated, and if THD does not see that soon they'll going to lose a lot of good people. I have met great people and made great friends I'm sad to say that I won't be able to work with them anymore but I happy to say I'm leaving this train wreck of a store."
good,"Entre por contrato de unos meses por apoyo de inventario entre como asociado de piso apoyando en diferentes areas como el piso de ventas,atencion al cliente,cajas,y carga de mercancia pesada"
good,"Home Depot is always looking for work and it's definitely not a bad job, but it's not the greatest either. Sometimes the management asks too much from you where you're not able to complete what they ask due to you trying to complete your daily tasks. It can get very stressful at times and honestly it's not worth it unless you have nothing to do."
good,"This was a good job and I enjoyed the workplace and most people. But if you are not in one of the clicks and have orange blood, you may or may not be happy there."
good,It's a good job for basic work. Its gets repetitive though but you at least know what to expect everyday. Good entry level job to get incorporated into warehouse life.
good,The job is overall more work than you are paid for. They will find any way to make you do more and more work in the one shift as possible. Raises aren't with the effort to earn them.
good,"In the morning, manager has me blow the trash in the parking lot. I also have to arrange all the carts to where they're supposed to be. I have to restock all empty or half full isles with necessary products. When the store opens, I help customers load and unload their purchases if its too difficult for them to load."
good,"This place is perfect for part-timers. Due to the competitive nature of the business, one can only handle so much work at a time. Having to be a salesperson, designer expert, contractor, and department janitor can be tiring."
good,The Home Depot is a good place to work but doesn’t offer many hours to employees and the management is very immature. They pay decent and you learn a lot about customers service working there.
good,After I transferred to a new store I moved up very quickly. The good managers got promoted and unfortunately their replacements were not very good replacements. I was happy with my pay under better leadership. I realized I was worth a lot more under the new leadership.
good,Dealing with customer service in any capacity has its ups and downs but I enjoyed my time here. Would recommend it for anyone looking into the construction industry.
good,"Always a hiring opportunity.  Level of employee product knowledge has slipped the last several years.  Some stores are well kept, others look like a garage sale."
good,Home Depot it's type of job where you can learn all the basics to home repair and remodeling it's always beneficial if you want a deeper understanding a rebuilding a house office or apartment.
good,"A good, solid employer that generally cares about its associates."
good,Fasted pasted clean environment mangers and supervisors ok sometimes work is easy and co workers easy to get along with the hardest part is when work slows down.
good,It is a good company to work for. The downside is management. It is a fun environment to work in with coworkers  but management piles up too much work on one associate.
good,"It’s a good company to work for, that have amazing benefits. There are high possibilities of growth within the company. I was promoted after 2 months of being."
good,"Worked well with other asso. Love working with customers "
good,very high stress and long days and they have you working in other departments all the time. Management was not helpful at all in the Portsmouth NH store
good,Cashiering are the Home Depot was pretty mediocre. The job was very easy but sometimes it got fairly busy. The managers were bad but the employees I worked with were very friendly.
good,"Lot Attendants spend long hours in the sun so maybe not for everyone, hours and pay rate aren’t that good either. Best if it’s just a temporary job  ."
good,I really enjoyed working with Home Depot. This company just need to make some improvement in being fair to all employees. Equal pay need to be around the board.
good,Your constantly up on the yellow bird takeing things down and waiting on customers and doing special orders.  It was alright to work at but when it was time to take a break people are constantly stopping you because you have the apron on and sometimes I didn't get my break other than that it wasn't bad. I didn't like it because I don't like heights.
good,"All is about costumer service and how you can help and learn from others department, that’s is a plus, and enjoy your journey because everyday you learn something new."
good,"The store I worked at had a hostile environment. Too much favoritism, and clearly no true care for employees unless you had been there for ten years or more. They fired my only coworker that I enjoyed at work and a friend outside of work because she told them she was pregnant and they did not wish to give her leave for childbirth. They did her very dirty. I tried to also turn in a manager for verbal harassment and the told me she had to approve of what she said regardless of me having customers as ear and eye witnesses to what’ had gone on"
good,I loved doing the design work and I was able to accomplish designs and jobs much sooner then other employees usually do when first starting. But they also have you do other work through the store that you may or may not have experience or knowledge about.
good,Management offered exceptional training and support. Company is extremely community friendly. Safe and supportive working environment. Aboove average wage.
good,"I've worked for two stores in 3 years and what I've experienced as an order fulfillment associate is that the sales floor is a hectic mess due to poor scheduling and when sales plans are being met the assistant managers are very vocal however dont provide much help leaving associates to fend for themselves alot of the time, phones ringing constantly while people are juggling tasks, people can be bothered to help out eachother most of the time"
good,"Depending on who you are in the store is what your relationship with management will be like. If you are a slacker or the type of person who isn't dependable they attempt to overwork you or find little things for you to do that will upset you. If you are a person who can be counted on to help them do their jobs better, they will either abuse that and not promote you or they will have some type of half way medium. The company itself is a great company to work for  but they management depending on the store you go to, is partial with how they decide to treat the associates. Its a lot of personalities to deal with and a lot to handle and it either you will stand out or you will fall back to the side and be invisible."
good,"The Home Depot tended to focus on contractors. In recent years, they have began to focus on DIY customers which makes them feel more comfortable and makes me feel more confident in helping them with their project need.s"
good,"Its hard to advance even if you are a hard worker, which I am. Love working with the public so love talking to the public. Just alot of stealing from the store. Always on the watch for thieves."
good,Love the people I work with and overall values of the company. Management does not appreciate the employees. Part time hours have been cut in half for the last few months (from almost 30 to 16/week) without warning. I have been trying to go full time for 4 months and it’s not happening. Not a good employer if you need a set schedule and consistent hours
good,"Working at Home Depot was a great job to learn useful skills. They train you on different products, but you learn the most from other employees and by talking to customers about their projects and about there business they are coming in for. The management is going to very from each department and each store so you can't really do anything about that. But find a couple coworkers that are fun to spend 8 hours with while walking around and its not a bad place to work."
good,"Work experience great short fun while lived, meaning working for them.they need to have better Opportunities for the employees.They have to be a better pay increase for the daily drivers such as forklift, reach, APJ and etc. those guys but they’re jobs on the line when it come to moving things and handling safety properly. Higher up don’t Quite understand what the drivers go through on a day by day basis with customers"
good,"Not too long ago Department Managers were encouraged to manage their department as if it was their own business. They had some control over product inventory and could use some judgement as to how much backstock they needed or didn't need.  Now the Department Managers are little more than glorified stock clerks having no control over the amount of product they have.  It's no longer their own business. They system (supposedly) manages inventory ""automatically."" Unfortunately the system is often wrong.  The system does not know the customers like a Department Manager does and is unable to quickly meet the needs of a contractor, for example, who might need thirty extra LED flood light bulbs for a new construction.  Previously the Department Managers could order more of a product to meet the need and satisfy the customer.  Home Depot took that away from those who manage the departments."
good,Providing care to customers that need assistance when renovating their homes or businesses. Personal product sales as well as business equipment sales.
good,its alright while there to work and earn a living. Management is nice and so as your co-employees. Only good for working students or stay at home moms coming back to work force.
good,"Most days worked alone in receiving, very high multitasking job.  Pretty much on your own, assistants from other departments was slow. Worked with a small receiving area, made staging merchandise hard, but made it work. Had to constantly keep area organized, very high traffic area. Being P/T, constantly worked overtime."
good,"A great shot term job. Only good for long term if you're planning on making a career out of it and moving up the ladder. Generally, the pay isn't worth it."
good,"working in home depot is cordial, that is it. i mean some what cordial.. working in home depot is good but the pay is not as much as one can desire..."
good,They talk a good game but care more about the bottom line then there employees. The home depot does not offer much paid time off and the insurance they offer is a joke. The only good benefit they offer is a 6 week fully paid parental leave. The work is enjoyable but can get a little overwhelming because of there unwillingness to terminate employees that do not do there job.
good,"I work as MET 3rd shift between the hours of 8:30pm to 6:30am. It has  been impactful on my day to day and I often find sleep can be an issue. It has been a reasonable job for me trying to gain more skills as you use power tools daily and occasionally lift equipment which I have found valueable. The culture is ok, being night crew is not a glamourous job but you do have some liberties day crew does not have access to. Having three day weekends has been nice and you dont have to work most holidays but that can counteracted by the time schedule as you may just be sleeping most of your time off. If you dont mind night-shift its not a bad option and full-time atleast in my experiance was readily available."
good,Job was great to work at. Management team sucked on second shift. Hard to advance with certain management teams. Great benefits and pay. Flexible hours.
good,Working for Home Depot was a learning experience and I appreciate the time I spent there. The people were nice and willing to help me overcome and obstacles or answer any questions I had.
good,"the amount of work they have you do is good but the pay should be more then just average for hauling and stocking, the more i learn the more i understood the nature of the grouping for each department...the only thing was i was not getting paid enough because it was a hard hauling and carrying job."
good,Work here is great.   You learn a lot.   I've person learned all I can. It's great if you're going to school or need a part time job to get out of the house.
good,"Customer service excellence on all levels, cashier, stocking, organizing, inventory, loading customers vehicles, load and unload tractor trailer trucks with inventory."
good,"Was a good seasonal job. Management was tough but fair. Busy in the summer, dead in the winter hence the seasonal job. Was a great work environment to expose me to diverse customer service situations."
good,while working here i was able to learn a lot from a helpful management team but some adult employees did not know how to act like an adult witch made it hard to work there but when i brought it up to management they helped me to the best of there abilities
good,If you seek part time work than working for Home Depot is very doable.  They do a pretty good job of training and if you want to advance you can do further training.
good,On a typical day at home depot for a merchandiser you would stock the shelves and make sure they are set to Planogram. You would have to change prices for product and some bays you would do a project in.
good,"its a cool place to work just not enough money for what is asked of you, Very demanding of seasonal duties, great shipping supervisor lack of leadership from certain management"
good,"Working for home depot was a great experience, Being around people tools, heavy equipment and people can be crazy. Just self control and learning to control certain situations will get you through."
good,The best part of the job is honestly the custumers.It feels good helping people out and seeing them happy. with better management home depot would be a nice place to work and shop.
good,"I worked very hard and did everything I could to help my store and I never got anything. No full-time, no raises, no promotions, just watched slackers get all of them. Don't expect anything but to work there."
good,"Your experience will depend on who’s working and how you deal with it, you won’t like everyone and most times they won’t like you it’s all what you make of it"
good,It’s a good company to work for. They are pretty flexible with your schedule. Everyone is nice and helpful. Not sure how benefits are as I was part time.
good,"daily work day was laid out depending on shift time. "
good,"Quite the family place staff is  enjoyable and well mannered and fun to be working with, ive learned how to sign up guest suggest sales up my cashier skills and learn how to get customers out of line and home with the products they love! Management with some was a little on the stiff side but all and all they were lovable. Hardest part of the job was leaving the shift. The most enjoyable part was meeting new customers and making them smile!"
good,My supervisor was definitely a hands off manager.  Completely left me alone.  Got very  little training from him but all coworkers were very helpful and experienced
good,Formation continue pendant toutes les années travaillées...appréciation sous forme de badge et monétaire régulièrement...bon travail d'équipe..
good,Working at the Home Depot for 9 years has been somewhat good. The salary was great and the work experience has allowed me to excel with using the computer to do my work.
good,"I learned a lot while working at the Home Depot.  Many of the associates took time to teach me my job which is more than I can say for management or the ridiculous online classes.  "
good,Company is a corporate they hire you to benefit them. You can learn to do anything you want but you can’t expect them to support you when you are really need them for your personal benefit.
good,"Working conditions are high pressure, pay is typical but awful. Hard work but the coworkers and family atmosphere are great. Good store if you can handle retail."
good,I never had any problems with the company as a whole. Your responsibilities are straight forward and manageable. If you want to make it a career be prepared to work lots of hours.
good,"The company has good and bad things to it. It’s a fair place to work at the only way you get fired is by firing yourself, just show up on time and when your supposed to"
good,"Working here was nice because of the people. The ""hiring with in "" concept only relates to you if management likes you not if you're the hardest working."
good,Working in garden it was good but some customers complained to much. Some of them was the best and some plants I didn’t know about and customers was making smart comments.
good,Home depot is great for staff helping each other out. They are a team effort company and if there is a problem there is always help to assist you. A good team player company
good,"Everyone is always willing to teach you something you don't know. there's never really a dull moment, whether it's you diverse group of co-worker or the different kinds of customers that enter the store."
good,"Merchandising Execution Associates (MEAs) perform in-store merchandising service activities such as merchandising projects, planogram maintenance, overhead organization, and display/signage maintenance. MEAs work in teams with on-site supervision, and provide service to multiple departments in the stores. These associates execute approved general bay service, tasking, projects and resets safely, accurately and efficiently. I also change out price labels and update the count on an iteam."
good,Constant telling on each other.  Spying on each other.  Employees hide to avoid helping customers. Constant lieing.  Ppl dont know what they are doing.
good,"This place needs more employees. Its always busy and each section has at least one person, every four aisles. The customers will ask anyone for anything, no matter where you work, and you're on your feet all day."
good,They have a very good work place and associates are well trained for their job . Everyone holds up to their part of the job. Most workers are always busy helping customers in need .
good,"The Home Depot gives the hours you want but is sometimes difficult with flexibility. There are various managers, some of which contribute to the satisfaction of the customers/employees while some don't."
good,That’s what I like when I worked there they stayed giving back to the community they use to have work shop for the kids and have clases for certain thing so u can do the work yourself at home if u needed to and they was really and taking care of the customers
good,"I enjoy the environment The Home Depot has to offer, however it is not the path I need to further my career. I would like more experience in different workplaces. I feel I have skills that are not being explored."
good,"fast learning"
good,company does not consider experience as a main factor when determining advancement opportunities . has been challenging to continue advancement thus considering alternative options outside of home depot
good,I worked overnight from 8p-7a. We usually would break down certain displays for certain companies and install new displays according to Planograms. Our supervisor was understanding and accommodating to unexpected obligations. I feel the pay could have been more due to the extensive labor.
good,"management pretty much sucks and the only thing that is keeping me there is the people"
good,"Great place to work if they chose to pay their specialist more than the retail environment."
good,Work life balance was unsatisfactory.  No set schedule.  Different start and end times each day.  Pay wasn't great either.  Some managers were less than helpful.
good,started off a good place to work but last year went downhill. Lack of scheduled work hrs. yet they were hiring more people! Some department managers were rarely around.
good,"The Home Depot, Inc. is the largest home improvement retailer in the United States,[4] supplying tools, construction products, and services. The company is headquartered at the Atlanta Store Support Center in unincorporated Cobb County, Georgia (with an Atlanta mailing address)."
good,"I joined The Home Depot when I had heard or read that the company helped the community. Wanting something bigger than where I was, I was eager to be a part of this. I was disappointed when it turned into less involved. While I was there, I used all the resources and education they provided and tried to make the most of my time there. The pay was ok for part time, but I didn’t feel I was gaining any ground for advancement."
good,The culture is root deep. The expectation to drive the changes are fast. The best part of my job was learning the diverse systems utilized. The work days are team driven for utmost productivity.
good,"A typical day in the life of an associate at Home Depot is pretty busy, you're always on the go and there is usually always something new that happens each day. The culture and environment are dynamic, you get to know everyone in the store, and you always interact with the customers."
good,"Just like anything in life, it is what you make it.  It is what you bring to it.  It is also who decides to show up and how people treat each other.  So as I said above, it was all kinds of ways"
good,"Good working here, friendly environment good customers and staff working. Nothing bad to say about this job everything was good while working there overall satisfied"
good,"Learned a lot while at the home depot, always busy, liked the customers, coworkers were fun, management only cared about numbers and profit, would go back if i could."
good,"I sold appliances and made them five-hundred thousand dollars within the first year.  However, they couldn't help me with hours.  Forcing me to leave when they would give me excuses why they couldn't give me full time or even close to the hours I would need to pay my bills."
good,"Job to far from residence in the winter, Hours get cut due to seasonal employees, Part time jobs, full time positions take to long to acquire. Team members and managers are very supportive"
good,"if you like a fast paced environment this is a great place to work. you can start your day at 5am and end at 2, or you can close the store and work from 2pm to 11."
good,"I do not personally believe I am paid what I should be at the home depot, I do an awful lot and are not compensated right for how much I do at the home depot"
good,Ok part time job  great training in all areas and depts   Management has a firm grip on trying to promote within before going outside  good chances for advancement
good,I enjoy working with people. Home Depot was a pleasant place to work. They let me learn different departments to help the customers find what the are looking for.
good,"like most jobs, you'll get out of it what you put into it. Your direct superiors will notice your hard work, while other managers will hate on you for personal reasons regardless of how hard you work. Customers are needy but appreciate great service. The best part of my job is seeing complete strangers walk away smiling and completely satisfied by the help they received by my coworkers and myself."
good,"I enjoyed it, it was fun, and simple. The task i was given was explained well. wil always go back if ii can, loved it work went by quick. they made work enjoyable"
good,"good place to work for just the right person.   They promote from within and treat their employees fairly well. The kicker is the pay, they do not pay well at all."
good,"There are hierarchies of dominance in every workplace-as far as I'm concerned, but there needs to be a moral and justifiable mean to keep workers educated instead of providing them with under-handed and biased overview, while managing the various ranks in such enterprise. When you perpetuate dishonesty among the human-beings of the store, it keeps them from achieving their real goals in this capitalist structure, while disabling them of their sense of identity, which insults the United States' history, the constitution, the founding fathers, and what the people (citizens) have fought so hard to achieve (liberty). There always needs to be integrity while conducting yourself, albeit with respect to the majority of the population."
good,The work environment is good and the people are better. It is a great place to work with good benefits and plenty of ways to promote. I worked in shipping.
good,Home depot is a safe company but the management is lacking. I took alot of good safety tips and practices from them.But what i notices each manager has different practices .So it effects your work career.
good,Typical days dealing with customers on a day to day basis.  Lots of patience needed and customer service skills as customers not always easy to deal with.
good,I started working there early 2019 and when I got there it was a mess but when time passed things got better. It's alright I guess. People are outstanding but management could use some people's skills.
good,"It was a fast paced job that you just had to constantly be busy at, like so many other retail jobs at bigger places. ================================="
good,While it is a good company to work for but what pay the associates get is not good at all like its not competitive pay like they described and i been here for nearly 5 years the benifits are good but the pay is whats a downside to being here aside from some bad customers and associates
good,Friendly and inviting place to work.  Co-workers generally are very helpful and accommodating when needed.  It is always interesting interacting with new and exciting customer.  You even get gift cards when customers leave positive reviews about your service.
good,"Loved working for The Home Depot, but it was very hard to maintain a work/life balance as a salaried associate. I would recommend working here if you able to be very flexible in your personal life."
good,"Go in to work, help any customers that are in your ""area of expertise,"" aka aisle, and then go back to facing the shelves or restocking, or walking around doing nothing."
good,"Working at the Home Depot is a rather easy job, as long as you do what you were hired to do you'll have a job for life. The advancement opportunities are far and few inbetween at the smaller locations, however if your open to transferring, the possibilities are endless. Overall the company is a good one minus the few issues that can be fixed with time & repetition."
good,"They don’t pay well . They don’t take care of people who’s been working there for a long time."
good,bleh it sucks really . you can move up quickly but at the same time youll only move up as fast as they want you too. it seems like they'll dangle a carrot but it isn't achievable.
good,Favorable work place. However I was interested in better opportunities & a chance to make more money. So I resigned to search for better a more ideal Job position
good,It is focused on employees. Activities were planned to help employees and encourage them. Would rather promote within the company instead of going outside of the company.
good,If you're a picker your job is to assemble whatever is ordered online onto a pallet or put into the picking station for others to give to the receiving party. Unless you have previous experience dont expect the greatest pay.
good,"Great company. Good values. Great pay. Benifits are awesome, the schedule is great the time off is good and paid holidays and overtime offered. Overall a good place to work"
good,"This was a positive work environment. The store was clean and I enjoyed my time and employment here. I wanted to find something with a possibility of advancement and more available hours but overall it was a good place to work. I was thankful for the opportunity and would recommend this company ,"
good,"the home depot is a great place to work if you are in the right store. Management is very poor and selfish. Well most managers are clowns. And my department head manager doesn't do squat for the department, to the point where I think I'm the department manager. He would leave us do his work where it's above our pay grade. Once he sees a associate that works for the department don't expect to see him for the next few hours. or even for the rest of the entire day. My department head is a clown. The job was fine and most of my co workers were great to work with. Some of the most nicest people you'll ever meet. Great benefits but better if you're a full timer. Hours are difficult to gain if you want full time. And if you have a shift outside your availability you will get a write up if you don't show up. Even though you weren't suppose to work that day or shift. In general if you are a hard worker you won't get the appreciation you deserve and the lazy guys will stay."
good,In all it was a good starting job but I’d rather do something with cars which I love. The hours were decent and helped out if you were a part time student
good,"lazy managers are the main reason i quit. often times i would be left to fend for myself when helping customers, such as loading mulch into a person vehicle"
good,Worked here during my senior year in HS. They were very accommodating with my schedule. Commute was very convenient and staff was helpful during my training
good,home depot was a good place to work but hours were being cut and the job just wasn’t making ends meet anymore would had loved to stayed but it wasn’t working out good
good,Typical day of work was in the lumber department making sure wood was straight and made cuts for customers. Working for customer service making sure the customer was served.
good,"Nice place for a retail business, they are eager to get better at what they do and customer-focused environment. A lot of treats at the workplace and supportive colleagues and average management."
good,I enjoyed my position and customers.  I did not like the unprofessionalism of most workers and the unstructured unorganized unqualified managers of certain people who should not have had those types of positions.
good,A typical day at the Home Depot included engaging with customers to help them find what hey needed as well as restocking items on the floor. I learned many new ideas revolving around home goods and needs. I too was involved in driving the forklift to handle special orders. Management was not the best as the managers had little to no engagement and were poorly at delivering a message as a team.
good,"It's a great first company to work with but management has alot of favoritism. Maybe it's just this location in work at but other then management, it's a great first job"
good,"Fast past very very busy, product knowledge is key. Management is poor, lots of favorites. Hardest part was the customers. Mostly rude. Best part was the workers and atmosphere"
good,"lack hour and work, the management does not care, either you work hard, only care the sale. and some fellow co-worker associate lazy, if their not someone monitor like manager, this fellow associate specially outside work loaded and unloaded associate the are lazy. specially sale event, this people are lazy"
good,Home Depot is a good company to work for.  Sometimes it can be very stressful because of poor scheduling and lack of support from management but when it is slow it is pretty chill.
good,When I first started working there I like it but as time passed. I come to find out that it is all about politics. And who the favorite are get promoted
good,It was okay but all departments get paid the same but definitely aren’t doing the same amount of work so it isn’t really fair but other than that it was okay
good,"decent place good benefits Work as a team with fellow employees to assist customers with all their flooring questions, measurements, and needs for their projects. Help customers select flooring to meet their budget and exceed their expectations. Provide home services for customers looking to get the job done from a licensed pro. I was the recipient of multiple awards and bonuses for excellent customer service and hard commited work."
good,"This is a great place to work and I've learned a lot since working for them, the hardest part is knowing the products because there are so many to choose from."
good,I learned a lot while I worked at Home Depot and my manager was very direct and honest with me. He was easy to work with and workload was never overbearing. Your time at Home Depot is what you make it.
good,"Job was great, enjoyed my time working there. Worked with store management on daily store changes.  Really enjoyed using my hands on projects. Working within a group made the workday feel less complicated."
good,"When I got in I had to do all the boxes in outside garden so that's about 40 to 100 boxes every night. Then after that it was garden recovery and with that I had to do the stocking and fronting of the fertilizer, concentrate tiles, and pebbles. Not to mention that I had to do all that by myself. That was only half of the stuff I had to do before the store opened."
good,"i wish there were more full time options available, the management needs improvement and more options open for available positions other than that a great place"
good,Hard work for the unloaders then you have to do the double the work when the over night crew doesn't do their job. the team gets in trouble for not finishing the work because we have to back track everyday.
good,"Company provides a good work environment, comprehensive and hands on training, room for career advancement, with good benefits and possibility of good compensation."
good,"Was a fast paced environment. For the work we did the pay could have been better. Most of time had to multitask and work in different departments. Did enjoy the team I work with, everyone did their job."
good,"Good work environment and company policies, pay is not competitive enough to be able to afford even a cheap apartment in the Springs. Management does not always provide helpful feedback and makes you feel unvalued."
good,"Its a great place to work if you are an associate, but being part of the management team comes with a price  inconsistant schedule and basically no home work life balance which adds to stress"
good,Based on the location there is always as issue with maintaining people in the position.  Where I worked there was a high turnover because it was a very rich area and there was not enough employees to fill the position because people did not need the job.  HD should examine salary based on location of stores.  Higher the economic growth in area the more should be paid to keep employees
good,"Schedule always messed up. expect you to know more and more info, include use of equipment with out an increase in pay.Always have to work a weekend and Holidays."
good,It’s a job. Nothing really to report. The culture at some locations is very toxic. I honestly don’t recommend working here for longer than a couple years.
good,Homedepot was a good second job I just found a bettter place to work it’s been so long sense I worked there I don’t really remember to many details.. it’s a good temp job
good,Started on freight team then moved up thru depts and finally became a key carrier mgr on duty..opening and closing store with alarm access and vault access them new manager came in and promoted someone else as salary manager after I was promised.
good,I was making $10 an hour and only working about 25 hours a week. Still came home with a decent sized check. Managers were strict and as a cashier if it was a slow day they would make you work the lot.
good,I enjoyed my role as a designer. I had reached the salary ceiling for my role and had no other creative direction to move within my store. At the time I was unable to relocate.
good,"I will say that this job will teach you a lot of useful skills for other jobs; time management, customer service skills, how to find information on things quickly, using custom computer systems, etc. I can't recommend it as an end all be all job though. Even though they make it very easy to move up if you want to, it just gets continually less fulfilling as you climb."
good,"I can honestly say you will learn new things working in different departments.  But part-time workers are not appreciated as much as they should be. Also, head management has communication issues."
good,The home depot wasnt the worst because you learn a lot from it but managers are constantly pressuring you to finish work faster so you can do it before your shift is over and not giving more hours then get written up if you dont finish
good,At the store I was at the management was not the best. Not very professional. While I was there they cut peoples house to get out of having to offer benefits.
good,the hardest part of the job is when a customer comes in angry and taking out on you. working at the customer service desk you have to multitask. making sure the online orders are pulled and stage in the right place. making sure the special orders are ready to get pick up by the customers
good,Started off great until the micromanagement and favoritism. After a while I realized I can only progress as much as managers allow. I communicated with management and they advised me I was where they needed me and should just wait until they decided to train me more. The people were amazing but the pay isn’t worth the workload and lack of respect and care the company have for employees.
good,"nothing good or bad to say , pretty ok company its retail so not much to expect. Some favoritism but I think that how it is in most places, this store was ok"
good,Fast paced friendly customers friendly co-workers good computer system sometimes good supervisors easy to do like self checkout in the most sometimes help out in paint
good,"Great as a start up place to work with retail. Not great if you'd like a consistent means to support cost of living if you are not full time.During the winter, the shifts are minimal. It is recommended to have a second job to support yourself."
good,it's a good company but they have bad managers that are not following the companies policies. they have a good culture and they take care of employees but favoritism is everywhere
good,Home Depot is a good job for younger individuals to start to get to know how the work life is and what some jobs may expect of you and how to deal with customer service
good,"long shift hours for part time, safety courses given, good learning opportunities, it is a very physical job, it gets very dry on the floor in winter months"
good,A good steady job to work in. Environment is normal long as you keep working and doing things by the book you should be fine. Nice place to make some cash
good,A very fun Fast past place to work. home depot demenstrated that working with a team is always fun and the importants of safety. a good company to exspand and move up in and to try to reach a managment position.
good,"Not a friendly environment.  No help in training from management."
good,"Friendly working environment. Decent pay. Just scheduling is off, they don't schedule you around your schedule, just when they need you. Horrible ""coaches"" rude & treat u like your 5!!"
good,No full- time work.  Management is always so stressed trying to hit the goals given to them.  It took to long to see how the company really was. Hours were always cut.
good,"nothing really wrong with the home depot, people did seem to talk a lot which bothered me, was short-handed a good amount of times but overall the job wasn't half bad"
good,A normal day you downstock and you help customers rushingbetween both to keep your outs as low as possible. management is somewhat helpful but usually if you need help your forgotten about and let to struggle by yourself. work place culture is usually your own small group of co workers that you work with the best.
good,"You will learn time management, costumer service skills, troubleshooting skills, and you will be in great shape depending on the position. Over all this job takes dedication."
good,Was not the best working armosphere.  You work bad paying not worth the effort for what you're paid. Look elsewhere for work. Unless its all you can get
good,"Management changes all the time. Company will overwork you and pay is not on the same scale has work. They say they have flexible hours, do not believe them. It is very hard to get days off with HD."
good,"It's an okay job. Nothing worth staying for. No real money in it, only if you're the head honcho. It's boring and becomes high school drama job after awhile."
good,"Did work to help customers find what they needed and to keep inventory on shelves in a neat and organized manner. It was a job that offered little benefits, that a part time employee could afford, or the obtainment of being a 40 hour-a-week employee."
good,I star working at outbound and them i move to carbill and them i learned how to work and fluids i was running all tree possion  and a was good experience worked at Home Depot
good,Home Depot is just about like any other retail job. You have a responsibility to your work and the customers. The culture is welcoming but management needs improvement.
good,Once again upper management not in sync with times expect floor personnel to be  lead generators as well as specialize in their field of expertise within the store not putting themselves in the positions of the sales people or floor personnel lack of training in areas expertise in customer service
good,"I started off part time and was allowed Sundays off, as requested. However, when I was increased to full time, they completely took away my right to Sundays off - without any warning at all. I work and am available every other day of the week, not really sure what the issue is with not being able to have one scheduled day off for personal issues."
good,"I loved my time at the distribution center. The leadership and other fellow associates were great to work around. The workload and pay were both above average as well. The store I worked at was almost a complete opposite. They were missing sales goal, the place was disorganized and the manager is a poor leader."
good,"In my review i will give my opinion about a typical day at work , what I learned, management, workplace culture, the hardest part of the job, and the  most enjoyable part of the job"
good,"A typical work day consisted of prepping the store, assisting the customers and sometimes even associates. Depending on your department the typical work day would be too overwhelming for one person to get all of the work done in the time span they are at work, no matter the department."
good,The hours always varied.  Department pro desk was my last assignment.  Too many weekends to work and have to work evening and late hours.  The distance from home did not justify the pay.
good,Same stuff each day  has opportunity for learning cross job within building.  Some don't do much work while others are busy busy.  Store probably better
good,its a cool place to work. apply and give it a shot and try. bonus checks every 6months health insurance and all its a great company just all depends on who managing the location
good,They company is ok but some managers needs to treat everyone equally and they company still flow good and they have a great pay rate problem of the top warehouse pay
good,Loved working there but they were not willing to give me more hours and My bills and landlord dont want to hear that my job wont give me full time they'll look at me and tell me get another job
good,"Overall working here was decent. I felt as though my hourly rate was cut unfairly at the start of 2019. Most of my co-workers were fun to work with and talk too. Management was average I suppose, it felt as if not all the managers cared much about the associates. I never felt much of a work friendly connection with majority of the managers. It felt as though some of the managers expected the world out of the associates but were not willing to help us out at all."
good,"If you are any part of management  there is no work life balance. Loved the job working with associates and customers was great. Always short staffed. Because it such a busy place, to give customer service to the level which they need and complete daily task almost impossible. Mangers change often and every time they change its like starting over.  Overall can be a great place depending on management staff."
good,Morning meetings and then it's off to work. Customers are in the aisles as soon as the doors open. Keeping the shelves stocked and good customer service goes a long way.
good,"The Home Depot is great place to start your career path."
good,If you work at a coporate office you can always move up. If you work Ina store less pay and more stress. Each are is very different. Very unprofessional on store level
good,Like anywhere else you go to work they'll sell you the dream. Except at The Home Depot they sell it hard! You give your all and it seldom gets reciprocated. The pay is fair but in the end it's just a job and not a career. You're an expendable number and not a person.
good,Enjoyed working a Home Depot. I was only a seasonal employee but enjoyed my job. Great people to work with everyday. product knowledge and great customer service.
good,Home Depot is a great place to work.Only negative point is do not depende on them to transfer you to another store.I gave them 7 weeks to transfer me and got hosed
good,"I enjoyed working at Home Depot. Scheduling is a bit of a concern, but hopefully they'll get it worked out for you. That was my only issue working at Home Depot."
good,"While the work load can be stressful, you can find wonderful people ready and willing to lend a hand. Focus and time management are key if you hope to make a good impression."
good,"Its usually an enjoyable work culture and good people in the job, however, there are a few set backs that severely dampen the jobs benefits"
good,Dirty corrupt company to work for. Look to fire and catch employees by setting them up with traps so that they get fired. The associate is not important.
good,Home Depot has good organization skills as far as keeping their employees up to date on all levels .   I liked working for Home Depot it is a fast pace environment
good,Productive and fast paced environment dealing with customers and daily lift truck responsibilities. Most enjoyable part is there is always something to do and management is fair to everyone.
good,Good job just not enough people. It was a good physical work out. The people are great and fun.need to have level head and be patient. Good pay. Flexible hours.
good,All co-workers great to work with. Not enough staff available at this store. The hardest part of the job is not having enough support throughout the entire store.
good,Overall working at home depot was okay. Management was below average. Friendliness of other staff members also below average. Overall Below average...
good,Its a good job for someone who is starting. Just need a change and the people are great there to work with. I am an OFA and started out in the plumbing area.
good,Have great association with each other could use a little more training ro start. As a cost-effective home repair outlet. Rhe home service could be a bit better
good,The environment is inviting and the staff is knowledgable and supportive. The managing staff is available for questions and concerns throughout the day. You will receive an abundance of hands-on training.
good,"As a sales associate you may have to deal with any kind of person any time, regardless of how pleasant or not they may be. Pretty basic job description, pay and responsibility. You always have an opportunity to learn about product knowledge and safety procedures. This can be a fun place to work and learn."
good,Average job. Wasn't anything special at the home depot. Understanding staff and seemed to be very reliable week to week. Delivery as a whole is underappreciated and overworked.
good,"Got this job as a temp job while looking for a real job in my field. Working night shifts isn't as bad as people think, but it does put a hamper on your social life and makes scheduling appointments and running errands a hassle when you sleep until mid afternoon after getting off around 6am. Main problem is that the work is easy and you might get too cozy working here, and before you know it you'll have ended up working here for a couple years, and with the pay being too low, you won't have anything to show for it. Good to work just as a part-time or temp job, but don't get too settled unless you don't mind making around 30k a year average.One thing to note is you can get free forklift and reach truck training, in case you want to use that experience for an operator job down the road."
good,Definitely a fun job to work at when youre not busy helping customer after customer after customer in often understaffed work areas. The work can be almost overwhelming.
good,Slow paced. Not busy in florida unless there is a hurricane coming.  Does not promote from within. Hires from the street. Would not work for this company again.
good,"I,am still a employed at home depot but planning on getting a new job . It has been alright working there but its not were I want to stay at . The people are great just looking for something diffrent."
good,"I loved the work I did while I worked here, and had fun for the most part. I was told at the beginning of getting hired they would work with me on my schedule since I was a single parent, they have since gone back on their word and have now given me an ultimatum that I have to work even when I have my kid and no one to watch them or I need to look else where for a job."
good,"I liked it. Overall, it was a solid job to work while in college. Somewhat flexible with the schedule but they had good pay. Management was supportive as well"
good,The management isn't great and hopefully you don't have any you have to handle with HR. The works okay if you just have to stock the shelves because the time goes quickly. The air is off in the summer at night
good,"Overall, Home Depot is a great place to work. My particular store is currently going through some short staffing issues, but at it's best it's an enjoyable high energy place of employment."
good,"productive nice drive competitive pay breaks are perfect, hourly pay is a little above average for savannah ga, working for home depot was a great experience"
good,"as you begin working it feels very easy to adjust to the new environment, but customers are what make the job suck the most. management expects a lot from their minimum wage employees. And there is a point system that attendance is based off of ( recently an employee of 3 years was fired for not having any sick hours when she called off work). Even department leads don't get paid for being there for years. one of my coworkers barely gets paid a dollar more than part time employees and he's been here for about 14 years."
good,...Homedepot is all there here these those well okay now well here is to the people at the stores of all the home depots no store discounts they have things from other compnay sometimes
good,Productive workplace with an excellent learning process. I worked there for 2 years and got promoted in that time. I learned many things about the construction industry.
good,"Handled 40-60 Tier 1 and Tier 2 support calls per day, guided callers through problem resolution, managed open tickets, escalated when appropriate, and shared insights and information to fellow team members. > Documented all pertinent end user identification information, including the nature of the problem, and resolution steps within the ServiceNow ticketing system with great detail that lead to perfect monitoring scores."
good,This was just a standard type of job as a laborer working in about 3 departments. I enjoyed interacting with the employees as well as the customers. I worked much of the time loading up peoples purchases or helping them locate the items they were shopping for.
good,"Anyone is allowed to apply, and doing so is simple.  They don't even mind if you don't have work experience, since they're one of those companies that provides on-the-job training.  Just tell them you're available any time, and they'll get you started.  (Although, getting promoted and working in the lot are kind of questionable.)"
good,Horrible management. Hard to move up in the company without sucking up. Long hours and no recognition at the job. No flexibility for scheduling. Good luck.
good,"Management was always very supportive of their employees and treated them with the utmost respect. Extensive customer service training, and always new things to learn. Always something to do while at work"
good,Different jobs in the departments have different needs. Being flexible to change is a must. Slow downs in sales mean that you will have time off without pay.
good,for the amount of work they expected from the employees did not match the pay. The managers were rude and had a lot of favoritism. overall the employees were nice and respectful
good,Not too bad but needs improvement. I am really not interested in writing a review. benefits were good. pay was not good enough for all the heavy work that all the employees di
good,"Good company to work for, hours can be little difficult on some people, starting early, then closing the next day or closing one day and starting early the next, weekends are typical."
good,Management and other associates are very helping and careful. I would be outside 90% of my day and management would bring me water and most of the times food.
good,"Was a fun place to work, Did need to work on the hours that staff had. They were not steady in your hours making it harder for those with constant bills to make ends meet."
good,"I work cs on-line orders, at times this can be very stressful. "
good,its a fun place to work. everyone is nice. the can work around your hours. you meet so many people working there. always have hours for you to work...
good,A typical day at work involves giving quotes or cashing out our Pro customers with product that they need to start or finish their projects. Working at the Pro Desk has given me more product knowledge to insure our  Pro customers have the best but also finding different resources for them if we don't have what they are looking for. This is a fast pace environment where we try to give the best customer service in a fast and timely manner.
good,Working  here  was  hard  work but at the end of the day pays good. I was genuinely shocked how well I was treated while working here would recommend.
good,"The management of Home Depot can improve. Salary can improve. Flexible hours."
good,"On the job training."
good,The company doesn’t always acknowledge hard work of an associate. If you fall into a department where your supervisor doesn’t even know what to do there is little support.
good,"this job was ok it could be alittle bit more aware on who they hire, in my opinion they just hire anyone they see fit the job. some of the mangers were rude. really didn't care about us"
good,This is a great first time job for people who are looking for just a summer job or seasonal. I worked 3 years there and it was stressful sometimes they did not pay very well good benefits though.
good,"I would like to write a long review but not too much to say. It is somewhat ambiguous in what you have to do because of the your duty."
good,"Overall it's a decent place to work. But, management doesn't communicate with each other thus making problems with supervisors and associates. The store I work add is like a family atmosphere, everyone seems to get along and for the most put doesn't mind working together to provide great customer service."
good,Flexible work schedules great diversity in company high focus on safety got to get it done kind of work being a team player is the key goal to getting stuff done
good,"worked here for almost 2 years and I met my husband here, I got to know great friends but overall the company can use improvements with the schedules."
good,Working at the home depot changes with each and every store you may work at. The Pro desk is fun place but very stressful is metrics are not reach and if your store manager does not pay attention to that side of the building.
good,Management no longer provided support after I submitted my resignation.  I had a line of customers waiting for help.  When I called (5 different numbers)  for loading help for a customer there was no response. Customers were livid.  I walked out.  This was not something I enjoyed.  Not my style
good,As a merchandiser we plan a lot of projects to manage before deadline. We drive the sale for store with right merchandising.team work is the key to finish projects on time.
good,"Good environment and co workers.  Recognition from management , encouragement, sometime career advancement.  Updated training on a regular basis.  Helpful when inquiring assistance for a customer most times."
good,"There are pros and cons at every job. I would say there are areas for improvement, but they have good points too. I would say this is a good starter job."
good,"It’s pretty self explanatory, this was my only problem. But it is retail after all so it’s understandable. If they didn’t over work you it’d be fine and I’d say the inability of managers to fire lazy associates who refuse to work."
good,Good part time or entry level career. Good job to gain experience in customer service. The employees were all nice and became friends. M. Management was not too strictS
good,"There is favoritism and little cliques, qualifying for FMLA takes too long, and obtaining a FT can sometimes take a tenured employee 2-3 years. Other than that, it's a fairly easy job and if you're a people person, love to help, are winning to learn and posses patience, you can grow with the company and move up."
good,"Management was implimenting policies that were not intuitive or employee friendly, stressing employees- especially those in my department. The environment was very open and friendly but overall the work was a stressful attempt at trying to get the impossible done in a short time span."
good,Had to unload delivery truck stock shelves clean shelves tell items that needed to be tagged stop what didn't fit on shelves clean back Freight room for heading home
good,I didn't like management at Home Depot the benefits with good. If you're young and want to start out it with a company that would be a good company to work for
good,"Did not mind working there as staff, seems to be rough on middle managers though  Would work there again in benefits, more pay and fulll time   plan to  contact"
good,"Home Depot on the daily had its ups and downs. Just like any job, I dealt with many angry customers. Was called out of my name several times, but i managed to keep it professional, calm, and collected. It's understandable that people may be going through a rough day and I was there to ring them up and keep the line moving, but i also came across some wonderful people, so it balanced out. One thing that was bother some was feeling unrecognized for the hard work and effort I put in to my work everyday. However, the workers there were amazing and great people to work with."
good,"it was a nice experience..i loved the people i was working with..i learned a lot from my supervisor chanel,tracey and monique. it also had great benefits."
good,"They really work people too hard for little pay.  Saw some harassment that was reported.  Home Depot in my opinion is a job for someone in high school that just needs a part time job, and to gain work experience."
good,Always put customers first and work hard wether you get noticed or not always provide good service. Work in more than just one department so you can be a team player and be able to help out when short stuffed.
good,My typical day at work was to help customers find products or use equipment such as forklift to transport lumber and other heavy materials. When customers needed help moving heavy equipment onto their trucks or cars I would assist them by hand or by forklift depending on the weight of the products.
good,"I worked hard and made a difference in the community and sold and explain merchandise use, greeted all customers and developed good relationships with customers."
good,Although the other workers were full of drama i enjoyed my time there i left because they didn’t want to change my schedule for school if i could i would go back there again.
good,"I learned how to talk more effectively to customers and how to be more sympathetic/empathetic of their problems that I helped them solve. I enjoyed the problem solving aspect of the job, but with the amount this company pays, and how often my average weekly hours fluctuate.. I feel that they expect too much of their associates and put too much pressure on them to maintain the store, pro selling product, and product knowledge of the various departments."
good,"The peers I worked with made the job. All from diverse backgrounds; young and old, different ethnicities, genders and sexual preferences, and driven to help customers.  Seems like the corporate culture is getting diluted daily. The company has gone from customer service based (take care of the customers tasks will get done) to matrix driven as trying to quantify customer service with production analysis (taking care of the tasks will result in customer service)."
good,"If you are willing to work your way up, opportunities abound for the right candidate to obtain a lifelong career. However, must be extremely adaptable and highly efficient to keep up with workload demand."
good,"Amazing staff and for the most part a great place to work. "
good,"Great experience, great moral, opportunities, fun place to work , care for the community, always giving back to the community.. great customer service"
good,"nice play to work with lots of freedom, management is friendly, staff was nice, lints of retire which is frustrating, sometimes don't want to work but mostly a nice place"
good,When the leadership is focused they can do a lot of work together as a team by them selves. Overall the job experiance  was great. I enjoyed my time there.
good,I love and appreciate almost everyone I worked with. It really had a family environment there but management took a completely different turn this past year and I truly hope they fix it out of respect for the employees and all they do for them and the customers. I know they can do better because I've seen them do it.
good,I would not suggest anyone work at Home Depot unless its your last choice. Even though the benefits are great it’s a very stressful environment to work in especially if you Cashier. If applying please apply for a department.
good,Enjoyed coworkers and the management. Easy going as long as you did your job. Stayed busy and the day went by fast. They give breaks which is nice after unloading the trucks.
good,Dept sup oversees associate and operation of dept regular 8 hour schedule paid time off and closed on 2 holidays a year. Accused vacation plan.  Great benefits.
good,A typical day is 8 to 5 standard. Majority of workers are on site. Some travel to stores or DC's. Learned little about industry and more about how the company runs it's business from an entry level perspective.
good,Working at the lilburn Home Depot was ok. I enjoyed my co-workers and the pay wasn’t bad! I would recommend this job to anyone who doesn’t mind hard work and helping people.
good,"Everyone gets along well"
good,I worked basically a second shift. Unload trucks 3-4 times a week. After truck is unloaded we would start pulling carts to floor to starting the stocking process.
good,Great coworkers but store manager wanted you to do more than just your job making it hard to get what you needed done and they need better management training because the just promote anyone that don't know how to talk to people or have mood swings like crazy
good,"Some Home Depot’s have their favorite employees, and they treated them better. But I would just to work and do what I was supposed to do. The pay was great."
good,"good people. management can be power hungry and a bit mean, but that's retail. learned how to work hard and as part of a team. The hardest part of the job was working in the texas heat."
good,More managers use their position to abuse their power and are really rude to the employees. They treat you like children and expect way too much when you have to cover an entire department by yourself.
good,"long days, was left alone on floor in seasonal for almost an hour"
good,"Working at The Home Depot has enabled me to acquire a lot of knowledge on how to do things on my on and also how to take care of customers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers and even that was easy and satisfying. Everyday I would clock in and make sure the store's floor is safe for customers to shop , then see if customers in the area are in need of assistance . If not then i would proceed into cleaning up my department or doing returns to allow customers to shop on filled shelves."
good,Overall had a great experience working at The Home Depot. I started working not know much about home improvement stuff so I have learned a lot. I was always interested in learning more. When customer would have questions I didn’t know I would seek help and stick around so I would also get informed. Management was so helpful easy to talk to. They would always work with you. They work with school schedules they were able to help me get my schedule so I can drop off and pick up my daughter from school
good,Great store to learn things but less than average management and less than average co-workers. You develop communication skills and also the work isn’t hard.
good,"I was a lot associate at the Alhambra Home Depot, the management was good. Particularly some managers had your back other not so much. They would expect to much they would give you a dirty look for taking a 2-3 min break for drinking water. Some days such as in the summer time it was really hot, they give us power aids. Hardest part of the job was you couldn't move up unless you became someones pet. It's great for college students such as myself because they work with school schedules but, living wise pay is lower than majority of Home Depots."
good,"they start new associates at minimum wage. they always seem understaffed. the work load and expectations are not always realistic. good for a ""first job"". not a long term career"
good,The Home Depot is a good place for a part time job.  I am not sure how people can survive on the base salary.  It would be better to have a better hours wage.
good,Was a good place to work.  Employees were treated fairly.  Always had food catered for doing well during a quarter.  Training was not done very well.  I didn't receive training right away.
good,was a fun job at first with good co workers and managers.  as years went on promotions happened and new people started taking over. became a very irritating company to work for and  I am glad I left.
good,Working with a lot of other veterans learned more stuff having a couple liscence to make my job much easier and quicker for the customers to receive there product in the over head
good,its great being able to help a customer with their home project. some customers are more difficult than others. I did not like working retail. the hours were random.
good,Home Depot has very good incentives for their employees however it’s a very short staffed company and you work very hard always on you toes they pay wasn’t that great but a cool place to work if your a hard worker and trying to get on your feet
good,Es un lugar donde puedes tener estabilidad laboral
good,"This place of home Depot is a okay place to work, it's just the management is terrible and they don't know how to talk to people and sometimes don't care about nobody but themselves."
good,The company has many different areas so there so no typical day because many times you will work at different things. The management is good and is willing to help employees with problems and training. The work culture is diverse and the job can be enjoyable if you like working with people.
good,"Co-workers were good to work with, make it a very enjoyable place to"
good,great place to work. not very easy to get full time hours. amount of hours per week were not very consistent. bi-weekly pay which seems to be the norm for most places now.
good,The atore manager was bias didn't have a chance. Of advancing would go back to another home depor depending on the store mamager overall the company takes great care of its employees you can find a career in the Home depor
good,"A lot of benefits going with the inconvenients of big corporations. As a merchandising employee you have to follow global plans that sometimes can't be applied in the context so you had to do and redo multiple times the same work. there was also an obvious lack of communication for a so big company. Even if they have pretty good company values, there are defended or not depending on the manager of the store and his team."
good,"If you need a job they will hire you. I don’t know how long it will take you to get a raise, or promotion. I do see a lot of different age groups and races."
good,"Great work life balance, fun people to work with, fantastic hours. Pay could be better. Teaching other people how to complete P.O.P projects................................................"
good,"While Home Depot can provide pretty secure employment, it is also a revolving door kind of place because of the methodologies. In addition, standing on concrete and manual labor are required which can be difficult on your body."
good,"It's an alright place to work. Very strict on attendance. No matter what the excuse, don't be late or absent, they don't care. They feed you like crazy. When you're forced to work holidays, they provide meals and treats etc. to try to make the day a little better."
good,"- Flexible Schedule"
good,It used to be better when i first started.  Management has become messy . They enforce rules when it's convenient. And they reward the same people over and over.  There are good benefits as far as 401k and stock and insurance. but the day to day is draining and sometimes just stressful . Just a few of my coworkers make it worthwhile to come in everyday.
good,They didn't help me in any way. The promoted me to supervisor and didn't really give me any help or training. Didn't give me the right people to be in that department
good,"Management is great, but the floor managers have some problems, anger issues stressed out and over worked, I believe. But they all do it volunteering. So they are intentional like that, and even if you leave with good standing, you'll never work for the call center again."
good,"I worked there for 3 years. After 6 months the manager of my department stated I had management qualities. After a year being there , I put in for a lead position and was told I would get an interview several times and that never happened. Management always dangled the carrot in front of you , but there was no follow through."
good,"Depends greatly on your position.  They pay a little higher than most retailers.  you will be on your feet on concrete all day.  They never have enough help and they never will, it is just the nature of retail.  If you are in management you will be paid pretty well."
good,"Learned a lot "
good,Enjoyed working @ home depot - friendly atmosphere - worked well with other employees - made working there fun - the job was challenging @ times - was fun
good,"The job wasn’t too bad. Nice people, nice coworkers. Management was not able to work with me, as far as scheduling. Typical big corporation, trying to hit goals and quotas."
good,"Excelente para estudiantes, empresa incluyente...."
good,"It was an okay paying job. If you need work apply. "
good,"The Home Depot is a great company to work for, it was just my time to move on also make sure your not scared to speak up if you feel your not getting the right attention you need."
good,"Home Depot is a decent place to work for my first job. However, I would not want to make a full career out of it. Typical retail job experience comes from helping customers with their needs and providing information/services for them. Specifically informing them on anything involving paint and paint-related items. It is a hassle to get management to listen excluding a select few, and they often push work that they are supposed to do on to sales associates. I know this is probably similar to other jobs and for my first job I don't hate it completely as I learned a lot about customer service and being a salesperson. Yet, I would never want to make a career in this company unless it was a higher position"
good,worked with good people. if you want too you can learn alot. was a awesome part time job. really enjoyed night shift. learned alot about life. my manager was great but some of the others i heard not good things
good,"The Home Depot will hire anyone, high turn over and lack of experienced staff is the norm. It’s not difficult to get a job there and keep it, low wages and very small and infrequent raises allow making ends meet impossible in most areas. Home Depot is great for young people or part timers and retirees but I don’t recommend getting stuck there, unless you become an assistant manager don’t expect to make more than $16/$17 an hour."
good,Homedepot is a fast paste environment. But it has many departments where you can learn how to operate machines. And its a fun place to work with many employers to get skills and learn from
good,Sadly the job was okay but paid very little and management was not very professional. I was told about opportunities after someone  else was hired for the position .The ngiht shift manager enjoyed making her employees feel uptight and liked to yell at us in front of other store workers
good,i want to move up but i feel like im being held back.... but it could be fixed if management was more inspired. Other than that i love the environment enstilled.
good,"Empresa muy buena, mala administración de personal no hablan claro al momento de tu contratación y no obtienes estabilidad laboral"
good,a place to work with no set schedule and it does not matter how good of a worker you are you cannot move up in the company its very hard to pay your bills
good,Don't train you nearly enough for the questions you are bound to get from customers. Learn to BS a customer or flat out tell them you havent been trained enough
good,Home Depot has been a good place to work because it has given me opportunities to grow in ways I didn't know I needed to grow. both mentally and physically. I grow mentally because of my co-workers and how the workplace back and forth goes between me and my fellow associates. I've had to grow physically to get the job done quickly and efficiently.
good,"I will say this is a good place to work fellow employees were great to be around, only downfall is I didn’t feel appreciated as an employee. Would accomplish things quickly and didn’t get the recognition. Would just be told to move on to the next thing."
good,Good place to work I enjoy working there but it not somewhere I see my self working for a very long time. I don’t know what kind of environment they try to give but it’s sometime a really fast pace.
good,"Home Depot had great employees working there. However, the management really drained your blood and tried to micromanage everything. If it was not for management and strict attendance policies it would have been a more pleasant experience."
good,"Regular hours"
good,There's not much to learn from the depot. its a whole lot repetition work. The hardest part about working at the depot was working in inbond. the most enjoyable part about working there was forklift driving. becasue while driving the heat wasn't too bad. working at the depot in the winter sucks. like it was honestly awefull i believe i got sick from it.
good,Worked at the service desk. Very stressful at times. Had to help customers with their returns and sometimes their purchases. You have to be able to deal with all different types of people and sometimes you had to take their abuse for things that were not even your fault.
good,"This places helps you with your leadership skills, your growth as a team player. And it has extremely good benefits. You get to learn about a lot appliances, plumbing,construction, etc if you don't already."
good,Friendly people decent management other than having to run back and forth across the store to load customers at diffrent doors it was a pretty relaxing place
good,I feel overall Home Depot is a very good company to work for a lot of it depends on you as a person you go there and work and they will treat you respectfully
good,I was night shift MET wasn't too bad. I work four 10 hour shifts a week and had 3 days off. You stay busy for the most part doing little projects as well as doing full resets.
good,"Customer service, build customers base through friendliness"
good,you are always walking or standing and you cant sit down if you have nothing to do. if you aren't used to standing and walking for hours straight then it might take some time to adjust but once you do its not that bad.
good,"The Home Depot is a consistent place to work.  I recommend this company for individuals who are young or in the retirement.  However, the opportunity to grow a become part of upper management exists."
good,"Good place to learn multiple things about home improvement, hectic workload and multiple shift changes. Co-workers are usually the best people to learn from, be it the simplest things to the most complex of work related issues"
good,Coworkers are awesome but some of the customers are horrific! They make you just want to walk out and never come back. Benefits are above average. At least some managers back you up against the nuts.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job were the other employees because if you do not like who you work with than the place would be dull. I do enjoy my time at the Home Depot because it has shown me certain skills that I did not possess prior to being hire. I do believe that i will use these skills in the future.
good,Managment isnt the best. As long as you have good customer service and problem solving skills then this job is pretty good. Great tuition reimbursement program
good,The coworkers in your store are the reason most people stay at the company. Most are willing to help other employees when they are in need. Culture created at the company.
good,"Every day starts with the inventory routine of scan, review, and correct. I have learned more on how the business operates, and how individuals can affect the bottom line. Management is good at assisting when there are issues beyond the associate capabilities. The culture of the store has always been great by taking care of their people. The most difficult part of the job is the amount of work with low pay. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking with people and helping them with their needs."
good,Good place to work to gain experience.  Overall good company to work for and great benefit.  Can grow well in the company.  Can be stressful but can learn to manage
good,"I started Home Depot at the Lumber department and I learned a lot about the material. There was nothing problematic with the lumber department, but the supervisor treated the job as a competition. Luckily management was understanding and moved me over to the plumbing department which is easier."
good,Poor management with little to no common sense and the way they make the schedule is beyond me but is good if your looking for a second part time job.
good,I learned alot could of had better team memebers to work with but overall a very good experience Love what I do If I wanted to go back I know that they would let me come back
good,"Some managers were very rude and blamed me (i felt) on a lot of issues and accused me of things I did not do. Communication was awful, lots of he said she said no i didnt etc. Maybe I wouldn't mind working at Home Depot again if I didn't have such crazy hours when I asked to start out part time yet was scheduled more like a full time employee. Rules kept on being changed it seemed when I asked about stuff etc and keeping track of money in the till was like walking on hot coals. I just got fed up and blew my lid."
good,Working for the company had options to advance in my career and offered many benefit options including discounts on phone plans as well as some insurance.
good,"Openers are required to perform safety checks for their departments making sure every aisle is safe, clean and shoppable. In the mornings making sure all pallets are put up in the overhead and no obstacles obstructing customer's path."
good,Home Depot is a great place to work with lots of friendly faces and some positive attitudes....that will help you get through the day! They offer rewards to the employees
good,"The pay isn't great but the benefits are fantastic even for part-time associates - the vision and dental are amazing, they have tuition reimbursement for any degree (not just work-related), 401(k), and discounted pricing on their company stock."
good,it was a good relaxing job when you got all your work done all you had to do wa just relax and wait for more work to come it was a really easy job i dint want to leave tho
good,"The company is good to work for, but a lot of favoritism.  The promotions are not chosen by the most qualified but by favoritism. The company does have a lot of associate events."
good,The intent was there for a good program however only certain people did well. Usually the supervisors favorites got the best leads. It was a very political program and I did not enjoy it.
good,Got yelled at for helping a customer away from the register when its part of our core basics to help the customer. Each head cashier has their favorite person they would call on more or let things slide. If another coworker is doing something that you know you aren't suppose to do don't do it you will get in trouble for it but no them.
good,Home Depot really cares for its employees and will work with them to assist them when they are in need. They have no physical restriction for employment.
good,"It is an easy place to work but does not really offer a competitive wage. It is a great place for the retired or college students to work, but it is really hard to raise a family on their offered wages"
good,"A regular closing shift at The Home Depot includes cleaning and restocking items for current customers along with customers that come in the next morning. Management was pretty good depending on the day and who the assistant manager was. The culture within Home Depot as far as workplace goes, was pretty stressful depending on how many customers were in the store at any given time and how staffed certain departments in the store had been."
good,"My experience in learning from HD was interesting, but as the days go by, learning became so tedious and annoying. Co-workers are always gunning for you to fail and to treat you horribly."
good,My typical day at work would probably be helping customers when they come in and getting everything done before you have to leave for that day. Another thing we had to do is to make sure everything was stocked right and have every hole filled that was empty.
good,I like the job but it is part time and I need full time.  It takes a long time to get into a full time position.  It is a good company who offer fun way to encourage employees to get involved with the company as a whole.
good,Employee's and employee appreciation events are great pay is to low for work done alot of employee advancement but pay doesn't change much management.
good,If you are looking for seasonal work this is a great place to start for a first time job.  NOT a place to make your career.  Difficult to have a home life when you never have the same shifts two weeks in a row.
good,I learn a lot at the company. The people i worked with were really nice. The pay was okay for part time. The company culture was okay as well. The company worked well my education.
good,First getting hired here the orientation sounded amazing. everyone seemed understanding about family needs and schedules. everyone worked as a team to take care of our customers. HAHAHAH What a joke that was. I am a single mother of two children and i worked 8 to 5 every day except wednesdays where i had to be here by 6am!! This was extremely hard trying to get my kids up by 4 one day of the week. really screwed our routine up and i tried to change it to my regular 8 to 5 but no the store manager was not having it and kept denying me. my supervisor was ok with it. it was just him and i in our department and he prefered to work early shift. Management does not care about their associate situations. if my kid was sick and i had to stay home cuz school or daycare had rules about fevers i still got pentalized for having to stay home with my sick child!!! Training new associates is a joke too. we all get thrown to the wolves and expect to succeed. there is no team work even when help was asked for. i loved my job here but the structure is a little backwards.
good,"Home Depot isn't that much different from other retail store jobs. Pros and Cons alike. However, if you know nothing about Home-Improvement like how I didn't, it will be a hair-pulling and frustrating experience. I was usually the only one in plumbing department, and not only was my supervisor frequently non-present to help me, but the computer training only skims the surface. On the floor, I had to answer questions from multiple customers coming from all directions at once about products that I know next to nothing about. Imagine being expected to be a lifeguard when you don’t even know how to swim. Thats literally how absurd it seemed. On top of that, I had to carry around a first phone and answer calls from customers all at once. One time I recalled having to assist 6 customers all at one time!!!!!!!! My department supervisors didn't seem to have my back either. My assumption is that they felt that I, being a Younger Person, posed a threat to their seniority. The only time both my department supervisors would usually speak to me would be after I had made a mistake, as opposed to showing me the ropes and showing me the correct way to do things. This was particularly true when I was working for the Pro-desk. That manager there seemed to lack any commitment or character. "
good,"Although there was organization,Training was not adequate, concern about employee satisfaction in job was minimal, After a year a review was on job performance was communicated to employee and even if you were commended on outstanding job only .35 cent raise was approved. It appeared that the company was not concerned about employee retention. A typical day at work you may help several contractors selecting their materials and at times it was stressful digging through materials trying to fulfill customer,s requirements. Many times the materials were not delivered as promised and customers were nasty at times and even though you had no control on deliveries. Anytime a job as stressful as this one requires better support from your management it was just not there some managers did try to help but unsuccesful in their attempts and the pay was very low for for the stress factor."
good,"Home Depot is a good place to work for because they are flexible with student's school schedule. Everyone there pretty much treats everyone like family. You get to know your customers, especially the custotmers who come there everyday."
good,"Pay was decent starting out, but what made it difficult was being understaffed and many associates stretched out covering multiple departments. There was a lot to learn about the product, so that's what made it a little fun at times."
good,"Great experience had lots of fun learned alot of different skills I didn't have before."
good,The work we do is great. However the managment team and the respect level they have is below par. The atmosphere and customers are what make up for what the managment team lack.
good,I dont see myself making a career form this due to the pace and management from the store i was at    but it was a starter summer job that did the job
good,"There is limited growth potential especially for management seekers. Hours are flexible but must be willing to work ""template"" shifts without deviation."
good,The home depot was a corporate business. Customer service was top priority. Advancement opportunism was vast. I mostly left due to poor coworker attitudes. As well as to start school.
good,"Job was fun, typical retail job, good hours for my position, learned a lot of information about products and services,  would be nice if company offered a discount to employees"
good,"I am a person with a manner when relating to people, and bring forward a culturally competent sensibility.  I have developed an international perspective of population diversity.  This non-exclusive attitude and the capacity to always recognize and accept social, economic and cultural differences has given me the capacity to relate to other institutions and adapt to new technologies.  I adapt easily to new situations.   I am totally involved with democratic practices that may help people to become participants and responsible for their own development.  I have been trained to encourage community participation.  Most important, I have enjoyed my work and believe I can contribute effectively to the diverse communities in Orlando."
good,good job pays great has different shifts training takes some time to get full benifits mostly good people to be around leaders are ok give bonus every 6 months
good,I was let go due to unfair policies in the work environment. Years after I was let go my Store Manager was let go because of these issues except he was given a large portion of money due to his title and position in the company.
good,"paid my rent for 6 years and i had fun with the employees , the environment was nice but the job could get stressful depending on your position in the store"
good,"Customer Service, Meeting New People, Diverse environment, Day to day challenges, Entrepreneurship, Working with and Inspiring the Team to be their best each and every day."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with. Management was a different matter all together, I speak only for the store i worked in. We rotated through so many managers in my tenure there, and each one came with their own way of doing things making all sorts of promises and turning things upside down, then they would be assigned to another home depot, and they would leave everything half started, and a new manager would come in and the process would begin again. I've heard other home depot's didn't have this issue, and other than that I think its a good place to work"
good,"Overall, I felt that I learned a lot about being a leader from this job being a supervisor.  I just believe that my bosses that were above me were a bit unfair with me upon dismissal.  But I take every challenge and move on to the next stage."
good,"as a cashier at home depot it is rough the supervisor talks to you like she is above you, department associates dont want to help customers so by the time they get to the register they are often irritated most of the time you are the only one up at the register or it is only self checkout open management doesn't really help the situation"
good,"There are multiple levels of management and they all have their own rules and how they operate. Some days were understaffed and busy and some days it was dead. Its retail you sometime you get horrible customers. Overall, its like working in any retail store. They offer a lot of benefits and bonuses for even part time employees."
good,"The job has all the requirements of your standard retail store. Given there was no direct competition in the area, the store did well for the city and area towns."
good,"This is a good place to work if you’re a student. The pay is fair, but you barely have any coverage. The management is pretty poor, and likes to play favorites. Customers expect you to know Everything. The pay raise is very little maybe $0.50 a year."
good,On the Job training is great and you will be able to help the customers with knowledge.  The location is great just 15 minutes away from home on the bus.
good,It was very few opportunities for growth within Home Depot. Not enough positive relationships within the company. Not enough flexible hours to work with.
good,"Credit Applications are the end-all-be-all. The ability to get customers to complete a credit app is what drives EVERYTHING! Doesn't matter how thorough or fast you are, if you aren't willing to ask every customer if they want to apply, don't apply for a cashier position. Many of the Dept Supervisors aren't suitable for managing!"
good,The management sucked because each would say something different. They played favorites and was rude multiple times. Felt overworked for little pay. They didn't care much about the cashier when there were extreme weather conditions. Having to do tasks that weren't my job. And sometimes butting heads with fellow cashiers.
good,"Getting leads for the store."
good,"We worked long hours with minimal breaks. Warehouses are large so it takes awhile to walk from one end to the other, this is not accounted for in break time. Upper management always seems to be very stressed out."
good,Pay should be better for all that is expected of the associates. helping customers is usually fun but can be stressful if they have no clue what they are doing.
good,"Was a good start here. Anyone looking for a job should apply here, get as much knowledge as possible. Learning about the different aspects in each department here was worth more than the pay itself."
good,"Clarksville Tennessee,  was an awesome place to work lots of positive feed back.  Store now has favorites and all rules dont apply to everyone. Lots of great people working here. Need more recognition to empluees. Schedule is always up and down and seniority is never observed."
good,"The management was unorganized, and oblivious. Many scandals occur here, and employees are not given recognition for their potential. Advancement is near impossible."
good,"As a supervisor we are the ones who run and drive the store, Management just complained or lacked management. im specifically talking about the Assistant store managers"
good,It was a while ago that I worked there so the culture could have changed since then. I enjoyed working there though when I did. The managers were nice and helpful and coworkers we easy to get along with.
good,Working at The Home Depot was a good part time job. It gave one much experience in home improvement products. The work culture was generally positive.
good,"This company is a fast paced, friendly environment. Everyone builds friendships with each other. Always willing to help one an another with whatever needs to be done."
good,"the pay is ok and the weekly hours are low. although if you are looking for a job to bring in money, this is not a bad job to have. if you push hard enough you can learn a good amount of useful skills."
good,there have been a lot of management changes and they aren't on the same page about a lot of things. Coworkers are great and job is pretty straight forward
good,"The staff are friendly, the customers were ok. Job is not really worth the pay but I did learn some useful skills there. They really should hire more people to help out."
good,"I went from a store that had a manager that yelled at me in front of people (including customers), to a manager that let very important things go without consequences.  My last supervisor was the most awsome supervisor I had the whole 3 years. He was great but the management SUCKED!"
good,My typical day of work go in make sure the shelves are stocked with materials. Make sure it’s clean before opening. I have learned how scan material for customers. Managers are nice and friendly. There’s nothing really hard about my job. They feed you good.
good,Senior management runs the Online departments as an outsource company and doesn't comprehend that The Home Depot organization brand is a successful global conglomerate company.
good,"Not a job fir a career. But is good for a parttime position for extra money."
good,"I liked working there but I didn’t know anything about the lighting department and that’s where they put me , I had grate co workers and they showed me the ropes and taught me plenty I now can hang a ceiling fan myself !!! And know about resess lights where I knew nothing when I started ! So that part was cool but when I was there alone I had no breaks no one ever even came by to check it see if I had fallen or got shocked to death I mean this went on all day not a soul to be seen just me and all them hot lights in the hot summer could have been a desaster but I was fine till the next day then the next by that time I’ve had it and never went back no one would here me when I tried to tell them and tried I did so well good by Home Depot and all the lights"
good,"While the pay is below average for the area, the people you work with are generally good. Management varies but will generally use and abuse you with no recognition."
good,The Home Depot has changed in several ways since I first arrived in 2008. Once a place that offered competitive pay and a workforce of experienced employees. Has turned into a warehouse filled with inexperienced teenagers. This company does not value seasoned associates unless you are willing to move up to management. Great place to gain experience if you don’t have any
good,"management plays favorites when promoting. It's a good overall company, management needs an overhaul. wouldn't recommend to work here at the moment. employees were amazing"
good,"Home Depot is a good company as a whole but so in each store location. I feel a lot of promotions are based on favortisom versus"
good,"They expect a lot out of you and got little thanks for it. I was put back into my original role as of my hire date many times due to ""Hours Reallocation"", which left feeling like there no chance to move up. I tried many times to improve my situation there to be returned to where I started."
good,"This job is only good for after school part timers, but if you think you can live a life off of the paychecks givin here then you're wrong. The hours are terrible and the supervisors are aswell."
good,"The coworkers make the job easier. You get less than 20 hours a week...paychecks are not living wage. The schedule is made three weeks ahead, there's little space for having shift picked up if you're job position if limited to a number of people."
good,Home Depot was a decent place to work. I never had any issues with management or any of the staff. Lots of my coworkers were really cool and I enjoyed most shifts despite having heavy workloads some days. I worked nights so a typical day would start at 9 pm and would involve sorting the nights products into their departments before the stocking process began which would go to around 5 am. The last hour of work was spent cleaning up and putting equipment away for day shift.
good,"Most of the Management, Supervisors and employees are very friendly. And want to help you grow with the company. Overall a great experience. I gained a lot of knowledge."
good,it would be good for some hours if our manager or head cashier wouldn't scream or be moody with us the hardest thing was getting credit card for customers
good,"Outside construction sales and consulting for HDE is a very lucrative position in certain cities, in the Midwest it is not competitive in terms of price and service. While I was the number 2 sales person in the region it did not pay enough to keep me in place. HDE has since eliminated most of the product lines in this area and now offers only window replacement, this reduced the income potential as windows are viewed as a commodity within the Kansas City metro area. Now, without the ability to sell roofs, siding and insulation as add ons the revenue will only continue to decline."
good,I worked in a lot of Home Depots over the years.  Each one was totally different in the way they enforced policy and procedures even inside the same district
good,"It a fast pace environment and a retail giant I am a shareholder in company there core value is to take care of customers,pushing credit apps,take care of there employees and the business as a whole."
good,I enjoyed working at the Home Depot because I like working with my hands and I am a fast learner. I went from being a cashier to working in the paint department in six months.
good,"it was a lot to do never had a duel moment "
good,"Liked the work environment, but didn't feel  like management cared much for their employees. Thinks that the company should invest more in their employees."
good,I have not worked there long enough to give accurate review.  Thus far my training has been adequate for my current duties.  I look forward to continueing my training
good,"If you get a good crew boss that really makes all the difference. This job will break your back and make you sweat. You will have to follow confusing plan-o-grams from corporate that often don't match the bay space that you are provided. Make a decision on your own that's not to your supervisor's liking he ""yells"" at you, even if it's the same decision he made last week on the same project at a different store. Come and ask him what he wants you to do and he says ""Think for yourself for once."" Never talk to your direct sup about HR issues, go above their head. Everyone in management always says words that don't mean anything, like ""trickle down,"" and may not support you. It all depends on if you have the right boss and your relationship with them."
good,"Home Depot is a company that I was going in to with high hopes of a good management system with communication and good leadership and that the employees would be well to work with. While the employees are well to work with, I have little respect for the management. I have asked numerous times about pay for tool rental associate as I have been moved here, and they always say ""I'll come back to you about that"", yet I never hear back. "
good,"As a company overall, it's a great place to work because of the benefits, success sharing, take care of their people with the ""Homer Fund"" when needed (and they qualify), etc.  If you break it down to the dept level, it's terrible. There is no work life balance, no consistent communication.  The expectations are ridiculous the higher up the chain your title/promotion goes. You're expected to work ridiculous amounts of hours (including weekends). If you're not high enough on the food chain or low enough on the food chain, expect to give blood, sweat and tears to the company so much so that your salary breaks down enough that you end up making less than the hourly associates that work for you (or that you work for).  That's the idea of servant leadership. But again, come the twice a year success sharing payouts and stock options, you end up not complaining."
good,Really loved my co-workers and the flexibility in hours. The pay was terrible for the amount of strenuous labor and compensation for meeting and passing by 200% sales quotas. I made the company a lot of money in sales and never was compensated..Originally the idea was you would be rewarded for your hard work. When asked for a raise I was turned down because I lost one sale which was out of my control. Even though I made the company tons of  money. Even beating in sales the 16 year veteran employee who had worked for H.D. for years.
good,Its ok I guess.We have a few fun events like parties crawfish boil thru the year ..we be bonuses twice a year.Hours are flexible.But they play the favorite game.There are ppl at my store who get away with murder and nothing is said.They do what they want.If u call the aware line they record u and play it back for your managers and then u really get treated badly and have got hours cut
good,It was an ok place to work at. there was some things that i would chance but overall it was not a bad place to work at sometimes you got free stuff but overall there needed to be changes
good,"Its like most retail jobs, you get it as a way to make money at first but then if you don't get chances to advance your career you get stuck in a loop"
good,"Need more input and training , not enough coverage, I enjoyed working there, until I started getting in trouble for sometimes things not in my control."
good,"Good place to work with a team. A lot of hard work and lack of proper hands-on training, but the customer service field was easy to be in. Helped me work hard and improve my customer service."
good,"I enjoy being able to help a customer find exactly what they've come in for, and with my specific position I've come to know the store pretty well. I love my job and what i do although assistant management could do a lot better with treating associates with more respect."
good,Decent working situation. Room for advancement. Can be very stressful. Customers can be pushy and obnoxious. Management focuses more on sales numbers than employee well being.
good,"This was a very fast paced job which always made the day go by faster."
good,In the 6 years that I worked there the culture of the company changed from an excellent place to work to a policy of profits above anything. Forced out knowledgible associates to reduce salaries.
good,"The pay was good for entry into the workplace, but long hours on your feet."
good,"Great job! Very easy to learn, nice place to learn about customer service and dealing in difficult situations, the skills you learn here are many that can help with other opportunities."
good,"the managers here were very nonchalant and very unhelpful. the employess only ever lokked out for themselves. the comoany utself is great, just my location was upsetting"
good,Management was very lackful and salary compensation was horrible for the amount of time and effort you put into one thing.Also it can be a very bad atmosphere considering the rude customers and rude employees.
good,"The hardest part of the job is having to manage two customers at a time. A typical day at work is just jumping on a register and get the line going. Lastly, the work culture is always putting the customer first no matter what."
good,I love my job but there are just as many reasons I usually dread work. Most recently the team hired a new part timer even though we had a nearly full team where they could've extended others hours. They hired them and cut my hours in 1/3rd. My manager at my store is a stress inducing person and can be contradictory. I love the warehouse environment and I love the people I work with. I am incredibly grateful for the machinery skills I have developed while working at THD. I will continue to support the store though I disagree with some of the business practices I see occurring at their stores.
good,Work on the sales floor. Helped customers with in home projects on install service though Home depot. help in blinds and paint when needed. Re stocking and cleaning the flooring department
good,"Similar to other retailers.  "
good,difficult sale because it was in home selling after a 2 hour presentation.  Felt kind of pushy asking for so much money...more expensive than most other companies but they had good warranties
good,I liked it there I still like it there in some ways the people I work with are great but the way the management runs things isn't so great . They need to take care of there people and treat them with respect. I l will always like it there . I'm a hard worker and do my best to get things done and make my coworkers happy. It's a fun place to work
good,"fun..i  learned a lot about house "
good,For the average person this a decent place to get some valuable work experience.  Once you know your roles and routines management doesn't harass you very much.
good,"The greatest part of this company is helping homeowners create a better place to live for their families. If you enjoy customer service, you will enjoy working here."
good,This job was great for not having to take work home with you I happened to have some awesome immediate supervisors which made things worthwhile however communication was an issue with other places in the store
good,Home Depot is a enjoyable lace to work. Your strengths and weakness are tested and made stronger. They are fair with work schedules and they have a strong desire to maintain associates happiness.
good,"Generally corporate can be a bit stuffy, but for the most part HD was really great for being innovative, however, the problem is that with innovation, comes change. My entire time at HD, I saw employees with 10-15+ years service get pushed to the wayside and forced out of their jobs. The orange apron culture reeked of corporate (rightfully so), costing good people their jobs."
good,It was a temp job in order for me to go back to school and really accomplish the goals i had set for myself. They people were ok and the management alright
good,"Overall a great experience work is difficult and underpaid, but very enjoyable. Management needs work, communication between different departments is almost nonexistent."
good,Being part of a like-minded team is the biggest plus to the job.  Everyone looks out for one another.  We all like each other and have similar work ethics.  This is specific to the MET position.
good,Was hired as full time days and hardly ever got 40 hours. Was not allowed to get over36 to keep us as part time workers. Had to work %.00 am shift to be able to get over 30 hours. Constant move of people from other departments to ours with no experience. We had to train our own shift leaders and managers.
good,"A good place to start off your work life. Their day to day work routine is very easily handled and it is a good opportunity to learn about various trades as you work with customers. The company offers very good training, and associate benefits. The biggest weak spot is that their employment and firing mechanisms are handled by corporate. Meaning that, for individuals with difficult life situations there is almost no flexibility."
good,another temp job it was retail and retail hours it was ok place to work always busy with customers store manger was ok other worker were good to work with
good,"The job itself is very lax. You're left to your own devices when it comes to packing things out, meaning things are nice and relaxing as you do your job. Management will occasionally breath down the necks of certain associates for no reasons, and sometimes seem dissapointed that one could not finish the job of many in a short period of time. Management just changed hours on everyone and made it expressly clear that they would do very little to accommodate those that could not work these hours. This makes it hard to balance work and school."
good,"working for the home depot was fast pace,i learned alot about setting the items in the correct shelf,management was not very good on third shift,they would watch you like a hawk."
good,"The environment was fine, but its just another job. There was nothing special about working there. Its fine for short term, but as a long term option, nots so much."
good,"Prepare yourself for long days, sleepless nights and a working ""vacation"".  You can learn a ton in a short period of time, but it will come at a cost."
good,Best part of working there was the customers and the co workers the health benifits cost way to much compared to the pay also they want you to work over your shift sometimes then make you cut your overtime before the end of the week
good,"Excelente ambiente y mejores oportunidades de crecimiento, se toma en cuenta al empleado, para ayudarlo a crecer dentro de la empresa."
good,"Overall I enjoyed working at The Home Depot, Getting to know everyone, both associates and costumers made it a good time, but the downfalls which caused me to leave was they train you so much but as my knowledge and experience increases my pay did not."
good,Often full days of work not being able to accomplish everything if its a extremely busy day of customers. You'll learn multiple hands on tools as well as products related you your department and the rest of the store. Lifting at least 50-60 pounds is required and the physically hardest part of the job. The environment and staff make the job much more enjoyable then some other jobs i've had.
good,"Good place to work if you like hard work and learning new things. However, things can get stressful very fast as the customer base is very demanding or rude and the management team gives very little support to employees on the sales floor."
good,"fun and productive place to work"
good,"The Home Depot has a long history of being a decent company to work for. I spent many years there and worked my way from the ground up. The hours spent there, were probably the most concerning. No overall family life."
good,come to work clock in do your exercises start to unload trucks break down the pallets stock product on floor also load pallets and load trucks break was 30 minutes
good,"Great place to work.  Staff is very caring and accommodating.  Was a good place to work while in university.  Customers were very friendly."
good,When working for home depot it was a fast paced environment that kept you moving every day. There were alot of opportunities to engage with customers and help them with their projects.
good,"Not enough employees to cover shifts. Most everyone is part-time. Management is on this kick to get their bonuses as large as they can. Cutting the rest of the store back on hours. Leads to no coverage if you need to take lunch, etc..."
good,Hard work extreme depends low pay. Will give favs to friends. Will remove lates and absence if they like you. Will give horrible hours to those they do not like
good,"Very easy going co-workers, family oriented company. Laid back, fast paced and busy. The hardest part of the job is dealing with disgruntled customers."
good,"Workplace culture is balanced "
good,"Managers do not keep their word, they keep grudges and will do anything to make sure they have no blame in them . The work load is not to bad if you know what you are doing ."
good,Home Depot is a great place to work at don't get me wrong but me as a person i felt like i wasn't getting paid enough for the amount of work i was doing.
good,"Values are posted and talked about, but in fact, they are not ""lived"" by most of the management teams.  Behind closed doors, other messages are sent to the upper management."
good,extremely hard to get full time. i average 20 hrs a week. some throw work off on others and blame everyone else for not getting their job done. some act like supervisors and talk down to you
good,"Very proud corporate culture, organizing office events and provides a modest work-life balance. Lots of very talented people, buried in a ton of job security."
good,I am moving on from the company because I am going on to do different things with my career. Not much to say other than that. Good luck to others out there
good,"too many asm, each with a different training method with leads to confusion. Some depts are not run efficiently due to lack of leadership and someone taking responsibility."
good,"I think if they would give more raises they could really keep people there. I was there for almost 2 yrs and I only got 1 raise that's it! And the raise that they gave wasn't much of nothing! They want you learn all the equipment but don't compensate for it! The starting pay isn't bad but the raises needs to be frequent if you ask me! If you learn the equipment and you use it on a regular basis, I think you should be compensated for it."
good,It was fine.  It's just a normal retail job with nothing special in either way. It was just a way to make a little money.  Not hard or satisfying either.
good,In my department everything was fine. Managers had  it out for me it felt like. Almost fired me for going to my grad fathers funeral because when I called in to say I couldn't make it he thought I did it at the time I was supposed to be in.
good,Ok place to work. I like most of the employees. Most of the employes are easy to get along with. most of the customers are nice and friendly. We receive a success sharing bonus every 6 months.
good,My time working here wasnt bad at all. Come to work help customers have a great time doing that then clock out time. It was a great job for me to help others.
good,"Work your shift, dont steal was kinda here and there no guidence people were drunk at work didnt knowwho bosswas at times pull you to do other jibs cut hours"
good,"*Hard physical long days"
good,"Quick paced work place, great for advancement or temporary employment. Management is inconsistent, either great and caring or indifferent and incompetent. Workplace requires a large amount of physical work up and down ladders, running across the store, and loading for customers. Customers are frequently sexist and would refuse help from me or be overly ""impressed"" with my knowledge base. Home Depot has little to no work place culture. They have their primary objectives and they ignore them for profit every time, do not be fooled. Expect lots of physical activity without much appreciation and rude customers daily. While the job may be bad at times, the coworkers are quality and make it all worth it."
good,"Worked in various roles during my 10 years at The Home Depot, helped me strengthen my customer service hard and soft skills while working as a Head cashier as well as Service desk associate."
good,Being part of corporate but working in the stores made things interesting with the store staff and management.  Great consistent work schedule but pay for the work seemed low.
good,"Honestly speaking while not the worse place in the world, it's so chocked with favortism and back room politics it isn't worth it. Your hours are cut by the week and there is almost no room for growth."
good,Learned a lot of my customer service and retail skills here. Had alot of opportunities to rise up on the corporate ladder but could not due to the schedule i needed at the time
good,dealing with people all day can be a bit much.. You are amazed on how much stuff is in 1 store and all the work they do in the community. This is a great company to work for.
good,"This all depends on what type of management you get, but with my experience at Home Depot it was a great place to work and a relaxed environment as long as you're working."
good,"I have been at this call center for 4 years and its what you would expect from a call center.  Yes they have tons of shift options, but you are forced to do s shift bid every 6 months and what you get is based off of your stats.  Home Depot contact centers only care about 2 things money and stats.  They peddle this ""Values Wheel"" propaganda, but its a ruse. They just want to sell stuff and make you neurotic over your stats.  They ""technically"" cannot fire you for stats that are not meeting goal, but they will do other things like, write you up for ""behavioral issues"" that is ultimately the road to termination."
good,The Home Depot is a okay place to work so long as you are willing to assimilate to the culture. I was most dissatisfied with the way the company compensated their employees and value their work.
good,"I would come in clock in say hello to all my friends with a big smile."
good,"Although I was there for two years, its not a job I would recommend to stay for a long time. The management doesn't take the steps to properly train you for the positions you take."
good,"I was working there to get caught up as another source of income, I was not serious about staying long term with this company however I did meet some great people"
good,it was a stressful environment to work in there was to much favoritism and the pay was unfair for the work they made you do including the overtime they wanted.
good,"Culture is focused on supporting stores.  Good work-life balance, management is supportive.  Benefits and pay are competivie with other companies.  Atlanta campus has nice amenities."
good,"I gained a good number of skills and different types of knowledge I would not have learned while working for Home Depot. The downside, however, is that there is little to no chance to progress through the progressive process when it comes to ""climbing the employment ladder"". They interview the minimum number of people required for most any position, either because they do not want to have to go through more interviews or because they already have a favorite for the position."
good,"I was not at this establishment very long, however the lessons that I learned in my brief stint will last always. Professionalism, respect, integrity. All qualities  that I have always taken seriously, but this setting gave me a chance to to really see how those ideals worked in the ""real world"" so to speak."
good,"You start by learning about plumbing , gardening , drywall just to name a few, in a hardware store compassionate about leaning towards a new career adventure areas that teach you trick of the trade."
good,As a long time employee I can say that the Home Depot does a lot to care for their employees with comprehensive health plans and profit sharing.  Open door policy with upper management means that your ideas and concerns can be easily conveyed to someone in the management team.
good,It's a great place to work but for as long as I have been there I have not been offered full time. Working part time isn't enough to maintain a comfortable living.
good,"Knowledge is power. If you are proactive and assertive with your training, whether online or through mentoring, you do well here."
good,They have great customer service  people and back end employees that work for the company. Upper management focus on what have you done for me lately but not what you put in over the time
good,"Not bad, but too much stress on my back. The other cashiers would get to sit and take breaks and I had to stand and help load and felt I was being taken advantage of just because I was a new hire."
good,"called a coworker an ugly name, because she was, not to her face and of the clock and still got fired. be careful because security is no such thing at this job"
good,"Enjoyable customer interaction, regularly scheduled employee training, opportunity to learn product information for all of the stores products and services"
good,"Good benefits for full timer.  A lot of lifting and walking.  Late shifts.  Good product knowledge training.  "
good,"Decent place to work.  Management is generally helpful although some senior leadership can be difficult to navigate.  Wages are ok depending on the position you hold."
good,Poor Job Training for someone starting who wants to advance. It is important to spend time with your employeee and my supervisor had no time for me. she was always too busy and would say so. she sucked.
good,"Pay is above average for retail"
good,As a part time worker there are no benefits and they do not give enough hours to provide for any type of standard of living.  Home Depot number one priority as it should be.
good,Customer service was key.  Always worked self checkout and at 5 in the morning every Saturday. Always called in on the weekends or days off when I worked full time already and this was merely part time.
good,"I was a cashier for Home Depot."
good,"If you look for the good, you will find it.  If you drift towards mining for negativity, you will find it as well.  Understaffing is a consistent issue."
good,"Home Depot was a nice place to work, manangement and other employees were very friendly and helpful. The salary was not that great and benefits were poor as I was only part time. The hours were great as mamagement was flexible with my family."
good,Home Depot is a okay place to work.  The only issue is the hours are not there at times to give you and they are always short staffed .  I feel they over work the employees scheduled so they can save money by cutting hours of other employees.
good,"It was a good experience for my first job. I was 16 and i was working part time . They made me feel comfortable and safe everytime i went to work. I recommend that any people that are young and trying to get a job , to apply at home depot."
good,I work for home depot for thirteen years and a lot others work worked there a long time. I would say that it was like my family that employees cultuire.
good,"Its a good place to work. Good benefits and can move up the ladder "
good,"Unfortunately, the leadership varies wildly based upon the district leadership. Some are phenomenal, some are completely absent of any guidance. It's quite a shocking variance."
good,the home depot was a fun experience it was my first job out of high school and the job had alot of good people in it.... it was a very good experience
good,"Constantly moving and dealing with both happy and angry customers. I learned a lot about gardening products, landscaping, and how to use certain tools to accomplish gardening tasks."
good,Very diverse. Really enjoyed working there. A lot of opportunities for growth. Associates were very close. Really was work family. Would recommend this company
good,"Always had the most precious customers, and staff to work with. "
good,if you are young you'll like working at the home depot. they have a college reimbursement so that helps out a lot with people who are either part time or full time for college
good,"I worked one day a week for an average of 3-4 hours pulling old stock and replacing with current dated stock , I would receive at least 4 , 70Lb boxes a week. There were occasion when I would receive and service up to 8 boxes.. I worked on my own and didn't have to actual report to a supervisor, just had had to call and report time in and time out."
good,"Les employés sont très gentil et compréhensif, ils vous montrent comment faire et vous invites à leur poser vos questions."
good,"I like Homedepot but it’s not the best with management, but Homedepot can definitely be a great place if u stay focus on that and put your pride aside."
good,"Home Depot management is not good. Neither is the scheduling. Co workers play favorites. "
good,Enjoyment the cashier experience. I met lots of people learning new  ways and  ideas on how to do self home repairs in the on site clinic. ...........
good,"Not a good place to come to starting from the bottom, too much favoritism and lazy management. No standards for those who they know will just coast, they will just push all the extra work onto the good employees."
good,"decent place to work, not the best pay, clean and fun environment."
good,"In the 4 years I have been working here, I have come to realize that it is stressful and not worth the hassle for the pay they give you. I would not recommend it as a full time job."
good,opportunity is given for growth. learn something new everyday. service and product driven industry. days can be stressful. room for advancement and growth.
good,Learned a lot about team work and customer service. The customers were also very interesting and good to work with and learn from. I appreciated the experience.
good,the only good thing i can say is the people you meet are friendly and understanding there are stressful days but really what job is stress free you can move in the company if they let you and there misleading
good,busy and steady. it takes hard work and if you work during the summer can be a hassle. good culture. Management was ok. hardest part of job was the labor and working overnight while going to my other job.
good,Home Depot is an okay place to work. You'll learn many different skills if you want to. They pay bi-weekly. No overtime it was very rare to get overtime. But they did have stock options
good,was constantly covering more than 1 persons job had too much on my plate was always stressed out and fely\t like i needed help i did enjoy the people and atmosphere
good,Putting up of all freight that had arrived overnight. Made sure all packages of overstock was put securely away. Also worked in paint department and assisted all customers and their needs.
good,Depends on the store but where i was it wasn't so fun. For the most part you are given tasks to complete that are very do-able but would be better done in with a partner.
good,I worked there as I went through college and it was a great place that worked with your class schedule. They do take great care of their workers. I have learned how to provide excellent customer service.
good,Workday's include meeting with client's in order to meet their specific window and door needs. Communication and listening skills are vital for accuracy. Additional time is spent reviewing inventory and packing out inventory. Management is always available if needed. The culture and workplace environment is positive.
good,"When you work here you rarely actually work directly with a manager unless they ask you to do something or are helping in your department, rather the department supervisors have complete control over the departments. It just depends on who you get as a supervisor as to how much work you are needed to do"
good,Working at home depot can be stressful because of customers and management. They offer good benefits but no discounts to associates. Pay could be more for a fortune 500 company.
good,"Indeed has no right to require this information. I understand it is designed to help, however it should be voluntary and not a requirement. I will not fluff or disparage any company I have ever worked for."
good,Fast pace environment work is challenging and fun at times. Customer focused. management was ok to work with. No overtime. I wish the pay was better but it was fine..
good,"It's an average place to work in. Management, unfortunately needs to be trained more on how to manage and train in critical thinking. Scheduling is not well planned."
good,"It’s a cool place to work, it can be so busy that you will say it’s crazy here and it can be also so slow that u say wow it’s so boring, like every other job, there is slow days"
good,I dont have much to say about working here i was not working there for a long time...at the time i was employeed there I wanted to work in customer service butnmy brother was the boss there but when je moved his department and i wanted to move they didn't want to change my position so i just moved on.
good,"I come in and usually look at the notes left by the supervisor to help catch up , I restock tile , flooring, and samples. Keeping your area tidy is very important. "
good,When I am challenged I go above and beyond.  When I want something I would so hard to get it. This is how I got one department so high.  I love being able to help them design
good,Nice place to work! Its a love story and it is an every time you think of the school system as the color of their skin color but they only had a couple 4months 4and in my facility we have a great influence and a badge for the rest of the day you were at the
good,"This is required for me to continue with the setup process but not something I wish to do now."
good,"Covered multiple departments selling products & services to customers as well as keeping shelves stocked with products. The job required self reliance & motivation, critical thinking, problem solving. Management was fine, not a lot of interaction with them. All for one, one for all kind of work attitude putting the customer as top priority. Staying motivated during slow times could be difficult. Helping customers achieve their goals was the best part of the job."
good,"Nightly meeting,unload trailer.Line up pallets pull freight onto floor,drop off freight to depts, pack out freight, cleaning up bkoken bags of merchandise."
good,Home Depot was a good experience. I liked working for the company the managers were respectful and my coworkers were also respectful and helpful when I first started.
good,I work part time on freight time nights. restocking shelfs&taking care of customers .helping them find things in store.cleaning the shelfs.coworkers were good to work with.
good,"gave me my first work experience, great people to be around,  Learned to be organized and responsible, this job was a great stepping stone in my working career."
good,Una Empresa que busca dar el mejor servicio al cliente
good,Overall Home depot was a good job. Environment is a little hazardous but still safe. Very Strict time Clock. Only wish i kept this job. I would very much like to be able to work for them again
good,I enjoyed the team and liked most of the customers.  Management in Garner is very nice but they just do not seem to have the ability to pay competitively.
good,My job was to pull lumber and delivery. Management was good. People were friendly. Hardest part of job was dealing with some customers. Enjoyed delivery the most
good,just helped customers cleaned up aisles restocked shelves with what was merchandise was needed also designed kitchens for customers on the computer and they would virtual designs on paper
good,"A solid company to work for.  Teamwork is highly emphasized, good structure.  Management is hands on and is always willing to assist associates whenever possible."
good,"I started my career at THD and in retrospect, it laid a great foundation in considering systematic thinking and processes. I still draw from it today."
good,"Not everyone wants to cooperate and work.  When speaking to supervisor, they don't want to listen and we are ignored.  Some supervisors shouldn't be in charge at all."
good,The company was a great company for the first fifteen years I was there and then after that they seem to go down. The biggest problem was the management team they had a buddy buddy system
good,"I worked there years ago so this required review is dumb. It was in Calgary. It was a job, that is all. Nothing exciting to report back about this one."
good,Home Depot es una empresa que tiene buen ambiente de trabajo aunque la.paga no es muy buena pero ahí oportunidad de crecimiento en algunas áreas hace falta que suban más el sueldo
good,work your shift due your list of duties. learned how to drive a forklift. management was good. it was usually a pretty clean place and was nice and tidy. hardest part of the job was the workload on some days. the most enjoyable part of the job was the optional lunches
good,"You show up every day give all you can, loyalty is important to them, but there is no loyalty on their part. They don't work with the problem, I saw many dedicated employees let go."
good,I learned a whole bunch of info about products and dealing with all types of consumers . Everyday provide a different type of experience witch made it fun and interesting .
good,The Home Depot is a great place to work. The customers you meet on a daily basic really make it worth the time spent there. You always get a sense of pride and joy whenever you help a customer meet their needs.
good,It was a ok job part-time 11-12$ per hour good environment good experience sometimes can be a fun job get free lunches sometimes. Like wings and pizza sometimes deserts like cake and cookies .
good,"Management is not good. They go based upon who you know even if they are not qualified. Managers look for their ppl come promotion. I was passed up evn though I was more qualified and the girl they promoted had the Audacity to ask me for help on something she should have known. They then tried to half bake promotions to keep ppl happy. Managers sit and talk and leave others not approved to be in charge, in charge."
good,"ok place to work. lack of communication with employees. Understaffed often. coworkers were fine, not enough communication with bosses or coworkers. job was ok temp"
good,"This particular Home Depot has good, solid management - which makes a lot of difference in a retail environment. Most associates are proactive and anticipate customers' needs."
good,"Good people to work with and I did enjoy my time working with the Home Depot.  In the end, I felt that they treated me well as an employee.  The hardest part was dealing with rude customers.  A usual day involved stock rotation and bay upkeep while helping customers with shopping needs and answering correlating questions to products."
good,"Good work for killing time, not really for a career. Wish there had been a bit more organized management but for the most part the associates were cool"
good,Working for Home Depot was good.  Working with men is easier than women.  There is no employee discounts.  Customers were nice to work with.  Management was helpful.
good,was able to meet lots of new people and build strong relationships.  learned a lot about home renovation materials and techniques.  great benefits and health packages
good,"stressful sometimes,  not enough hours, the schedule change a lot, lack  of  communications, inexistence management"
good,I would reccomend working here as a stepping stone to a better job and a better life. It usually has a great team that you can count on. There’s always a few bad seeds but just focus on your next career path!
good,home is nice great ..love it love it i just wish they paid a little more than they do actally however it helps but we work extremely hard as workers and it will show
good,i was a coop student all the employees are fun to work with and there a grate ground of people to bee around and they will always put a smile on your face
good,If you work the truck or the actual freight you will come at different times. Truck team unloads the truck while the other pack the shelves. It is nice to get along with someone who can show you the ropes around the area. Management will provide assistance when necessary but for the most part just ask your fellow associate. The workplace is an easy and laid back as long as everyone is doing work. The hardest part of the job is the scheduling. There have been times when we will have heavy trucks and little associates working at given times. The most enjoyable part is communication between associates. Most are friendly and will give nice conversations and jokes which can make the time fly.
good,"Worked the contractors  desk"
good,"worked with a lot of great people and management sometimes had your back with decisions that were up to you to make.  would go back if i felt i could make a good salary, but it's all corporate"
good,"it's good if you like to work around tools. i enjoyed working outside and using my hands. the pay could definitely be better, as well as the hours. luckily, i worked in pro services and got steady hours."
good,"Some HD stores are busier or larger than others; my previous location was like a central hub. Despite the never-ending buisiness, it will seem as if there are never enough associates on the floor to assist customers and carry out tasks. Well, that’s because there rarely are—no matter what location you go to. You may be forced to cross-train or fill in for departments with which you have no familiarity—assuming you are able to complete the bare necessities training modules before you’re out on the floor. "
good,"Enjoyed working here for the most part. Was hoping it would become permanent, GREAT PAY, but it wasn't in the budget for the store. Management was pretty good, tried to get some of us hired full time, but were told, NO by District and Regional Managers."
good,I worked for outside contractors thru Home Depot. Home Depot offered financing which helped many sales. On the road everyday was enjoyable at that time
good,"The Home Depot is not a terrible place to work but there are definitely better places. There is certainly a lot of favoritism with management and employees. From what I saw when I was there, you can expect to get more hours if they like you but also if management doesn't like you expect to have your hours cut by a lot."
good,"Good company to work for. I would recommend this company to anyone looking for employment with this company. The people, service, and growth with the company was good."
good,"Other associates were very friendly, Job was very physically demanding and offered no form of company advancement in foreseeable future. Learned nothing aside from increased customer service under pressure."
good,"Making sure the store was grand opening ready for Customers. In stock and staffed."
good,"I loved working for the Home Depot, but what was lacking was the fairness in pay. Every associate starts at the same wage, regardless of how more or less difficult their job may be. For me, my job was difficult and I still got paid minimally, the same as those who did not work as hard."
good,"Its all about great customer service , making sure customer has all there needs, team players , making sure contact the right department for customer needs,, its was amazing place to work at . but only down fall is it will take you long time move up in company.. because pick and chews who they want move up"
good,"A typical day at the Home Depot is customer satisfaction meaning to help a customer from A to Z. While working at the Home Depot, I learned how to manage credit card accountants for customers who needed credit to purchase appliances for their home. The culture was customer service as well as congenial to everyone that worked there. However, to me the hardest part of the job to me was big sale days. Enjoyable part was seeing every customer happy they were able to buy what they wanted from my assistance."
good,This was a good temporary job to work while I was in school. The pay was not sufficient enough but enough to put gas in my car in order to get to school and work.
good,I did enjoyed the time spent at the home depot but I didnt find it as a place where I can grow
good,"In my time working here i loved it. My team was amazing, everybody got along and everybody helped everybody. If I didn't have to relocate I would still be working there without a doubt in my mind"
good,The company was good to work for unfortunately the pay was not relevant to the amount of work and hours I put in.  The hours were extremely varied and my days off were never together.
good,It's a great place to work. Friendly work place environment. We are given bonuses if we meet our sales goals every 6 months. Vacation after a year and paid sick time.
good,"I was a Garden Associate, with the responsibility of doing a walk thru at the begging of my shift making sure the all over head pallets where in proper alignment to code. Watering of plants, pulling forward of products in isles and most important was to attend to all customers needs with any product in the indoor and outdoor products: lawn mowers, chain saws, leaf blower, any electric, gas product.  Also with other items located in my area of work. I also learned how to make key. Helped customer locate other products through out the store."
good,"I worked here over 10yrs ago, It was a low paying, highly physical unrewarding job. As soon as got another offer I ran out of the door without looking back."
good,Placing and taking orders for customers. Making sure that export orders was pull and ready for delivery and getting orders ready for pick up. Over all just making sure that the pro-customers was in and out as quick as possible.
good,Good company to work for in terms of benefits. The best candidates for employment at The Home Depot are students and retirees.  It is difficult for a person to sustain themselves on The Home Depot salary.
good,The hardest part of the job was finishing tasks for the department while providing customer service. Sometimes you'll have a lot customers to help and won't have the time to finishing daily tasks.
good,"Though I feel the compensation is inadequate and advancement is doesn't come easily, it is still enjoyable due to great coworkers and work environment and great management."
good,"I was able to maintain a pleasant and helpful greeting through out the day. The benefits were great, and the fellow associates were easy and helpful, the assistant and store manager were available to handle serious issues."
good,The things you do vary from day to day. One day you could be helping a customer with blinds and the next you could be helping stock shelves. But overall work there is fun.
good,I worked the customer service desk and the switchboard directing calls to appropriate department. It was a second job and worked nights. Stressful job.
good,"Grateful I had employment during the recession. Didn't get a chance to advance, so left when the economy improved. Hard physical work, not enough opportunity to make a difference."
good,"Your typical retail job.  Become the dependable hard working one and get punished with extra work.  You decide to take the initiative to take on extra responsibility and become certified on lift equipment, or go the extra distance and become an equipment trainer?  Don't expect anything other than every associate coming to you to sign off on their checkrides. Benefits are good, but the pay could definitely be better."
good,"Over all Home depot does well in cross training, but lacks in follow through with communication on work projects. While working individually is usually best when working for home depot, the management team i worked with had only select individuals that were welcoming and approachable when matters of work task  issues arise."
good,The place is great during lunch you have 30 mins and they have a relaxing place with ping pong table and other games but you won’t have a social life if you work the 2nd shift you’ll go in at 3:30 pm and leave at 2:00 am and you’ll sleep the whole morning from exhaustion from them pushing you to the max even if you work in a dangerous area in the warehouse compared to the other easy relaxed places you still get paid the same and even if you are seasonal and have worked there for 5 months and they keep extending your seasonal time so they won’t pay you for holidays. They pay pretty good money around $800 for two weeks
good,"I liked working here. I didn't like working weekends. I enjoyed working with the customers, The other employees were cool also. Management was always easy to talk to."
good,Won't work with your schedule. It's not bad working there but scheduling is a huge problem unless you're full-time. Management was really bad too!!! It was really unpleasant  to work with them.
good,"The individuals that I work with at The Home Depot, are great, but the work itself can become stressful, and the wages are not enough to support a family or an individual for that matter."
good,Home Depot provided part-time employment while I was attending school.   I was able to complete my Associates and move forward.  I began as a part time sales associate and was quickly asked to become a team lead for the shifts I would work.
good,"Management styles varied- some were understanding and cool, others nitpicked about the smallest things and walked around looking for problems.  Scheduling was my biggest issue with HD.  When I interviewed, I told them I was a college student and needed flexibility with my schedule.  They regularly put me on the work schedule on the times I told them I had class, then got upset when I asked them to change it.  Some departments have no room for growth, pay is OK but not great, and raises are insignificant if you're not management."
good,"the home depot is a great place to work and grow. if you love customers its the place for you. if you love garden, self building to learn about diy projects its the place for you"
good,i would go back if certain improvements were made everyplace has room for improvement to have better management better workers it will do for temporary
good,not a bad first job for anyone looking to start out from high school or ect but the hours are pretty minimal so not a job i'd personally look for to make a liviable wage off of
good,"Flexible schedule to work, reasonable amount of training, could use more communication between management and employees. Could do a better job of compensation and benefits for employees."
good,It gave me the needed experience that I need to become a manager as I have always wanted. I was treated with the utmost respect by my immediate supervisors and given a opportunity to lead other associates and their daily tasks. I formed a family with fellow co-workers and it was a mostly positive work environment to go to
good,"helping customers, learning new departments, relating to fellow employees,  constantly training, interesting projects, serving the community responsibly"
good,"Working at Home Depot I learned a lot, I believe they didn't always stick by there values. Most times they were in it to help customers get  what they needed."
good,"Clock in, See what station you will be working at that day. Clean and stock your area as needed. You will prob work at different stations threw out your shift ."
good,It is tough to advance and get pay raises. You do not want to be working here for 20 years of your life because it is convenient only to find out that you wasted your life!
good,"Upper management could be more visible and supportive "
good,It was very stressful at points and sometimes it was not. The employees there are always willing to help one another if they have a question or just need help with a customer.
good,Muy buena empresa con grandes beneficios pero un poco injusta al momento de evaluar y recompensar esfuerzos
good,not enough help at certain positions. learned how to operate machinery. management has favorites and that is the only way to advance in the company. hardest part of the job is everyone wants help but isnt willing to help
good,The Home Depot is a fun place to work. It is continually busy and this makes the time go fast. People are generally nice to work with. Hours can be difficult as they change from week to week.
good,It is only a retailer hiring employees for low wages. Nothing different from others at the same segment. It has a perks program that is very helpful including discounts for gym memberships.
good,I would ensure the parking lot was cleaned of carts and would do my rounds around the store helping customers find products and answer questions they might have had. Management was really respectful. The hardest part of the job was the amount of hours they would give they were low. I really enjoyed learning  how to work in other departments to help more.
good,the company loves to say but the customer first but when it comes down to it they don't want to properly staff the building to actually follow through on that so if you like a fast paced work space where you have to juggle both your job and others then this is the place for you.
good,"Good people, simple, repetitive work. My job as MET was very easy but did require a keen eye and you had to be willing to go hunting for appropriate items when they were needed."
good,"Count all in and outs of products in the Department. calculate the outs and down stock the ins before opening hours. Help Managers with task or projects. "
good,I loved working here. Good hours. Good pay. Easy job. Very good at managing my time. It’s a good place to work at. Management was good. I worked the night shift.
good,"rather not say, just want a new job please help . over working there. good place to start.i want a fresh start im ready for some place new. associates are too much drama"
good,"i wish not to say anything about this company , other then it was a fast paces job and had many great people working for them . The pay was fair but some people will stab you in the back quickly"
good,i work one year sale assisted and forklifts... i like work but sometime make me stressful cause too much hard work but really good paid. manager really cool and patient with me that i am deaf
good,"The day is pretty easy, it varies from day to day. Some days its busy other days it's slow. It depends on how many customers come in that day. When the weather's bad there tend to be fewer customers."
good,"I like my jobs for the customer that I deal with on a daily basis, they are why I like my job. The return customers, or contractors are what makes my day."
good,"So far my time at the Home Depot has been satisfying. I enjoy the sense of family among the coworkers, customers are most often times decent. However, the compensation should increase."
good,"Poor pay, hard work with little advancement. Not very flexible with hours. Good thing company has help programs for those employees that are struggling but very hard to get"
good,At the time it was a good company to Work for they were plenty room for advancement you learned every day dealing with people was wonderful you meet so many great people along your career very fast pace so the days busy
good,Home Depot was a great learning experience for me. I was trained in different areas of the store and enjoyed my time there. Lots of changes in leadership during my time there.
good,"Typical day was stocking, I learned to use a forklift and get certified and the most enjoyable part of my job was assisting customer with their needs."
good,"The job and people are fun, but fun doesn’t always pay the bills. Home Depot does not pay enough for someone with a lot of bills. And full time? Don’t think about that. It’s near impossible."
good,"Lots of lifting and on your feet, great people, friendly co-workers.  Hours can be 6am to 3pm one day,and 10 to 7 the next, never the same days off, bad customers are rewarded, brings in a bad customer base"
good,Home depot is a fun place to work. You can learn a lot from how to fix things all the way to growing a garden. Every day you learn something new at the Home Depot.
good,It was a productive and fun place to work. You were very busy in my department so time move very fast. That was a benefit as far as I was concerned thank you very much.
good,"Its been a long time since I worked there. No work life, personal life balance. It was retail. Job just didn't fit me. Pay was pretty comporable to work required, just wasn't a career unless you were full time."
good,This position helped  me further develop my professional skill as they apply to customer interaction and managing inventory. I was able to apply my personal knowledge of gardening and wildlife to position product and to coach new employees on the Home Depot work environment.
good,"Buen Ambiente de trabajo, aunque nos saben como ejercer y darle continuidad a problemas fuertes"
good,"to many favorites , it was alright . not the greatest job I have had. "
good,Did start out as part-time and advanced to full time and to a lead person. Was there when co went from owners to public. There were a lot of upper MGMT change that was effecting all stores
good,great job if you are a hard worker. They tend to hire people who know what to do or is ready to learn which makes is a great team. Nice place to work for a part time or full time job
good,"Great place to work. Managers work together to accomplish tasks. choice of length for lunch break. Learn alot about DIY projects. "
good,It was ok. Not that great of a place to work. Not great if you want to get paid more or if you want job advancement. Employees will point fingers if they make a mistake and tell you it was not there fault. Some of the Manager will not lift a finger.
good,not the best place to work at mainly because of the lack of care towards employees in a general basis. this is a workplace where many things need to be done and who does them is not important.
good,"In my current position, the days can be slow but I have had the opportunity to help other departments to keep busy. I've learned a lot of skills at this company that I can take with me in my future endeavors. The most enjoyable part of the job are the wonderful people you get to work with everyday."
good,"It's stressful, underpayed and corporate likes to play a bunch of stupid games. You can bust your butt and have nothing happen to you in your favor. The people you work with are about the only good thing there besides for the benefits."
good,this place is amazing. i love it so much. very much. the people are so amazing and they are so helpful and great with their advice. i will always come here
good,Can be a fun environment when you begin to learn what customers want and how to help them with their projects. Fast pace and learning the equipments can help you in the future.
good,The management in paint and flooring was very discomforting but had good days and bad days like every other job would. But over all a very fun place to work at
good,This place was fast-paced and was very hard work. Of course you have to work with the public's needs and you also need to handle a lot of merchandise. We also had to fill orders for contractors.
good,No management support for rude customers. Not enough technically qualified people to work in the contractors department. Had to work a lot of overtime to accommadate customers.
good,I started as a cashier at Home Depot and quickly advanced up to Service Desk then Head Cashier.  I was happy with the quick pace of the job and all the responsibility I was given.  I am happiest when I have a challenge and Home Depot gives you that.
good,Good customer service experience when being a cashier. I was able to work on enhancing my customer service skills. Good interaction with co-workers and customers.
good,"working in receiving is a good job for younger employee, fast paced job when required to unload trailers, restacking shalfes is made back some what, fellow employees good to work with for the most part"
good,"come in to review the work station, make sure associates know what the plan is that day, keeping the customers call bin in tack, over see register transactions, constantly maintain a clean environment for associates to work."
good,"Not bad for my first job, but would not recommend long term. I started as a cashier and it was great to get working experience. They were very flexible when it came to changing my schedule for school."
good,"The employees were great, but management was lacking. There is really no chance for growth at an acceptable rate of pay. Not many team building activities to bring unity to the group."
good,The people were great. Most days were slow and if left alone they got monotonous. most days we were understaffed. Customers were understanding and never saw corporate often
good,"The days feel long and stressful, but you have a team with you to get the tasks for the day done.  Management is only pushing you to do your best, but it may be pushing you too hard."
good,I learned a lot with my time in home depot. would have preferred a more set schedule or something more consistent. Provided me with great work experience
good,"Can not move into a full time position "
good,250 employees in that building and only 50 actually work. Management just did not care about the employees. So much room for improvement if there's just simply a management team that cared about the whole team.
good,The Home Depot offered no career advancements. When working a 8hr shift once and awhile management would not give me a mandatory breaks. Would have to work by myself at the most busiest times of the day.
good,"Home depot is good if you don't want a job that is monotonous, for the most part. If they need help in another department, then usually they'll send you there; so you may not work in the same department every day. However the hours are difficult sometimes, with 5 am shifts."
good,"The Home Depot is in the home improvement business and they goal is to provide the highest level of service, the broadest selection of products and the most competitive prices."
good,Heavy lifting and pulling. Hard work for a woman. Extremely warm weather inside the trailers. I think it was a work overload for just one person. I probably wouldn't ever try that again
good,"A typical day at work involved constant customer interaction, in a diverse workplace. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping to satisfy customers' needs."
good,"Pay was good and work was steady. The only issues I had was with our new manager who didn't give a hoot in h3ll about his employees, only the numbers and how useless the Homer fund was in most cases. I had to leave because the city I was working in costed so much on food and gas that I would barely have 20$ by the time my next paycheck came around."
good,"Love the people I work with, its like family with some people. Management needs to be re-trained to be for the employee, and show compassion. Needs to be like it was a be like family. All they care about is money, which if they took care of the employees then the employees would be happier to help customers and give better customer service in the long run. Plus they need to give better wages to employees that have knowledge and hire people with the knowledge."
good,"Definitely not a bad place to work, but the pay is low, as it is still a retail job, even though one is usually required to do work more in line with a warehouse than a retail store."
good,"No real negatives but not incredibly stimulating either. No complaints, although management presence is almost imperceptible and employees are often left to solve problems on their own. Great if you like empowerment and autonomy, not so much if you're a lemming."
good,"I didn't work at home depot for a long time, but it was a little more relaxed than I expected it to be. First day I was thrown into my department with not as much knowledge as I needed. Learned quickly how to use all the equipment."
good,"Advancement opportunities are great. A lot of good people there. Hardest part of the job is it's a lot of physical work, and hardly ever enough employees."
good,"Dont be 30 seconds late because  that's a tardy and everything is based on a point system,  depending on what department you are in depends on how th ge job will be, they train you well and are great team workers so always showup and work very hard and learn as you go."
good,"During my employment with The Home Depot, I was introduced to the world of distribution centers and the fast paced, constantly on your feet workplace, that goes hand in hand with supplying materials to many places all over the world."
good,"I would have loved to continued working for the Home Depot organization, but the starting hour for this job was just too early.  The person I work with was very pleasant and good instruction."
good,"Lots of opportunities, but I never had enough appointments, and that hurt because I was straight commission. They had changed policies as not covering any travel expenses."
good,"a day at home depot it was always a surprice  never know what to do , many people where late every day but I love working at the home depot ,because is nice working whit people."
good,Hours are ok. Not very much overtime. The environment is loud with alot of movement. There inside condition is usually dependent on the weather outside.
good,The place was alright if you need to make money its a good place to work at and rent is cheap in the area I would not work this job again.They try to make it a cool place to work .
good,Not enough hours in a week fun people to work with  some managers are ok departments are better to work in more to do  cash is ok but you have to stand
good,Home Depot was pretty fun and laidback I really liked the managers they were really cool and chill and they were flexible with our hours for high school students other than that it was a laid back job
good,Home Depot was a part time job for me when my children were very young.  I was able to have a flexible schedule.  It worked out well for me at the time.
good,"The work place has a balance of fast pace/cruise time.  "
good,I was a contract worker. I did not work for Home Depot directly. I worked at many Home Depots. I did not interact with many employees overnight only the crew I worked with.
good,"Mostly Enjoyable - Work there too long, perfer not to go into details here as there is a reason I am looking for new employement but dont think I need to go into details here."
good,"The company or each store is a team and the ratings within the company are by store. There are some individuals that stand out, but most is looked at and as a team. There are bonuses or contests for some positions."
good,The co-workers were good to work with. Like most big box stores you have to learn to be gunge hoe about the company. If you like that type of atmosphere than it can be fun.
good,"If your have a work experience with wood or tools it would be a great place to work. Great place to learn a new trade. Also, the garden center you will learn the different types of mulch and insecticides."
good,"Typical day at Home Depot was whatever, lame management, no help from anyone, people are missing from their departments. I didn't bother to try my best after a while. I learned how to go about the freight team, I loved it but pay was an absolute joke for the amount of work we were doing and the hours are awful."
good,Learned to operate order picker/stocker. Was a stock so typical day was to make sure the store was grand opening ready for the next day. Very laid back.
good,"Home depot is a good job to have for a kid who is in high school, and looking to save money for a car or something of that matter. But for a career I dont think so, unless you are looking to move up in the company."
good,You get to connect with a lot of customers as well as other employees during the process and it is a fast paced team based job. You get to take in a lot of knowledge that can help you outside of work if you plan on any building/fixing/construction type of projects.
good,I worked long and hard hours but it paid off because I was able to advance to a manager with a diffrent company because of my experience. I would recommend this job to anyone who asks me.
good,I worked on my own most of the day and didn't have full support of staff. A lot of days were spent with nothin to do and there was no drive to make my position take on more task.
good,Great people both customer and employees. Hard work lots of heavy lifting and on your feet all day. My only complaint was my schedule and they were unable or unwilling to make any modifications to it.
good,I was a lot younger when I worked for this company I would recommend this job for someone in high school or while in college not for me because earning potential was limited.
good,"I've learned a lot while I've been with the company. The company is piloting a new labor module cutting back part timers hours, leaving the customers unhappy about lack of staff and they let you know about it. The pay is not enough for me to do what I want to do with my life. The stock options are nice, however the ability to pay a monthly mortgage on a house is just not possible."
good,I want a career to excel and work full time hours. I am flexible and can work any shift if needed. With store I had to work what was needed and some weeks did not work enough hours.
good,Home Depot has several supply chain management systems that operate in different ways (different protocols)- across a broad spectrum of worldwide suppliers.
good,"I do not wish to ""review"" my current employment. It's a good place for some, and not for others. I just feel I've outgrown it and need to move on. Nothing more, nothing less."
good,Hourly rate did not equate to the manual labor needed to perform job. Dress code was not fair based upon the department assigned to. I do not suggest working here for anybody that has an option to work elsewhere.
good,"Learned a lot from my manager. The people there were all so nice and friendly. "
good,"Pleasant environment with a hardworking culture."
good,"Everyplace has pro's and con's, at the Home Depot they pick and choose who they like. They push their good workers to exhaustion, with out reward and the workers who only work there for a paycheck gets all the reward weather they do the job right or not."
good,not to much to say. a lot to offer as far as learning and expanding your opportunities. management was fair and helpful and work days vary to seasons.
good,"Daytime and Nighttime MEAs perform different tasks.  Night time MEAs create new sku ""Homes"".  Daytime performs regular maintenance very similar to store associates."
good,"loved the customer interaction, it felt like family there with staff and management.  I would still be there if it wasn't for the need of more hours at another site"
good,"I worked part time. Management was good to work with associates that were good to work with the store. I was allowed to work extra multiple times, but was never scheduled more than I told them I could work."
good,"I enjoyed working at Home Depot. They just rarely offer full time positions. I'm pretty sure the benefits are amazing. The store is very clean, organized and customer friendly"
good,Lots of walking down the long aisles. Learned a bit about flooring and various departments. Received fork lift training. Was able to transfer from out of state and city.
good,Being a cashier at Home Depot is pretty easy but sometimes it can be boring if we aren't busy.  You would think that you could get an employee discount for working there but that isn't a benefit.  It's hard to get full time hours at the location that I worked at.
good,"You don't start out making much. The Incentive programs are okay but they feel more like a meager compensation for that low pay than anything. It's relaxed environment and the management are generally friendly. One big issue I had with them is that they refuse to hire new employees on full time, and I think it has to do with the benefits package. Typical retail stuff. It makes for a good transitional job but If you're looking to support a family, you may want to look for something more serious."
good,"As a first job this position was actually perfect, however this is not a position that I recommend staying in for too long. The social life here is about the equivalent of high school, and even if you want to be left alone in your work, eventually you will be dragged into it somehow. Either try to move up on the corporate ladder or try to find another position elsewhere."
good,Great second job for some extra cash or in high school or collage great people to work with had a lot of fun out going people easy going great job recommended
good,was a fun place to work but management was horrible. department was left understaffed and with no department head for months even when multiple people stressed that we needed extra hands in our area.
good,"the management between stores is not always what it should be, and as a result, an associate can loose his/her livelihood. I am saddened that that is all I have to say."
good,"Being a contractor at home depot cac sucked. My contract was ended early due to the budget. I thought that I would become permanent, but I was mislead. The entire thing was unorganized, There was no official training for the position. We were only shadowing other employees, and then thrown out there to work without formal training that was standard for other employees. It was basically unorganized"
good,I enjoyed working at Home Depot. I enjoyed the people I worked with as well as working with the public. It was a good learning opportunity. For me it seemed a good company to work for.
good,"thoroughly enjoyed my time with this emploter. This was a fun part time job. Nice employees, nice customers, acknowledgement of skills was given, Comfortable working atmosphere. Easy to learn job"
good,"8 hour work day, Monday through Friday, no weekends. Good place to work, good management. Learned how to drive various forklifts, reach trucks and pallet jacks."
good,Worked for a temp agency so you didn't get a lot. there was no vacation or sick time. You did all the hard work for home depot.  We did more work then home depot employees.
good,"A lot of work to be done, keeps you busy, yet also stressed to take care of things. I learned more about supervising here than almost all of business school. The actual hands on work isn't bad, customers are customers, but the deal breaker is your coworkers. My problems were with having few cashiers to use and uncooperative people for the few I did have. I just wish people would either show up to work or stay home. Don't come in if you just want to stand around. Management was wishywashy about handling the problem people, some helped and some didn't. It's great when your shift coworkers are there and want to work. It's a nightmare when you get the people that don't."
good,"The training was presented in a ""fast and furious"" manner.  Having never worked in a hardware store, I was unable to assist customers nearly as much as I would have liked to and, rather, had to rely on knowledgeable co-workers."
good,They have  good and bad management and everybody in management do what they want when it come to the associated. If they work together it would be a better place but that's just at my store
good,"I did emylee coaching. Customer semirars"
good,"Good company, lots of benefits.  Not enough pay for the flak you deal with. Goodbye weekends. Managers make bank, but floor level doesn't get much. Some promises it delivers on, others they do not."
good,Part time work will never make an employee bleed orange. When I was hired in 1994 it did hire full time staff and eventually changed its policy to part time only. Bring back Bernie and Arthur ways.
good,Ok place to work if you Want to Save and meet new people  I Would Recommend this job for People From ages 16-24 to Work there very Enthusiastic friendly  Environment . Everyone was Nice very clean
good,"The Home Depot is a great place to shop and work, but there are a couple of down sides low pay, hard to move up even if you are very customer oriented and  knowledgeable about the departments you are working in."
good,"not a good place to work if you have a real degree. no weekends off if your part time and never enough staff to help the customer s"
good,Home Depot was a great company before! I don't know what happen. Home Depot suppose to be a good place to work but not no more. Customer Service is poor. Associate's who get hired is very young but don't help out. Like I tell people if you don't want a job I will glady give someone who is in need of a job. Management is not so great lack of support with their Associates. An more but people will find out soon.
good,"no employee discount, but great rewards program, management needs to listen more to the employees, if you are not passionate about construction don't apply here! you will receive PK training every month and it gets really tiring and repetitive!"
good,i appreciate a workplace that allows me to learn something new everyday. Some tasks may be repetitive but there are different scenarios that happen everyday that allow me to learn something different that i didnt know before.
good,I worked in the hardware department it was a physical job and I would come home some days and be really sweaty and tired. This job was a face to face with customers.
good,Opportunity was full of different situations which made work very exciting and interesting.  Enjoyed giving my input to help consumers with their home décor.
good,"A typical day at home depot would be very competitive if the store is busy. During the summer, you would be on your feet all day. The most enjoyable part is the Christmas party and the random events."
good,"we had a store manager while i worked there that was overbearing and constantly finding reasons why our performance was subpar."
good,Very hard place to work at. You can close a shift at night and leave there at 11pm and you have an opening shift the next day.  Difficult to get used to.  Have constant customers yelling at you because they cannot speak to a manager and the manager's don't back you up.
good,management needs improvement where there should all be at the same page and be able to communicate to associates what needs to get done in the workplace
good,"There's always something to do. It's a high paced retail environment.  It can be a fun place to work at, however the hours and expectations can make it very stressful and challenging, especially for department heads and the rest of management."
good,They were understanding I had just had a child when i started working there.They worked with my now exhusband&I to make sure one of us was with child.
good,For me this is something to do for right now. They are pretty flexible with my schedule. They can improve on positive follow up when an employee has concerns about another employee's lack of performance.
good,the company can expect a lot but they work well with you. just have to be vocal about what you want or can do. The people that i work with are very nice but customer can be a little difficult
good,"Good company to work for, must have a passion to really work with kids. Salary is not that great and will need to do better on that. Overall good comapny"
good,They like training employees almost in all departments they give them excellent Training Services you watch computer videos to help you understand and take testing to make sure you're qualified for the job that you're applying for if it's an flooring Plumbing tools Lumber there's all types of training also training for management sales associate management good company to work for
good,Customer Service is stressful getting yelled at constantly by customers. The customers degrade you and undermine you and your bosses don't back you up when you follow policy which makes you only look worse.
good,"As an appliance sales associate most of your work occurs when you have customers looking to buy appliances and some days can be really slow, so things can get boring easily. On the other hand customers expect you to be an expert on all the appliances(you won't always be which isn't a problem) so it's good to study which appliances are best at what when you have free time. We are also responsible for keeping appliances clean and managing any shelves in our department as well as kitchen and bath. If things get too slow a manger might ask you to help in another department."
good,Always remain in great spirits it’s a lot to deal with all these different kind of people. Just go the professional route. You have a lot of costumers that come in the store and feel like if you’re new you can’t help them. Reassure them you are there to help and get to it.
good,The Home Depot was a good place work but was very demanding.  It was hard to balance the various metrics.  The pay was not very good and that is why I left.
good,there are a lot of things to review about the home depot.  I did typical things every day while at work and they typically consisted of all of regular things that occur.
good,it is a good place to work fun co workers who also know when to be serious....managers take time to teach you about the product and with mistakes if made they take time to show you what you did wrong and how to correct it
good,"Typical day at work would be to get on a register and ring people out and get them out the door while also providing great customer service. Also, making sure that the other cashiers around you got their breaks and lunches just the same as you."
good,"Gave me a job when times were tough. Management above store level likes to micromanage, they want your opinion, but will do what they want to anyway.."
good,"very lay back. we work together as a team,sometimes it can be stressful when trying to provide great customer service.great rewards and food for fundraising ."
good,"fun place to work, always learning something new, people were great to work with, management was fair, training was good, benefits great, however hours were long."
good,the retail environment was good to learn the sales process.  overall i did not enjoy the way personnel were treated.  there was a attitude of ownership form managers that was not favorable to employees.
good,i cant believe your making me write a review to this stuff i don't want to right a revue for them stop asking me to do so i would like if you wold not make me do this
good,"i just made keys for customers, and served as a customer service. it was busy at times. i also put labels on different key style. Also i make sure that the display looks good."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of assisting Pro-customers with creating a order to either pick up at the store or have delivered to their job site. Helping in store customers with problems/customers, returns or purchases"
good,racist people they hated me always rushed me to do things but this is a great place to work just do your job and dont focus on other peoples negative feedback.
good,it was a ok job the people was nice the manager sucked and her favorites didnt get too move up after 12 years it was a long drive away its a lot of work plenty of customers but the workers some are
good,I was a rep for a cabinet refacing business affiliated with home depot.  I didnt enjoy cold calling people or bothering people while they were shoppin
good,"It is a good fast pace it will keep you on your toes, but they don't have any coverage. They will cut your hours very quick. And what they pay you can not live."
good,I didn't have the best experience at Home Depot.  Management was okay depending on who you were dealing with.  During the spring they will put you in the mulch pen for multiple days in a row.  I injured myself because of this.
good,"I have neither complaints nor praise for Home Depot. While it makes an excellent attempt at making its employees feel value behind the scenes with barbeques, and other such events, it is all about the customer. To the point of ignoring rules or walking over sales associates. Which is fairly typical of any retail industry."
good,"As a lumber associate I move frequently and lift objects that are about 20 to 50 pounds. I am taught about many products such as a pressure treated would that is specifically used for out doors, so I am moderately experienced with building materials."
good,The morale was a little low because it was a tough place to work.  So many customers with not enough coverage.  The people were great but management was not the most helpful.
good,decent place to work but sometimes lower levels of supervision believe they are Gods and make you feel like you are nothing but low level workers.  Some management was good though
good,Team members were great everyday was an adventure.there were plenty tools to use that made the job easier such as the Home Depot app. I enjoyed assisting customers with whatever was needed of me at the time.
good,I just did my job the boss wasn’t very friendly but the coworker some of the best people I ever work with it. Homedepot is not a bad job it’s actually great for a first job. It teaches you a lot
good,"They chew you up and spit you out and nothing else to add except This process is a Joke!   "
good,"Home Depot offers very good benefits, however the hourly wage is too low. Management is unfocused, they do not train employees well. The philosophy is to utilize short incomplete training videos, without follow up or managerial oversight"
good,I open all the time so getting everything clean up and make sure the place look nice and help anyone who need help the workplace was nice but the covering suck and the hard thing is lift heaving tile because I work on hard side of the store. I think the best think that I like was to see different people doing different project.
good,A typical day at home depot is calling customers to come p/u their orders. Assisting customer with returns and online orders. PROVIDING EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICES. Opeming up credit cards.
good,Working at Home Depot is a great company with many job opportunities. There are several locations and easy for the everyday commuter.  Home Depot gives training to those who have no experience.
good,Good to very good place to work Comfortable environment and friendly staff. Lacks some training aspects that would allow you to be successful sooner and move upward.
good,"Too many upper management to prove you can do the job. Also, management changes their mind too often without seeing the effort and time spent on the project. They need to set up a plan to eliminate excessive call in/no show to work as it effects customer service."
good,Working here was great at first. Then I saw the true side of the management and I did not like it . If you want to advance in the company it is comparable to holding a carrot in front of a horse .
good,It was a decent job. Really convient with hours. I would have stayed there if it wasnt a seasonal position. i liked my managers and my co-workers. It was a good job.
good,would tell a friend to apply for a job Sometimes the physical work is demanding. puts safety first. has good training classes. management works well with associates
good,"Home depot was not a bad place to work, but it did not fit my schedule at that time. I also had some problem with discrimination. I thought they handle it well and fast."
good,The Home Depot is a busy place with a lot of work to do and the pay is low as a cashier. Maybe you can buy food for your family and gasoline. It is not a bad place to work but pay is very low.
good,I enjoyed this experience for what it was while being at college at the same time. Take the opportunity if it's temporary - definitely a cool place to work at
good,High speed work place. Great people willing to help out when you need it. Great people and customers. Able to learn different parts of the store and departments
good,"non stop on your feet, must meet sales quota and obtain leads you must constantly push credit on people and protection plans. Hard to get recognised for the job well done"
good,"The employees at the particular store that I worked at weren't the best people. They weren't very friendly, and could even be called hostile. "
good,Low pay for the work you do and for the area you work in one of the lowest paying jobs in the area great benefits but low pay and the benefits are expensive
good,The team I worked with had issues almost every single night.  Either a co-worker would be in a bad mood or a manager would be in a bad mood.  This resulted in a lot less work getting done and overall drama.
good,While the job was great and fun the hours weren't so great and being night shift some of the people were a little strange. It was an interesting and eye opening experience. I never want to work nights again.
good,The work environment could be different depending from day to day especially if you are in certain departments some days you may be going up and down the store trying to help the customers and other days you could just be in your department not doing much of anything.
good,"The Home Depot has a great culture with lots of benefits. They work with your schedule & its peaceful. Great company. Ethics, morals & principles. Could have better pay for employees."
good,"Home depot at the time was a fairly new company, they had solid benefits and opportunities to move quickly within the business.  Pay and hours were fair."
good,a typical day was different day by day you could have a very busy day where you''l be nonstop  then you'll have days where it'll be a easy lite day ..
good,"A typical day starts with communication from a fellow associate from within your department. Customers are usually around that need help. Working products and merchandise within the department takes up a good portion of the day, if there isn/t too many customers around. Otherwise time is mostly dedicated to people shopping."
good,"days were filled with fun that great coworkers give to one another.  employees were underpaid, under appreciated and overworked. Management was poor most of the time not having the skills to supervise employees.  i did learn tons about building"
good,"Worked at the service desk, many challenges, helping people with orders, working in departments, was a nice place with good employees, made a lot of friends"
good,Management was average there and employees were easy going. Workload was fair with a laid back environment to work in. Store was not very busy. Great job for college students.
good,"Home Depot is a great place to work as a supervisor if you want to stay busy.  However, the expectations and tasks expected for a department head are extremely high for a very low salary."
good,I wasn't happy with the pay that was given at the start as well as the small raises provided over time. Not a whole lot of advancement opportunities either.
good,"I enjoyed Home Depot's management but unfortunately it was brought down that you can make less than 27 hours a week and I watched people who had been working there for years and years some 20 Years, I watched them go from making over 40+ hours a week to making less than 27 hours a week and that can kill a family people were leaving left and right. I wouldn't go back. "
good,It was an experience to learn from. I enjoyed what I did for the time worked at Home Depot and would recommend working there to anyone in the vicinity.
good,"In many ways my first exposure to retail. I learned a lot of things good and bad. Unfortunately, in my store, most of the things were bad but it helped me to become a better worker."
good,"Great company to work for, this job was fun to me and I really enjoyed working there and would do it again. People and customers were nice and easy going..."
good,"It was a home improvement retail store with various duties ranging from stocking, cleaning but most importantly customer service. My main focus was always the customers experience."
good,"I was very young when I worked here fresh out of high school, so I wasn't able to stay there for and work myself up the way I would have liked to, but it was a great place to work while i was there and I have nothing bad to say about them."
good,"they were ok with hours but be careful, they will change the schedules and not notify you. Also the management lets employees walk all over them. They do not protect you from other employees."
good,"I think working at Homedepot is good, due to the fact that the hours are flexible, employees are friendly and nice to be around. Homedepot also Succuss sharing. Its basically a way of showing the employees a was  of appreciation"
good,"Very Busy Place to Work at and fast pace, working at the Front End of the Store.  Must have patient dealing with different age groups of customers.  Some of the items were a bit heavy for me, but I did the best I could."
good,"a typical day at work consist of directing customers with there shopping needs, provided excellent customer service ability to handle cash register and refund returns.greet and thank each customer ."
good,"Decent place to work at."
good,"I did not work store side, bu on the met team. I enjoyed it because it has set hours and you do not work weekends. If you are full time you get paid holidays, if you are part time you get half pay. It is very fast paced, and is hard work. I think the pay is on the low side for what work gets done."
good,"Actively engage customers to assess their needs and provide fast, friendly and exceptional customers service.  Transport goods to relocate materials storewide"
good,"the home depot was a great place to work, management were always stressed.The associates always tried to help each other out in the other departments. This is a company that anyone would love to work for, Just make sure that you can pass a background and drug test"
good,"The Home Depot is a decent place to work which gives annual raises.  While the pay isn't great, it is better than Walmart.  In the end, I did enjoy my time working there, but was unable to make ends meet without a better paying job."
good,entry level kept me busy although it did show opportunity for improvement it seemed like people had been there for centuries and were sttill unhappy....
good,"it was a good job to have, but the hours were pretty harsh so it was hard to keep going especially when i was balancing school at the same time so i cant really blame it on them"
good,Management lacks the ability to follow through when they discuss promotions and climbing the ladder with employees. For the most part employees are happy and the people working there create a family atmosphere.
good,I worked nights so it's quiet there. we start off with what tasks we need to do which is usually adjusting metal beans for shelving the products. The hardest part of the job was trying  to get the deadline for the tasks don on time. I like working nights.
good,Lots of standing and no team work at the Alvin store.l Customer Service desk needs more help than any other department. I learned alot of experience and watching how favoritism was performed with others.
good,I would say that Home Depot is OK overall in the short term but I can see a small number of people making it work in the long term sadly. Room for improvement.
good,it had its pros and its cons. they showed their employees appreciation and acted as a family. they also  thought they were doing something beneficial but it was the complete opposite.
good,"its a good place to work especially if you have it in you about customer service, retail. enjoyed my time working there. good employees but some management was bad."
good,It was an experience working at Home Depot.  I would not say Home Depot isn't a place to work but I wouldn't recommend it strongly. Management plays a lot of favoritism.
good,It is typical pavement pounding retail. Be ready for crazy hours and weekend and night work.  Can be fun at times.  Depends on who your manager is though.
good,"It can be stressful. Lots of customers and not enough associates to attend to the needs."
good,"For my specific job, I was an overnight merchandiser. The training that was received did not correlate with the skills needed to complete my job. With proper training this could be a great job."
good,The culture in home depot is very positive and community oriented and is followed most of the time. The day usually began with cleaning my department before our busiest sales hours would hit and the end of the day was mainly dedicated towards cleaning and inventory management. I learned much about various home improvement products the inconsistent hours made it difficult to manage my time outside of work.
good,I personally think it should be more development and roles in the Merchandising Department of The Home Depot (MET) and the pay should be higher for the amount of tasking that goes into (MET) as of the (MEAS).
good,"Good place to work, management is all for themselves though. Customers can become a little too much at times and managers not backing you up can make the workplace a little hostile"
good,Not much to say its Home Depot. Its exactly what you expect but with a little drama. Its fast paced for a few months then slows way down during the winter months.
good,"If you like to be on your feet, this is the job for you. You will literally be on your feet all day long. It's a regular retail job with a side of manual labour if youre in the lumber or garden depts. the other employees were pretty cool though, management was a little too strict at times."
good,"Safety checking in department ,fix problems ,most day focus for  help customer show products help with bay products,and installation services.Work with high pressure in Lowe's store ,deal with different type of customers."
good,okay place to work.  A lot of the people working here should not be as they are not too smart.  The managers were not the best and i could not get enough hours.
good,Working at home depot was familiar and comfortable. The people I worked with made the job. Some people had been there for 15+ years and were making the same hourly wage as me. Its sad to see when minimum wage goes up this company does not compensate.
good,Empresa socialmente responsable con oportunidad de crecimiento y capacitación continua
good,"It’s what the individual makes of it. Do what will make you feel like a success in the end, but to pay the bills it’s a job. They start out decent and stay to yourself."
good,There is a lot to know about plumbing and the training classes didn't cover everything. I did learn a lot by being on the floor but there could have been more training.
good,"Starts early a lot of heavy Lifting, Customer Service dealing with a lot of different personalities. Warehouse environment a safety focus store over all a enjoyable work environment."
good,"Overall work was interesting and varied. I learned a lot on how to manage my time and work as part of a team. Management within my direct organization was upbeat and helpful, but their were conflicts with store management as well as others outside my organization. Other than the requirements to lift over 50 pounds, bending, and stooping, this proved to be the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable was working with a team to accomplish a varied workload."
good,"We have a great team, and get along great. Great company to work for. Always there for eachother, and the management cares about their employees. We work and we play."
good,This is a great part time job and they were flexible with my school schedule. At times it can be a little stressful due to the fact of the high volume in the store and customer and contractor orders that had to be correct.
good,Personally the company wasn’t ran well enough. Wasn’t happy how I ran the biggest department in the store and still made the same amount as newbies who worked only about 1/3 of what I did.
good,The Home Depot has given me the opportunities to improve my professional skills. Experienced managers were a pleasure to work for. Younger managers micromanaged often. Freight Associates unload trucks and pack out product.
good,I love most of the customers and employees that I work with. I love my department supervisor but not that impressed with the higher management. I have also not been looked at for a promotion
good,The Home Depot is a fair place to work daily. typical day at work would consist of unloaded freight and processing it for store purchase.We processed everything at the stores minus plants and lumber.I learned how to operate a electric power jack and forklifts.Also receiving freight for correct counts and sku labels.Hardest part of the job was dealing with incorrect freight orders. The most enjoyable was learning new things in different departments.
good,"You come in work your job and leave, there is no hard part and there is always work to be done. Safety is the number one priority to protect yourself."
good,"Help customers, tackle work lists given from higher ups, front face and make sure aisles are cleaned and organized as well as making sure product is on the shelf for the customers."
good,Home Depot is a decent place to work and can be rewarding. The benefits package is great but the salary could be better. I enjoy what I do as a marchandiser.
good,"Home depot teaches you great core values to take with you to any job that you want. "
good,The job has been set up in a way that you can succeed and advance if you perform your duties but when I was working there I was asked to do things differently and criticized for wanting to be the best employee I could be.
good,I enjoyed working here as well. The only reason I left was because I was trying to better myself. I actually learned somethings there about plants and what looks good in yards.
good,Overall the home depot was a great place to work at throughout my 8 years with the company. Although i dont agree with the way i was terminated i have nothing but respect for the coworkers and management. Thought i was overworked and underpaid for what i did and scheduling was never fair
good,I do love work for Home Depot: I just needs something  new at the moment Home Depot is great place to work if don’t bill and kids  I needs some new experience!!!
good,lots of free parking. Friendly environment. mostly part time work. Can pick up extra shifts. lots of free training.  Computer program is a little hard to get used to but OK after you figure it out.
good,The management can use some serious overhaul.  The turnover for management is ridiculous.  The HR team has only certain associates they like to help.  Some leaders get away with disrespect to associates and others are very unprofessional.
good,not much to say. its a big box store that squeezes every cent it can out of its already underpaid employees. Management is sub par. if all you want is just a job to make a little bit of money or to meet some okay people then this job isnt bad.
good,"Home depot has a culture of giving to their customers & community. Benefits are avail to full time employees, although you do need to pay for insurance, and retirement. Advancement is avail depending on management at the particular store. I found some managers play favorites to certain employees."
good,Good pay but many hours and driving in my territory it is LARGE. Overall a good place to work but it does require many hours especially in summer and spring.
good,Easy to outgrow this retail environment. If you stay a few years you'll most likely see your store manager turn over and assistant managers change. Expect to be perpetually understaffed if you're in a smaller store.
good,"If it wasn't for the lack of advancement and the customers themselves, home depot wouldn't be that bad to work for. I would gladly go back if i knew i wouldnt get stressed working there."
good,"Home depot had some good fun times while working there, but I decided to move on after having my son for a higher pay rate.  I would recommend to young people as a starter job."
good,very easy place ot work and become comfortable i was trying to work there for one month and stay for almost a year. kinda nuts how easy the work was but the pay reflects that.
good,This was a temporary job while I was in school. Learned a lot about shipping and receiving. Trained on reach truck and forklift. Hardest part of the job was maneuvering around the store on reach equipment while the store was still open to customers.
good,"Cashier, Service Desk, Lawn and Garden cashier, Pro Desk Cashier. Flexible hours but only part time. No real room to get to full time. Was not the best to move up."
good,"Like all box store, Home Depot has the potential of being a great company to work for, however, and most unfortunate, Home Depot doesn't invest back into their employees, therefore, management treats their employees as collateral losses."
good,It’s been a long time since I worked for Home Depot. It was part time in college.  It was a good job that was a great stepping stone to a career.   Thanks
good,This company wasn't the best to work for. The hours were not up for change and you were treated as if you were just a number when you asked for a day off.
good,"1. Task work and must be finished before you leave"
good,"This is employment for people who want a job, but not a career.  Raises are terrible and the advancement is just not there.  I did enjoy my fellow employees."
good,I myself resigned because for one the managers they uses  their position for leverage to hold it against the assoc . for that person not to advance then they gossip behind someones back .then when it gets out they cover it up through the head manager. that is so not cool.I left because of the threats that i received so i already knew that nothing would not get done and it is so sad.As long as the assoc. make them look good that's all that matters to them.I was a very good worker i got feedback on my surveys before i left i had my review and it was awesome.
good,"The home depot was an good experience, I've learned new things as in learning how to operate a bally-more. The management there was ok, they actually reward associates for their hard work. At the home depot the hardest part of the job was trying to finish the job in a timely manner. After all the experience there was very enjoyable, the associates were nice and very kind and friendly."
good,working at home depot was not bad at all. management was great and I'm glad I was once part of that company. the hardest part of the job was daily promoting sales
good,"Started off as Lot attendant, then become a pro loader/ lot attendant. Enjoyed working with contractors of various trades. When power hour(busiest hour) came there was always a shortage of employees scheduled to work."
good,work place culture is good but my experience with retail was not fun at that time. There is the opportunity for growth and a better pay although there is no fixed schedules and that makes furthering your educatiol very difficult.
good,"This was HOMEDEPOT .COM a warehose that catered to online patio furniture  and accessories.Ireall think it was an experiment, because was open for long."
good,"It proved to be difficult to find someone to help you when needed. Management seems to favor garden center over other aspects of the store, including pulling orders."
good,Management was the focus problem for the main situation. For my personal situation I asked management to talk with a fellow co-worker but they insisted he be allowed to sit on his phone and not help.
good,"I worked here when I was younger and just starting out, It was a good full time job with steady hours and fair pay. Lots of room to advance within the company."
good,great place to work hopefully ill come back soon if I ever need too thank you for letting me be a part of this work place. I truly enjoyed the company of my coworkers and the great friendly customers.
good,"I had a good experience overall at the Home Depot I worked at, my co-workers were enjoyable and it was fast paced which is something I like in a job. Working there taught me how to deal with bad attitudes and rudeness of people. I did not like how supervisors/ management treated the young people who worked there."
good,Manegment was good but when you are capable of doing more then one job title the really use that to there advantage. Enevirments where good to a point
good,"The Management Needs Work, The Company Needs Work To Be Better For Not Only The Customers But The Associates(Recognition,Better Pay,Fairness,Etc). "
good,My managers have drawn out alot of good people because of favoritism. People who have been there longer in the same position don't get respected. I have talked to several people who moved stores and are happier at other locations because of management.
good,"My typical day included greeting customers, checking out items that were being purchased, return items, helping customers look for products with in the store, computer training and very little on the job training by my supervisor or assistant General Manager"
good,"I didn't really like the store i was in. i met some great co-workers, but the environment wasn't that great. I wanted to work in a specific department but i wasn't allowed to do so."
good,"There are very good benefits for full timers. Part timers are not as respected. They are constantly educating the team independently."
good,"Its ok, but its not what I'm looking for in a career, I don't have anything else to say in regards to this company.   I don't like the hours, because they close at 10pm during the summer and from 9pm to close there is hardly any customers."
good,"A typical day for me as the Freight Team Supervisor i get in at 9pm and begin to assess how big the truck for the night is. Then i begin to lead my my team of 26 associates to start rolling out all the freight so it can be worked. Along with the regular freight that comes in we also have other trucks that come in on different nights such as Behr paint, windows and doors and also a separate freight truck that can be half a truck or a full truck. At times there isn't enough time to work on all of this which can cause the team as a whole to back up."
good,"If you  want to make a living, than this job is not for you. Your working in retail/department store. Your not learning about how to new skills/apprentices. Unless your a retired plumber/electrician/contractor you won't actually be able to provide information to customer."
good,I had a mediocre time while here. I cant complain and I also have nothing overly positive to say. They do try to low ball people on wages when they have others making more that do not posses the proper knowledge for there title or position.
good,"typical day goes by fast stock wood and building materials, cut wood, take things out to the car, and assist guest with questions, there isn't much work to be done but interesting to learn about"
good,I was a cart pusher when I worked for Home Depot. I really did not like this job because I was working out in the elements. I had to retrieve carts in any type of weather.
good,Home Depot had a great environment to work in. Had plenty of help when needed to complete tasks that were assigned. If needed could call on other departments for help.
good,"when you first star within 90 days if you have an emergency you are penalized.  They have very heavy materials ,over 70 lbs that is expected to be lifted by one person when the container shows 2 person lift."
good,It's alright if you work there long enough you'll be able to attain that plus great staff and team members are around to help and assist in getting things sone
good,"Great benifits, associates are nice to talk to, hours are flexible if you are the type to need more time off, fun environment to get to know new people"
good,"It's the number one retailer of choice for a reason. The company has a cyclical turn in management fiscally, is one reason why it is a good place to work but if have career goals understand its not long term employment."
good,"fast paced, friendly environment. there was always a supervisor nearby in case you were stuck in a situation. they were ready to help. i enjoyed my time their."
good,I enjoyed working with the public and interacting with my co-workers. I felt the management team was a bit disorganized and could have been much more effective.  Home Depot had required a monthly sales goal while paying a dollar over minimum wage without any type of comission structure.
good,"A wonderful place to pickup knowledge about home improvements , projects, gardening, plumbing and many more.  Employees shares knowledge with each other and finds ways to improve"
good,"Great place to work "
good,"We work very hard for this company. We have good and fun activities, we also have some free lunch for special l events.They also have a growth development."
good,"Scheduling isn't stable thus: Alot of people either quit , transfer or point out and are fired."
good,"Being a retail company, The Home Depot is a very demanding, fast-paced place to work and gain experience.  Great financial benefits, but slim on PTO benefits."
good,"They have limited positions such as ""associated"" ; but there ae many areas to work as a ASSOCIATE"".   Ideally you will began part time and receive only dental benefits,  obtaining full time status will equire"
good,The Home Depot call center was a decent place to work when you're a kid and you don't have a family to support. Graveyard shift and simple duties meant it was flexible for all kinds of lifestyles.
good,"Good job if you don't mind seasonal work, or fast paced work. It was seasonal for me and they made it a competition on who wold get the position that they don't tell you is available until the week before they decide to make a decision who they will keep. Only one position available for each section of the store."
good,This company is all about training. When you do work. You are usually in a department that is understaffed. A company is only as good if the Management does their job correctly.
good,delivery department had to pull orders all day to get ready for transport next day had a list of things to do. worked in various depts throughout the week
good,"A typical day as a cashier at this company involves rotating positions between the pro-desk, returns, outdoor (garden center), self-checkout option, and general registers. Management is communicative and supportive although it is unlikely you'll find room to advance within any reasonable time frame. Front end is generally distant from merchandising. Hours can vary wildly, though this is typical for a position like this. Working outdoors in the garden center can be enjoyable but this is highly dependent upon the weather."
good,home depot pays twice a week for the hours and the work they provide they do not pay for the man power that is needed. Moving up in the company is harder to come by do to the fact positions arent available.
good,Home Depot offers a decent 11 per hr rate and will give you as many hours as you want at first. Once business slows down they cut your hours by as much as half and still drive you to work hard toward a part time position. They never give any reassurance about wiether or not you’ll be kept and they show little to no employee appreciation.
good,I work in the garden shop. It is a rwally nice place ro work. I would recommend this job to others. Not a bad place to work at. Great people and good management. Great people.
good,"Interacted with a customer-service focused approach, resolving any issues regarding in-store and online purchases. Utilized cashier experience making transactions with customers up to $20,000 per day Prepared new employees how to use the P.O.S. Systems."
good,"I would come to work sign in and start unloading trucks and receiving product for the store, then start packing it down for the night crew to put out on the shelves."
good,My co-workers are a pleasure to work with. We are pretty much supportive of each other. The new management team  are wonderful. The customers are the best.
good,lack of training for supervisors never able to get along with mgrs assts were ok to get along with  ceo never came thru night receiving not what the drivers wanted
good,"can go from knowing nothing to knowing a lot after a year of working there.  breaks, and lunches are timed and you will always get a lunch.  Associates you work with are typically very friendly.  Management not so good."
good,Work environment depends on the store and how busy the store is. The flow on new employees is constant and few stay over six months. Hardest part of the job is dealing with customers.
good,"Home Depot is a hardware store that also doubles as a warehouse, so safety is a general issue brought up quite a bit. Working weekdays is great, however on the weekend is when customer issues seem to populate more."
good,I enjoyed working here only because of the friendships I made and the people I met. working here I learned a lot not just about the store but how to be self sufficient.
good,"I did believe that the home depot was a great place to work, BUT the coworker and stress of the job is not worth the pay. Most managers were great other than the one I worked under."
good,I enjoyed my time a The Home Depot. Dealing with the clientele was enjoyable and fun. The environment was decent however I suffered from back pain from standing on cement all day.
good,they didn’t really give me and hours and said they would work with me going to school and everything but the pay wasn’t worth it i was working 3 positions and getting paid for one
good,Home Depot is a very fast pace working environment with constant interaction with customers at a retail level which to me was the most enjoyable part of my job.
good,I work there for about 2 years and liked it for the first year than I joined the army than that went down hill they put me in a different spot and I hated it
good,it is an ok place to work. u just gotta stand around alot clean your aisles and listen to all customers needs. slow paced but it can get hectic at times.
good,Many nights closing 3 departments on ones own begets more than what is normal for 1 person. Especially when the other associates do not work as hard. added onto that being a student didn't help too much.
good,they do not listen to their employees and dont care to promote from within   a lot of retail politics and its a male driven work environment not open to promoting women
good,I enjoyed my employment at The Home Depot. I got to work around many good people. The only reason I left was to make earn better wages and a full time job elsewhere.
good,"As a P/T from 4 - 8 hour shifts, totally random times and days. You can block off time but if you block off too much you get no hours."
good,"Work is very repetitive and routine. Cleaning, ordering supplies, working with store associates to merchandise products are primary duties. Wages are low but appropriate for duties."
good,"The pay is more than average retail. For the most part, customers are grateful for any help offered. There have been some issues with other associates but those were quickly addressed by management."
good,"Very Busy from start  to finish from when You Log I n. "
good,Working at The Home Depot was very stressful. Lines were always long due to several cashiers calling out. Managers didn't help us on the registers and customers were really rude. By far my worse job!
good,"This job requires a lot of physical activity. Standing and walking for eight (8) hours a day, use of ladders, and heavy lifting."
good,"Fairly easy job because we only worked at night didn't have to deal with customer too much. Enough work to keep you busy the shift."
good,Fun workplace with plenty of room for growth. Job security and plenty of hours to work. Experience a fast pace work site and working professional football and soccer games
good,I felt at home working with customers and co-workers the supervisor I had wasn't all that welcoming some of the management was good but It felt so competitive in there.
good,It’s was a good job but not enough hours for me. Co workers was nice but was drama in the work place.I asked for more hours but never got more hours and with the hours I got it was not enough to pay all my bills.
good,Good place to work if your a fast learner and willing to pick up others mess or work that did not get completed. You have to pick up a lot after your coworkers and when reported to management nothing was done. Worked could go to work and not do a single thing and still get laid and not get In trouble which is not fair to the workers who have to overwork.
good,"With every job there are ups and downs.  The down on this is that not everyone may leave happy or there may be a delay with an order or with a truck or installer leading to customer dissatisfaction.  Or if  everything does go right a customer may not acknowledge it.  The people that you work with are great are generally great and may know much about the department they are in and every other week there are celebrations of different holidays or a sales event.  It's a great place to work, but as any place it comes with a few frustrations."
good,"worked lumber department.,forklift driver..required to place pallets higher than comfortable or trained or experienced...continued negitive feedback..very stressful"
good,"Business pace is steady, busy, or absolutely slow. Fun staff, appreciation and safety is big. At times frustrating. But customer service can be. Appreciation makes anyone feel good. When people work together to  Create happiness for customers it's great."
good,"Is a very nice first job, but after a time passes hardworking goes uunrecognized. While the first few years were really good management shifts change that."
good,It is a fast paced store with lots of moving parts. You must be or learn quick knowledge about the area you are working in. Stressful and lots of heavy lifting.
good,typical day at work fast paced intense but competitive and enjoyable got a great workout loading and unloading trucks workplace culture was ok laidback
good,"Very fast paced  working with large quantities of cash,,credit cards,coupons.At the self checkout you must handle all four stations by yourself. Cannot leave your station until a reliever comes and most of the time they are late.You must ask each customer if they would like to apply for a credit card for Home Depot and if yes you must open one for them within 5 minutes."
good,Gather carts and water plants most of the summer time as well as loading up product into peoples cars. It can be a bit of a workout as it gets pretty hot during those times.
good,Enjoyed the fast paced working atmosphere.  Also enjoyed meeting and greeting new people.  They do need to pay more and give people more hours to work.
good,"not a bad place to work, but the ability to move up was difficult if not impossible. The people were nice, but not a job I would work for the rest of my life."
good,The employees were mostly nice and so was the management but the company itself was not great. They did not treat their employees real well and I heard constant complaints
good,A typical day at Home Depot was being at the contractors line. I learned how to give quality customer service. The hardest part of the job was standing on the cement floor for 4 to 6 hours at a time. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the customers.
good,All around good work environment fair benefits and pay. room for career advancement. Very good customer base and friendly in the community. i would say home depot is a fair place to work
good,"Overworked and underpaid. Can be a fun place to work but all the ""values"" they talk about are exactly that, all talk. The only good thing about them is the amazing benefits."
good,Being a cashier here is pretty easy as far as your everyday job...you see a lot of the same contractors everyday getting their supplies for their job so once they know you its a little easier.
good,"always busy but good community, managers make sure your comfortable makes sure you're OK. Hardest part is working at Home Depot is clocking out , try not to go over hours when still have work to finish"
good,"My typical day at work consisted of assisting customers with custom order windows. This is not an area I was familiar with, in return I was learning something new. Management was easy to get along  with."
good,"I work in plumbing,  hardware,  flooring,  millwork, electical, receiving,  cashier, head cashier, inventory manager, return desk, HD fork lift trainer"
good,"the lack of communication in my store is ridiculous, associates hardly pick up their phones. Our for sale or markdown signs are too broad vague. Also, its hard to keep up with rules and regulations because they are ever changing."
good,There was no typical day at Home Depot. In season is extremely busy with repairs and customers. I enjoyed and respected management which made it an enjoyable place to work.
good,Loved working with the customers.  Management at this store do not care about the employees.  Your made to feel under appreciated.  Many employees very unhappy and very hire turn over rate.
good,A day working there is to be hype if you get work because they or really slow with contracts. You know the construction site take time cause they do a lot of bidding.
good,"This is a great job for a retiree or student. Part time atmosphere, large company you feel like a small fish, all the employees get along and treat each other well."
good,It's okay if you like that type of career. I am working there to get on my feet however I would not recommend this for a full time job for someone who wants stable hours and good pay and benefits.
good,Every work week had different amount of hours I would work and it wasn't enough to survive a week. I learned a bit more of home products for the future.
good,Since I work majority at night it's not very stressful do to the lack of workers and customers. Due to that fact it makes it easier to get hard task done around the store.
good,I worked the register on a daily basis.  I assisted customers with their orders and finding products.  I also helped out in many different departments when they were short staffed.
good,"great work schedule. no nights, weekends or holidays. flexible schedule. paid vacation and sick time. pay should be MUCH MUCH more for how hard we work."
good,The company has changed over the years that I worked there. I love a good place that you can help customers and help the company to prosper. I was given a few  awards for assisting customers.
good,"their operation was unrealistic, prices are 15 years old cannot hire good personnel. poorly trained staff, they did not know their own policies, and warranties"
good,This is an okay company but it is mainly part time work very little full time work available so keep that in mind when applying at The Home Depot. Part time
good,Calm atmosphere. Workers are engaged. I enjoyed and value my experience as a sales associate. I will forever used theskills I gained from working there.
good,"I was all about my customers, but it was a customer that lied and got me out. District down in the south ,not fair. There's circle of people, not in circle. You gets nowhere. Certain people gets help in time of need,even though you contribute to homer fund. Management has gone in their personal monies to help certain workers. I was 2x platinum  a week before my 3.3 weeks before my 6 yr anniversary. Also was due for raise.  I was screwed by them. Benefits are good ,customers great."
good,Was a great job for someone who wanted to stand and do nothing. The cashier was a slow job but easy. It was easy for me to move from being a cashier to helping all over the store which made the job much better.
good,It is a great place to work as long as you keep busy but the minute you slow down it catches up with you.  The people were great and they taught me a lot.  I wish I could go back but I don't know.
good,"People get few to no hrs so full time benefits cannot be given, so employees often are fighting for hours which causes conflict between employees. Job and customers are usually fun and rewarding."
good,A typical day at work would be like getting ready to unload the lumber off the delivery truck to the home stock and by doing that I learned how to get use of the forklift. The hardest part of the the job would be dealing with the concrete mix bag and the most enjoyable part would be working on the garden center
good,Solid place to work. I was often performing different tasks and learning new skills I could carry over to other aspects of my life. I was paid well for the work I did.
good,"if you are young and have a free and open schedule and dont mind standing and interacing with custmers for 8 hours a day then byall means take the job, but if u have a family and need a set schedule and one that works with your kids or other things in your life then consider applying somewhere else"
good,"The management fear to communicate with each other. Pay raises are not what you expect, the most you can get is 50 cent each year after your review. The people are actually great to work with."
good,Close by with an easy commute. 
good,I learned a lot about home goods working for the Home Depot and I would say as you as an individual intend to learn this is a job where there are many different departments and so much merchandise it’s tons to learn
good,Home Depot is a good employer. They also offer a bonus every 6 months. The position I had was a cashier. I believe the cashier are more stressed compared to any other department because of the long lines.
good,"It's alright. Most of the time, I get to just lift heavy stuff and put it in the correct place within the store. It's chill, and there were times when I had a team around me that made me really enjoy the job. Still, I think there are some structural problems in hiring management."
good,"Very Busy sometimes slow depending upon the day or time. They were very cut throat because they absolutely do not pay about being there on time. My coworkers were awesome, but at the end of the day you did not come to work to make friends you came to work to get paid and go home."
good,"At this company you can work as little as you want. However, it is hard to advance and move to other departments. The management is pretty lenient, but you have to fight for benefits."
good,I would not recommend working there.  Managers are not helpful.  My favorite store to shop at.  Customer Service is a difficult position. They ask too much of them.
good,Update and maintain inventory. Customer Service.
good,"Home Depot was exactly what you would expect it to be. If youre part time you get treated like part time everywhere else, if youre full time you get treated like full time everywhere else. Its north myrtle beach so the workgroup is a little older than your usual store."
good,"Associates can be helpful and kind, very knowledgeable. Can be some conflict between associate, though not much. Lots of activities/extras for employees, like paid day lunches, silent auctions and special events for holidays. Most department supervisors are good, sometimes upper management in the store is not so great, but the regional management team is amazing and supportive. "
good,The staff are really friendly but get things done. I felt comfortable when working there like I belonged and fit in. I enjoyed the different cashier options as well.
good,Large company who care about there profits and yet push there people to the limit. They expect salary employees to work 60-70 hours aweek. Enjoyed my time at Home Depot  but worked very hard for the things I accomplished.
good,The company is a great company to work for. Is the only company that gives you yearly bonus. Unfortunately the management team are unprofessional and do not appreciate the supervisors
good,"the work was fast paced and sometimes difficult. but we always assisted each other when needed. however the manager was very bossy, pushy, lazy, and demanding"
good,"It's fun to learn new products and explaining how those products work with the customers, time goes fast on the job because you are busy with customers non stop"
good,Always had fun with some of my co workers. The only thing that was uncomfortable was the req. to get credit cards and standing by the register constantly.
good,As long as your not working the overnight shift.  Pay and benefits are decent in comparison to other like retailers.  Not a whole lot of career advancement opportunities...but overall not a bad place to work.
good,"The supervisor was annoying, he was following people around. He did not know the department well . i just do not understand why home depot can put an inexperience person to led others!"
good,"The managers were decent and so were the employees. i did not like their hours or the pay rate, but at the time I needed  job to help support my family."
good,I was a Department manager at Home Depot. It was twenty years ago or so. I really don't remember too much of my time there at all. The company was in the process of going public.
good,Poor treatment of contractors.Too many meeting for the sake of having meetings. Contractors isolated and made to not feel a part of the Home Depot team.
good,"I don't remember a lot about working for home depot. it was 15 or so years ago. I do remember that there were people that were concerned about me succeeding with my job, they helped teach me the things that I needed to know."
good,it was a good job with nice management and fun to be around co-workers and they paid you fairly I think had I not got fired I would have had a good chance at promotion.
good,Good entry level job. Many chances to move up in the company and make a career but very competitive.  Management can be very hit or miss. Good place to learn work etiquette and customer service.
good,"Was a fine place to work, the salary potential was high. There was always a chance to get promoted or work your up the corporate ladder. Customers could sometimes be rude."
good,fun place to work the group of people i worked with was fun to be around and down to earth. my management team was cool and really worked with you to the best of their abilities while staying within the company guidelines.
good,"Haven't worked here in a while what i remember it is fine. No problems, work there is what you make of it, easy learned to work with others. Good culture."
good,"it was not the right job for me."
good,"The Home Depot can be a fast paced place to work with sometimes limited people in the area of your employment.  This means that you have to be able to assist in other departments at any time.  A broad range of knowledge is a plus, and they will train you in these areas."
good,A typical day consisted of being set out to various appointments even on my days off.  There was never a consistent paycheck because I was strictly on commission.  High pressure to close deals.
good,"The job is very physically demanding. Good employee benefits and compensation. But, these two things are overshadowed by the limited opportunities of moving up, and unrealistic performance goals set by the supervisors."
good,"I enjoyed working with customers everyday - and my co-workers made it a fun workplace. "
good,My experience at The Home Depot was a great assessment of my skills as a worker and greatly expanded my skill set as I a flooring associate at the Hackensack location.
good,It is a good place to start if it is your first job. But don't stay there. Management is one of the worst ones I've ever seen. You make friends. Just get the experience that you need and get out.
good,it was fun working there.  meet lots of interesting people. always room for growth in a business like this. never had any problems with anybody. work was always constant.
good,"Trying to pacify upset customers isn't fun at all. It's even less fun when the higher-ups take away some of the ""make the customer happy"" discounts and offers, because they were apparently hurting the company's bottom line. "
good,this place is more for someone that just came out of school and paid doesn't care much about hours or getting and they make you do alot of work for little pay
good,"A typical day at work was standing at a cash register"
good,Chances for advancement not that strong due to others being in position for long period of time. People would stay in positions longer than they anticipate.
good,Working at Home Depot is for individuals that don't mind a construction related atmosphere. You must also be a team player and not mind sales goals. Fellow coworkers may/may not help you.
good,"Good place to work if you’re looking to collect a paycheck. Moving up in the company can be slow if you work in a remote are, but it’s possible. Good people to work with."
good,It's fast paced at times and very slow at others.  Pay isn't great but benefits are good.  Employees are very helpful and seem to know a lot more management - but is par for the course these days.
good,Good job for starting out or if you're in high school.  Not somewhere you would want to make a career unless you know the right people or have a degree.
good,"The Home Depot was a good learning experience, they did show that hard work can get you somewhere. But just like any place else if a manager does not see eye to eye, you could be fired for dislike of a person."
good,Home Depot was very fast paced but yet a very educational job. I worked in the Lawn and Garden section and i learned all about plants and gardens. It also was a very tough job
good,"Its a revolving door working at the Home Depot, you have people of all age groups mostly young adults who quite frankly don't know much about their own departments which leads to having frustrated customers."
good,"ordering special orders."
good,"Working as HR  representative."
good,"Friendly associates, slow paced work environment. Manager was very nice and welcoming with all associates and customers. There is a lot of room to grow."
good,"I was hiring for the second shift and it was very stressful, helping customers, stocking shelves and cleaning trash and other duties that are not assigned in the contract."
good,Home Depot  is a typical retail company.  Management is semi-supportive.  Staff culture is average overall.  They allow you to make your work schedule but very strict about you following it.
good,"They'll let you get your work done , A very good work flow and nobody hassling you all day . Great team work at times you know every job have there days"
good,"accountable for the sales and services to to professional contractors,some merchandising,unloading of trucks with sit down and stand up forklifts,some use of electric pallet jack,order picer"
good,Good place to work and have the ability to grow....management needs more training.  Co-workers are good.. it all depends on you..  You must be on time.
good,"Benefits are good. Able to earn time of each month for sick leave. The more years worked more time allotted for vacation. As a full time associate must have open availability, which at times can be difficult to manage time with family. Associates who excel are utilized to bring sales in which often leads to hours worked being during high traffic hours. If you are working with a customer and its time for you to be off you are expected to stay to complete transactions. Then you are informed when you have to cut it which often does not allow you for time with family. Expectation to have sales and complete department clean and stocked regardless of traffic. The more you have knowledge of to do the more you will be pulled to assist in other areas in store. Most enjoyable working with customers in selecting and designing areas of home and explaining the installation process. Getting feedback from customers on how their project turned out. Repeat customers seeking you out for new projects."
good,"management doesn't make the  best decisions that benefit employees, like hiring more part timers and while they need to cut hours. low yearly pay raises"
good,working there time goes bye fast between the customer support and the down stocking and stocking of product keeps you busy. will some what work with your schedule if need be.
good,"customer service and being a cashier "
good,"The Home Depot is a great company, it's the culture of the workplace that takes away the feeling of enjoyment .The lack of teamwork was a great concern and often would be the reason of increased stress."
good,Managers are stretched thin and barely have time to remember your name. There was a very strong favoritism that had some people able to get away with any form of rudeness or just inability to do their jobs properly. The hours were terrible but the pay could have been good if you stick around 10+ years
good,"i""ve learn that a big store makes it difficult to help customers that need help since everyone has their own department to take care of  unable to stay with the customer"
good,"This job allows you to meet great people. On the work side it can get pretty hectic and busy, which cause some tough days. Customer service is number one and very important here. You get to learn a lot about home improvement."
good,"Part-time workers are asked to submit maximum hours they can work, Home Depot turns around and gives them the least hours they have to, sometimes just 4 hours in one week.   Hard on part-timers to predict incoming income to budget for bills when hours fluctuate wildly from one week to next.  Have seen Home Depot lose very good employees due to their culture of abusing part-timers in that way."
good,Great associates.  Met a lot of interesting people while working there. Formed some good friendships with the community.  No discount for employees.   Shorter shifts for management
good,"I start by making sure the equipment is working and then get ready for customer. I learned how to organize my time with each customer, so no one feels left behind.I will make sure that the customer waiting knows I see them and they are next in line. I work in the paint department and have to learn how to make the custom paint. I have learn how to handle difficult customers, and make sure the problem gets resolved."
good,Worked overnight and was a very dirty environment moving beams and products. Had to clean years of dirt and dust after moving items. Overnight not for everyone because it presents and unhealthy living style
good,The people were very good to work for.  Management was failing and turning into a very corporate situation.  I loved dealing with the customers and DIY people that came in.
good,"They do not pay a living wage to any of their associates, they have limited hours, very difficult management environment, and do not recognize seniority between stores"
good,I learned that I am a person who needs a set schedule.. an environment like this doesn't fit my needs. This I think is a great job for someone wanting to fill in some extra time while going to school or as an occupation for retirees.
good,"Typical day at work is just facing products to be visible for costumers, help guide costumers for products they are looking for and give additional information. You will always have something to do."
good,"A job that is a clock in clock out job where you do your job helping customers then leave work at work then go home and return the next day, its a job that requires customer service."
good,"Work was easy, stocked shelves overnight, however a good amount of workers were lax in their duties and only did their department and never helped others"
good,"The environment was enjoyable. Working as an associate things were less stressful. It was easy for me to stay busy with stock, inventory and cleaning always needing done. The guest interactions were pleasant and made for enjoyable days most of the time."
good,"I worked as a lumber associate.The majority of my customers were contractors with rather large orders. Each customer was nice enough to help load what they needed, but our store was understaffed to handle alot of foot traffic at once."
good,I loved this job. It kept me fit and I met a lot of cool personalities. The health insurance was great and the 401K company match wasn't too bad either.
good,A  reliable company with a great crowd of individuals to learn from but that is based on the area you work at. The additional perks to this is that the you can pick up great hands on with all kinds of tools and gadgets.
good,"They offer a community work environment feeling,  also have plenty of extras for employees including lunches and cook out. Hours are varied by seasons"
good,"Bonus is Harder to achieve and cap amount reduced. Do not understand especially after having the companies best year. "
good,"its okay to work there, but only if you are trying to supervise really quickly. Most new people only stay for a month, but others are there for a really long time."
good,low moral and under trained staff. Poor working conditions. Low Salary. The Lighting was bad and the place was unorganized. Constant computer training
good,"Good job for anyone seeking work for a decent wage. Job requirements exceed payment to employees, During my time at this position I have realized that this job makes money off of you not making money."
good,You check out purchases and help answer customer's questions.  You need to be able to deal with unhappy customers.  You may have to stand several hours at a cash register.
good,"A typical workday consisted of unmotivated co-workers which resulted in unhappy customers. Management would often overwork us to the point I would work an eight-hour shift without a break. Customers would often come inside to discover a lot of our products are out of stock due to our low inventory the store often received poor reviews. The hardest aspect of the job would be the constant workload, with my own daily tasks to complete along with assisting customers it created conflicts. The most enjoyable aspect of the job would be the great strength of patience I obtained."
good,the most enjoyable part about working for home depot was when I helped customers to there car to help them load it up. The managers at Home Depot was the best.
good,"I began working at the Home Depot thinking advancement would be possible but it didn't matter how educated you were, advancement could only happen through attrition.  The hardest part of the job was answering internal service calls with minimal communication equipment available which would require the requested employee to run to the area where help was needed.  The Home Depot is a huge box store which made it virtually impossible to give good customer service to visiting customers."
good,By far the best thing about working here was the co-worker. Such a large company yet not too large to where you didn't know everyone by name. A fair pay place to work but management is wonderful.
good,"The coworkers were friendly, but at the same time you would have a few who took advantage of their relationship with management and would be very lazy."
good,"The hardest part of the job was getting back and forth. And being able to be reliable, dependable, and efficient. Well I kept the work up. "
good,My review of Home Depot should not be submitted as I have not worked for the company in several years and I would not feel comfortable providing my experience as the culture has probably changed.
good,"THD was a good experience for me overall. You work with all aspects of customer service, and operations in the position I had. I had a strong management team with me at the time and good crew of workers. If the pay was more I would have stayed longer perhaps."
good,"*Warning** Accept an offer of employment at your own risk."
good,Ok place to work.not the greatest the pay rate is low.decent room for advancement good benefits.need better management.compnay party's are fun and ok lol
good,"Enjoyed the employees, management changed 4 times in 3 years, loved the quarter bonus. Took care of employees. Better pay needed but would go back!!!!"
good,Competitive environment that you have a time limit to complete your assignment and have he floor set up. Advance your skills to multitask and move with a sense of urgency.
good,working at home depot you learn to work well with others as well as it being a motivational place just by seeing your manager getting work done as well.
good,"I would recommend  working here if you are okay with hard fast paced work environment, but one thing that was noticed in my two years working there is that management picks favorites quite often and if you are not one of them they tend to stay on you about everything you do from when you take your breaks to even bathroom usage but over all employees are friendly and the pay is equal to the work needed."
good,"I learned a lot on time managing. The typical day at work was talking to lot of people, helping them find this and answering a lot of questions. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people."
good,"early morning hours, low pay and lack of appreciation for the work that I did. I was doing the work of several people at the time but was told it wasn't enough"
good,Its a job where you do job stuff like at most jobs where people go to get a check from the job people so its not too bad but its a job like most jobs are
good,Home Depot was a great company to work for but soon I found a better job with great benefit and more money. Its a great company for someone who is fresh out high school.
good,"Not school schedule flexible "
good,I  learn to improve my self and perfonce quality customer service shipping receiving load paññets into trailers when I start I was shy but when I learn I was better
good,"I liked my roles as department manager of 2 departments. Learned alot about some of the building trades- carpet and flooring installation, tiling, window treatment installations, and the like. Very useful time spent there."
good,"This job took up more time than just the hours worked due to the physical nature of the labor. It required recovery time and prep time. However, the employees and managers tended to be encouraging and willing to help each other, which made it better than it would have been otherwise."
good,Physically demanding work in the area I worked in! I would not reccommened Home Depot to anyone that was not physically able to work in certain areas.
good,Home Depot is a place where I learned different skills and got the opportunity to obtain a Forklift license. Good work life balance! I enjoy working here for the most part.
good,I love it but the hours are hard for me as a single mother of 2. Fun environment and great coworkers. Would recommend it to a friend if they were looking for factory work.
good,"Started as a cart pusher/cashier. Moved up to service desk, then to paint desk. Then moved back to service desk because those skills were needed more. Was able to lead classes and took the supervisor training twice in two different stores. For the amount of stress after so many years, realized my potential could be utilized elsewhere."
good,"Is Avery good company to work it give bonus .in this store I have came a couch and team leader ,voice of the associated ,have taking a role of a supervised  is a company we’re u have the change to grow."
good,Each team member needs to understand their role and be the best at it. You also need to have a working knowledge of all the departments within the company. Customer expect each associate to be able to answer questions about the entire store.
good,helping  customers find merchandise and ring up sales and returns
good,There was hardly a day where you would see people in a bad mood walking in to work or to buy merchandise at The Home Depot. The co worker were also eager to help customers at a moments notice to give the customers the best service.
good,good place to work. friendly enviorment. fast paced and interactive work place with close interactions with customer on a daily basis. must learn a vast amount information.
good,Home Depot is a fun place to work. I was treated very well there. Each day consists of assisting customers in various different ways. Almost all of the interactions with customers are positive.
good,overall good company to work for with advancement opportunity. training is lacking more hands on less computer based would be better. pay was average but scheduling was managers needs not employees needs. most departments are short handed that have high traffic.
good,"Enjoyed designing kitchens and baths for customers."
good,"good part time job for college kids, flexible hours and great staff. their pretty good with vacation time and benefits. training is good and friendly staff"
good,"its an average place to work, the job is fun but it feels like its more like everyone is out for them selves and team work throughout the years is slowly diminishing"
good,"physical work 8hr "
good,"from the time I punch in until the time I punch out is a joy being at home depot Despite when someone's having a bad day. its always busy but most of the customers are regulars and know us so it was kind of like a family. the management team was awesome except for 1/2 managers .but they always came to solve a problem no matter if it was a customer or just to fix the register when it crashed .very diverse place to work in. There was really no hard times ,mostly a joyful place to work."
good,"Had to stock a variety of goods on the floor.  From cabinets, bark, to nails and flooring.  Had to inventory items putting on the flood and back stocking."
good,Home Depot is a good place for students to work. Home Depot has many positions available and flexible hours to accommodate a student's class schedule.
good,"checking in and renting out equipment , cleaning and prepping equipment for next rental, checking rental trucks in and out . penske rentals apart from home depot. opening and closing when needed on my schedule, promised full time but after a year still at part time,"
good,"Mostly like any other retail/cashier job. Coworkers were fine and management was good but could have provided more training. I also would have appreciated knowing a better layout of the store. I'm not sure if this job would be great for long-term, as most employees seemed to be doing it as teens or after retirement."
good,"lots of walking, talking and helping customers find products and giving information about the products. Loading and unloading heavy materials very fast paced and always moving environment."
good,Fun Workplace. Excellent customer service.
good,Great way to meet new people and to gain experience in a big box retailers. One of the best company's for knowledge. Constant change is happening so you must be willing to adapt
good,"Very Cult-ish, high expectations for low pay. Good job for people that are retired or someone who wants to capitalize on their benefit package                "
good,"very easy, but can also be very boring. Many days with nothing to do other than putter around the isles and act busy. The people that worked with me were great"
good,"not a bad place to grow, depending on management and how things were run, depended on how the employees worked and put forth the effort for efficiency."
good,Very easy to adapt to and fun environment. Was treated with respect and was encouraged to learn all aspects and departments. Even though my time was only temporary I would highly suggest this company to anyone who has zero background or knowledge of the company's products and services.
good,"they expected 2 people to run tool rental, fix rental tools, order parts, sell products, shipping and receiving, clean, do inventory, help in other departments and provide customer service. entirely to much work for 2 people."
good,"Great benefits, work hours, and work place. There is a lot of room for advancement. It has a great encouraging atmosphere. Easy paced for those new to the type of work."
good,"For something to pay the bills, its an ok job. i havent worked there in a long time so alot has probably change. shopping there, the workers seem to be happy."
good,"A typical work day consists of greeting customers as they walk through the main aisle. Checking out customers should be carried out as efficiently and accurately as possible. I learned how to communicate with co-workers and supervisors when presented with a problem. Managment was usually available on request and were always determined to help resolve any issues. The culture of the workplace was very competitive and goal oriented. As a team, we were motivated to meet sales goes and advertise all promotions whenever possible. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the fast-paced environment when working during peak hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was successfully assisting customers with questions and concerns about products and services you are familiar with and making their visit enjoyable."
good,"If you are a people person then this company is a good place to work. You will be given daily tasks to complete, while providing customer service. If you enjoy multitasking then you will enjoy working here. You will stay busy."
good,"Buena empresa, buen ambiente y compensación justa."
good,"Home Depot has many opportunities to learn different fields, but seems to be very male friendly with there equipment training. I also thought they did not hold there spotters responsible for mishaps that that happen on there watch. They also do no follow up on missing employees- hence no one can find anyone to help in the isles. there are enough employees but only a few take customer responsibility seriously."
good,"i enjoyed working at home depot, but the hours were inconsistent and did not meet my financial needs. I believe that part time hours should be consistent on a daily basis rather than no consistency."
good,"The work pace a the Home Depot is very fast-paced. You need to draw on your knowledge 100% of the time to help customers. Much of the time, you are on your own, as the department is woefully understaffed."
good,This is a good place to work if you are looking for fast paced non-stop work. However pay is not great for work that is done and hours can get low if the store is slow
good,"Big store, very very busy. Managers are very inconsistent and bias, friendly coworkers. not very nice hours and if you ask for a certain day off most likely you won't get it off."
good,I only got this job to make ends meet. It was a part time job and I mainly only worked weekends anyways. The staff I worked with was extremely helpful and motivating as well.
good,"The Home Depot very much feels like a second family. Wearing the orange apron identifies who you are in the organization, as a valued member. Hours are crazy, customers are intense at times, but every day is an opportunity to become a better sales person, a better employee, a better individual, by simply just helping a customer to accomplish their goals and dreams."
good,Never worked for a company quite like the Home Depot I worked at. They spend a lot of time and money on training for employees yet the local managers constantly disregard the SOPs and reprimand the employees for not violating them.
good,If you put your best foot forward you can advance within the company. They have good training system.  You only work in your department. Same thing everyday.
good,"Working at Home Depot is just a part time job. Co-workers are good people to work with.  Whenever Home depot be successful the employees get a bonus as well. Sometimes the job can be a little challenging, but overall it is OK to work there."
good,"I loved all my coworkers and my supervisor. But there were a lot of artificial demands put on me by management and I had to deal with a lot, often being the only specialist handling 2-3 departments at a time. I often had to work late into the night/very early morning doing inventory and cleaning. The job was very physically demanding and tiring."
good,You could work anywhere in the store.  A typical day was helping customers and managing inventory.  Odd hours made it hard to get a normal sleep schedule. I made may lifelong friends working there. Some management would make it hard to advance.
good,Management works with you to find your skills and the best place and co workers fo you to work with. Good hours. Transparent supervisors. Co workers are helpful and knowledgeable.
good,My day at work is stressful accompanied by a lot of work many times without being able to take rest or lunch. I have learned a lot about the sales and use of the machines in addition to doing a good customer service. the managers are good with you alone or whenever they need something from you after you do not serve them they leave you alone and you need a favor they put you around a lot to help you. the best part of working for home depot is my co-workers of course not all but what if they are willing to help you and to listen to you
good,"Fun place to work to learn and develop a skill set in retail, supply chain, and customer service.  If nothing else, get licensed to drive the sit-down forklift as this is a lucrative skill in future employment."
good,"Short Staffed, So the customers tend to get a little frustrated, but overall the store is pretty efficient when comes down to the necessary materials needed."
good,"I started off as a cashier and moved up to Head Cashier after 8 months. I started off loving the company and after working at three stores, you see that each one is ran very different. If you take the time to learn the different hours, you become more useful to management, but they end up running you everywhere. Overall, the company is good, but certain stores really need to change. You end up getting burned out at some point. You end up getting treated badly by management and definitely the customers."
good,"Steady Job. Good for young people as a first work experience."
good,The management at The Home Depot is not the best and the raises are only good to those who kiss up to the bosses but still the yearly raises are 50 cents or less and thats why people tend to look for a better opportunity and leave .
good,"Great conpany to work for, but just like any company it has it's ups and downs. They do pay there employees decent though. And there stock is good to buy into if your an employee only."
good,Home depot was probably the hardest job I ever had in my life. I worked in the building materials department and every day was a work out without going to the gym..I worked every equipment they had and stocked the shelves with forklifts and waited on customers and cut lumber it was a juggling act many days to satisfy both management and customers in accomplishing your job.
good,"I enjoyed working Night Freight at the Home Depot for 22 months."
good,Fast paced environment & heavy workload. A customer service oriented job. Use of life equipment preferred. Providing excellent customer service a must.
good,"A typical day at work at the Special Services Desk included assisting many customers with issues that they've had with their orders, products and services, processing returns, and following up with customers on services/orders. I learned a lot about how to use computer systems to create and sell orders, how to run reports (which was one of my favourite parts of the job) and how to respond to upset customers. The job wasn't for me because I found that the negative vibes I got from customers for eight hours a day really began to take a toll on me - that was definitely the hardest part of the job, but it did give me more confidence in myself in the end. The management was always very approachable and friendly. They were very understanding when I needed to cut back on some hours when classes started again in the fall. The managers always made an effort to bring associates together, whether that be in fundraisers, associate events, BBQs at lunch, or Cashier Appreciation Month. The only way I feel like they could improve is in taking initiative to intervene when an associate is dealing with a big customer issue instead of seemingly avoiding as many confrontations as possible. The most enjoyable parts of the job for me were the associate community/atmosphere and expanding my knowledge in different departments and in customer service skills."
good,"Overall, this job provided me with a lot of training that helped me learn so many details about sales and building materials. Unfortunately, management at both my North Upland, CA, and Idaho Falls, ID locations was very poor. The managers of both stores were not helpful or inspiration leaders like a manager should be. Both spent more time in their office than trying to build rapport with staff and customers, and both had little respect for the values and beliefs of their employees."
good,this was a job i did just to make some pocket money in between college. Its great place to learn about tools and see if your attention is caught on by a project.
good,"Buena empresa , da estabilidad laboral . "
good,The job includes a lot of walking and time responsiveness towards helping out customers with any loading assistance. The best part of the job would be seeing customers lighten up when they received help.
good,"Home depot is a good job to start out with. They offer great benefits for medical, dental and even pay for half of your college. They even have an employee committee for employees to join to raise money for the associates for barbeques and the Christmas Party. It is very customer service oriented and fast paced environment."
good,"Back in the 80's and 90's, The Home Depot was an amazing place to work.  You were one big family.  The CEO's of the company would know who you were and would ask about your family.  It reminds me of what Google is now.  It is not like this anymore.  very cold and business type and it turned into a very cut-throat place to work."
good,I liked the manager. Fast paced ever changing environment. Learned all aspects of customer service. Very safety oriented environment. Learned knowledge of many various products
good,"I was excited to work at the home depot because i was out of a job for a while and really wanted to get to working, after getting hired and actually started working, as a cashier, i came to realize that they were short staff, each department was short staffed, and each time i needed help i had to wait for assistance, which made the customer grow even more impatient."
good,"Good opportunity for someone who is retired with another income. HDI offers no reimbursement for anything, fuel, mileage, wear and tear driving a lot."
good,"would not recommend to work their, especially at the location i was at. very dangerous and gun shots every night when working the overnight schedule.."
good,"Exciting in the first 5 years but as u stay longer management and company lacks more and more of employee good treatment...they care less of the employees,but will push u to do more jobs.."
good,"Billion dollar numbers driven company.  Pay structure favors upper management with few opportunities to advance.  Almost impossible to raise a family on less than management salary.  Company does offer benefits, 401k buy in,  as well as discounted stock buy in for employees."
good,"Lowe's offers eligible part-time employees the following benefits: Part-time Medical Plans, Pharmacy Discount Card, Dental, Vision, Life Insurance, Short Term Disability, Critical Illness, Accident Insurance, Fixed Indemnity, Auto and Home Insurance, Vacation, Holiday, 401(k) Plan, and Employee Stock Purchase Plan."
good,Frieght tough to work depends on team and management. Depends on your manager Depot can be a good place to work. Low ball on pay and raises. Good benefits.
good,"I worked seasonally in the garden department and it can become stressful with the amount of foot traffic. A lot of lifting was required such as the stones and mulch. Workers are generally thrown in to the sales floor as quick as possible with minimal training which is tough with the contractors are asking for immediate assistance and you can't help them. Overall, the staff was pretty helpful though."
good,i was district trainer and then went back into store to be a department sup.  loved the job was challenging and fast paced.  area was not the best so high theft.
good,Overall Department management position was typical for that type of retail operation. Overseeing departments daily functions with customers and shelf integrity (down stocking and maintinance) were the 2 main focuses on a daily basis. Schedule was tough and unfriendly because of constant changes. You could close one night and not get out until 11:00pm and be expected to open the next day 6:00am. Employees were friendly and enjoyable to work with. Upper management was very fair and easy to work with. You have to have people skills and an ability to work and get along with others in order to excel. Insurance and 401K program were good. A good experience and stepping stone towards future employment.
good,Used my remodeling and landscaping knowledge to assist customers and other employees. Tried to do my job while  trying not to  get caught  up in stressful company  politics which has a direct effect  on employees and how they deal with the customers on a daily basis.
good,Some days were slow others a bit busy. Team members were great to work with management however was not the best. Overall enjoyable to work yet a bit stressful.
good,worked hard always made sales but when it came down to advancement or what not they decide that could not happen that it would be more to cut back on the full timers so they could hire more part timers
good,"min wage a challenge.  Good working enviroment.  Great training, lots of support.  Average department lead.  ongoing training.  free parking.  onsite food concession."
good,Their benefits are expensive. Wages are average for part time. I was offered a supervisor position which was appreciated. They wanted to pay around $11-12 per hour but i found a job that was paying $14. I told them I would stay if they paid me $13 per hour but they declined.
good,it has its pro's and con's depending on what area you're working in and how well the store is being ran can effect a wide range of things. I worked MET team. One of the most overworked positions there.
good,It is your basic run of the mill retail job. There is bonus opportunities and they do like to hire from within the company rather than hiring from an outside source
good,It was a job. Not a career - it was Home Delivery America which was a contracted company for Home Depot - I have never worked directly for Home Depot.
good,"Received good training, enjoyed working with co workers as well as customers. The work was fair and not too demanding. Received support and consistent work hours."
good,"Assisted customers with questions on products. "
good,"I got hired as a cashier and in 6 months, changed over to an MEA on the MET. "
good,"The Home Depot was overall a good environment to work in. The coworkers were mostly motivated and ambitious, but not all were willing to step out of there comfort zones to help a coworker (or customer). The day to day was generally not very stressful, except during peak sales periods or during the occasional rush on merchandise. The biggest downside is that compensation rarely increased other than to barely match the rate of inflation and promotions were hard to come by. Consistency and hard work were not always rewarded and other candidates were often promoted based on seniority rather than achievements or effort."
good,as I am in a wheelchair I didn't think that it was fair to ask me to put 4'x8' sheets of plywood on the shelf and then get extremely rude and intolerant when I informed management that it was a task I was unable to perform
good,Liked interacting with the customers and dealing with their needs everyday. Management was amazing and worked with you to fit your schedule as well. Able to move to different departments.
good,"A decent place to work but not somewhere you wanna depend on. I worked for the MET Team and it was very unstimulating. We often found ourselves talking with the Home Depot employees which ironically, was the best part of the job. The management is very biased with their treatment and you pretty much have to suck up to them to stay on their good side as opposed to doing any hard work. The workplace environment can be tolerable but on a typical day, the workers and customers tend to be on edge and testosterone is flying everywhere. Wouldn't recommend working their full time unless you wanna go crazy and be angry all the time."
good,"Head cashier managing cashiers to have the right amount of money in there registers making sure the money books get send on time to the office also making sure the store is well taking care of clean isles, parking lot, and great service gets given to the customers all the time supervising schedules of employees on the clock."
good,"very slow but steady work"
good,"Home Depot is a great job to have as a student. With tuition reimbursement they would pay part of my university tuition, and they were extremely flexible and willing to work around my schedules."
good,"A typical day at work is selling appliances and accessories, stocking "
good,"Overall for the pay Home Depot is an ok place to work. It really depends on the location of the store and the Manager that is there at the time.  Did recieve bonuses,"
good,"The Home Depot isn't a terrible place to work; I just think that, in the long run, it wasn't the place for me.  Personally, I found that those who should have been given a chance to advance, weren't, solely because they were too good at what they did, and that people who should have been let go, weren't, because their metrics were still good.  I'm just not sure I can be okay with that, especially when the people needing to be let go are as toxic to their co-workers as these individuals were.  Hopefully, that't not every Home Depot."
good,"its a lot of work and very stressful. high passed and you have to be organized. it more like a construction company. I have to deal with all the customers over the phone, give discounts and turn a mad customer into a happy customer. Which I do 7 out of 10x."
good,"This was a good place to work. Got a lot of experience all over the store. Good people to work with, Just management needed a little work. Hardest part was just learning everything and moving around the store."
good,Hours can seem long...but that has to do with my perceptions. loved the people I worked with...some are the best folks I have Known. recommend to young folks.
good,"I worked in Home Depot for a while, I was picking & shipping, the pay rates was good, my school schedule weren’t good to work for the shifts, the management was friendly"
good,"Fast pace enviorment , putting out fires all day customer service is #,  ASM's are not try motivators the company does not have people who can recognize talent."
good,Great help to the community lack of care for employees. Though i did enjoy working on projects within the workplace as well as having access to other employees knowledge.
good,while working at home depot i was able to receive training in various departments while learning new skills.  a set schedule would have been nice but overall great experience.
good,you will spend long hours on your feet so wear good shoes and socks  very customer interactive you must be able to enjoy talking to random people every day
good,home depot is a great job to have for a short period of time. there is really no room for growth in the company for most of the employees. there is a lot of favoritism within the management team.
good,not alot of advancement low pay and raises only once a year not on your performance I feel like if you go above and beyond on your job you should be rewarded as so
good,Great place to work on a daily basis.  Very good company. They are committed to providing a great workplace.  Hardest part of the job was working every weekend.
good,"Overall environment was good however, the reality for Home Depot was in a high volume area, so it made it stressful and fast paced for no employees to complete tasks in a timely manner"
good,"As a cashier, you are very limited in movement."
good,I was a cashier at the Home Depot.  The shifts were generally 9 hours with 1 hour for lunch and breaks.  It was just a slow paced job most of the time.
good,"average place to work  "
good,"Seasonal position, fast pace environment customer service ready team oriented, and work part-time hours. No health insurance no dental no overtime available,"
good,quick paced stock shelves part time over nights worked as a team sometimes worked on ur own pay was very low not enough to make a living for the work it was worth more pay
good,"This company plays favorites, if you are not in the Click, you will not advance.  The benefits are good along with the stock, but the medical insurance is quite high.  Its a lot of childish games. When mgmt. has their round table meeting it ends up being gossipy about the associates and their performances, all hush hush."
good,"Good benefits,steady hours could be paid more,could use less drama in the workplace and less gossiping,more consistancy,more  understnading management"
good,"My experience was good, I enjoyed the job, managers were nice and the work environment was good. The hours they gave me I enjoyed and my coworkers were always friendly."
good,"Fast paced friendly work environment with room for advancement. Benefits, piad vacations and sick time. Customers are usually friendly. Home Depot is a great place to work."
good,Home Depots contact center is a decent place to work if you don't mind a daily grind with no real advancement options. So if you are looking to assist customers until you retire then this may be a good options for you. I personally want a career with advancement so it wasn't a good fit for me.
good,"Different branches of home depot are different, so it can be unfortunate when some empolyees, who are a credit to the business, are mistreated due to bad upper leadership"
good,"Typical what you would expect being a store associate. OK training, stocking and servicing customer requests. Retail hours were decent and training was good."
good,When you told your op(operations managers) that I didn’t know a way that u could have a better time they would just tell u something instead of showing you.
good,The Home Depot is a good place to apply your customer service skills.  Thousands of customers pass through the doors every week allowing plenty of opportunity to share and gain knowledge in a variety of fields.
good,Home Depot is a competitive company that has a quota to reach every week so it's always pressure to sale sale sale. There's room for growth in this company starting off as a part time associate. Seniority can assist you to grow in this company.
good,"There was little to no advancement available. I learned 4 different positions and was given employee of the month 3 times, but still no pay incentives and low hourly raises."
good,"Could be better; not a lot of incentive or promise of growth in the company. Very few women in leadership. Lean organization. "
good,"I very much enjoy working with my colleagues at the Home Depot, and feel that their training and benefits are very good.  But the salaries they pay are so low that they tend to only attract people who are otherwise in need of the benefits (health, etc.).  Since the benefits at my spouse's employer are better than what is offered at Home Depot, I am basically getting nothing from them other than minimum wage."
good,stable environment. management is good but needs more transparency.  opportunities for growth within the company are not very easy to obtain.  job requires a lot and needs a pay upgrade.
good,The best thing about the job what's my co-workers we got along really well and work together to get the job done my immediate overnight supervisor what's a good supervisor
good,Home Depot overall is a great company but I have been with the company for 14 years and I need growth. The one thing I don't like is there is lack of advancement in the company. I have tried to apply for many roles I went back to school and received my bachelors degree. I need an opportunity and I need more money.
good,A good first time job for people in high school or college. Advancing depends on the person and how bad they want the advancement. Easy going work environment and friendly people.
good,"I mostly worked after hours, so things didn't get hectic or require balancing multiple tasks simeltaneously. If you keep you head down and get your work done, it's fine."
good,"No employee discounts"
good,"is a great job, some time very stressfull place; but is a safety and secure place for the associad and the customer, is a lot work to do in different areas.Greeter for customers entering the store, provinding fast and friendly service."
good,Its beneficial for those who are into construction and gardening. Each department at the store you will learn something. This store will help you build up your customer service skills.
good,"Working for Home Depot isnt necessarily bad, but the lack of advancement and fair pay for work involved makes the whole experience soured. If there were more benefits for working there longer or more compensation for certain jobs it'd be better."
good,"Doesn't give a lot of hours, can be slow at times, pay is low, don't get raise until second quarter, no employee discounts, fun work environment, cool people."
good,"Just an ok job.  Lacks customer service.  Every1 takes lunch at the same time.  Pay isn't great based on work load.  Depending on the setup of the store, not everything is easy to find or identify within the store."
good,"great starting off job  ,paid vacation , benefits are good ,   management can use improvement , pay can be better especially having different job duties"
good,The professionalism is very high with employees and contractors within the organization.  However the good ol boy system is visible within the way the organization tends to employ and promote.
good,It's a good place to work and it's also very interesting.  You can always grow in the company.  It is highly recommended.  The hours are very flexable
good,Pick and getting product ready for shipping and printing out invoices. The fun part was finding the product in the warehouse. it was a very fast pace job that i loved doing.
good,"good work environment, a great way to learn new things to help in your own advancement toward your dream home. make sure you get to work early other wise the clock in computer will count you as late if you clock in right when you are supposed to start your shift."
good,It was a positive workplace that allowed employees to expand their knowledge and are encouraged to express their personality with customers to help to build better relationships.
good,I always felt very valued there and my time was always full with helping customers and stocking the shelves and assisting with phone calls and deliveries.
good,"good product fun to work for needs to more room for advancement , the people are nice the managers are ok need more training for supperviser roles for all workers."
good,Good job with good people. home depot is fun. work there if you are in high school or college or looking to make paychecks until the next opportunity comes.
good,Home Depot was a good place also to have worked when I was there. They offered a good 401K and health benefits to employees and paid vacation also. Management was good
good,"Daily grind"
good,Well rounded workplace with a lot offer in terms of knowledge an certifications. Pah is terrible an so is advancement opportunities an raises. Wouldn't recommend unless you're a ugh school student
good,"The physical environment of the warehouse was depressing, more often than not you were by yourself working or with someone and there wasn't enough work to keep both employees satisfying performance goals then.  I witnessed a high turn over rate due to the nature of the job and the poor treatment/ expecting way to much out of the employees."
good,"Loved Home Depot itself and their core values. If within the store management could work with those core values, life would of been great. Management did not always take care of their people."
good,everything about this job was just ok pay was ok management as ok coworkers were ok work life balance was decent all in all the job was ok hated waking up at 3 in the morning but enjoyed getting off at 3 in the afternoon
good,No training provided as far as the Lead Generator position goes. This store has very good training videos on every position in the store except lead Generation. 
good,"The job had demands that had to be met on a regular basis such as a certain number of credit cards ha to be met each month, customer service replies had to be maintained at  5, scanning proficiently at a rate of 100%; etc.  Otherwise an employee could be written up."
good,"It was a nice place to work at first in the beginning"
good,When I worked for the Home Depot the management was poor. They eliminated my position throughout the whole company and my manager got promoted and transferred.
good,Learning Environment with a diverse group of people.  Not very fast paced and can find yourself bored at times.  Very engaging job that involves a lot of customer service.
good,"night shift hours, got freight off tractor trailers put freight on carts put stock away on shelves, help others, when store is open help customers finding products"
good,I enjoyed the job and liked being able to help pros find the information that they need and get their bids and materials needed.It was a fun fast paced environment.
good,"the people were great, the customers were nice to work with.  work was fun to go to. hours in the winter were cut to 20 hours so you cannot rely on it."
good,Great job to make extra income. Discount on home remodeling products. Tuition reimbursement for college students was a huge plus! Tv in employee break room and flexible work schedules.
good,"flexible hours and great location to work at nice quiet pace environment able to work at own speed. Overtime, vacation, and sick paid available if qualified and full time position as well as part time"
good,I work as a cashier at store 4139. There are good employees and bad employees like anywhere else. This place makes a lot of stupid decisions and wastes a lot of employees time with needless tasks but its overall easy as long as you just realize your getting paid to do this needless task.
good,This was a good job. It had good pay for being my first big company job. The people there can sometimes be immature but it balanced out. The management was fair and the store manager was a very fair person.
good,"Home Depot was a very well maintained, fun and interactive place of employment"
good,Slow during winter hours.  Very busy between May and Sept.  Would recommend.  Dive was to long for me.  Pay is very good for the work.  Insurance is high.
good,Poor management and lack of hours. Didn't really enjoy only working 5 hours per shift and not being able to get more hours.Wasnt able to really be appreciated for the work i was doing.
good,"good people, good work, great outhouse discounts."
good,"First few weeks were quite stressful due to customers constantly asking questions about where certain items are located and due to being new, I had no clue what to tell them. Eventually the hardest part of the job became simply standing on your feet the whole day though."
good,One of my favorite places to work been there since Highschool. My manager was very helpful and willing to help to achieve whateve necessary goal need for the day. Home Depot provided me with grat warehouse training
good,My day begins with me opening the store. Cleaning the area making sure all merch is separated and sent to the right departments. The culture is okay alots of snakes that are trying to get you fired or in trouble so you are always on alert. The pay is okay not great but decent.
good,"Great opportunity for advancement, heavy work days with long hours and competitive productive days, tough on work life balance but growth of team environment for associate team."
good,I would not recommend to anyone to ever be a cashier at Home Depot because I was written up because I could not get customers to apply for credit and get approved. Home depot requires you to get so many credit card sales a week and if the customer is not approved it does not count. This means that it is your fault they the customers have bad credit and you are punished for it and I think that is completely wrong!!
good,It's a good place not that bad. Just that some customer at times just get mad and well talk bad. cause we're suppose to know everything. besides that our work place is amazing.
good,good job just the hours are not good in the winter and depending on the department you are at they make you go to other departments and you don't have a set schedule
good,I liked that i was able to move around and learn new things in different departments.  It's nice that we all helped each other out when we were short staffed. Will work around school if you are in school.
good,"The Home Depot is an ok place to work, they pay pretty good wit great benefits but the staff there is horrible with a lot of drama. But the pay is great"
good,it was a excellent work place.  I enjoyed working there I help as much as I could.  I stock the shelves.  the employees mad it fun and relaxing ..there was no hard part of the job
good,Needed better manament good company overall and decent place to work good people work there and people who work there are friendly and helpful above all good place
good,It was a decent summer job and I would recommend it to teenagers. The pay was good and the hours weren't abysmal the only problem was having to work very early mornings on occasion.
good,"I go in every morning before the store opens and unload the freight truck. I restock the shelves so that the store is grand opening ready."
good,my position as a sales associate was pretty fun. i gained tons of knowledge on the products sold throughout the store. i got along with everybody that worked there. it was nice having a diverse team that you could count on when help was needed. i got to train on the forklift was given my license to operate the machines. overall it was a great experience.
good,"I learned to control myself when I'm under pressure."
good,"I've enjoyed working there for the past 3 years, mainly because of my co workers. There are some genuinely kind and awesome people who work at the store. Like any other job it has its downs but I tend to mind my own business and go about my day. A job is a job and I am grateful for it."
good,"Great company, but IT support is a new role for me, so I learned about adherence scheduling and IT support, PC networking and RSA token administration."
good,Worked full time all year until winter as a part time employee. Was never offered full time position yet they hired outside people for full time even though they didnt have the availability.
good,"es una empresa donde el crecimiento interno para empleados dependera de si le caes bien o no a los jefes, no ven virtudes solo la conveniencia propia"
good,Big company with lots of different departments and opportunities. Your experience could vary based on what department you are in and also what kind of a manager you report to.
good,"Filled with Anti-Social, negative people.  Do not work here if you are not confident in your ability to compete amongst numerous peers for a limited number of advancements.   Also, know that you're entire stack ranking (including every single metric measured of every second of every hour of every day) is Tribal Knowledge."
good,"I was in charge to open operate the cash register.  I also assisted clients with their questions and made sure the customer had a great experience, by asking the customer of the shopping experience."
good,"Its not a bad job to have. Family type environment . Somewhat slow paced job depending on your title. Management is usually good. typical day is helping customers, stocking shelves."
good,"the job was okay. management was just poor. Some associates were easy to get along with, others would steal from you. I like how it was fast paced always busy."
good,My experience with Home Depot was average. The company goes above and beyond on their safety practices for employees and customers. I enjoyed meeting new people.
good,"Do not keep employees happy, doesn't care about the employees.  They look for ways to replace good workers with less experience in order to pay out lower wages."
good,It was fun working with the public. I enjoy working with people and learning new things. It was a good environment in which to work. Over all it was a positive experience.
good,Its a fairly good job. Wouldn't recommend long term career. I learned good skills along the way through Home depot. Friendly environment. I don't like the retail aspect.
good,"This position was only seasonal. There was nothing special. I was let go after they used me for 3 months. Although, I would recommend working for this company."
good,it was a fun work place always on the go moving around helping customers with what they need or looking for. I was always doing something in my department
good,The atmosphere is pretty laid back at home depot. my department didn't have to wear the typical orange apron and it was fast pased enough to make the day go by.
good,"If your looking for a third job or your a retiree, then home depot is the palace for you. IF your looking for a job that pays wells, has good hours, etc..............don't apply at the home depot."
good,"Home Depot is a great Job in many ways, however pushing credit cards and random items off on each customer as a requirement to rate your work ethnics isn't fair to the employee. I worked two jobs and when I decided to go back to school I left this job even though I was paid more. People have free will to not buy useless items or get credit card, a persons job as a cashier should be customers satisfaction of service not what they buy or how the buy it."
good,"Typical day during the summer season was very fast paced really enoyed the management and bonus oppurtunites, performed well with sales and rental aggrements, awsome place to work in, great enviroment, skilled co-workers."
good,i didnt enjoy this job either moved me around all the time would promise raises then never give them to you. was very frustrating and overworked me when they moved me to nights.
good,Not enough money no life  the world revolves around that company all the time management suck they never back you up on anything the people are friendly
good,"Overall it was ok working there. People did have the opportunity to advance in there but you really had to be committed. If one is not interested in working in costumer service for the rest of their lives, then its not for you."
good,"Clearly defined structure, good supervision, flexible distribution of work load"
good,"Work place was a very friendly place"
good,I worked at home depot for about 6 months. It was a regular job. don't want to do this review. why do I have to do this? it's not optional? It was a decent first job.
good,Night shift was one of the overlooked shifts at the Home Depot where I worked at. Typical night was to unload freight & put into the correct spaces & pack down the shelves.
good,Solid working environment  quick paced  collaborative efforts by all employees  will train you on how to do the work the right and safe way from the start
good,I don't think that I would work tlhere again it wasn't the company that I felt like I could grow with it was very hard on you and the management skills left a lot to be desired
good,okay job for college students no room for growth. Typical retail job stocking unloading some lazy coworkers..............................................
good,"did the service desk, helping customers with  special orders, answering the phones, working the returns register, and doing reports for the manager as well"
good,"Love working with the public. The best thing about working at Home Depot, employees agree, are the benefits. Even part-time employees have an array of benefit packages to pick from, which include medical, dental, stock options, and a 4019(k), as well as vacation and sick days. There aren't many retail outlets like Home Depot, where customers usually come in with a particular task they need help with: a crack they need to seal, or a skylight they need to install. So hiring managers are really looking for applicants with ""a strong knack for problem-solving."""
good,"For a part-time gig this is perfect. The managers at my store are almost non-existent. It wasn't as bad when I first started but now they rarely show their faces unless they need something done from you. In terms of peers, my fellow associates are all great. Great culture and working place. Nothing is too strenuous. Being able to lift at least 30-40LB seems to be a requirement as you may get pulled to any department at any time. Lack of coverage happens quite often which can be very annoying and frustrating. Laid back at times but during the summer months you are always on your feet and MOVING! "
good,I️ was a lot boy when I️ clearly applied for cashier or hardware but it was cool n the lot I️ guess a job is a job yo know but I️ want a cashier job and I’m searching for a better pay I️ love Home Depot
good,Not a bad company to work for. Need to pay employees more. Original founders made the company great. Not a great company anymore. Should take care of employees better.
good,"Overall have had a positive experience with Home Depot - I believe it has given me good work experience.  That being said, there is a high rate of turnover at this particular store (we are in a bad part of town) and we seem to be short staffed on a regular basis."
good,"Home Depot's training is terrible. It's more of ""throw you to the wolves"" mentality. In my case it was as a Receiving Supervisor....I really had no one to supervise. I had so much on my plate I could  get nothing done. I really liked the job, but when you have to juggle 2 departments with no one to help you.....it's terrible. I tried to my best to have a solid team, but the changing of schedules and the lack of pay they offer it was hard to keep a good crew."
good,it was good to work at. it was a decent work schedule. management was kinda horrible and very rude at times. i left the company but would probably go back .
good,Overall i enjoyed working for The Home Depot because of the other cashiers in my department. i always enjoyed meeting the new customers and discussing the projects they were starting or discussing the outcome of finished projects with regular customers. The only negative thing is the had poor front end management. The managers would put off helping the cashiers when they needed help further assisting customers beyond the cashiers ability and in my opinion made the customers look down on the company the cashiers are the last line of contact a customer has with a retail store and i feel they should leave happy and having all questions answered instead of flustered or unsettled.
good,"would help customers with plumbing need such as information on product ,install, and sales. Restocked shelves and helped in other departments. Did some self help and install classes. Would also help in other arears"
good,Good job experience with some nice people to work with. The only problem would have to be the lack of communication from mangers to employees. Other then that it was nice
good,You go in stretch. Have a meeting then put thing away. Working with a team. Management was fair. It was a relaxed work culture. the hardest  was sometime getting larger shipments put away. I enjoyed the team mates I had
good,"High pace in my department, left to work alone even when my department had all the freight.The people I worked with were socialable but not helpful. The management team heard my concerns but never followed through to address them."
good,The job is fairly easy and everyone who works there is great.it's a good work environment and pays fair as well. Just needs to work on scheduling people better
good,"ample training and education available to employees who desired to expand their knowledge base or marketable skills. fairly simple process to move from one area/department to another, if you are proficient and motivated, which helps keep the boredom and complacency at bay."
good,The pay was low and there wasn’t a lot of hours. The management were pretty cool and good at their jobs the worst part about working here was the fact that there wasn’t a lot of room for growth or full time opportunities.
good,"a lot of running around and home depot is a company that doesnt encourage team work which in my opinion it should. Hardest part of the job is when you have to be at 2 places in one time. I learned to work alone, i also learned that even supervisors need help, given the fact that my supervisor would give me some of his work to do. i never left my job without finishing what i had to do"
good,"Was a good starter job."
good,If you are into building things and getting your hands dirty then this is the job for you. Its a real in your face job where u need to know what your talking about and what you are selling
good,"this place was ok to work at not really any place to move up unless someone quit, ""customers are always right"" type of place very annoying sometimes but a good place"
good,With present compensation can not afford rent in the area but pays the bills.  Training and career opportunities for job advancement in retail are available but it is my opinion that compensation is not commensurate and can be improved.
good,The Home Depot was a job I did not work retail I was a fabricator and installer of bathroom and kitchen vanity tops and kitchen tops also did tear outs
good,"I enjoy working for the home depot. I enjoy building sets and setting up for upcoming projects. It feels good when my team and I have a new reset and it looks totally different from how it was before, and having the asm notice all your hard work."
good,Overall I loved working with the people in my store but the company not so much. The pay wasn’t so great for me but I do appreciate the opportunity I was given.
good,"Fun job, good people.  Flexible hours. Co. has partial benefits for part time employees. For a retail environment, management  recognizes accomlishments."
good,"Worked in the Tool Rental department. Had to handle transactions with individuals renting out tools, tows, vans, etc. Biggest difficulty was customers trying to convince you that they had not used the tool that they rented out. Also had to inventory every night prior to closing to keep track of items in and out of the store."
good,Handle incoming calls from store associate and store managers with payroll issues in call center setting in Human Resources. Maintain paper files for reference or research. Entering pay adjustment to correct pass errors. Stay abreast of tax and deduction laws.
good,"I have been with the company for close to a year. They have not offered me a full-time position. However, they gave a full-time position to two employees that where hired after me."
good,"I went from PT cashier to FT and moved up the ladder, eventually finished in the bookkeeping department."
good,"working in the warehouse is fun and the staff are great to work with.  There are so many pallets coming in, duties to fulfill and responsabilities.  This is good if you want to have a fast paced job."
good,the management is fair. they don't accept a doctor or hospital notes.it is always super busy and very enjoyable. there are very slim chances to move to a different positions.
good,"When I worked for the Depot, the pay was fair and the work was hard. It is a warehouse environment and you feel it, for the most part. Their products are of all qualities, good, better, best, and the prices are competitive."
good,"A typical day at work involved taking HR calls all day from THD associates and creating tickets for everything you say and do. I learned basic HR skills but I felt this role lacked the ""human"" aspect of human resources. Everything was scripted and had to be followed exactly as written. It lacks human interaction and feels a little forceful, robotic. The pay was good if you're ok with call center roles."
good,Strong An positive get some rest hard working organized loving people great team happy team caring happy team cheering team hard work good people strong
good,The location that I worked for was unsafe. Our area was the most stressful area in the store. Customers were rude and threatening. I like the company hated the location.
good,"Great company to work for. Great pay,  benefits,  time off. Depot takes care of the associates and families. Depot is very involve in the safety of everyone."
good,A typical night was very busy as far as making sure your department was pristine and well stocked. Overall nice place to work! Alot of things to learn daily!
good,"Hours varied, most customers were nice, excellent management, opportunity to volunteer helping Veterans, ever holiday season one one employee was picked out (anonymously) based on their needs for staff to pitch in and donate presents for their children."
good,"I worked as a customer service associate at the home depot. General daily duties are included in my resume, qwhich can be found online, Thank you for your time,"
good,"It was more or less your stereotypical freight job. Most amusing part of working there was watching a guy smoking a cigarette filled with weed right in front of the manager, about a week before he got fired."
good,I worked at the Home Depot for five years. As a part time job it was not bad. I had a fixed area of responsibility and knew what was expected of me. The training was good and the store was constantly trying to get you to learn more.
good,Hourly associate not paid competitively. Little to no benefits. Good retirement job but other than that was not good for career advancement or anything else.
good,long hours and not rewarding. Need more room for growth and ability to learn new technology. eventually was given the ability to work on my own but took too long.
good,"Home depot over all is a very professional environment When I got the job it was intended as a temporary income until the market  had improve, I think that is a nice place to work for."
good,work environment was very welcoming. Enjoyed coming to work every day. upper staff was very encouraging. Great benefits were included. overall great place to work.
good,Home Depot allows a flexible work schedule to anyone that needs it (within limits of course). There are many types of positions and they offer training for each of the departments.
good,it was a great place to work at but customer service sucked people wee nice holidays were hectic like always. At the end of the day i would work there again. i really like my manager james and my co workers.
good,"It was cool. I liked it"
good,"was a position worked between other jobs. was average in experience, nothing particularly noteworthy. no real oppurtunities to promote from greeter position."
good,I felt that the Home Depot was a good job to work while I was going to school. They were very flexible with me as far as scheduling me to fit into the work schedule and go to school. big thumbs up!
good,The Home Depot is a great store with reasonable prices. If you work hard you can succeed at this establishment. Learn your department and you'll do just fine.
good,"Not enough labor hours per sales to cover needed customer to personnel work load. Management was at times lacking in the building, allowing only the Key holding associate to carry the work load."
good,customers appreciate the service we provide. some customers even come just for one person for advice on a project dedicated customers continue to come in just to say hello
good,"Home Depot was very interesting when I started. It was a very friendly place. But as you got to know people things quickly changed."
good,There's many position in the home depot. I was a merchdiser executive associate. The MEA work in a small group called merchdiser executive team(MET); which they do all the merchandising around the store.
good,OUR MISSION. To generate revenue for the Province; stimulate and enhance economic development; and promote high standards of responsible gambling—all in the best interests of the Province of Ontario.
good,This company has up's and down's justifiably speaking. If you expect too much you will see little to no results in terms of advancing. It will take a lot of time to grow with the company. Full time status is inconceivable unless you get lucky to work the night shift.
good,"My job as a customer service representative was to help customers, accept payments & to ring up purchases for customers.  I learned to look up items that needed to locate for the customer & help get them to our store for the customer. I was working at this store while I was working for Premium Retail Services.  The hardest part of my job was when a customer ran out of the store with stolen merchandise.  My supervisor did not like the fact that I tried to stop him."
good,"I work for a department called M.E.T., merchandising execution team. In retrospect, the day time team is just a price change, stocking team and customer service. this is because of the lack of employees covering the sales-floor."
good,"The Home Depot wasn't as much as I expected when I started working. You can only work part-time. Only managers can work full-time. There are no employee discounts. You can either have 1 hr break or 30 mins. There is nothing new to do, always the same thing every time you work. Employees are friendly, but the managers aren't. It would be nice to receive more benefits, new activities, better paid per hr, and better friendly managers."
good,the customers and co worker made the day go by fast cause your always helping someone through out the day. learned to drive forklift while stocking the department.
good,I enjoyed my job and had an excellent boss but found it to be a very stressful climate which impacted my work life balance which is part of why I left the company
good,"Constant interaction with customers, providing directions for needed items through out store. I have learned about where items are located through out store. Management acknowledges hard workers. Everyday is different which makes your job easy and enjoyable."
good,Can be stressful with rude customers. Summer time is very face paced. get stressful when other departments are unwilling to help you  or when products don't have the proper label or bar code
good,"When I first started, they were starting people out at 11 per hour....7 years later minimum wage which was 9,25 per hour. They would not promote certain people with more experience because they were already above the pay grade."
good,I enjoyed working for the company and with the customers.  I think they are a very good company and hope they do well in the future.  I really do not have any more comments.
good,You have to work morning or nights and this includes the weekends. You're on your feet the entire shift besides breaks and lunch. It's a good place for a college kid to work.
good,Initially it was great because associates were knowledgeable and I learned quickly. It was fast passed and I loved that too. I was the Plant Expert! But associates quit left and right or were fired when the new manager took over and the atmosphere changed dramatically. I was sticking with it anyway until a young man was hired that just did not respect me and I was NOT supported by management.
good,im a cashier so theres not much to say but from what I noticed the rest of the workers are hard working and really outgoing. What I enjoyed the most was that they treated me nices a s a new person.
good,It was a good job while i was there. I left because of a better/ more money opportunity. There store manager sucked and did not care about the employees. the ASMs were awesome and they made working there bearable.
good,"I always look forward to some of the challenges that comes with working for a large company such as Home Depot. Although I only work  4 hours per week day, I often find it quite fulfilling helping customers and other team members."
good,I learned a lot while at home depot. Management could have been better but my supervisors were amazing. Its  a great place to work for while in school.
good,"The job was the same about every night, come in and take the skids that were already unloaded  in receiving by the morning crew  and stock the merchandise on the floor."
good,Management under pressure to work employees hard. Problem is the compensation is poor. I worked graveyard ship as an experienced Freight Associate and was paid 10 dollars an hour. This was in a CA county with an extremely high cost of living.
good,"A typical day includes me trafficking ads to our media partners, managing edits on creative concepts sent from ad agency, corresponding between our design department and internal marketing departments to ensure accuracy on promotions, product codes, and expiration dates."
good,Was told I would be kept on if I did a good job at the seasonal position.   I was told I was doing excellent.  But when the seasonal work ended they let me go.
good,"A relaxed workplace, enjoyed talking and helping customers.. However the is little opportunity for career advancement and that's why I need to find another employer."
good,The Home Depot provides useful knowledge but does not have good management. The managers do not help when associates require time off for personal needs. The Home Depot does not pay associates fairly.
good,As long as you showed up for your shift it was ok changing hours for family issues was not acceptable . Very cold at times no discounts or benefits offered unless you were full text and or management
good,Counting and calculating inventory. Reporting what was available and what was not. Updating product price changes of a handheld planogram. Working with customers to find what they needed.
good,and still get the job done it was really a family oriented work place. it had it ups and down but this job has really got me prepared for even larger work task at hand.
good,"ERRICCO Inc. is one of the the consignor in different hardware. I used to assigned in Globe Master Home Depot in Calamba. I had great experience to be assigned in Globe Master Home Depot,this is my first work in Hardware."
good,"I learned allot while I worked there.  About home improvement projects, My customer service skill was very important there . Manager were ok they had  there favorite t move up in the company,"
good,Home depot lost sight of why they became a great company and focused only on cutting hours. In early 200's they went to a mix of 50% part timers and 50% full timers. Customer service went downhill from there.
good,I started working for this company as a part time shelf stocking employee. In a few months i was given a full time position in a high customer location of the store. (plumbing) With my previous knowledge of construction i was a top customer service employee. i received numerous merit awards for my service and work ethic while with this company. At the end of my first years i was promoted to a supervisor position where i remained for the next 3 years. My only problem working with this company would be the compensation. My starting pay as a supervisor was not a respectable rate.  After you can only gain so much on an annual  raise. The percentage rate was to the point where i could find better pay almost anywhere.
good,Starts with part time work but with good work can become full time. Love the environment great people to work with. Management could use some upgrades.
good,"Job was demanding but had fun moments with customers "
good,"I enjoyed working for the home depot.  I was hired as a part-time employee.  Through my hard work, dedication, and overall performance, I was given the opportunity to become full-time.  The job was stressful and understaffed."
good,"The work environment and management are very nice and make you feel welcomed. I think the problem is having the patience to deal with customers. If you do not have the patience to deal with customers and complaints, this is not recommended for you. Its not a difficult job. Your customer service skills have to be on point and have to have a positive attitude all the time."
good,"Nothing really bad, just fast paced. Management turn overs are huge.  Seem to want to promote minorities even though not qualified.  We always said they promote all managers one day be customers. Every manager, minoroty I worked with was eventually fired.  Seems like a cycle to keep from paying anyone retirement benefits."
good,Working for a division of The Home Depot was a bit different. When they bought out the company I was working for they changed our entire work environment. My job went from a degree required to a HS diploma required.
good,people were great that you worked with demands were many.Shift was 3 to 12 which was ok but very conflicting with family.upper mangement were ok but their expections of what could be done with min people on min wage were unrealistic.
good,"friendly non biased place to work all the managers where hard workers and fair, I would be provided with enough break for the hours worked and was always given lunch breaks"
good,"Home Depot is a ""good"" company, not a great one.  Their retail practices encourage loyal customers at the expense of wages for front-line employees.  The ""cut cost everywhere"" to stay competitive model - based on the desire to monopolize the global market - is a tried an true method that harms the worker."
good,"Stressful I do not wish to disclose any more info. This review was just to help indeed, I'm not a huge fan of the Home Depot after working with them. But i hope the people that do enjoy it, stick with it."
good,Most of the people are good to work with.  The biggest problem with working in these kinds of stores is you are on your feet for long periods of time.
good,"Fast pace, hard work, customer service, forklift ,reach truck, order picker, slip truck, loading contractors and customers, also delivery trucks, flat bed and boxtruck"
good,"I was with Home Depot for quite a few years early in my working career and learned a lot.  This is where I learned management, customer service, sales, purchasing, and vendor relations."
good,"Hours were extremely random"
good,Truly there was nothing remarkable about this job.  My only complaint is that it should be explained to applicants that if you work in the garden department that you will be spending a fair amount of time loading concrete and bricks/pavers into contractors trucks for them as depending on the amount it involves a fair amount of labor.
good,Benefits were decent when I worked there. They were semi-flexible about requesting days off or switching shifts with a co-worker. Hourly pay rate wasn't the best. The manager that was there at the time played favorites.
good,Scheduled   store deliveries and operated newly developed Sales Pro Desk.  I was under paid and was promised better compensation but it never happened.
good,"Home depot very fast paced always in constant moving.I learned how unload in a timely matter. Management fun people yo work with. Diffrent culture orientated place of work. The hardest part of job was trying to unload faster than others. I enjoy the end, time to go home."
good,"I loved dealing with the customers and I worked very well with my peers."
good,"Immediately corrected hazards, unsafe conditions or reported conditions to the Manager on Duty, work safely as not to endanger self, co-workers, vendo"
good,Very fast paced work ambiance. The schedule was incredibly flexible and allowed me to manage my time in an effective manner. On the job training was offered. Work culture was loose knit.
good,"Company has good and bad areas and times, each store has its own set of problems. I was at two different stores and in five different positions some lateral moves to different departments. The management did not recognize the good work done except during store meetings when they had to. Most the time your best work was not good enough."
good,"Hardware & Plumbing associate, performed general warehouse duties such as stacking pallets, cleaning, organizing shelves, stock checks."
good,"It is a good place to work, even if you are looking for a par time thing they will work with your schedule. Pay is your normal big box store pay. Good place to work if you are going to school."
good,"Seasonal work. Depending on the season determined the fast or slow pace of sales, work, stocking, general business. The pay did not match the work that one is expected."
good,"Management would make sexist and rude remarks to employees all the time. If a complaint was made, nothing would be done about it and the person would still work there."
good,"Low pay, good product knowledge training, not enough hours. no benefits for part time. Loved the other associates and hardware. Too much walking around ans standing."
good,I enjoyed the challenging aspect of the job. I work well with others so I also enjoyed being given a task that required two or more individuals to perform.
good,"They worked you all night requiring time limits, short breaks. Not to much of help when it was asked for or needed. Overall, they had no desire to work with you."
good,I was young and just moved to the area searching for a job; Will always be thankful for this company giving me a chance to work with a great company.  They treat their employees like family and teach them skills of working together as team players.  I worked in the gardening department and then moved up to sales; working one on one with people and learning the ends and outs of a box store. I knew this was not what I wanted to do the rest of my life; but again thankful for the people skills I learned while searching for and doing what I do now; welding and building things while sharing my skills with others.
good,This was temporary job as I  was living in Utah for a short time. It was a good learning experience.  I would recommend this type of job for a student or someone who needs  flexible schedule.
good,It was a fast paced environment and you have to me your quota everyday. The minimum is 1900 a day. It is easy work just some days are slower than other days.
good,Team was really great. I had a lot of fun working there the first time. The second time one of the managers was horrible and was disrespectful to the other employees and myself.
good,"It took a while to learn the store and get used to everything, i worked in the back a lot unloading trucks. For the amount of work and heavy lifting the pay was below par, It was a tough job and not that rewarding."
good,standing for 8 hours is really the hard part of my job.working as Sales Representative is a very competitive and challenging job. though it is tough but i still reach my monthly quota.
good,"I felt that working at home depot gave me great experience, but they didn't give me enough hours that I needed to pay off debts that I have from going to school."
good,"Never enough people working at any given time, they ask far more of everyone than what one person can possibly handle, the management fails to recognize problems and acknowledge the concerns of associates. The other associates are great and friendly but the management is horrible."
good,"Paint - The understanding of the how the computer calibrate the machine for each color spectrum. What paints bonds to what surface & why & how. "
good,"Working as a sales associate in the paint department, I did get to learn quite a bit about the tedious process of home painting. Co workers helped make the days more fun, with the few friendly customers who came to help brighten my day"
good,"Employed 4 years and the leadership in my store's location is pretty decent. I  help to ensure skill development and avid associate coaching, while supervising departments. The work place culture is to provide"" Happy associates in a Family environment"", which is uplifted most of the time. The hardest part of my job title is feeling I am the only leader in store who view my peers and other associates as ""people"" first above workers.My most enjoyable task at work is problem solving. While employed in retail, I have learned patience and that there are some truly ridiculous people in the world."
good,it was very customer based and i enjoyed that working with different people every day. and sometimes there were days where that was very difficult all in all was a fun job
good,"working at home depot you will learn a lot of things ranging all over the place from things like wood working to gardening tips to fixing house hold things you never new how to fix before, an interesting job."
good,The experiense i had was very fun because the maniger was very fun to work with if i dint has to stydy at the time i willl stood there for sure working for a long time
good,The home depot is a great company to work for. if your a hard worker you will rewarded for it. the people are friendly and the have a decent benefits package
good,Not a bad place to start off but unless you are retired and need extra work or its your first job then you don't want to stay there forever. Otherwise the management and everything else was good.
good,Being a cashier was fun and pretty easy. The lack of communication and information about the products makes some customers angry but the will typically take it out on the other employees
good,"Honestly it was so long ago that I don't think my critique is applicable,  I enjoyed my time there and got my first management experience here.  All and all positive"
good,I didn't have any serious complaints about working there except that some employees that were there for a number of years were not very friendly or very quick to answer my questions.
good,"Every job is basically so specialized and/or repetitive that no one escapes boredom. Sometimes the physicality creates fun on a task, especially in teams."
good,I have been treated poorly and the job was going nowhere as I was in  school and needed time to get it right.  I was thinking ahead so it went forward and did stress it out.
good,Not enough pay for what I need. It was a great first job for me but I want to further my career. I liked the people I worked with but what/need more pay.
good,you checked in to your job and 2hrs. later got a 15 min. break --the most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers--what I learned was how to mix paint
good,"Deliveries is always a busy Department however, If there is no schedule delivery there is always something to do. Help other departments or help customers in the store."
good,It was a decent place to work. There was a lot of ins and outs about it but if you need a part time job they were an okay place to work especially if you don't have children.
good,"You are expected to answer the phone, release orders, perform sales and refund transactions, as well as any other amount of duties, most time being the only employee at the Customer Service Desk. Multitasking is a must."
good,Maintained stock in departments and some interaction with customers made it enjoyable.  Also enjoyed finding all the product s that were available for certain jobs and how I could apply to solving my own do-it -yourself problems.
good,"If I could improve one thing there, it would be the training. They could do a much better job teaching the technical knowledge needed to really help customers. I had to learn on the job, which was pretty difficult and frustrating, especially when the company advertises that their employees are supposed to be there to help. "
good,"your basic job in retail , people are nice and management isn't bad nice  place if your looking to stay there forever but all in all not a bad place i still liked work at lowes better"
good,Answer calls about customer service orders and what was happening with them. Place orders for items for customers Took care of customers and resolved issues about shipping
good,"Not enough staff to help out all the customers, a very stressful environment with little chance to advance. You have to get into a clique to maintain your job here."
good,"MET works indepently of the store. However, MET is paid less money and performs more work than store associates. The work hours are great, off on every major holiday. Time deadlines for projects were frequently shorten due to competion between district managers. This caused undue stree on staff."
good,"Worked over-night as supervisor. Ensure that the trucks were"
good,"Working at Home depot has been a good experience. My typical day would usually be busy. I learned more about being a garden associate. The workplace was diversity including coworkers, management, and customers. I did not have a hard time at this job  , The most enjoyable part is my coworkers."
good,"Its not a hard job. They have music for us to listen to while working. I just feel like they have to be more organize . The management needs to be more on top of things that go on threw the day ,"
good,"Working at the Home Depot is interesting, Depending at which location you are at, you can like it better than the other locations like wise with the type of customer you get."
good,It was the just normal day. working with customers helping with the services and get the product out the door. Standing and waiting for customers to come get their services
good,if you like working on your own pace and completing task this is the job for you. the task are easy at times but can be done no issues. the hardest part of the job is the walking around a lot.
good,"The store I had been working for had kept the same manager for a much longer time than was normally permitted within the company, and I suspect this probably hurt the store in the long run. As a whole, the company seems likely to be a decent one."
good,The reason that I left is bc I could not have a set schedule and plan my life around work instead of my life around work. I also like have some normal schedule to work instead of always having to ask off for days
good,"I have been working there for a year and I still am not comfortable doing the job . It is very fast past and the expectations are a bit much. You are expected to race through a call and give the customer outstanding customer service but you only make 16.00 a hour."
good,Home Depot is a company that provides service to customers and treated employees fairly and was clean environment and safety for their employees and customers as well
good,"Must be a people person, requires lifting and lots of walking. Good opportunity for advancement and ok pay. Hours will vary depending on job title and location."
good,Great Place To Work to Much Slavery Great Employees Manger Very respeactful And Concerned Boss Is To Much Of a Controlling Boss but still enough To deal With
good,"This is a big-box retail environment and the environment for each location is different with some locations being good and others not."
good,Can be a fun place to work. They do have quotas to meet so it can get stressfull. You don't always have enough people to cover everything that needs to be covered.
good,It was cool to be able to learn about different products that Home Depot provided. Bathrooms were disgusting. Consumers expect for employees to know everything about everything.
good,"My job was stocking products, organizing boxings, cleaning the garage, sweeping the floors, cleaning the premises, helping with costumers. it was a good way to with others."
good,My typical night at work consist of stocking shelves and relocating merchandise. work place culture was balanced. the most enjoyable part of my job I got to work independently.
good,The home Depot was a great place to work while I was in school. I learned many things about home improvement and many methods of doing certain tasks. The job taught me to be punctual and to present myself in a professional manner. Most importantly... the customer is ALWAYS right.
good,"Terrible management, not concerned for individuals whom are being harassed at work. Did poorly at finding a happy medium between associates. Complaints were pushed aside and never were reviewed."
good,"Its the home depot... its right for a person looking to get into retail, the usually promote from with in so just getting a job does allow you to move up in the company, however, you'll be working there for 5-10 years before hitting manager position."
good,It's a job . if thats what you need. it's dusty and dirty but the people are amazing and fun. fully expect to climb ladders and use machinery.  Also sometimes they have pizza.
good,"This was a seasonal job on a casual basis, although my offer of employment letter specified part-time."
good,"I enjoy working with most of the associates in my department and most of the customers that I deal with."
good,Overall Retail can be a demanding job geared toward the customers needs.  Work schedules are mostly changing week to week and requiring weekend availability. The Merchandising team is one job however that has regular set hours and no weekends.  People working in  Merchandising work as a team but also are self directed at times.  My team works well together with virtually no unpleasant exchanges.
good,Customers come into both the consumer and business areas of the store to purchase items for home as well as bulk items for businesses to rebuild/remodel local homes and businesses. Culture is team based and the hardest part of the job is lifting heavy materials or items that people purchase. Most enjoyable is the time spent with the other team members.
good,"Honestly this job was pretty decent, but the hours they had for lot loaders wasn't the best. On average I would receive between 25-35 hours, don't remember ever receiving a 40 hour work week."
good,Typical day is going in looking for a FIRST phone and using it to pick customer orders. Hardest part of the job is sometimes you wont get the recognition that you deserve.
good,Its a great company but the management sucks. To much favoritism goes on in the building so its ha d for you to move up unless you kiss up. But they have good benefits
good,The Home Depot pays minimum wage and expects much more than a minimum wage employee. I was there before the minimum wage increase and it was okay. Then the minimum wage went up and home depot kept the same pay. The job is definitely not worth the pay.
good,I worked as a lot associate and assisted Customer's with their merchandise. I Translated Spanish to customers that could not speak to English. I would also translate from English to Spanish.
good,After changing mirror Company the rules change for the time could North the time new people came in new you started part-time that men should full-time got our lives that is all Irish to space
good,Helps You grow to better yourself in order to find a better job gives you the expierience needed in order to grow within yourself... home depot offiers great services
good,good work environment. ability to change work position and learn more throughout the store. takes a while to gain full time status. good company to work for.
good,"Normal box store job.  Not a whole lot you really can control.  Everything comes from the ""higher up"" at home office.  You really can just try to make the customers that come in happy."
good,"For the most part, Home Depot is a good place to work.  If you have personal events happen they do have programs to help employees but there is a bit of a double standard on work ethics.  Some managers are very much about work first and some are about the balance between home and work.  There is a good attitude for being safe on the job by the company, still if some managers are in a rush they have tried to be, just get it done, instead of do it right."
good,"At home Depot i learn how to drive a Forklft."
good,"The Home Depot is an alright place to work, especially if you put a lot of effort into it. There are a lot of advancements waiting to be taken if you are willing to put in the work."
good,"this was my first real job, pay was ok at first since I was younger, however, after being there for years I was unfairly passed for a supervisor position due to age. Many people that I still work there love it, just report when things are unfair."
good,"Good company, individual locations need help with management. Typical night 4 hours. I've learned, people need to take their career in their own direction. Management keeps people right where they are to get work done."
good,"They pay low for experienced cabinetry designers."
good,It was alot to learn with really no help. I enjoyed that I was able to work in two departments giving me the opportunity to be learn about the tools in hardware and the garden center.
good,It was okay. Not a great place to start a career. I would reccomend it as a temporary job or summer job but nothing long term. Look elsewhere if you want to start a career.
good,The people where fun to work with and you got to interact with many new customers each day. If you had a question on anything any of the other team members would always help out.
good,"I am a hard working and dedicated employee, I give 100% always. This being said, I saw others who, in my opinion, were not suitable for advancement get advanced anyways, while I'm being overlooked."
good,Employees were very nice to work with. Enjoyed engaging with customers. Management was always very pleasant as well. Always there when you had any issues or concerns whether you were an employee or customer they took the time to give attention and satisfaction.
good,"Worked as MET Associate, the ones in orange shirts, not an apron. Set bays to POG's in a limited amount of time, helping any costumer or any issue with the project made time go over. Management struggled to hold on to costumer issues, but the lack of any real number of employees working departs made them of little use. People were quickly hired and soon left to find other jobs. Many long term employees seem to just live in the chaos and mismanagement. Best part of the job were other co-works and daily struggle to get things done."
good,"productivity,a good company,with joyful employees and a lot of memo for the progress and development of the company itself.They conduct trainee for the new employee"
good,Not a career field company. over work and under pay employees. if you are a young and need a job this is for you. dont expect to make working a home depot a career.
good,"the management was good. it was a very diverse environment, i worked on the electricity department and learned a lot from there. the culture was very different but we were all friends it wasn't that hard of a job but i learned a lot from there"
good,"Full time is sparse and may simply be given to other associates. I experienced many cases in which fellow employees were sexually harassed and the management simply either shrugged it off or even berated and belittled the victim for things like not reporting it immediately after the event transpired. Can give major kudos to their willingness to work with hours for part timers, I attended school during part of my time working here and they made sure my needs were always met regarding making sure that working didn't interfere with class times."
good,"Pleasant work environment."
good,"Not many hours available for students"
good,"Given my position as a cashier, work is typically steady on a weekday. Weekends (Friday-Sunday) however, are a bit more fast paced while pushing harder on credit sales. I learned much about answering basic questions customers gave me regarding where to direct them within the store or directing them to a knowledgable associate within the needed department. Management is so-so. Essentially, they claim they're willing to help you as much as possible with any conflict that needs to be resolved. Most of the time, they're easy going with helping you out. Although, there have been numerous occasions of management stating they'll 'get back to me' but never do I hear back from them unless I approach them several times to remind them of the matter at hand. What I enjoy most is my co-workers. I've made such close connections at work with my co-workers and I can definitely rely on them to help through any problems I may face. Also, I've built a great relationship with a handful of customers/contractors that are considered regular shoppers in our store."
good,"The hardest part of the job is for associates who have to stand still on a concrete floor with steel toe shoes, they experience lots of pain in their feet."
good,Home depot expects a lot from it's employees. The pay is min wage and you'll be lucky to get more than $ 0.15 on your yearly raise. The only way to get more is to suck up and and move up but if you do move up the money isn't really much better for the stress and the responsibility
good,this place was so unorganized and the supervision was awful. they have changed a lot since i been there it was not a great place to work then. My review is really irrelevant because they have changed a lot of things since then i  don't know if its better or worse
good,it was a good stable environment to work in. The peple werent the best  to work with though. It was more of individual work. meaning it was very every man for his/her self.
good,"On a daily basis I helped customers with purchases, maintained inventory and loaded vehicles. I learned how to drive a forklift, unload trucks and stock shelves."
good,"Peers and customers are good to work with, administrators can be on top of you with an attitude. The compensation is barely nothing and you only receive dental and vision if you are not a full time employee (something that is very difficult to get)"
good,Expect a lot of work from their employees with little pay. Always short staff the job so a lot will be left for the employees to do throughout their shift.
good,HD is good place to work for the most part. The management can vary due to the nature of the business. Its a fast paced customer service driven company that values the employees knowledge.
good,I've realized different locations are ran completely different. there are very good ran companies and there are bad location companies. i have had my share with both.
good,home depot is a nice job but it wouldnt fit everyone you have to have patience with customers and its very overwhelming at times. and sometimes they dont even show you  the credit you deserve
good,Worked for company for many years. The core values of company are amazing but over the years they are lost on salaried managers that only look out for themselves and do not hesitate to have others to do their work. There is a lot of favoritism based on how your relationship is with manager and not job performance in the location that I was in.
good,"This review pertains only to Home Depot Interiors (HDI). Note: If you were born with the gift of selling over priced kitchen refacing projects, then this job is for you. But then again if you're that good why would you want to work for HDI when you can get a much better job. Nevertheless, if you're persuaded by one of the HDI managers to pursue this 100% commission line of work (HDI Sales Consultant), know that nothing will be reimbursed towards any daily costs, i.e. gas, tolls, or any ware and tear due to excessive millage (believe me this becomes costly).  Lastly, if you manage to sell one of these highly priced kitchen reface project and install department (for whatever reason and through no fault of your own) blunders the project and the customer cancels the project as a consequence, know that whatever little commission you made will be garnished from your pay EVERY TIME.... Management, however, is really good.   They need to be since people are always quitting..."
good,Job was easy enjoyed workers and management. The work place culture was positive. The most enjoyable part of the job is the workers and the houly pay for a partime worker.
good,"At The Home Depot there is a great opportunity to learn many different skillsets, however not many of these skillsets benefit the employee in compensation. A typical work day starts out with a laundry list of tasks that continuously grow throughout the course of the day."
good,I like where i work but i need to start working full time and earning enough cash to live on my own. job training and health insurence would be great as well.
good,"Great benefits, flexible hours, very few hours were given, favoritism, poor management, pay is really low, after a decade looking for a better pay, raises are only 2%"
good,They are ok they do so much part time and they don't care about your hours. The manager i worked with would give us the personnel or hours to complete a task.
good,"Co workers are good for the most part depends what department you are in and what kind of department head you have"
good,"Work is fast paced and learning techniques for cashiers are difficult. Most enjoyable part is knowing and meeting the clients, employees, and contractors."
good,"For over a year the following tasks were performed daily. Ensured proper ordering by included but not limited to counting orders, verifying orders picked up, end-processing of customer orders, hand loading trucks, removing shipping totes from conveyor system, and placed items on shelves. Oversaw proper packaging of products as well as picked, packed, received, and restocked products with forklift, lift truck and stock picker. Processed work orders and prioritized jobs. Utilized facility tracking system to keep accurate records. Made sure customers were satisfied by providing the highest quality of products. Planned work and determined appropriate tools and equipment.  Promoted a safe and clean working environment. Reviewed work orders and communicated with prior shift to assess work needs for the day.  Led group teams to perform daily tasks.  Assisted in management of business operations by maintaining records and files, preparing cost and inventory reports, and ordering supplies. Kept supervisor informed of job progress and material requirements Maintained inventory of tools and supplies. Notified supervisors of faulty operations and defective materials."
good,While working at the Home Depot I had wonderful experiences from celebrating holidays to community events. Although at times the work place became stressful my coworkers and I always tried to keep the day run smoothly yet keeping a profession and adequate environment for the customers.
good,Flexible with the hours great job environment. Graceful staff multiple break times get paid overtime partially flexible with calling off or sick days.
good,"As many say, having any sort of retail experience under your belt is a very good thing to have. At the location I worked the people were above & beyond amazing!"
good,"lots of change in management depends on what the popular people thought about you, no confidentiality among the workplace, sometimes my lunch was stolen"
good,I enjoyed working at Home Depot. Management listened to you when needed to talk to or have a issue resolved. Everyone who works there is friendly as could be.
good,"I wouldn't work there ever again in my life. The management, associates, and customers were terrible. The management would be your friend one second then another want to finally be a boss. There is too much gossiping going on in the store and not a lot of working is getting done among associates. The customers always seem to have an attitude when they come in and feel overly entitled to the point they will yell at you, throw their items at you, and even try to fight you when you tell them no."
good,I think if you're looking for comfortability and good with customer service Home Depot will be a good fit for you. Great benefits and friendly people to work with overall I. Find it to be the wonderful company to work for.
good,What can i really say i mean its a cool place to work if you just want something to do.i really have nothing that i want to say about this job at this time.
good,"I learned so much at home depot .As customer service is what i love it gave me a chance to expand in many ways.I really grew past my level of customer service and became usefull in all departments.my favorite part of the job was my customers,they looked for me to provide them with the service they know and trust they can depend on. management became very difficult and moral went down.alot of the best associats started quiting.very sad"
good,"Terrible, terrible, terrible. No support from upper management. All pomp and stance. More and more responsibility with fewer people and no compensation. Hardest part was finding enough time to complete tasks while dealing with customers because of being under staffed. Best part was being able to help a customer fix their problem."
good,Not a good place to grow they pick favorites there so it's not the best place to work but the people are good people I love working with customers and they loved me
good,"Home depot is a decent place to work, The other employees are very friendly and has a good job culture. Management is decent and allow people to take time off when requested."
good,"Home depot allows you to learn each department through specialized training and coaching programs. Once completed, placement in the most appropriate department is implemented."
good,"I enjoyed working for the company. The workload was fair and the income opportunity was fair.  Job stability was uncertain: When the work load decline, your assignment ended."
good,Very fast paced and competitive. I enjoyed my job and the people I worked with.  Challenging work and supervisor encourages employees to learn more about ho the job and company works
good,"I learn a lot from here haw to sel any tools and work whit costumers help others Work As a team whit others help down stock shelf,S and clean my area of work etc."
good,"High paced working environment, management that was relatively easy to work with, very customer service strong work standards.  biggest issue: customers"
good,The Home Depot is a nice place to work. I am currently not receiving the amount of hours I was told I would be getting. I have to provide for my son when it comes down to it!
good,Hard work for low pay.  Turnover of employees is very rapid due to massive firings (mostly for those who have trouble coming to work on time) and those who escape to better paying jobs.
good,"This company likes people"
good,it was a fun place to work at. it had its good and bad parts of the job. for one it was its hours and days off. but it was ok for the most part. good customer skills are required
good,"Ultimately left because of how understaffed they are and that makes it more difficult for people who are there. The pay is alright, but I did like the head cashiers that I worked with, but management was just OK."
good,Home Depot can teach you a lot as a young individual. A job I recommend for a job to launch you into something bigger. Management is difficult most of the time. You have to try really hard to gain respect and be moved up.
good,"Need better leadership, supervisor needs to be better train in taken control of many situation that needs to be handle instead of coming in for a pay check"
good,awesome place to work if you love to play ping pong and deal with super happy customers all the time and it is also great because you get free super fast wifi!!
good,The work in my position was usually stressful but paid off in the end since the end result was worthwhile. There's things the company can approve on but all in all Home Depot isn't a bad place to work. They cut hours during slow times though.
good,I did enjoy the job but management was crazy. Even though there full grown adults they dont act like it . They bicker like children and have no control of there anger when there put in  tough situation.
good,"Sadly Home Depot has gone downhill over the years as an employer. What used to be a fun work environment with  positive reinforcement has turned into a stressful environment with little to no support from management. Customer service is supposed to be the number one focus. But with little staff on hand to put more money in upper managements pocket, there are people working 2-3 departments at a time by themselves on many occasions which as you can imagine leaves much to be desired for customer service as there is only so much 1 persons alone can do. They have gotten rid of departments and just added the work into another. "
good,"Home Depot provided me the training and developing I needed to start my management career. They did not provide the best quality of life for staff, but overall decent place to work if you enjoy dealing with the public."
good,This job was the first job that I received after 4 years in the United Sates Navy. It helped to teach me people management skills and balancing labor budgets.
good,"Processed transactions."
good,Home Depot focuses on customer service while educating the employees on the areas making them knowledgeable to assist customers. You learn the basics of each area of the store
good,It was a seasonal job but I enjoyed learning about plants.  I only worked part time so not much to review aside from friendly atmosphere and co workers.
good,not  much  to  say  only  worked  there  a  couple  months  to  get  by. shift  were  always   short.  hours  always  changed.  good  job to have  for people with no experience
good,The Home Depot allowed me to earn income while I was in the process of competing my undergraduate degree. Allowed me to develop my customer service and time management skills.
good,"Didn't really mind working there, had a good group of poeple I worked with while I was there but the pay is definitely not enough. Shift hours were great though."
good,"Compte tenu de la transaction américaine avec cette compagnie, je préfère m'abstenir de commentaires."
good,fellow employees and customers are great.   very fun people to be around.  great place to gain any home improvement experience.  lots of training makes employees confident in abilities.
good,"I have worked at Home Depot many years, it is a great place to work, but overall experience varies by location and store manager. It has had ups and downs over the years"
good,"They were great to work for, yet they had no room for advancement. They moved me from Cashiering to the Garden section, and did not proved proper tools to water the plants. I almost developed arthritis from using bad hoses."
good,"Strong company drive to provide customer service excellent, in a busy atmosphere where tasks change constantly and employees must be flexible in working as a team to accomplish projects."
good,"I cannot provide a review for this company.  It has been over 20 years, and it has changed. Sorry to say, I will not be able to provide anything beneficial."
good,"Very good place to work, only thing that would probably bother a person with no customer service experience is the customers LOL but I think its good."
good,I really don't know what to say about this place its not too bad to work at if you like getting empty promises and your schedule changed randomly. Some great people work there though.
good,Days move pretty quick and fellow employees are great to work around. Besides lack of communication and the heat in the warehouse it's a good place to work. pay could be a little higher and top pay could be a little more to desire 7. These are all minor things compared to other places.
good,"I learned a lot in a short period of time. I found a lot of ppl that work that do not like to work. Upper management was great. It was great, i lived right down the street. They gave me a chance when no one else would. I will be re-applying."
good,"busy, stressful, love the customers, employees are great, great vacation time, 401k plan, success sharing for the employees, health benefits, vision, dental"
good,Nice place to be at. Cool people nice management . Really was a busy environment fast pace . lots of work to be done. most of the day your really busy.
good,"Helping customers with their purchases, sometimes helping them load items if we're low on people. Expected to give maximum effort for minimal pay, but that's normal. Good coworkers is what helps you get past it all."
good,Works with you on scheduling.  Has excellent training.  Has get team work.  Worked with customers and handled cash transaction. Helped with customers request.
good,People I worked with were nice. Paid OK for part-time work. Part-timers have a flexible schedule and supervisors were respectful to me and other workers.
good,"The Home Depot used to be a great company to work for, however when the economy took a hit they quit paying their employees as well.  If you were hired after the hit you pretty much get minimum wage and their pay raise schedule leaves very little room for quality of life advancement."
good,"work benefits are very good, but for those who needs it. "
good,Good work place very good job environment. Can get pretty busy at times but overall a good place to work. Pay is not good at all even if you become supervisor.
good,"Enjoyed opening new stores. Watching a team come together was very rewarding. Once the store was open, the working relationships grew, creating a powerful team."
good,This is a great place to work because there are so many different locations to choose from and move around too.  This allows employees to be well rounded and get great diversification.
good,Decent place to work. Difficult to find means of predictability within the work schedule. Too many work life sacrifices on personal time. Compensation for holiday work is poor.
good,"hours aren't perfect, shift changes are done in advance. Only box company in town. knowledgeable folks work there in their areas of expertise. employees that don't show for work impact all employees"
good,"The home depot has a motto to put customers first. Great environment to work in and they do demand a lot from it's employees. For a part-time job it is not bad. If you are not willing to move of the career ladder, the wages they pay aren't worthwhile, in the long run."
good,The managers did not stick to their words when it came to important things in my life. For example high level baseball I was not able to miss and was told I could take the time off to play but when it came to the days I needed off I was told I could not miss work.
good,To much favoritism and associate/ manager/ supervisor friendships.  I have seen a lot of race issues working for this company. Anual raises are terrible at this company. Your lucky to get 25 cent.
good,it was ok. people there were polite and very understanding. also developed a lot of useful skills like learning how to use a forklift. and my position was easy
good,i was with the company for 8 and a half years my store back in my home town was great after 6 years i transferred to the home depot on skibo rd and it was horrible the management were very unprofessional and very disorganized its great if your a favorite employee home depot is not a bad company but there fayetteville store need reforms
good,"Nice place to work, friendly co-workers. As a cashier, not nearly enough hours to pay bills and support a child. They hire way too many employees so they do not have to give each one of them many hours. I'm sure there is some type of benefit for them as a company in doing sobbut not the employees who actually need to make money to live."
good,"Heavy duty lifting, lots of questions, lots of action, memory needs to be decent, could probably advance to a higher position to stay longer and work for the company"
good,home depot was a cool well balance job easy for the most part and friendly people .the company overall is a good compqny to work for starting off cause u can learn a lot
good,"The dress code at Home Depot is casual, but the work enviroment is not good. Management is poorly trained and don't care how many people they hire or fire. They have a high turn over rate because of how poorly they treat the employees, so people quit a lot and then there are a lot of unqualified people working in the store. They also will fire anyone who they feel is not one of ""them."" It is very much like being in a dictatorship with a grade school mentality operating the place. Highly stressfull because of the lack of employees willing to stay and put up with the dumbies running the place!!!!!"
good,"The hands on supervised training is in need of work, sink or swim does not work in many cases. The dire need of bodies on the floor does not supersede the proper training of ready and anle new associates."
good,They really work you to the bone for the little wage you get. they give you lots of hours and expect the world of you. But they do give pretty good benefits and they do take care of you which is a plus
good,"I worked in tool rental. I repaired , cleaned , and rented out tools, large trucks, trailers, ect.  I also worked the sale floors as well. management teaches you some things along the way. but personally they need to do a better job, they are in such a rush, that they assume everyone knows about tools, ect. which in my experience is not always the case. if they teach others the right way to do things in a slow and steady pace. I promise things would run a lot smoother. but other than that it was a good job. once I got the skills I needed , I preformed really well in this job."
good,"The Home Depot at peak seasons (spring/summer) is a mad house, with the right amount of staff is certainly manageable. As a special services associate I feel extremely under paid for the amount of work but more importantly the amount of responsibility that is put on the associates. The training of associates needs BIG improvements, I am a fan of on the job training however the ""sink or swim"" ideology is not for me.  The management team is fairly new and seems to be focused on bettering the store, the associates and it's processes which is promising in comparison to the past mgmt. staff.  The hardest part of the job are the irate or difficult customers we come across, the staff and support associates help to make the job enjoyable."
good,"Home Depot is a company with fun work place. They're adapting the latest in the industry and trying to get ahead in the market. Currently with open floor environment, it's a good place for your career growth."
good,I liked the company over all but there is very small chances of advancement and management at my particular store is very un professional. I would prefer an environment where there is more career advancement and a better atmosphere than my previous job.
good,"Don't know what else to say. It's a typical retail position with all the shortcomings you could expect from such a position. However, Home Depot was very willing to work with my scheduling needs."
good,At the Home Depot I enjoyed working with people because the emplyee to employee culture was great. I learned alot about what it takes to understand exactly what the customer needs tom complete their projects an etc.
good,This was also a temporary position. Which meant that once the work order was complete the job ended. No job security. Work well with others and willing to learn how to operate more machinery
good,I have learned a lot and from working with a great staff at Home Depot and I'm glad I've experienced it. The workplace itself was great nice and clean environment.
good,Culture at home depot was an an important aspect of the job. Comparative pay was certainly not. Human resources was oblivious to the repercussions of their actions and behavior towards staff
good,"the management in the store i worked in took no personal accountability for their actions and would actually try not to schedule dept. supervisors on days the district team would come so we couldn't talk to them about the issues we needed addressed."
good,"The environment at the Home Depot among the employees and customers is one of great love and positivity. Unfortunately, the company is s big that the corporate practices can fail and end up being quite unfair and unforgiving in particular situations."
good,"Customer service is huge."
good,"This was a very laid back retail environment. Managers and supervisors were very knowledgeable and friendly. "
good,This is a very competitive field to be in.  HD did their best to make the sale as attractive to customers as it could.  HD offered a very good product.  Making a sale was a long process.
good,Decent management team. Room to advance. Hours not always that great. Average pay. Do plenty of hands on work with customers. Depending on where you work you may be lifting a lot.
good,flexible and accommodating if your in need of a second job. It is a wide diverse working environment. Culturally respectful and on going. You can begin at one position and develop in the hierarchy.
good,I recommend working at the Home Depot. Management is good. Workplace culture is good. The hardest part of the job is probably juggling management and customer service.
good,I enjoyed my time working for home depot. Everyone worked as an team and effectively.the compensation for our job could've been better. the overall experience was satisfactory.
good,"did learn alot based how i did and product i saw used and put away."
good,"I had been working at The Home Depot full-time (More than a year) and it was ok"
good,Most of how this store treats you will be based on the department you work in.  Certain departments have a much easier time and get better compensation.  Another place to apply to multiple stores and get an idea of which is best to work in.
good,"family oriented, great benefits, Big Turnover rate, fast pace, Standing job, customer service, Phone sales, Pro Sales, home installs, extended replacement  plans"
good,This was a good company to work for in general. The hours were pretty good for the most part. The management in my specific department wasnt great by overall a good company
good,"Great company, national recognition, well structured, good working environment. opportunities for advancement in different states.  Easy to learn and management is nice."
good,"I have been working here for 4 years and it's a fun place to work, also very comfortable. Advancement within the company depends so much on management and work life relationships."
good,"was given 10 very old manufactured homes to remodel, no a/c...some times it reached 130 Degrees. couldn't work more then 6 hrs per day. "
good,"It was a nice place to work, not somewhere I'd make a career out of. Hours fluctuated dramatically from week to week, pay could have been better, and management wasn't organized."
good,People were friendly and easy going. They treated as a family or as a friend and they do not feel that they are better than me. I wish I could've stayed more but there is more to my future.
good,"just a part time job, previous store manager (who doesnt work there anymore) left much to be desired. Its fine if you need benefits though, as any part time employee can apply."
good,"Overall typical day was boring and long at times, especially in the winter due to low home improvement. As a cashier, the job was boring because we had to stand around doing nothing until we got a customer."
good,"I've worked for the company several years and have transferred to many different stores and my experience in each has been widely different. My primary experience in the Crescent City location was excellent, as my management team saw my value and gave me many opportunities to advance. My next experience in West Sacramento however, was extremely negative. They abused my knowledge of the office and vault system to give one of their associates a vacation, then put me back out on the floor as a cashier. At Yuba City my experience was mostly positive, but I had personal issues and had to take a leave of absence. I returned to the company two years later at the Auburn location and my faith in the company was restored, as I was promoted almost immediately and valued highly. After a transfer to the Chico location my advancement stalled once again, as the store heavily played favorites among locally based associates and only gave advancement opportunities to them."
good,sales consultant for there exterior sales is straght commission and if you miss spec they are easly to blame you and take out of your commision. They need to have a base plus commision.
good,Fun place to work but hard on legs and back standing all day for $10/hour.  People are good to work with and all associates are hard working and good at what they do.
good,"Being a customer service associate is stressful and tiring from walking alot, but it can be exciting at times. You can eye shop while you work especially in seasonal department."
good,Physical work and managerial skill is most vital element to sustain in this current portfolio. Need to do all the round clock work and trying to satisfy the company need is important.
good,At home depot you will use ur knowlege  of different product to help makes sales for the store. you will learn bout various tools and products that customers will need for there homes
good,"Pretty much was non stop as soon as you clocked in. Getting the Department ready for the public when the store opened, product and shelves looked faced and neat."
good,It was nice and enjoyable at first but about three or four months in you will start feeling a little trapped for me it was more like intentionally held in place because i wanted to move to a new department but they were not letting me.
good,Really enjoyed working with the public and became very good acquaintances with many of the regular customers.  Enjoyed the co-workers that I worked with.
good,"ok place to work, benefits are not so good."
good,Provided excellent customer service. A handful managers were professional. Hardest part of the job? Being pulled in different directions and handling multiple departments because they were understaffed. Most enjoyable? Taking care of customers.
good,"It was a cool fun place to work, loved helping people but cutback on hours too much and not enough to keep me. Want everyone to be happy working 25-30 hours a week cant live on that."
good,This was a learning experience for me. I worked the special orders desk/returns. I love the reports but the rest was very difficult for me to comprehend. I loved talking with all the people but found it difficult not to be in an office setting.
good,"I helped set up the store and management was awful. Total creeps, hitting on all the women. "
good,It was a great experience to work for this company. When i started the company was growing very fast. Lots of positions coming open all the time. When Arthur and Bernie left the company the company never really recovered.
good,Enjoyed working with customers and helping to resolve their garden issues. Product knowledge training was very good. Learned quite a bit about plants and related products.
good,"i has a good experience , i learned great customer and communication skills i would say that home depot is a gray place to work because it teaches you the fundamentals of a fast paced environment"
good,"If you want to get into the housing and construction business, there is not better company to do it with.  They are the leaders in their craft and know how to get the job done."
good,"Can be stressful when it is very busy.  Learned a lot"
good,Great place to be for a part time student. Numerous ways to gain knowledge and move from department to department. Flexible hours for part timers and students and good consistent summer time hours.
good,Buena empresa para desarrollarse y con un ambiente agradable
good,was a nice summer job. learned a lot about plants. some days it was hard to deal with the heat. District manager was very helpful. Heavy lifting of shrubs and trees.
good,Work was very balanced and they offer many knowledge and they help teach new skills and well management very good environment and people great people skills
good,"I didn't mind working at Home Depot, I was part-time and they don't give you set hours. And when I gave my two week notice they finally offer me full-time. Plus I miss the country life so I want to go back to the life I love"
good,"The benefits are amazing, even for part time! There are many areas for moving on, associates just have to put in the work. The atmosphere can be  bit tense at times, and people are expected to churn out labor like water, but it's always exciting!"
good,"Home Depot itself is a good, even great company to work for.  Unfortunately, the store I work at has been going downhill for the past 4 years.  Bad store managers, combined with increasingly counterproductive policies, in addition to the usual lazy workers, have made my job almost unbearable.  But, I still stand by my earlier statement that Home Depot as a whole is a good company."
good,"I worked there for only the summer as a cashier. The job climate was fair, as well as the compensation. My only problem was I found it incredibly boring compared to other jobs"
good,Good entry level job for a high school student or retiree. Great on the job training for multiple positions and advancement. The hardest part of the job is standing on your feet for 8 or more hours a day. The best part of the day wearing comfortable shoes.
good,Schedule varied widely: sometimes opened at 7 AM. Other days closed after 11 PM. Hours were arranged so that work never exceeded 30 hours per week but with the unpredictable hours private life was constantly disrupted.
good,"Its a good job"
good,"The Home Depot is a good company with good and a lot of benefits. It is not a bad company to work in, the ASM takes their jobs serious and also the staffs members are awesome"
good,"home depot is great the people are really gonna decide whether you like your job or not. the management is not bad, the coimpany does what they can do to make the people happy because happy workers is what makes the company successful"
good,We were low on people everyday. Summer rush was stressful. Supervisors were really strict and not very down to Earth people. They really need to pay employees better that would make the job worth while.
good,A standard entry job in the retail industry. Do what needs to be done and things will run smoothly and productively. I don't know what else to say really.
good,"fast paced, management team is outstanding, friendly and helpful associates to work with. high customer service values are the main focus of The Home Depot."
good,I work a minimum of 20 hours a week in the appliance department. I enjoy the interaction with my customers and co-workers. I enjoy solving my customers problems and making a difference in how their project is handled.
good,"Always nice to meet new fellow people, learn new things in the company from merchandising, supervising, tool useage, carpenter skills, construction skills, building etc"
good,"if you like to help people this is the company to work for. All sorts of different shifts to work, Rotate to different departments is a option you will always have."
good,Many positive supportive co-workers but the culture of the workplace was dominated by many more petty ones. Management looked the other way to this culture as well as bought/fed into it. Management was more rewarding to brownnosers as opposed to the actual deserving hard-workers.
good,"for someone who just finished high school or going through college, it is a good place to work. It will give you some experience as to how to communicate with individuals and give you some patience."
good,Great company but it is not easy to transfer or move up to different positions. Pay not always equal to the heavy work loads. Needs training improvement
good,"Worked with some really awesome people and some great characters."
good,"I only worked there for a brief amount of time due to an unknown pregnancy. Not much to review, my short time there was fine. Would not return, however."
good,"Awesome, great store to shop and work at. Very nice people and respectful people. If paid more would enjoy to work for them again. Learned alot there."
good,"What can you say, managers are very lenient, they work with your schedule, a lot of preferential treatment. Managers seem to lack social skills, the most enjoyable part are the bonuses and Christmas parties."
good,I enjoy meeting new people and helping customers. I love that I was given an opportunity to become a member of management. Its rewarding for me to send a customer satisfied out the door.
good,Decent company to work for.  Culture varies from store to store and if management doesn't like how fit into a position they will make your job difficult.
good,"Home Depot is a very unique company, I have learn a lot about the retail business. They have many options for lunch as well as a good workout facility."
good,good team. fast paced environment room to grow. on the job training. knowledgeable associates. success share bonus' twice a year. affordable benefits.
good,very friendly work place the pay wages are very excellent the managers would come out to help you if we ever got behind on work they just knew how to treat the workers
good,"Mostly stocking everyday it was cool because i listened to music and it was quiet most of the night. There was an active supervisor, his name was harry, but most of the time you work independently. The hardest part of the job was it was overnight so i had to work and go to class. The best part was bieng able to afford school and relax at work."
good,"Guide customers to products they need and provide information about them. Various skills such as forklift reach, order picker, how to use hand held device to order products, and find location and price. Management is great most of the department heads are great to work for, the store managers are good leaders. Workplace culture is good, people there respect each other. Hardest part of job is dealing with customers and phone calls at the same time when it is extremely busy. Best part of the job is working with other employees as a team, and helping customers together."
good,Home Depot is a good work place if your coming straight out of college and you need money to pay bills. Home Depot is not a place where I want to grow and work there for many of years.
good,"Home depot is a very productive work place, even when we are not busy we're busy.  Home depot is a good place to work and gain experience for future jobs."
good,Nice place to work. Flexible hours if you are in school or family. For part time. Full time position have set hours. Learn as many departments ad you want.
good,"I worked for the Home Depot for 12 years. It was a good job that I enjoyed very much. The company was very LGBTQ friendly, even though the state in which I worked most definitely was not."
good,"nothing to say much i was more focused on my tasks there was no time to sit around. overall homedepot was enjoyable i had a good time, good co workers and competent manager"
good,"At first I loved working here and was ready to make this my job for the next 10 years to learn everything I needed to know to become a house flipper. However, after about 8 months everything changed. No one has been treated fairly ever since. A lot of favoritism here."
good,"Home Depot, while a fun environment to work in, has an overall lack of advancement .  The pay scale was low, and the hours/schedule were not as consistent as preferred."
good,"Poor time and resource management. They take care of their employees in times of crisis as far as death in the family, or a catastrophe incident. every month or so have events or cook for employees. Job sharing is nice."
good,"Really the thing that makes or breaks working at home depot and lots of places is the store team. a good manager is awesome. bad ones are terrible. the one i worked at had a less than optimal store team. there were lots of great people working there and we were fairly high on customer satisfaction. but a lot of the department leaders were pretty terrible. as well, our store manager was great in some areas but in others was lacking. as well some departments worked in ways that really clashed with other departments. overall the home depot is overall proabably one of the best places to work in the retail field. but a bad store management team can make it a nightmare to help customers and enjoy the work enough to want to stay."
good,Make sure that we had enough registers open during the busiest times of the day.  Help customers with questions and locating the products they were looking for.
good,I worked in a the paint department an it was all brand new. I enjoyed helping people in a different skill to help them. Management gave me them tools to help an even to this day I know what a stain brush and paint brush makes a whole difference.
good,"Good work enviornment, great people in the company. Awesome benefits and bonuses. However they could have offered more resources and options to the reps to better take care of the customer."
good,You have to cheer the Home Depot twice a day. It's kinda weird. They also need to rotate people more instead of the same people getting the harder or easier jobs consistently.
good,"loved working with most of the people there.  Frustrated as a select few were promoted, yet sat around and did nothing, while the majority worked their tails off. Loved helping the customers."
good,"It was honestly a pretty good job. I had two breaks a day, a decent lunch, and a good time working there. Then out of nowhere they started cutting my hours to just 8 a week."
good,"good place to work for but favoritism is  big problem, the job isnt complicated or hard but it is fast paced and can be stressful, benefits are really good but the pay is rather low."
good,"I only worked part-time for a year and a half to pay off my puppy's eye surgery ($2,500).  You do get 30 minute for lunch and a 15 minute break religiously.  Lots of Holiday celebrations, including lots of food.  Awesome bonus program."
good,"Ok job with decent benefits,  Sometimes they feed you. Very hot in warehouse. The enviroment can be uncomfortable for a woman because of all the harrassment."
good,It is a busy place to work. Lots of heavy lifting. Keeps you very productive. Not too fond of the short shifts they offer. They also would not work with my  school schedule.
good,Just watch out is all i have to say. the second you think somebody is on your side they will turn in the blink of an eye.People are very friendly and it is a very nice atmosphere associate wise. opportunity for advancement is very low. its a god job for kids in school or people who are already retired.
good,Home depot is a friendly enviorment with changes throughout the day. Where the pace can go from slow to fast in a flash. But the people she what makes the job more enjoyable.
good,i will work for home depot for a long time just because i have a good time working and interacting with people and learning so much and also growing in to a better person
good,"At the time I was working for this company, my position was Cashier for the Contractors section. Many lead cashiers quit during my employment and management didn't handle the shift very well."
good,It's a good place to work great people but management moves around so much every manager wants something different that's the only con about this job.
good,I learned how to effectively push production to satisfy the customer at the same time being a perfectionist. A typical day at work was for me was focusing on safety. There was a big opportunity for me to drive safety as a floor trainer.
good,Fine place to work for was first job. The place i worked for was bought by home depot prior to that we did a lot of measuring for the company. enjoyed experience
good,"I like working at the Home Depot but I wish we were paid better. $13 an hour is not bad but when it comes to the type of work we do, I think we deserve more. We have difficult customers on a daily basis at our location which becomes stressful to deal with. Management is ok but they can do a better job at showing personal interest and initiative."
good,This was a good company to work for it was just too far from my home and very expensive travel. i literally made enough money to get back and forth. I don't have a bad review for this company at all
good,Some days are busier than others.  All employees are respectful to customers and try to make their shopping experience pleasant.  People seem to get along well and are helpful to each other.
good,"They only had part time work available so I had to leave. "
good,Manage day to day work activity and management of cashiers under my direct supervision. Responsible for the training and professional development of all cashiers.
good,"Its a retail store so its job is almost a revolving door. i liked the work and what i did and helping the customers, just he management at my store wasn't good."
good,"Work days vary to how busy store is. "
good,It was a cool company and nice too work for. i learned a lot about the store and it was a cool set of management. the scheduling was kind of screwed up but other then that cool job.
good,"a lot of work for minimum wage"
good,"ithe team that i worked for was in charge of bay maintenance, setting displays, holiday resets, stock and pretty much everything at home depot. our team is called the M.E.T team"
good,"Working for the Home Depot its not that bad. Even though sometimes you're underpaid there's opportunity to grow if it is available in your store. Bad part its to deal with difficult customers and heavy equipment or product. Overall, its ok job for a beginner."
good,"Good job overall - pays very low, however. It is a good job for a high school or freshman college student unless you are a store manager. For the most part, if you mind your business it is an ok job."
good,I worked four hours a day for twenty hours a week. I did freight team work. I didn't have much interaction with managers on a day to day basis. I wish I did
good,Company didn't pay the employees what they were worth. There was a huge turnover with employees. Management was decent and cared about the employees but seemed to have their hands tied with most instances dealing with employees
good,"good company, did not pay well. were willing to work with my school schedule. very strict , do not mess up or they will fire you. good place to work though"
good,Some days were pleasant and others were very stressful because of the supervisor that was over the freight crew I worked in outside garden and hassled
good,"The job is simple but the opportunity for advancement is difficult at the higher levels. "
good,It is very fullfilling if you ask me. They make you work long hours and kind of forced to take more hours. There is a big turn over rate at home depot so it makes sense why they don't really care.
good,"all the staff were very helpful i worked on 4 month contract i did my level best at work got a lot of appreciation from customers but at the end of contract i was removed from job .Some departments have some heavy work, the workplace culture is very friendly very good benefits for staff like discounts etc good place to work on permanent basis"
good,"enjoyed my time at the company. one of the better big box stores. worked with good people. can be a little too corporate at times, but that goes with the territory"
good,"Favoritism is Badly influenced, Accountability is no where to be given. It is a good company to work"
good,if you have time for a temporary work go ahead and apply to the place to work really good for students or people who are retired  and want something extra to do on a daily basis
good,i enjoyed the atmosphere and enjoyed helping the customers. the management was great. would recommend working for them. i learned different thing about all departments
good,"when I started in 2004 very decent place of employment. But throughout the next few years, there were many management changes which made the working environment challenging to figure out what they wanted out of the staff."
good,good for new associates senior associates over worked and under paid under staffed with qualified workers decent  insurance  and 401 k benefits half year bonuses
good,I worked the night shift. The supervising manager was really good at delegating tasks and fair to the workers and his approachable. It's a good company to worked for.
good,The Home depot as a company was very fun and exciting environment. At times it was very hard to work and focus. The freight team was very disorganized and the associates were kind of hard to get along with.
good,Management would hide or not respond when we really needed them. Requires a lot of standing and no help at most times. But pay was good and received a raise once a year.
good,"Its a good place to work. I worked as a lot loader for a while, but wish the company would increase hirer wages. The Home depot is a fast paced company so you have to work hard everyday."
good,"The hardest part about working at Home Depot wasn't because it was a hardware store but was of people (customers and associates) insulting you because you were a girl and made inappropriate jokes about you take you had to take with a grain of salt, saying that a girl doesn't know anything about hardware shouldn't work there."
good,"Fun place to be involved with the local community. Enjoyed advising and instructing customers. Very safe and upbeat workplace. Did not care for the General Manager his #2. Other management was wonderful, especially in there respected departments."
good,"Most people I worked with were friendly, Enjoyed my job but did not enjoy asking each customer if they wanted to sign up for Home Depot credit card and to fill out the Customer Service Survey."
good,"Working at The Home Depot is like any other retail experience.It has many benefits as well as challenges however it allows you to learn how to handle all types of situations in an appropriate and proper manner. Although management is sometimes less then professional, the environment and interaction among associates and customers is definitely the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Not much hours if you are a part time sales associate during the winter season, other than that nice place to gain experience and work in different departments."
good,not a bad place to work. most of the employees are friendly and it's pleasant to work in most departments. they don't hesitate to put people in departments that they don't know much about.
good,meet great people there. been there for 3 years its great working there I would love to move up so I postion my self in the future. but all and all am happy am working at home depot
good,I really love the environment and people at the Home Depot felt like a family gathering .Sales was new to me and they made it easy for me to understand and learn. Great job
good,"I learned alot working for the company, the good, the bad, and the ugly sides of the business and how things are run. Turn over hurts, and running a very thin crew affects customer service!"
good,"Workers with customer friendly attitude and excellent customer service skills. "
good,Pretty fun place to work. The people are very nice and you learn almost all areas of work in the store from helping others or others helping you. You choose your own pace at which you work.
good,"customer service, greeting everyone asking them if I can help them with the project they are working on, or getting them to the right person that can. Phone  sales"
good,"Even as a cashier, I was able to learn as much about the other departments that I wanted. It was encouraged and everyone was happy to teach me about anything that I didn't know. I learned a great deal of information about tools that I still use and know now and pass along to others. "
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo equilibrado. Sueldo promedio. Estabilidad laboral.
good,"Worked night shift. Did not like if work was slow you could get called off. Enjoyed working with the team. Did not like working in the various departments that I was not that familiar with,"
good,"I started as a lot associate, cashier, head cashier, special services associate. I had a knowledge of every department in the store. I was focused on safety of customers and associates."
good,Walk in the  building and already dread the shift you are about to partake in. You clock in and see the faces of the fellow employees and can tell what kind of it is about to be. You try to stay busy so time can fly by. When your shift is over you hurry and clock out.
good,Benefits are amazing here and it doesn't matter if your full time or part time. Learned a lot about tools and garden material. Very hard work and lots of heavy lifting.
good,"I worked at the home depot from february to august of 2016 and for the most part enjoyed my job. The management did a poor job in my opinion and i never got a boost of hours when summer came, which I complained about numerous times."
good,a typical day at work is very productive and fast past. I learned how more about  tools. There was no real hard part of working at home depot. it was enjoyable
good,"They are a world leader in what they do. I enjoyed most of my time there. I was however, given the wrong impression of what they wanted me to do. That was the disappointing part of it."
good,"Never a dull moment. On my feet for 12-14 hours a day driving the business and engaging. The most enjoyable part of my job is the connection with the other leaders and associates. Home Depot absolutely puts the associates first. That would be what I am most thankful for, the opportunity to see the results of treating your team well."
good,"Its ok. The hours are easy but the store is not well staffed which makes being there very stressful. Also, some of the managers are very incompetent. Its good for college."
good,This job is amazing for a people person like myself. You meet so many people. The management is pretty flexible with any schedule you might have and they pay is great!
good,If your looking for your first job then this is the place for you. They have great training for employees and room for advancement. I would recommend this company to others.
good,This was a good company to work for. Being able to interact with the guests on a daily basis was also interesting as you figured out what their  needs were. no day was the same with every guest having their own unique projects going on.
good,working in lot wasnt to bad i got to experience just about every department. worked and helped on a lot of projects when my stuff was done. the only thing that sucked and took for ever to change was the high heat and pushing carts. took my head cashier to speak up and help me out which i was grateful for.
good,"pay is low, benefits not so good and management is the worst . Coworkers are for the most part nice. Training is on Computers no Hands on Training to speak of."
good,i didnt like my boss he was not nice so i had to quit this home depot otherthan that i liked working here but pay was also not nice so dont go here for that
good,Help customers with there home and business projects. Make sure customers find what they're looking for. Keep neat and orderly work space. Promote credit cards
good,"Good place to work if you like working with the general public.  Pay is better than most retail stores.   I worked for Pro Sales, which was a good paying position."
good,have gained valuable work experience. would love to work full time hours but not available. Also would like to someday work in management position within the company
good,"the home depot works really well with my schedule with my full time job. Pay is ok for part time employment, how much you enjoy your department really depends on who your supervisor is."
good,Good work environment and love the people I work with managers need to lighten up a little and be more friendlier. I loved my job always busy and good hours. I learned a lot and exceeded in lots of areas!
good,The home Depot was an experience that I did not personally enjoy. The management disrespected the little guys of the company and it made it hard to want to go to work.
good,"Busy environment lots of different products many new and interesting people. Good benefits friendly staff good working hours loved the garden center, plants,"
good,Work environment required safety practices because it is a warehouse. Staff was considerate. However my hours varied depending on performance. Customers were cool
good,"great staff, good place to work, family oriented. overall a typical day is easy. pay is alright and the company treats its staff how coworkers are supposed to be treated"
good,"Overworked, under paid were most of their employees. The managers never cared for the employees."
good,"Their hours are typical sales based but since I preferred working weekends, I was given 8-5 and all weekends which freed up the other designers. We settled into schedules usually not allowed but the management of the store recognized the advantages of happy, settled employees. While the KD department went through several managers over the years, I was consistent and became the on the job trainer of the KDs after their training at the HD School. HD changed their rules and methods weekly sometimes, not fully informing or training the employees on these changes causing chaos in the workplace."
good,The Home Depot is where many new entry-level candidates should start. It provides a very comfortable environment of working and learning how to provide the best customer services. The Home Depot will train its employer for the best in customer services and product knowledge.
good,"Home Depot has over all good job culture."
good,"Busy place to work, must be able to multi-task. You will get asked a bazillion questions. But it does provide product knowledge for all sorts of stuff."
good,To start day counted money for register. greeted customers as they came into the store and assisted them with any questions they had. keep area cleaned around registers and check customers out when they were ready
good,The home depot is a great environment to work in. You can always rely on your co workers to help you out it help is needed. The home depot also has many respectful costumers.
good,"As a merchandiser, it was fun. I learned more of what is expected of management. Enjoyed doing resets and working with product. Did not like how people would target me and set up false facts to try and get me fired."
good,"my experience at home depot was good. I felt my job was all over the place, because some days id work the lot, other days it was inventory, the forklift and other days it was loading customer supplies. Why I left is that I was only getting weekend work and when I requested a change I was denied."
good,the work load was overwhelming especially for part- timers. management had poor communication skills with staff and customers. Room for growth was inevitable.
good,It was ok management needs more fair actions with all employees and treat as equal  You must be part of a group or full time employees to be anything within the company PT employees are treated differently
good,working at the home depot is exactly like working at lowes home improvement except that lowes pays a little bit better and seems to care a little more about the workers.
good,"Este empleo me ayudo mucho a definir el area que mas me interesa sobre la Arquitectura, el diseño de interiores."
good,"Maintain adequate number of buggies and carts near store entrance and listen to pages for loading assistance on a walkie talkie. When hear page on walkie talkie help customers load various items ranging from 5 gallon paint, floor tiles, concrete, cement, doors, fridges, washer and dryers, drywall, plywood, shingles, BBQ, sheds, mulch, dirt, cedar trees, lumber, fence panels and other merchandise that the customer needed assistance."
good,Home Depot pays low compare to other home improvements store and the benefits are not that good. however management does work with employees on schedules.
good,"I love my job, the people and environment. The only thing is starting at one of the lower positions is no where like the higher positions. It gets better as you move up in the company."
good,* Aprendi processos administrativos novos aos quias ainda não conhecia.
good,"hot and fast paced work environment"
good,"-Inbound"
good,"Pretty basic, the people are nice.  Able to move around to different departments if interested.  Will not allow you to sit, and 8 hours of standing on concrete will add up over the years."
good,"fun fast paced job, good to engage with friendly customers. Management takes care of associates and customers as well. Good benefits, and bonuses as well"
good,"The job itself is a fantastic job. The management team, however, makes it very hard to work there. Half of them do not know how to do the job themselves, yet they try to tell you ""a better way"" to do your job. they constantly breathe down your neck. overall, i like the job, but having the management they have makes me want to find another place of employment."
good,"I worked at a Albuquerque based HD. It was a good job while I was going to school. It was pretty much stress free. I knew I was not staying there so I didn't really try to move up. I was able to come to work, do my job, and leave. I think they were OK with that. Most of management seemed to think all the floor associates as less than. Years later after I have learned a lot about leadership myself, I can tell that none of them would have been trained properly on how to be a leader. I am assuming they promote to leadership who ever has been there the longest. They show them how to do a few things and turn them loose."
good,If you are a woman you are a cashier or floral employee. heaven forbid you want to work a specialty department. they give you the run around and nothing ever comes of it.
good,"Good place to work. Currently on night shift. They give full time hours but rarely hire ""full time"". Ive been there for 2 years now. If you want to move up in the company night shift is not the position you want to pursue."
good,"Good place to work, management has been changed since I was there, but I hear it is much better now. good people to work with and flexible scheduling makes it easy, could use better pay, but all in all... good place"
good,"A company with a large geographic footprint and thousands of locations throughout the US, which allows for relocation opportunities.  Employees can learn different jobs within each store if they choose to apply to open positions."
good,"Home Depot is a good company to work for. It is easy to move up in the ranks, if you are ready and willing to work hard. Home Improvement Warehouses you will always work hard in."
good,Assisted customers with needs maintained the department and also greeted customers.Operated point of sales system .Professional Good Company.Management is very helpful.
good,"I feel like this company could be a lot greater than it is I feel like there's a lot a good attributes about it ,but the downfall is there's never enough security in the stores. when you have to deal with crackheads and druggies and suspicious people that come into the store. I feel like they need to up their loss prevention and have them there around the clock when employees are working."
good,"Assisting customers with estimates on counter tops and estimates on total kitchen and bath design as well as selling total job.  Negative work environment, with unfortunate management with high turnover."
good,helping customers.  learned how to deal with customers.  The management was not that great though.  was a fun place to work.  i really enjoyed working on the tools
good,Home Depot was a good place to work.  I worked several different stores and depending on management depends on how your day goes.  As a vendor the supervisor are usually way less qualified than the employees they are in charge of.
good,"The hardest part of working at the Home Depot was dealing with the occasional customer who had some sort of problem where something like a drain or toilet was broken and were understandably upset, but this was frequently countered by the customers who had a vision for their home, and getting to help them select purchases with which to make it happen."
good,"Could've been better but a pleasure working there and meeting new people. I learned a lot about tools, business and how customer service is very important."
good,you will have to work there to see what I see and you may not experience what I have experienced. My view is my view. It may not be another person's point of view.
good,enjoyed working there. Customers were very diverse.  Most employees treating you like you were apart of the family. Some employees wanted to keep to themselves. I enjoyed working there.
good,Fun job love the people one down side if your late once they fire you that kinda sucks other then that good place to work all around fun even the lot job.
good,This is a great job with benefits they even award employees for their years of service. They also have Christmas parties for employees as well. I must say I enjoyed
good,working outside  with plants  meet new people everyday  cleaning and down stocking   building displays   watering the plants paper work  and order new stuff to put out
good,"Your success is completely dependent upon the Store General Manager.  Professional development is dependent upon the individual, not a structured program other than computer based classes,"
good,Caribbean air mail gives me the opportunity to develop my skill in accounting field . As a new  graduate overseas i did enjoying working with the company for about 6 years .
good,"Fast pace, customer service environment. serving Jacksonville FL, surrounding areas, plus overseas. Typical work day is fast paced, on your feet from 4 to 9 hours a day."
good,"The overall work environment was positive, but where they lacked was communication and consistency among leadership. A days work would consist of managing the operation. Associate needs, head count, flexing the labor accordingly, keeping everyone ""gamefully"" employed."
good,everything is good except for management and their rules i really don't have much else to say on here idk how much more do i need to write but it's simple and basic management sucks
good,i learned about home improvement and the different types of lumber and concrete that were available. management was very good with fixing schedules to your needs
good,"Home Depot is completely focused on customer service, but in doing so, they seem to neglect the needs of their employees. Employees there usually are quite friendly on the outside, but the majority seem depressed most of the time. There wasnt much respect between management and normal associates on either side, and that made it even harder to want to work there. It was great though to feel like part of a family. As associates we are all very close and we all know each other."
good,"Consulted with customers to create designs."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of maintaining the aisles, greeting customers with a smile and helping them with their needs, as well as process special orders, help the customer order specialist with her workload, and help neighboring departments. "
good,"customer service focused, with innovation products.. focus on training associates in all aspects of the business and product knowledge. Team building to ensure development and mentoring. Enjoy working with people and solving their project needs"
good,"Very busy company , good management . The hourly pay could have been better for the 3rd shift. I did enjoy working there but was offered better position at another company."
good,Just a job to pay the bills for right now. It's a face paced job. It's not a hard job at all you learn a lot of stuff and get to see a lot of different products.
good,The position could use better benefits. Learned a lot about managing money and a staff. Good entry level position into management.
good,"I did enjoy my time overall, but there seemed to be little opportunity for my team to advance from the night crew to more ambitious positions despite my repeated attempts to request assistance with this."
good,"This is a typical retail job with a focus placed on being safe and customer service. The day starts early at 5am, and we are focused on keeping the bays in good shape. "
good,"Almost everyday is a busy day when working for Home Depot. Its the go to department store almost everywhere. Daily task for an overnight stock would be receiving labeling and organizing incoming shipment. Using pallet jacks, fork lifts and lift trucks to rearrange and organize the store."
good,Meet and help customers find products to fix there house or complete a project around there house. Help pull orders for online customers so it is ready for pic up. Help find fixes to customer projects.
good,Can get stuck with no movement up......... good starter job but not a career........ good people to work with... not enough sales associates to help customers
good,"As a student, the employer is great for being flexible to individuals' busy schedules with various shifts/hours being given for employees to continue to maintain a balance between school and work."
good,"I enjoy the people that I work with but the company as a whole could use some help assisting their associates. A typical day at Home Depot would consist of helping customers, cash deposits to the back office at the end of the night. I am one of the part time head cashiers so I over see multiple cashiers and handle cash, checks and credit card information on a daily basis. I have learned how to put customers first and always be willing to lend a helping hand. The hardest part of my job would be management because they are more about the safety of customers than they are their own employees. The most enjoyable part of the company is the people that I work with and customers."
good,Not very much compensation for work done. A very strong atmosphere of everybody is replaceable. Not the team program they claim to be
good,"Opportunity for advancement, wages are not too fair with the amount of work enforced by employees. Management can be very tough but loving. The best thing about being an employee for Home Depot is all the benefits they offer throughout the year (bonuses, bonus parties, Christmas party, pot sharing, and barbecues etc). The hardest part about working for Home Depot is working extremely hard for not enough pay (for the amount of work that is done)."
good,"Good Place to work, friendly people. You learn quite a bit working there. Especially if you don't know anything about home improvement."
good,A typical day is to return equipment to shelves and help customers with their home projects. to finr the proper equipment to do the right way the first time.
good,"Great place to work, staff was fun to work with. Location was clean and friendly. If you need a home project done, go to the Pro desk, they will make sure its done to spec."
good,I get a sense of satisfaction from completing a large online order . that requires multi department fulfillment for the order. The Home Depot associates really come together to complete the order .I deal a sense of achievement when this happens.
good,I like working at Home Depot but there is some favoritism there. Nice co workers! I love working with customers and helping out!
good,"Everything is good as long as you fit in, as long as they want you. But when you don't, your gone, they will find a reason to get rid of you. Watch your P's & Q's"
good,"Home Depot culture is not what it protrays, I think they have to many bosses and not enough workers.  The employees work hard but are not appreciated.  Employees work only part time with no benefits which how Home Depot doesn't  have to pay medical benefit.  The employees that I worked with were dedicated to Home Depot but were not appreciated like they should of been.  "
good,"Working at Home Depot is not for the faint of heart. Customers will test your patients, knowledge, ability to think on your feet, and memorization of the whole store. Can be stressful at time."
good,"The workers are great, it does take a lot of energy to work there as it is a hardware store. Have to hall things around, but overall i think its a decent place to work."
good,i was to young to really see any pros or cons while working here. i just needed a job at 18. later i realized that the pay was horrible. i would not work there again.
good,"Bonne équipe de travaille,"
good,"I Worked For Home Depot For Over 4 Yrs Until I Was Recently Laid Off. I Loved My Hr Person, The Receiving DS, And The Customer Service Ds. They Were Very Friendly, Respectable,And Such A Big Help. My Hr Supervisor Was Also Fantastic She Was The Only One That Worked With The Managers In The Back That Cared And Showed Concern For The Employees. The Hardest Part Of My Job Was Getting All The Different Personalities To Work Together As A TEAM. My Most Enjoyable Days Were My Days When I Was Able To Get All My Work Accomplished And Run My Shift Smoothly.  The Alexandria Home Depot Would Be A Better Place If They Would Recruit A New Management Team And More Employees Who Are Dependable And Can Work As A Team."
good,This was a very very fun pls e to work at management was pretty awesome and staff was really great and easy to get along with. Pay was good and free food all the time
good,plenty of classes given product knowledge of products not enough associates to work departments. However employees and there attributes are appreciated and acknlowedged
good,"We all learn to deal with our job title. Its an effort we do to help all customers and we enjoy it. The company lacks training, mainly because they don't pay the trainers to."
good,"The company as a whole is a great way to get your feet wet in retail.  Its fast paced but its easily dealt with. A typical day in this company is customer service based. On the front end, you're their last line of defense so to speak.  While there are lulls there is ALWAYS something to do, with it being a ""working warehouse"" theres always something to clean or organize."
good,The job was hard at times depending on what you were doing. Overall it was a great place to work. Good people. Alright management. Learned a lot of Home improvement skills I wouldn't know where to get anywhere else.
good,"Working at the Home Depot was a enlightening experience. Management on the other hand, had a lot of favoritism. Not every worker was treated fairly. Most days were stressful."
good,"I have worked for HD for 4 yrs now and found I love my associates, the management team is also a very hard working and well educated group love them as well. My only complaint is it is very hard to get full time, and healthcare which comes with full time only. Corporate needs to figure out a way for us to be healthy so we are happy part timers, after all we do work for them! best be a quick and organized person or you wont make it in this fast paced company.. I am working part time but am trying to advance to full time.."
good,It is a simple works place and easy work. We unload the trucks so that we can stock the shelves with freight. After the shelves are full the overstock is put up in the overhead. When that task is done the trash is being taken to the back and the store is getting ready top open.
good,"I was there so long and not moving forward due to management picking favorites. It was disappointing, but it made me realize theres better jobs out there."
good,"Decent pay and benefits.  Fellow associates are great.  Management is so so.  I had a lot of success there until I got sick and was having to miss work.  Even though they were approved, my whole management team had a change of disposition toward me.  It is a great place to work if you're healthy and don't mind a little hard work.  If that changes, whether in your control or not, you might find yourself being advised to quit."
good,"Dish washing is a very hard, demanding, dirty job. Other employees were great, meet a lot of nice people, managers were very flexible at the beginning."
good,Very little hours and not the best management. The company is good but every environment is different & this particular environment I was not fond of.
good,Take this with a grain of salt- I'm still bitter over being fired. Job is a good place to work if you enjoy customer service.  Interesting learning all the different departments in the store and meeting lots of different people. Mostly inexperienced management .
good,"Home depot really cares about there associates. They will always help someone in need. They may not pay a lot, but they keep people employed. Ive never seen them having to lay people off to help the companies financials."
good,Since 1995 this company has declined on their knowledge of their product. They hire a no longer professional employees. They use to concentrate on customer service. That is no longer their priority.
good,Besides the store being filled with Gossip its not a bad place to work. The pay isn't bad and if you work then u have a chance at full-time or opportunity to move to a higher position
good,"Overall the philosophy & culture of the home depots vision is excellent, however can use some work around truly executing and living those values. Work/Life balance is only as good as the Store Manager in that specific store. The CEO sets Sales Plans extremely high so that Managers & Employees find it almost impossible to meet thereby saving money on paying out bonus' ....although most of the stores are double digit comping throughout the company and the CEO is the only one seeing a Giant Bonus'."
good,"this job is an ok job, not a career.  it can get a bit hairy because there is a lack of employees at night time.  sometimes management is aloof, no communication."
good,todos son muy unidos en las buenas y malas los compañeros y todo se ase en grupo cuando no puedes en algo tus jefes se acercan ati y tu enseñan como aserlo la ´parte mas difil es subir de puesto hay mucha preferencia
good,Friendly work force . Like helping people with their building problems. Discuss any way our products can help resolve a certain problem . Recommending good products for use in a person home. I cut lumber for customers doing diy projects for there home . Home Depot thought me how to deal with rude customers properly . Hardest part of my job might be loading Heavy materials such as 80 pound bags of concrete .
good,"Not much flexibility was given for an analyst role, which means the space for growth is also limited.  Home Depot loves recruit outside talents, while ignored the company talents. Most likely, you have stay in a role for quite a long time to move to next role."
good,"The Home depot is an amazing place to work and grow. Unfortunately, I had no success in being take on full time. I felt this was unreasonable considering all my training and heavy machinery certification,"
good,"The typical work day is busy in the summer and dull and slow during the winter. I did, however, learn how to lay concrete, set drywall, repair roofs and cracks, what lumber to use for certain projects, and how to handle customers. This knowledge, however, came from the customers and professionals rather than the store. Management, at my store, is lacking for the most part. The managers fail to change policies that need to be changed and often ignore the suggestions of the associates who work the floor daily. Other associates at The Home Depot are often nice and, if they hold a good work ethic, tend to remain at the store for a much longer period of time. The hardest part of working at The Home Depot is definitely the customer service. When a product isn't available or has to be brought down from the overhead, customers tend to get impatient. Another difficulty is lack of associates when you need them. Often times many associates are scheduled for the slowest day of business and vice versa for the busiest. The job, however, is fun when you have good coworkers and can drive forklifts to help customers and associates alike. That, by far, is my favorite part of the job."
good,A typical work day consists of organizing department managers work lists and following up on appointed tasks. The culture is of being the best at what they do.
good,Was a good place to work but they don't always work well with their associates. And there is a lot of competition to be advanced so it takes a while to move up sometimes depending on how fast associates leave the company
good,Again a company that sells too many foreign products not enough domestic options therefore taking jobs away from the American worker.
good,If you are looking for extra cash for the summer or part time if you are in high school this is the place to work. You get to learn a lot of great skills!
good,"Home Depot was a nice place to work , I was crossed trained in different departments. They gave employees room to grown within the company"
good,"typical work on a day"
good,I enjoy my customers. I learn how to do returns and keep my customers happy. I really enjoy my coworkers an mangers we know how to get things done together as a team
good,"not a bad place to work if you are full time they offer benefits , if part time during the slow season will cut you hours down to 10 hours a week all in all not bad"
good,A typical work day at Home Depot is getting to work on time and be ready to tackle any situation that may come your way.  Your always busy so there are many things to learn around the whole store.  Management is good but could use improvement.  The hardest part of the job is keeping what you learned on the job if you don't barley get to use the tools you have learned. The workplace culture is nice and chill.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers and keeping a smile on their faces.  Especially when you know you went beyond the call of duty.
good,Although it was very productive and I learned a great deal the best I can say is it was a good training environment and the instructors were the best available.
good,"Reset bays, beams and shelf heights to accommodate new product placement.  Use “Planogram” mapping for the corporate determined layout of displays.  Adjust the display when store physical space did not fall within the specifications of the planogram.  Make sure the SKU and pricing labels were correct and placed by the correct merchandise.  Daily stock products in the displays.  Inspect areas keeping watch for damaged or opened containers that would then be marked down.  Breakdown and stock seasonal displays.  Maintain a clean, safe environment for staff and customers.  Most importantly assist customers find products they are looking for and suggest to them items that would help them complete their project quickly.  "
good,I would typically clock in for night shift and then get to stocking my section. The hard part is having to lift heavy things for basically 3 hours straight but it becomes easy. The hard part was working graveyard but the pay was good.
good,"Les journées de travail durant le temps des fêtes passent très vites. Beaucoup de clients donc toujours occupé. Par contre, suite à la fermeture, nous sommes obligés de faire le ménage du magasin alors nous finissions très tard les soirs de semaine et de fin de semaine."
good,Home Depot seeks to create a huge customer experience with little to none employees working the floor. Those in management are mandated to learn each and every department.
good,I enjoyed working with home depot and wish I would have been able to go full time when needed to but wasnt in the cards then. Got along well with pretty much all fellow employees as well.
good,Is a great to start working but not for a life time working job. theres to much drama to deal with but if you mind your own business and do you job you will sure like it for the amount they pay is the better job than anywhere else.
good,"Working at this job you get to learn a lot of new things about home improvment whether it is in door and windows, or electrical. Coworkers are very good to work with especially when there are a lot of customers and need assistance and help all of them in a timely manner. Managers were very encouraging, even if you werent good at a certain skill. The hardest part of the job was being in steel toe boots for 9 hours a day, it really put a lot of stress on my heels. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help customers find the best solution for their home improvement needs."
good,Hard work and no worklife balance. Management do not connect well with employees and information is lacking as to process change
good,"Great play to work, great co-workers, great management , learned many things in my position while i was there, the store that i was at was great"
good,"I worked at Home Depot for a summer job during University. I worked in customer service, sales, and inventory replenishment. The people I worked with were great, but the job was not challenging enough for me."
good,"At this time I prefer to not comment on Home Depot and will come back at a later date to do so. I have experience in supervising various departments such as Electrical, Flooring, Decor/ Blinds and Paint."
good,"The most enjoyable aspect of working within the Home Depot was the interaction among co-workers and repeat customers. Management at times was questionable. I learned a lot of skills mainly involving time-management, equipment operation, and some supervisor essentials."
good,"Its a job, if you want to move up you better have it good with management. other than that it's a relatively nice place but the customers think they know better than you and treat you badly"
good,"Working with home depot was great while it lasted!  learned and picked up quick. It is a Big environment, you get too see all that home depot has to offer!"
good,Every day was a new task but usually only a few people worked to make sure it was done. Teamwork was good but the hardest part was lifting heavy product alone. The best part of the job was meeting new people and being able to laugh and joke with everyone including customers. Management was good but not fair to all associates.
good,"Enjoyed working with the customers and team members; however, it always felt the coverage within the store was lacking. Little to no cross-training in other departments, so it was difficult to help out in the other departments."
good,Working at Toys R' Us is like any old retail. Some days it gets busy and some days are really slow. Co-workers are very polite and managers as well. Some days they will stay on time of you when days are really busy. During the holiday seasons it gets really challenging where customers are entering at a high scale. Best part about the job was gaining more experience in retail and learning to become more of a people person.
good,"Needs to pay employees higher, overall good atmosphere to work in however. co workers are pretty good usually expect for a few."
good,Working there was great being able to be around great and friendly people. I love that you can make the people feel like they at home.
good,It was an ok good i loved my customers and co workers. It's a shame how the managers treat their employees. I've learned a lot of patience and my customer service skills became so much better because of that job. There was nothing really hard about my job.
good,"Come in and look on our Monitoring to see if any devices went off line. If so then we would call the Site and have someone check power. Then call ATT, Sprint, Verizon if it was a circuit issue. If not, then we would proceed to troubleshoot until the device came up. We'd check emails, update tickets, close tickets, communicate with each other. Learned from Management how to follow protocol but thats about it and how to be a better team member. My Co-workers where good people to work with but there are some that kinda didnt want to learn new stuff so that they didnt have to do more."
good,"Retail it's hard to keep your set number of hours. If your trying keep a set amount of money,You can get it if you initiative and come in on off days."
good,"Worked part time. Work could be demanding at times, but not too bad. •	Ensured store was stocked and ready for business daily."
good,The people I worked with made the job fun to be at everyday. You really work as a team to achieve store goals while maintaining the relaxed atmosphere
good,"Decent employment with decent pay, not flexible concerning scheduling. cashiers only do cashier work, no restocking included in job description. A lot of pressure on getting credit"
good,"The schedule and work was always the same. Nice and consistent, which was nice and let us know exactly what to expect each and every day. We maintained the store and put away freight."
good,"First real job, and it was okay. Pay isn't great for living in Bay Area and you don't get discounts but if you need a check you will get one!"
good,"since my time there, there has been  new management,  my review was based on the old mgt.  The company benefits are actually pretty good, prescription meds are pretty cheap as compared to other employers"
good,"Work Monday-Friday which is unheard of in the retail game."
good,Good part time job to hold while in school. Vastly different experiences at different stores all depending on each stores management.
good,Deal with customers from every aspect.  Learned about items in the I never knew about.  Became more informative.  Helped customers with there question as best as I could
good,Somedays we will have a kinda sorta frustrating day but then it turns out to be very great. I learned that team work does make the dreamwork. If I wanted to work for home depot again I wpuld definitely go back
good,"standing and busy"
good,Usually get two 15 minute breaks if you work 7-8 hours. And then get 30min-1 hour for lunch. Downfall is standing on your feet for long periods of time. Management is nice and coworkers are friendly. The hardest part of the job is that you can get written up for things that you were not taught on. Most enjoyable part of the job is that your coworkers feel like family.
good,"Typical workload is average; depending on the day of the week and available help, however, the amount of customers needing to be helped can be overwhelming. Time management was learned. Managers were somewhat helpful."
good,"So this is the second time i worked for home depot. I was desperate for a job as i had been sick for sometime and had not worked a job in several years. The management is still one of the biggest issues with working for this company. The other employees are also apart of the problem. It's almost like high school all over again, as everyone stands around gossiping including the management. There is a reason why there are so many bad reviews for this location."
good,"The first time i worked at home depot i was transferred around the store a lot. The management at the time was pretty awful as people were constantly coming in and going to other branches pretty often. The hours were pretty bad as well. I ended up having to work a 2-11pm shift which can be pretty bad as some days you get an overwhelming amount of customers with little help. I believe they have gotten a bit better, but the biggest issue with home depot is usually the management."
good,"Very nice place to work clean , raises were available, just a little laborious at time, and some heavy lifting location was in Tolleson Az."
good,"Multiple supervisors, sometimes duties confusing.  Fair training and advancement if you can stay. Most coworker congenial and will provide assistance when requested"
good,It wasn't the most fun job because I was just a cashier but I did learn a lot but it doesn't really pertain to working in the medical field.
good,It was fun to work for The Homedepot. started in the lumber department the was fun got to operate a forklift. Then transferred to the hardware department. Till I transfer to another the home depot
good,Good atmosphere. Nice people. Too political. Work life balance is actually pretty decent. Good pay and decent benefits. I personally did not like the position but everyone is helpful for the most part.
good,"To maintain your position, you have to do as your told. The position is micromanaged and improvement suggestions are overlooked. Very hard to promote beyond department supervisor."
good,"Held a multifaceted supervisory and customer relations role. Managed employee scheduling, payroll reporting and performance reviews. Oversaw cash office activities and processed merchandise returns. Hours were sometimes hard. Management and employee turnover was an issue."
good,loved working for home depot great place to grow and move up in the company. sometimes you get managers that are a little head strong and find people to pick on guess it just depends on what store you work for
good,"the culture and work environment are open minded and look to make sure your working with like minded people. If you show pride in your work you will be rewarded, however if you do not then you will become bitter over time."
good,you see people buying stuff to redo their home or gardens. you get to see what is on sale and get a lot of stuff in a bulk form. I didn't like it much
good,"A great company, but provided little to no advancing opportunities. I learned great customer service skills and maintaining work spaces. Management was great but did not acknowledge personal life outside of work, very demanding hours for little pay. Very small staff, but very welcoming and eager to help me expand my knowledge n products."
good,Working retail always has it's ups and downs but Home Depot is average I would say. I would not go back. I worked in the paint department and usually had to stay late finishing up. Management does not do a good job supervising their own departments and the structure is very disorganized.
good,"Training was satisfactory, management was supportive at the time I was actively employed with the company and the fellow associates were very friendly and cooperative."
good,The Home Depot is a good place to work because there is always something different going on and constantly you are learning new things.
good,The home depot was a great place to learn something new each day. It was challenging but worth full of knowledge gaining opportunities.
good,"The work is fine, the only thing is, you have to repeatedly talk to management over the same things for anything to happen for you."
good,amazing people but management is lacking in leadership and the workers don't feel like management has their back. Pay is really not much and opportunities for raises are slim to none.
good,I enjoy my coworkers and managers. I appreciate the experience gained from working her. The workload is steady and opportunity for advancement is available.
good,"Very great place to work for, very friendly. manager is a great guy and gets along with every associate in the store...very kind. we have a lot of fun helping customers and each other out"
good,"great company to work for. in my case i am looking for something a little more stable, company is a great place to be if your looking for a district manager level"
good,"good company to work for. looking for something more stable for my self, if your looking to become a district manager this will be a great company to start off as"
good,Home depot provided me with the knowledge I needed to learn on how to deal with civilian life after the military.  It was a real eye opener for me on how to handle civilians and succeed in customer service.
good,"Great work environment, typically friendly customers (when they're not in a rush and ACTUALLY know what it is they're looking for..), and plenty of room for advancement if you know what you're doing"
good,job was ok i liked it it was fun how do you do a backflip go youtube mdamurda  he has good music his music is the best in the bay area
good,"A normal day at Home Depot consisted of restocking merchandise, putting away returns, and walking the aisles to help customers with any questions in your respective department. I learned more detailed information on the different hardware tools and materials, rental equipment and operating lift equipment. One of the best and worst parts of the job, in my personal opinion, was the customers. I enjoyed helping every customer, but some were less friendly than others when they felt that my knowledge was lacking."
good,"I was part of a parivate contractor company, that worked inside Home Depot, but never worked as an Home Depot employee. As such I would not know to have say that I worked for them."
good,"Good company to work for, they are really good with schedules. But you can feel like you don't get recognized for the work you do. Really good with schedules."
good,"Working at Home Depot for me was quite a different experience from past occupations. I have came across some really pleasant people and created bonds with many of the employees. I will say, I love that Home Depot allows family and friends to work in the same environment, however, when I first started employment in this establishment it was pretty hectic. I had to be on my toes. I don't really blame customers for being impatient with new employees .but dealing with paint, you'll definitely need strength (be able to carry 5 gallons of paint), gain information about the paint department (and if you don't know, they'll hopefully teach you) and be able to deliver good friendly customer service."
good,"I unload merchandise off trucks,in a face paced team environment to ensure our store aesthetically pleasing to the eye and merchandise is fully stalked"
good,"Many opportunities, learned many things in the store. I enjoyed meeting new customers and some my coworkers were fun to work with."
good,"This job is a good job depending on what job it is you do. Avoid pallet building and your good. Other then that good pay, nice perks, benefits, and you work with pretty cool people."
good,Good place to work. The envirornment is safe and fun. The time would go by pretty fast. Did not agree with some of the worl politics that they had at that company. But overall the people I worked with were amazing and made me love my job.
good,"location is everything I guess I enjoyed working here most days, very busy long lines but an educational job work here long enough and you'd be building your own house"
good,"Good job to gain experience as a young worker and great for people who are looking for a career in retail. Jobs are department specific so day to day is different for everyone. Great for all kinds of people, easy to find the right fit in the store."
good,"The Home Depot does have decent benefits. Coworkers are the best part of the job, with pleasant customers being the second.  Management/constantly changing policies & procedures is the worst. From month to month you don't know how your job will be changed, and the communication between managers is usually non-existent."
good,"a typical day at home depot is very busy theirs never a slow day there. You get to meet different kinds of people there everyday and depending on how long you have work there you learn something new about different products from different departments such as, hardware, plumbing, lumber and so on. My job in the store is to check customers out as they finish finding what they need and presenting excellent customer service. You have to be a friendly and fast paced person to work here because lines get crazy and keeping a customer happy and not leaving our store upset is apart of our job. The most enjoyable part is to be able to make the customers experience in our store the best even if they had a hard time finding a item we are there to help and make them feel better and want to come back and shop and maybe look for you especially when they come."
good,retail is retail you have your ups and downs but its good place to work great they really take care of their associates and have a great work environment
good,"Had a very fun experience working at Home depot. It is a good place to gain the necessary experience needed to progress"
good,"overnight work, labor intensive "
good,As stated I have given a previous honest review for this company twice now and i do not intend to do a fourth or fifth time. Im hoping not to be asked again.
good,"Like any typical retail jobs, it has its pros and cons. Depending on where you are located depends on the degree to which you experience the pros and cons."
good,home depot was okay it has its ups and downs but they do not work with you going to school as being a head cashier this is a job i will take if i like to work in construction field
good,"Management always have their favorite(s). Non-stop commotion between customers and associates, being a supervisor makes you first line of contact for sudden issues."
good,"Fast paced environment, expect to learn something new everyday.  I learned team work makes the dream work.  If you don't know ask until you do, never guess.  Management is great can be over bearing at times. Co-workers are great just play your part and assist them whenever necessary, you can learn a lot from them. Hardest part of the job is dealing with customers and finding the solution to their problems.  Most enjoyable part of the job is the practical knowledge taken away at the end of the day."
good,"They only really offer alot of part time hours and positions which is okay for some people but after so long I couldn't do part time anymore, so needless to say I left."
good,Good part time job as they do work with and around schedules. Good  employee moral most of the time. Managers help where they are needed
good,"My years with The Home Depot were great. I have gained great customer service skills and have enjoyed making wonderful bonds with peers and customers.Putting people first is something thats always come so natural to me. I have made sure to always take care of my cashiers and would go above and beyond for them and our customers.  I love to learn about new products, and doing demos for our customers. It can be challenging when you are put in a hard situation but always in the end it is a learning experience. I've always felt like I've accomplished so much once the customer would leave, especially with a smile ."
good,"Home Depot is a great company that has a great history. A typical day here starts with daily counts and stocking. Cleaning asiles and helping customers. "
good,"management team could use additional training.  Starts from the top.  When the UPPER level management is in order the lower levels of management have an example to follow, which is reflected in how your employees respond to the work environment. Typical work day consists of management hoovering to complete tasks the field team makes difficult, by not replying to calls and emails.  That is the hardest part of the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job, the team settings and having recognition awards for motivation called homers."
good,Pretty good for retail. I was able to get a set schedule Monday through Friday which is quite good for a retail setting. The job is pretty boring but it put money in my pocket.
good,This company loves their employees. This job provides security as well as a great comfort level. The most stressful part about this job is the customers that call in.
good,open and closed registers. part time janitorial duties when customer lines would dwindle down. un relateable co-workers majority of were 20-30 years older than me.
good,"I thoroughly enjoy the arena of salesmanship, assisting customers to determine what is best for them by using the features & benefits methods. I also find satisfaction in turning a negative experience or situation into one of positivity. Seeing the customer leave with a smile is the ultimate goal for me."
good,Good Place For Customer Service But no help in the store. thats the downfall about a place. but i cant understand about it
good,home depot was not a great company to work for. the managers were very unorganized. I did learn alot about delivery manifest and pallitizing merchandise.
good,"Call center operations are in transition, the division is moving to a better work space.  It is also under new leadership/management to improve job culture, opportunities for advancement and work life balance."
good,"Work schedules typically vary with little room for regularity in the beginning, if at all. Would recommend a cashier position for regular hours given that cashiers are typically only assigned during store hours. Work responsibility varies from day to day, not difficult, just a lot to keep up with."
good,Worked in check-out to insure the happiness of customers. Greeting customers and making sure that they find everything that they need in friendly but timely manner.
good,This was a fun fast paced job. A lot of the job was so much like working with Military Sealift Command. I enjoy a job that keeps me busy and learn new ways to do it.
good,"I've worked both sides of the company - corporate and store level."
good,where is management. when you have a building of so many employees you need to have a large and very present management team. It was hard to speak to supervision and get the same answer from more then 1
good,It was the ordinary day at work and i worked by myself didn't like to borther by home depot Associates and there attitude they be having
good,"great company to work for. hectic schedules, great customers. great training and information. management needs more personability. hardest part of the job is when you can't fix the customers problem and they don't understand."
good,Company could invest a bit more into hiring benefits. The starting wage is low compared to other retailers. However several employees are long term associates.
good,"When I was working for this company, They had just opened and it showed. The management was constantly changing along with the job description. The atmosphere was fun and co-workers were very helpful. Typically I would reach out to installers and schedule them for a customer installation."
good,You have to prepare yourself to stand for hours. You will also need to jobs to sustain a living because they pay every two weeks.
good,Home Depot in my opinion was not a good place of employment. The management were to demanding on its associates. The pay was not satisfying either.
good,"A typical day at work would be, coming in and clocking in. Beginning to check out any customers that are ready. Be moved around a couple of times, eat at break, clock out and go home."
good,"every single day, any shift other than a late four hour closing shift, it was busy, busy, busy. always busy, busy, busy busy, busy, busy. being the front end supervisor is a lot of responsibility but if you organize yourself well, and have head cashiers that are reliable and dependable and take initiative, it can be smooth,"
good,Working for The Home Depot is an experience. The expectations are very clear and management is really good at providing the support you need to be successful.
good,I love The Home Depot and its core values. The DC I work for is ok. The management isn't the best and I believe they make poor choices due to not communicating effectively
good,"Productive and moderate workplace environment, Customer Service was the best part of the position. Furthermore, learning about D.I.Y. concepts and procedures was a plus."
good,Great job management sucks. Fun place to work ad weekend off. That was the best part about the job and I love the hours I worked.
good,"No day was the same. There was something different everyday, whether it be trucks I was unloading or a customer that I was helping. I enjoyed my job and interacting with the public, helping with their needs. It was the management and overall company that I grew to have issues with."
good,"learned the standard procedure of cash check out,gained experience to avoid shrinks, fun to wok in a team, supportive management, resulting to gain more experience in different departments"
good,"The company has really good benefits for the employees, however some of the management does not know how to manage the store."
good,"Must complete morning checklists, prepare hazmat, check in ups, delivery drivers, pack out freight, customer service, locate and tag orders, pick orders, pull orders, drive multiple forklifts, offload trucks, make balers etc..."
good,"Reviewing open quotes and calling customers about them, I have learned a great deal about the internal workings of Home Depot and its management. The hardest part is dealing with all the differing management styles and customers who don't understand the limitations of my authority. The most enjoyable is the regular customers who recognize me and my abilities, and I can help on a personal basis."
good,"Good first job, management tends to play favorites, too many people giving direction makes it unclear who to take orders from. Expect you to do things outside of your department but don't provide training/compensation."
good,Very fast paced retail environment.  Company treats you as family.  Benefits and salary are very good for retail.  Company offers bonuses based on sales.
good,"Responsible for making sure that every customer feels welcome in the store, additionally stocking product in different departments, and suggestive selling merchandise to the customer that will benefit them."
good,"good work environment, and positive and supportive management. We were a contact between the stores and the vendors for the appliances that are being sold at the stores."
good,"Typical day in work is very busy all of the time. Dropping pallets for customers, trying to meet the demands of management, stocking the shelves, basically running around all day."
good,"I learned how to multi task by speaking with customers and accomplishing my tasks at the same time.The pay is not competitive. When I started my plan was to be an ideal employee and hopefully move up within the company. My immediate co-workers were nice and fairly good workers. The low level management above us was awful. They were scattered and as unprofessional as can possibly be. There is essentially no way to be recognized for hard work when you are working under layers of incompetence. Luckily I figured this out quickly and landed a job elsewhere. Hardest part of my job was seeing my pay stubs. I was hardly making money considering the cost of gas and food. Although we all got along at work morale was low. I'm happy to be out of there and have steered a few folks away from applying. I feel as though home depot management is very selective. They promote associates based on favoritism. It is hard to speak to someone when you're having issues and even harder to get them to care. As a cashier, you will be faced with needy customers all day long. Most customers a pleasurable though. Only work here to gain valuable experience, great benefits, and OK starting pay. Do not make this a long term career unless you were lucky enough to be a favorite."
good,"A good place to work, always something to be done. Employees are friendly and make a good team. However, managment is out of touch with employees. The receive very little recognition for the work done and moving from part to full time is nearly impossible. Hour become very limited in off season."
good,"I stay busy. I'm always having something to do. I help people that need help with loading, push carts back to the front of the store for customers."
good,"I was working for the night associate team and working from 9 at night till 5; 30 in the morning, you slept in till like 4 in the afternoon and only have a few hours to yourself for 4 days out of the week."
good,"No different from most typical retail/sales jobs, with fluctuating hours and a high turnover rate, I managed to be employed by this company for 5 years and was grateful for the opportunity, but eventually sought to seek success elsewhere."
good,"It is hard to get breaks, It is hard to get a manager when needed. They would rather hire new people than to promote seasoned associates to full-time. Most of the workers do get along with one another just some in management are unorganized."
good,"It's not a bad place to work, however, they will take advantage of you if you let it happen. I was pushed around for a while because of lack of staff because a lot of employees quit."
good,"typical day; you come in work you check on will calls, answer phone calls. i learned a lot i moved departments so i already knew somewhat of the system. i had to learne the computer work almost on my own not a good experience but it wasn't impossible for me."
good,There is no hard part about the job I really enjoy working the the freight and the customers. The co-worker are very friendly and even the other associates.
good,The work was not bad in the warehouse as a general warehouse associate. The management was not the best and not helpful. Co workers were favored and not everyone seemed appreciated.
good,"Throughout the day I will answer customer calls, perform customer returns, help and fix customer issues with orders and installs. I have learned a lot about the type of customer service that The Home Depot abides by. No matter the cost or if the customer is seriously in the wrong just do whatever makes them happy to leave the store."
good,"wouldn't necessarily recommend Home Depot as a career , but it is great for students who are looking for a part time job , and need a flexible schedule"
good,Looks out for it's employees. Great benefits. Some management is good other works off a friend and family system.  But i dont speak for anyone but myself.  The company is a good one
good,"This is the type of job that values team effort and communication skills. Moving up in the company is based on the level of effort and dedication you apply to your job but at times falls short recognizing valuable employees. The most enjoyable part of the job is making the customers smile and engaging with other staff. Contrary to the belief, most customers are quite pleasant. When a customer is upset though, it's best to keep your composure and not take it personally."
good,"A life in the day of an assistant store manager can be very hectic and rewarding. You have your daily operational functions, customer service, and most importantly your associates to leverage. I am currently a specialty manager so I am involved greatly in customer service. I lead a team of approximately 120 associates and 14 department supervisors as well. The hardest part of my job has been my hours and time away from family I have sacraficed. The most enjoyable is team building. I love to create excitement and fun for customers and associates. Going above and beyond and genuinely surprising people with my willingness to make their day makes my day that much better. I have learned in my past 19 years of retail management that you have to prioritize your day everyday. That being said, you need to change those priorities in a heart beat. Working in a stressful, high demand position is not easy but I take my victories and still celebrate them with my teams. People need to feel important and empowered. You need to listen to be able to communictae effectively with everyone. My teams have always performed for me because I appreciate them. Customers will be greatful to you when you keep the lines of communication open. Bottom line is, be open to change, listen, communicate, and stay focused. These things have brought me my success."
good,home depot downtown dallas #0589 is an incredibly busy location. it is always demanding and takes some persistence to work at. this is not your average home depot. customers can be brutal but the sheer mass of product they move daily with the small staff they keep can really require some hard work and team effort. i really enjoyed my time spent here.
good,"Was a company I wanted to work for and then it changed. Most of the people are great, hard working, decent people. However, the brown nosing jerks seem to be the only ones promoted."
good,"Typical day processing returns, special orders, sales and addressing customer concerns not addressed at the cashier level. Knowledge of store layout and wide variety of home improvement practices very helpful. Always enjoy resolving customer concern both simple and complex and using others' more specific skills when appropriate."
good,The work place was a good environment management could use a little improving the associates could be a bit more motivated and the scheduling can improve as well.
good,"I spent a lot of time on the phone contacting clients and setting up appointments for showings. I learned how to manage my pipeline and keep track of customer relationships, which helped make it easier to move to close. Management and co-workers were a lot of fun to be around and learn from. Setting up appointments could be quite challenging at times, but helping our clients find a solution and fulfilling their needs was very rewarding."
good,I do love working at The Home Depot but they don't give enough hours. People have bills to pay and 16-27 hours a week isn't enough to put food on the table. Other than that the work environment is good and the energy is great. Just need to be more open to giving more hours
good,"the job os okey and the pay is bad"
good,Working with the company was very productive and well manageable. I feel I would still be working there but I wanted to get back in school to further my education.
good,"Working on your feet most the day."
good,A typical day at home depot is frustrating and stressful because management lack organization and communication skills which is important in a successful working organization. I find it hard to work in a environment rewards nor acknowledges good work ethics.
good,"Good hours "
good,"Just your typical retail job. Handled customer traffic, provided customer service. Most enjoyable part of the job was the events. Id rate it 7/10/"
good,As a cashier you are greeting the customer as they come in. They ask you where to find items as they come in.You need to check prices for customers when they question prices. You help your team rotate so everyone has their breaks.
good,"I bounced around departments, Didn't really learn much they don't teach or train there employee's. The schedules are all over the place."
good,"Typical day at work all depends on what time of the year it is, but my co-workers are great, since each individual Home Depot is such a huge companies, we try to make it a point to get along."
good,Great company but they need to understand balance between work and life of their employees. Loved everyone I worked with we made a great team.
good,This is a company you have to be physically and mentally prepared for. This isnt for someone up in age young out of high school feel overall enjoyed my time.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of approaching customers and asking them if they'd like to take a survey on the quality of their water. After completing a survey on a tablet, I would then submit this information to Rain Soft. The survey was a way of marketing their filtration system to Home Depot customers. My sales goals were usually 10-12 surveys per hour. I learned how to confidently approach people and make conversation, as well as help customers find items in Home Depot. My manager lived in Georgia, so he rarely came to visit. I did not have any co-workers because only one vendor can work in the store at a time. The hardest part of the job was that Fort Walton Beach Home Depot usually had the same regulars coming in every day, so it reached a point to where I could no longer obtain fresh surveys. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know customers. There are so many interesting things you can learn from interacting with the public."
good,"great environment overall, good management great company to move up with. hardest part of the job is probably switching season to season."
good,"I have been to two home depot locations while I was employed. This was because of me moving out of state. I loved that they allowed me to transfer! That was very convenient. they do work around your schedule as long as you work with them. in my opinion i did prefer the second location, in a less city like environment. They were much nicer and worked one on one with you. The first location was in a huge city area and they just had everything fast paced which isn't bad but you're  more expected to do jobs that aren't  even your responsibility and with little credit."
good,"As a freight team employee, the job becomes very repetitive very quickly. Would've been great as a first-time employment opportunity. Management is decent, but micromanaging is everywhere."
good,I love to meet and help people. i enjoy working with most of my coworkers. everybody is willing to help if you might not know the answer to a specific question.
good,Home Depot is a good company to work for.  They have good benefits and good people work with.  Like any retail it is hard work.
good,This company is a great company to start out working for. If you are a hard working young adult looking to advance quick this is the company for you!!
good,"Working with consumers on a daily basis, to help fulfill their needs for projects from start to finish was always fun!"
good,"Flexible with the schedule but management is of no help and they're sneaky and only do work when they're bosses show up, my coworkers are nice and easy to get along with but the problem I've had is with management not doing their job."
good,aprendes mucho y es buena para tu primer empleo salen buenos amigos y enseñansas
good,"Was only part-time and seasonal.  Home improvement. Busy place, employees and management are nice and helpful.  Did not work there very long."
good,"I worked in several depts. throughout the store. My job was to complete daily tasks issued by the dept. supervisors . Clean and maintain department ,keep the shelves stocked and assist customers."
good,Home Depot is not a bad place to work for a retail store. Just be aware that your schedule will be sub-optimal if you work full-time (expect to give up your weekends and have to work early/late at times).
good,"good people but management was often conflicting, with clear favortism being evident and affecting the scheduling and work experience. limited training"
good,Its a special palce to work where i can get to know people and interact with customers. Ive learned new machines to operate and how to deal with a variety of people from different places and backgrounds. overall it was a learning expoeriance for me to work ther and if there was was room for growth and pay i would continue my carrear there.
good,"As a department supervisor, your day could be quite busy what with supervisor meetings and ad sets. Home Depot was a great company for continued education. They had so many classes for every department so that you were better versed in your respective departments, but you were not limited to learn just your department. Managers had a problem with talking down to employees and treating their department supervisors like children. If a new supervisory tool was implemented they would not train you on how to use it but would blast you for not doing it properly. I had good co-workers and bad co-workers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with tasks issued by managers because they were not clear in what they wanted, it was almost like they expected you to read their mind. The best part of the job was when I first started, I started on the overnight freight team and I loved the challenge of packing out 3.5 pallets per hour and getting the store ready for opening. The freight team was like a family and I missed that when I was promoted."
good,"I was at the service desk. A job that literally only 5 people in the whole store know how to do. And I had to multitask a lot, I was in charge of special orders, will calls, returns, normal ringing up of items because the customers were too lazy to walk to checkouts, helping load, helping in garden, keeping track of employee attendance, answering phone calls and transferring them to the right department and paging employees. It was very overwhelming, my manager was nice (the same first one at Family Dollar) but was fired. And the new manager and store manager were too young and inexperienced. They eventually left too. They wanted me to greet customers when I was on my way to break or back to the counter where I wasn't suppose to leave. And ask them if they needed help, but I didn't know any other department and then they had to wait while I found someone. The girls I worked with were rude to me. Always yelling and complaining. And customers use to yell at me, at other peoples mistakes and I had nothing to do with it."
good,Co-workers were nice work was fair a typical day was grabbing carts and loading cars and lots of walking theirs was food giving out to celebrate hard work
good,"Typical day at work is usually fairly busy. You learn to prioritize your time according to your daily tasks that are given.  The hardest part of the job is the general lack of communication between departments and the manager. For the most part it is a good place to work, especially if you are seeking part time employment ."
good,"Work was only busy during the summer. Management was always changing. Had to leave because of lack of hours, even though sales were great in my department."
good,"its a very political environment, if you don't cozy up with the managers you likely will not move up or be promoted. however it being my first job it was more than adequate."
good,"typical work day consist of customer assistance loading unloading trailers distributions of merchandise through out the store, co-workers where great so was management"
good,night shift was pretty easy. i worked with one of my friends at night and the job was just overall easy. it was a good starter job for anyone
good,"great environment to work in and usually nice and friendly co workers . You learn a lot of different things from the different culture of people, that's the most enjoyable part. The hardest part of the job is the fact that the motto is customers are always right even when they are clearly wrong and the managers really let the customers disrespect the associates most of the time."
good,This is a okay job if you are willing to work your butt off. Some associates don't do their job so you are constantly doing it for them. You are always going to be playing catch up because there are not enough associates to do the jobs.
good,"This was a great company with flexible hours. Management was nice, and they work around your schedule for students well. It teaches you great customer service skills."
good,A typical day at Home Depot is busy and fast paced. There is not much time for employees to sit around doing nothing which is a good thing.
good,"It was a decent experience working for Home Depot. I personally did not enjoy the tactics used by management to single out candidates for  bonuses/upgrades in positions."
good,"Overall I would rate The Home Depot as a reasonable place to work for entry, but lacking opportunity to advance - However, for me I am way over qualified but when I retired welcomed the opportunity to interact with people rather than sit on the beach or play cards."
good,A typical working at home depot I clock in and then I head to the floor and maintain the shelves as well as and sometimes pair with a coworker in my department to put away returned items or to rearrange an aisle.
good,"somewhat slow nights"
good,"Opened register.  Handled customers checking out. Straighten products when not busy, and end of day restock items and sweep your area."
good,"While working at Home Depot I really enjoyed working with so many people everyday, also I liked the fast pace environment, always something to do. Id have to say one of the hardest part of the job was adjusting to the hours, getting in the routine of waking up at 4am wasn't easy."
good,"Everyday there is something new to learn."
good,"Great management team with the store and the team I supervise are great coworkers. The MET team has taken on a lot of roles and that has became tough but easy at the same time if you have a great team to back you up. A typical day at work is a 5am-1:30pm shift of resets, projects, changing price labels, customer service, and making sure we set products for the customer. I have learned patience and to make it fun and exciting at work but at the same time to be a great supervisor."
good,Fill customer order for pavers and other concrete materials. Learned to work hard and work well with others to get a quality job done
good,Like the environment and customers. Getting to know customers everyday.  It is demanding but rewarding. Feels good to help out
good,"Could use improvement in communications throughout store on specific job responsibilities. When trying to stay busy, I am sometimes told not to do certain tasks that are someone else's responsibility. Also, company seems to only implement part time employment."
good,good overall experience and opportunity to advance. Must be patient when dealing with customers. Lots of incentives and opportunity to relocate if you love your job. Good place to work
good,"worked here for 1 in a half years"
good,"I have been working at the Home Depot for about a year and half and I must say that although it has taught me a bit about saying items and merchandise, the customer service is atrocious."
good,They train you from top to bottom from how to drive a forklift to shipping and receiving. Job can be fun or hard depending on which department you end up in.
good,The benefits and pay are good here. They lack in work life balance. Very solid group of hourly associates as well. The upper management could use more leadership training.
good,The employees are like family. But management and corporate doesn't care about the little people that work there. There isn't much room for advancement like they tell you.
good,"Was my first job. Hated the management, the store had been closed down and opened up by a different company now. Horrible manager there, was very rude and mean and demanding."
good,"Enjoy working there, but it is hard to advance upward."
good,Work was easy and management is unreliable. If you work hard they'll respect you dearly then begin to ask you yo do many things.
good,En Veracruz me encontré con personal que no estaba capacitado para tener gente a su cargo generando strees e incomodidad.
good,"Very busy. get to the desk and start to taking care of customers, we work 3 to 1 on orders placing, releasing, checking in and out orders, pulling orders from delivery dept. etc. is a non stop until scheduled lunch break. I learned how to deal with complaints, conflicts and how to make a connection with customers. "
good,muy grato la estancia en home depot y el aprendizaje fue amplio gracias al compañerismo
good,I did not work for The Home Depot; I was merely a brand ambassador for NEST stationed there. I was allowed a fair 30 minutes of break
good,"I love meeting new people, so the establishment was great for that. The management and associates as a whole was very unprofessional."
good,"Customer service and Operations, management is excellent with coaching employees and co-workers provides an healthy work environment. The hardest part of the job is the turn over of sales representatives, the flow changes very frequently."
good,"After 17 years with Home Depot, I saw a lot of changes. It started out as a Great company with a great employee and customer service culture. As it grew to be the mega retailer that it is it became more like any other large company with the almighty dollar and the bottom line as it's soul motivation, and lost some of it's people skills along the way. "
good,"I've worked at home depot for 2 years and I make the same amount as the new hires. I work in a department where it can be very very stressful and tiring on your body. I don't understand how some departments or the front end (cashiers) can make the same amount as my department when there is a lot of heavy lifting and body stress involved with my work. You can say well they deal with money and transactions, but I occasionally do that as well with special orders. Specialty departments should make more... just saying. Just to be clear I work part time at 25-28 hours a week; that is why my salary is $19000/year."
good,fun working environment with helpful managers and friendly co workers. everyday is different and doing different tasks with different customers
good,It is a great place to work if your in school. Full time is hard to come by and most working adults can't make it on a part time basis.
good,"Commission based. did not make enough money. You had to go to Home Depot and get your own leads. When you figured the price of kitchen cabinet refacing for the customer, the cost was almost the same as a new kitchen."
good,"Working at The Home Depot is very stressful, management is all over the place, and to get promoted it takes a long time. Employees are not taken into consideration by management"
good,"The hours are great with Monday-Friday 6:00am-2:30pm, weekends off."
good,Inventory management I counted the product on the shelves and I changed departments to Cashier where I would work with the customer to find the right products for the job
good,Good place to work.  A good company to learn a lot.  Meet new people every day make great customer relationships.  Co-workers are great everyone very helpful.  Days at work go by quickly always have something to do.
good,"The company offered flexible hours. My scheduled would change often and the company worked with me. The chance for advancement was limited, often employees were tasked with lower level work with the promise of a benefit that would never arise. The company tended to do outside hires for leadership roles."
good,I place order for customer and also help them find an item that best work for them. I check status on order and handle any fraud issues that customers have. I process any returns and refunds to customer or adjust prices on orders that I place.
good,"Well where do I begin. The job itself is not bad. They do have great benefits. But if you want to move up then you will need to be one of managements ""pets"" or you won't go anywhere with the company."
good,"great place to work if your up for fast paced and learning new activities, typical day at work would include greeting customers and helping them find the products that they need"
good,"was able to work two jobs while employed with home depot. easy work load, good training. good for students"
good,"It was an ok job. A step up from minimum wage fast food job..okay people. When you work for THD you dont have much of a life..youre required to work 1 weekend day. and its usually long, tiring and gruesome. .no set schedule...if you have something personal going on they refuse to give you that day off. and if you call off its frowned apon. they also stalk you on social media so be careful what you post"
good,"Learned great customer service. For example helping customers pick the right paint to go with their house, solving customers problems, etc."
good,"It is an acceptable place to work however, ""employee support"" through the company is not  universal.  ""Home Depot values"" are not present on a daily basis as corporate claims."
good,"Can be chaotic but with the right people the work can be fun. Over whelming at times balancing customers and basic job requirements,"
good,"Great overall learning and teaching experience.  Constant computer classes over the years to learn my field of study (horticulture) and to be"" certified customer service"" associate in horticulture in addition to classes of other areas of the store and to be able to help in any department.  Also given Managerial classes during the 3 yrs. I was in Management.  Management gave reviews to all employees every 6 months in order for employees to determine what they did well in as well as what areas they needed improvement.  At this time raises were given if improvement was made.  Management was usually fair in making decisions.  Hardest part of the job was never working a regular schedule, i,e, schedule changed every 2 wks. and might include different days off, morning, mid, night, or closing shifts - very hard to adjust to.  Co-workers were great and most of the time were helpful and considerate of each other.  Most enjoyable part of the job was knowing the product, creating good will and always keeping the customers coming back!"
good,good place but you need to be in good with a dept head to be promoted as well as work long hours and not be given breaks. you will burn out if you do not take days off.
good,I worked here through college and gave me the stepping stones when I got promoted to a higher position. Its good for people who know they aren't going to be there for life. Depending on your location it just depends on what your daily work day will be like.
good,"I really enjoy working for the Home Depot for my amazing coworkers, and all the benefits that come with the job. When the company is successful there are often free lunches, and fun things done for the associates. I really like that Home Depot is very transparent with their employees by letting associates know of sales that the store has been making."
good,You can have your good days and bad one as well.  Staff is good.  they are continuously improving.  Hours are good.  Management is good
good,Home depot taught me great customer service and how to deal with unhappy people. Home depot gives you the opportunity to grow.
good,"Despite doing a good job working there they rarely notice hard workers. Co-workers are friendly and laid back however, management needs some work. The pay isn't enough even after working there for 2 years. No motivation at all to succeed."
good,"falta de oportunidades a pesar de ser una excelente empresa donde se aprende mucho sobre las ventas."
good,ive been there 7 yrs with a up and down full time schedule and now thats changed to a set schedule and I got stuck with the closing shift. made my entire life miserable. otherwise its a lovely place to work so long as you like to help people.
good,"a typical day was crazy. No real goals. Basically busy work"
good,Manage front end staff; Manager on Duty; Loved my co workers; Provided customer service; Prices were too high on a lot of product
good,"Home Depot has two different sides to it. Store associates and those of us considered ""store support"" who are payed by the vendors but work in the stores 100% of the time. I constantly hear about how store associates are stressed out by management and their hours are being rearranged a lot, cut, and they often are stretched thin due to lack of full staffing. ""Store support"" associates who do merchandising have it better than those who work in specific departments. However, you never really gain knowledge unless you have the time to look things up and read packaging."
good,"A corporation that outwardly continues to promote family values and Orange culture, hoping to be able to revive the way that The Home Depot actually was in past years. Compensation is fair. Salaried and full time schedules are difficult to live with from a family life perspective unless you are one of the ""chosen ones"" in a limited number of positions that offer a set schedule."
good,"I love the people I work with, Management is a little bit different and I feel they don't care that things happen and people have family."
good,"Typical retail, slightly impersonal. Great co-workers who try to help each other. Staffing was not sufficient to provide a high level of customer service."
good,"home depot is a great place to work if you are going to college, they work with school schedules. Great place for a new person with no experience"
good,"I helped customers with a fast and friendly checkout and I also helped customers with Spanish translating and I also cleaned the front end and all the registers and counters and made fresh coffee for the customers and I helped customers do ordering online, and I also watered plants and took care of them and sold them and helped customers with any garden questions and how they can make a mini salsa garden."
good,"It Was a good place to work.Physically and mentally challenging."
good,The hours are long and the work is extremely demanding. Management was not attentive to employees. The pay was decent. The company as a whole was good company that spoils their employees.
good,Home Depot was an okay place to work. I enjoyed my job and the customers. The employees not as too much. I would choose Lowes over Home Depot for services.
good,Company with good pay and benefits that requires a lot of physical labor. Long hours during the peak seasons but lots of opportunity for advancement.
good,Probably the biggest issue here is the lack of good software management experience.  I also was a bit bored on the job.  Someone with a different manager may have a different experience at this company.
good,"enjoyed working with public and learning about the many products, staff was friendly and dedicated, keeping track of inventory could be challenging"
good,this would have been a great place i loved the co workers and the counselors I liked the fact that some needs were met ive learned so much being in this field and i was able to use it in future jobs
good,a normal day with this company involved a lot of discouraging calls to insurance companies to get the repairs needed on the home owners property
good,help customers drive sales live the value of home depot. Help other employees when they need it. make sure customers have everything they need
good,"You will work with good people at The Home Depot although they don't pay well."
good,"I gained experience in the retail field, as well as learning how to be patient and give excellent customer service. I also learned how to be a good listener."
good,Hot in the summer working in garden dept. Management seemed to care more about productivity than safety at times. Forklift driving can be fun once you get the hang of it.
good,"I learned a lot from the customers at this job. I enjoyed my work, but my direct supervisor was continuously difficult. This eventually lead to my wrongful termination. I wish I would have been more diligent in fighting to keep my job, but I decided it was in my best interest not to stay where I would be mistreated and have confrontation in the workplace."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was learning how to operate an fork-lift. A typical day at work would be me unloading/loading the inventory truck,stocking, and customer service."
good,work words and the some place that i worked and the fun I had works twenty words that are required to meet this web sites require ments
good,"Physically demanding, requires handling of heavy materials of up to 90 pounds such as lumber and concrete. Requires computer skills and customer service skills. Job can be stressful during the busy season."
good,"I love working for the Home Depot. I enjoy the work environment and the people that work and shop there. I have learned a lot while advancing in my career there. The company tries hard to accommodate to their employees and make a fun, team-oriented work place. They recently started a new program for their full-time associates with consistent scheduling. While it may sound like a great idea it has also caused work/life conflicts for several of my co-workers. My schedule was recently changed from 9 am - 6 pm shifts to 1 pm - 10 pm shifts. I am unable to work those hours as I am a caregiver for my elderly parents at home. Therefore I am looking for a new job. I wish they could be more accommodating for the families of their employees. I will miss my job there."
good,"- a typical day at work consisted of walking around straightening out the shelves and bringing down freight. Helping customers with whatever they had questions are. Loading peoples cars if they needed help."
good,It was a nice place to work just had a high turn around.  Need to work better on scheduling always was short staffed.  The employees were awesome. The hardest part was finding coverage
good,"learn so much and did lot of testing on databases"
good,"out of the last 3 reviews I was a 0-outstanding,i received 5-7 homerawards in the last 12months and a watch for going above and beyond"
good,"Needed better store management, employees are friendly.Learn to work forklifts,ect. The store was really unorganized witch made it difficult to get tasks done."
good,"On the average I walk 7-8 miles in a shift and lift in 40-60lb items for 4-6 hours of my day.  When I leave work I'm tired and sore but I always know what I accomplished.  As I tell people, you pay to go to the gym to workout, I get paid to workout.  It's not a job for everybody and most don't work as hard as a handful of us do.  Being on the bottom of the totem pole is hard and certainly not financially rewarding, maybe not today, but in the end it has made me better."
good,"Good place to work for benefits and compensation. Poor leadership sometimes gives the company a bad rep. The company has a great culture, but not everyone lives the values."
good,"•	Ensure that merchandising and operational activities performed on timely and consistent basis."
good,A typical day at work consists of greeting the customer and checking out merchandise. What I learned is to greet customers in different ways and to know that not all customers will seeking an answer will not react in the same way but in different ways. Working with the best co-workers through answering every question that was asked without judgement. The most enjoyable part was the bonuses the staff would receive throughout the year.
good,"Great closing shift load and unload truck with lumber and building material , clean department and set up for opening the next day, worked alone , clean under pallets of concrete , replace and markdown broken and busted materials . I worked in department alone until morning shift comes in, Making sure department is clear for opening check list."
good,"Its a friendly diverse culture,co-worker are friendly,i think re-engineering should take places among the hierarchy ,i think the salary need to be increase for such a company."
good,Thank God for Home Depot. I continued developing my sales and soft skills whilst working there. Don't expect to be able to pay a mortgage or do something financially spectacular if you depend on the pay. A little increase in wages will go a long way helping the employees.
good,This is a great job for someone in college. They work with your hours and the HR work with you hand and hand. The people you work with become like family.
good,"I started working at Home Depot when I just got out of college. I was unemployed for a while and they finally hired me. The money wasn't great, but it was something. Not a bad place to work if you have to work retail."
good,"Overall, the Home Depot is a good place to work.  The company provides a lot for their employees and there is a sense of a family atmosphere.  However, like most retail jobs, staffing never seems to be adequate and the workload does not seem to be even among all the employees."
good,Do not have any complaints.  Supervisor will work with you and help you if you needed.  Does involve heavy lifting. Management worked with you as needed.  Had a meal served once a month for company overview and Associate of the Month.
good,"I would recommend this place to anyone interested in learning more about the construction side of sales. The harder you work, the more you get out of this place. There is always something new to learn."
good,Great environment enjoyed serving my customers on the daily basis. I enjoyed making others smile and seeing the relief of their faces when someone is actually going the extra mile for them.
good,"Took this job initally as I assumed that I was to learn about Home-renovations and all that that entails...WRONG..basically, the position is one of a glorified janitor...Dusting and stocking/facing displays through-out the entire store, which includes working in the cold/frost out-doors in winter months..Applied for the overnite position at another  location..Being a NEW position with-in the same department, the managers were NOT certain of the actual details of the position...The shift was VERY long...10 hours/ 4 nights week...Unless your a ""night-owl"" and can stay awake around the clock. 9 p.m. thru 7;30 am the following day I DO NOT recommend this job."
good,"I had learned a lot about grass ever since I worked for this company. Therefore the pay were not good, the management were not that good and they were not understanding of some situations. They will promote whoever depending of how they know them but not of the quality of the work. I was getting like 16 hours every week and the most I could get was 28 hours a week."
good,You get free food for safety which is nice. You get to meet coworkers and other people at times. Meeting some customers can be nice and you get to learn about interesting products.
good,"Training's rushed to get you out on a register. You must always ask the customer if there using their Home Depot card in the beginning of the sale and you must always tell the customer not to forget to take the Home Depot survey on the receipt when they get home. If you don't say that you get written up.  Huge turn over, and they will fire you in a heartbeat if a customer says one little thing bad about you."
good,well trained and treat employees well. lots of room for advancement.  great managers and mostly good customers. associates seems to get along really well and make coming to work fun
good,call center taking inbound/outbound calls. operates 7 days a week up  until 10:00 pm during the weekdays. overtime is offered at times and there are many sales contests to help improve personal sales goals.
good,"A typical day at work was a busy, fast paced environment that was challenging, but  if you were determined to build a professional relationship with customers and learn the merchandise it  will be a great day to day experience. If I would have to say what I learned I would say, learning how to have an emotional impact with the customer by going above and beyond for the customer. The hardest part of the job is assisting a difficult customer who can never be pleased no matter what was done  and the most enjoyable part of the job is knowing I pleased customers and did it with my fellow associates as a team player and knowing  management/ supervisors were pleased with our efforts"
good,It is a nice place to work for cause of the healthcare benefits. The hardest part of the job is not getting paid enough for the work a person does.
good,Fast pace work environment  helping more than 1000 customer on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of this job is meeting new customers and helping them with there problems.
good,"Honestly the Home Depot is a good company to work for, its just I have responsibilities and things I have to achieve and working part time over an year wasn't going to help me meet my goal."
good,this is a goof place to work i was able to learn alot i would go back to work there but they didnt pay a lot until you get up in managment. it was a nice place with good people
good,Friendly work environment. Everyone tries to help you learn your job to the best of their ability. Someone is always there to help.
good,"The day started early. All day I was busy, there was always work to do. I very much enjoyed being busy. I worked alone a lot of the time until the second person got there later in the day and I have to multi-task a lot. I dealt with customers everyday and in good and not so good scenarios but was able to handle it most of the time. If i couldn't I could send them to someone who could help them."
good,I like working here it all depends on the management team you have. There is high turnover at the store manger position. Sometimes they expect  to much out of workers
good,i enjoyed working at home depot although sceduleing was erractic i was hired part time to go full time and that never happened
good,"Ever changing expectations, long hours and high stress. They do take care of the associates, but at times forget about the leadership team."
good,I enjoyed working with everyone there but it was only a temporary job. I didn't feel like they were that invested in helping or teaching there workers to advance. It was a safe and clean environment. The job itself just wasn't something I was planning on making a career out of.
good,Not bad if you dont mind working outside.  Expect to lift a lot of heavy things and get your hours cut when they don't need you.
good,"Aucun"
good,"great place to learn and to work. fantastic. A great place to broaden your knowledge of building, and building materials."
good,"I learned a lot while working at HD, I just feel my skill set was a little higher than they had expected and we were not able to agree in some areas."
good,"A lot of good workers, fun workplace. A lot of work to be done. Always busy. A lot of coworkers. Wish they would stop hiring more people and gave out more hours"
good,employees are great and they are very hard workers people that deserve to be recognized learned everything from using equipment like big and small fork lift order picker pallet jack etc.
good,"The store is catered to those looking for immediate employment as well as those making a career in Home Depot management, as their development from within is commendable.  I found the merchandising team positions to be the most attractive, as the hours were consistent and the tasks themselves were flexible and avoided micro-management."
good,It was a basic retail job. Nothing special. Management was friendly but not extremely reliable. Shifts were horrible though due to under staffing.
good,I worked here on the overnight freight team and my coworkers were very nice and helpful. They gave me a few 40 hour weeks even as a seasonal worker.
good,Cool place to start off and establish your self in the retail business . People get grandfathered in and think they run the place
good,"Very helpful with costumers, great work ethic.Managers are fun when  it needs to be. very resourceful place. hard workers."
good,"I learned a lot from the experience , I also learned about different everyday household appliances. For example, it was my first time working in a big departments helping people from all types of places. I even seen a couple celebrities while working there it was pretty cool."
good,"If you love to learn new things everyday. Specifically under the subject of home improvement, this job is great starter. The environment is fast paced, and definitely have too be great at working under pressure. The pay isn't so great. Just a typical retail place. Customers tend to always be rude, due to the fact that their always in rush, because of deadlines, or being on the clock."
good,"A typical day is active."
good,i left home depot for the reason that i wasn't learning anything new and the managers there were all crooks. it was not a good place to work except for the fact thats where i met my fiancé
good,There is a high volume of customer service and the job can be physically straining at times. I have learned to deal with customers all effectively and respectfully no matter situation. Overall management was good at working with schedules if outside obligations were noted in advance. Co-workers for the most part were helpful. The hardest part about the job is the inconsistency of scheduled hours.
good,Good place to earn money but may not be a great place to start a career depending on the person. The job is fit for some people not all.
good,"I've received a better understanding of using a register with a computer. Fantastic Managers, Poorly hired supervisors. Great coworkers always fun to be with. The hardest part of this job is the lifting, but the most enjoyable part is meeting great people."
good,I disliked this job because the work over do the pay then the hours suck you work full time is hopefully 70 hours every 2 weeks.
good,Home Depot is a good place to work because they have flexible hours and have frequent events. Employees can earn badges and gifts for good customer service.
good,I had no real  appliance experience.  Studied and learned all I could about the products.  Sold many high end products.  Lead store in insurance sales on hard goods.
good,No day at home depot is the same but at the end of the day the job isn't too complicated but the pay doesn't match the work. Co-Workers are considerate and willing to help as a team. Hardest part is allocated the time to make sure all customers are being help to peak time.
good,"The particular store I work at is about favorites.  While this is a set back, I do enjoy working there. Most of my co-workers are great and they gladly work around my school and life schedule."
good,at first i loved working for home depot but i changed my mind and left the team. after going for many promotions and being turned because of my young age even though i was more suited for the job than the person they chose. i was told there was no way i could do more than count money at my age.
good,"This is a position I took and felt I was fairly qualified for but after a little time here I have learned there is so much more to this area then just windows and doors. This position requires that you stay up to date on the newest lines that vendors are dropping out. It also requires that you know all there is to know about windows and doors. I have now completed several 6 course classes to obtain a wide variety of knowledge for vendors, products and services offered at Home Depot. This position has been a very demanding and challenging experience finding out that there is so much more to this field then I realized. I am always placing special orders for customers that require attention to detail, some math occasionally, the ability or read a tape measure and deal with numbers along with being able to build a specific design in a computer program to fit that customers need."
good,This place was very difficult to work at if you have a lot of other things going on outside of work. This job will take up a lot of your time as well.
good,A typical day at work consisted of restocking shelves and cleaning up after the night crew if you were scheduled early morning. Throughout the day activity normally picks up by 12 noon so the rest of the time you are defaulted to serving customers and maintaining the shelves.
good,A day there is pretty easy but able to stay busy management is typically very nice and get to meet a lot of people and usually fun people to work with
good,Working in the  retail industry can become a difficult environment to adapt but In my opinion if you get master just like any other job the work will become great and productive environment.
good,Provided customer service to customers in every department. Stocked the shelves to with merchandise. Help my manager complete the daily tasks given by the store manager.
good,Politicing is strongly encouraged if you wish to advance. Overall not a bad place to work just be careful. Follow all policies and no problems. High turn over rate with junior personnel.
good,nice and organized management but not enough hours or pay. company benefits are great and had no problems working there other than 20hrs a week and 8.50 an hour
good,Depends on the store but the managers can be a bit too much but you meet a lot of great workers pay can be better Pay scale doesnt increase as you work more years
good,"Employees were not always treated with the respect they deserved."
good,worked in the flooring department  of home depot learned a lot and was able to grow in my knowledge of measuring and flooring accessories.
good,"He aprendido que el cliente es lo mas imprtante, que gracias a ellos tengo trabajo. "
good,i would not want to work for them cause they made me feel uncomfortable being disabled other than that i would still shop there
good,Great co-workers. Learned to use forklift. Helping customers solve their home remodeling issues. Ability to work in different departments.
good,"I worked overnights and the Home Depot I was at never really tried to get extra help. They always wanted YOU to finish most of everything. You had to do your department than go to another. They never provided enough help for the over night crew. They never let people go to full-time if you wanted to, and they let people leave early all the time, living only a few people to do everything. Got paid every 2 weeks. they cut hours if it was really slow. This job is only good if you're looking for a part-time job."
good,A typical day is you repeat the same thing you do everyday. I learned how to use a RF scanner system for order selecting. My co-workers were nice and we got along well with each other.
good,I really liked the fact that the people who work there are always willing to help you and its a clean and earning environment
good,"Home Depot is a very fast paced environment as my store saw over 5,000 people per day.  I would open the Pro Side of the business M-F at 5am. I worked extremely well with all the Pro Customer to the point that they would only come to the store and my register when I was working."
good,the home depot was a decent place to work at. Most of the people who worked there were cool. One big flaw was part time hours and not much room for advancement.
good,Everyone is super friendly and nice. Awesome place to work and you can really get along with co-workers and members. The hardest part of my day would be working in the hot sun every day.
good,"Enjoy hard work low stress environment, product knowledgeable workers, every one willing to teach and lend a hand to get the job completed in a timely manner."
good,This is a ok place to work i guess. I personally hated it and thought i could do it for the money but i just felt like a piece of me died each day. Its not a hard job at all but there are things you have to go through each day which make your day more difficult.
good,"management is great, the shifts are long and boring because you have to stay in one spot, holiday pay, time and a half, and vacation time if offered"
good,"Getting to have customer, and personal relationships with contractors. Learned crucial information on power tools, lawn equipment , and chemicals. Management"
good,Dont have any complaints working here. Enjoyed it and learned alot of things about home improvement. management was very understanding and reasonable.
good,"This was not employment experience, this was an extracurricular activity in high school I participated in.  This was the foundation for my interest in machining and what drove me to become a machinist."
good,"Home Depot is a good workplace for anyone wanting to excel with the company. If you are dedicated and work hard, it will pay off and you will succeed."
good,"I enjoyed working on the sales floor. It just depended on who the co-workers were there that day. "
good,"It is a good place to work but not really for safety reasons but to achieve goals and advance, it's good. You would come in for your shift and you would put your apron on and clock in. You would go to the front and be told where you would work for the day or cover someone's lunch or 15 min break. In the three hours you would take your 15 min break. Someone would come cover you. Then you come back to your line and doing all of the cash and credit transactions and about two or three hours depending on your shift you would take your lunch and someone would cover you for that too. Then when you got back you cleaned and you were back on register."
good,Home Depot is a great company with the exception of the politics that cause for employees to suffer. Each store has it's good and bad points but you have to see through the gray areas that constantly put in front of the employees.
good,I would help and assist customers and was also a back up cashier. I also assisted the other co-workers in there positions if they were short on hands
good,very nice environment to work in. co-workers are always friendly. customers are a pleasure to serve. hardest part is dealing with my department supervisors personality. most enjoyable part of the day is helping a customer with a challenging question.
good,I just completed my bachelors and needed to work for the time that I worked there it was an interesting  place to work and I have
good,"Provided Excellent Customer service."
good,"- coworkers and management was nice, rewarded us and fun working enviroment, night shift got hard after a while and the work wasn't always easy...but overall good experience"
good,"management was a mess, mostly teenage staff but overall not a terrible work enviroment"
good,"A typical day consisted of assisting customers, using the forklift to retrieve and load product, front facing and stocking product."
good,"Home Depot is truly a company that you can grow with.  Great place to grow and learn.  Management compensation package is well, but does not pay hourly associates enough money."
good,"Accurately maintaining inventory records of incoming and outgoing materials and products,as well as demonstrating through ability to be a team player with in a diverse work environment."
good,"Everyday new challenges with customers made the job exciting. Management was good, other employees some had attitudes like home depot owes them."
good,"Maintain the paint counter and aisles on a daily basis."
good,"It was okay but when the questions from customers got hard, I couldn't answer them because the training they said they would provide me with I never received. The people were cool, I learned to mix paint."
good,I enjoy working with this company. This company has taught me a lot as I even became a Team leader. I been here for a year a I was told by many of my co-workers that they really enjoyed my time being there.
good,"I learned how to multi task by speaking with customers and accomplishing my tasks at the same time."
good,"as a former employee, the job is okay. nothing great. pays the bills, warehouse environment. Under staffing and short handing, customer service struggles."
good,"-A typical day consisted of being non eventful with no real challenge or excitement, but it was very easy to know what needed to be done. "
good,"They always start you off as part-time. Its nothing personal. Its hard to actually become full time unless you really push for it and go above and beyond at work."
good,"Good company to work for. I worked 60 hours per week and 12 hours per day. I learned a lot about a civilian logistics supply chain management company.  The management team is good.  I really liked my co-workers. I also really liked my associates.  The hardest part of the job was getting there 3 hours before the shift started and having to do everything by myself.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being around my associates, who worked for me."
good,If your not hitting the numbers it gets stressful. the weekly conference calls were a pain in the butt too especially because they were always over an hour long
good,Great place to gain work experience for students. I was guided by a great team of co-workers/ management and also from daily Pro customers.  I gained knowledge of Hardware products/ tools along with knowledge from other departments in The Home Depot.  The most enjoyable part of the job is making the customer happy by finding their product they needed and helping them fulfill their project goals.
good,Je n'avais pas eu assez de formation pour être installateur et en charge d'employé
good,The Home Depot provided me with excellent training on product knowledge. The management often emphasized customer service.
good,no cross training stuck in one department unless needed. loss prevention is bad. management is ok but not consistent. no opportunities to move up
good,I loved working for this company. Yonkers NY store did well with sharing success party's and paychecks yes very smooth very nice. And they would have cook outs and lunch party's for us.
good,A great place to work as a transition job. Advancement is sometimes difficult and choices can be political. Retail has its own challenges and the hours are difficult on a family. The pay rate is low based on the community averages.
good,"Very busy days filled with audits, investigation of theft, safety audits and shrink issues.  Strong management team with room for growth."
good,I start with evaluating what the work load for the day is than I meet with my manager and team and decide who is going to do what in which department. Than when that is done I use the fork lift and finish the job. Afterwards straighten up receiving lock up go home.
good,I unload 8 to 15 trucks per day.  I also have to answer phones and key receive all bills of lading.  I also have to receive and detail all incoming  special orders and inventory which is about 5 million dollars in product per month.
good,My time at home depot has shown me how management attitude towards employees can change during difficult and good times. It's great to be in a store where everyone attempts to maintain good relationships with one another. Favoritism can sometimes outweigh opportunities for those who deserve it rather than those kissing up to management to gain a better position.
good,"Head Cashier, Returns Desk, Paint Dept. Exterior & interior Paint Stains,  Home decor ( Carpet, Area rugs, Wood flooring, Vinyl, Laminates, Blinds)"
good,"Fast-Paced, challenging work environment with opportunities for advancement and professional development.  Compensation is supplemented by employee profit sharing."
good,A great entry level company but not for the long term. It is not always easy to grow within the contact centers. Co-workers are friendly along with the management team and the company does offer extra compensation.
good,"Its about what you'd expect from being a cashier. Co workers and managers generally nice. Store manager was very nice and laid back. Getting coworkers help from other departments was hard. You can quickly tell who was going to help and who wasn't. The people are about a 33/33/33 mix of Very nice, Neutral, and Rude. It was a toss up to what you'd get. The hours is what killed it for me. You would work 32-35 hours one week and then 12-16 the next. That way you would average part time on your 2 week check. There were opportunities for overtime after hours stocking...but I found that when I did that I was put on morning shifts pretty regularly. So it was hard to make that extra few bucks."
good,Was a good job while was there.  Wish actually that I never left that job I was young and stupid when I left. Hopefully a new position at a different job will be just the same. And I stay
good,"Working for home depot has given me a lot of experience with customers and cashiering. I have gained good relationships with my coworkers and it has been a great experience working at home depot. Sometimes working in returns can be stressful with angry customers but helping them out the best I can makes me feel better. I love meeting new customers and talking to them. Only thing I wish for is more hours from the company, I want to pursue my independence."
good,comparatively low pay plus long hours. physical exertion balanced with amazing work benefits. Would love to stay if provided with higher pay because the work that is required doesnt satisfy the amount paid for it thats all. other then that amazing and friendly environment
good,"The job its self was really cool but the management made it hard to be productive. When all you are is an associate, you have at least 3 people above you telling you different things so basically you have to choose what you think is best and sit back because youre going to get it from two of them."
good,"I really liked working here even with some annoying employees, overall I liked it because of the customers and the atomsphere."
good,"Usually a very active work environment, good coworkers, unfortunately I had the bad experience of being told I could not take my rest period that was required by state and because of that I was put on probation. The management did not do their job properly and took situations too personally"
good,I started on the front end and with the company training I advanced in the company.  Learned many new and exciting things and different depts and products.  Had  a staff of over 50 people that I trained and helped grow.
good,I worked for temporary associate position from March to July in one year. They wanted me to stay but they cannot afford me because ex-employee sued Home Depot. Home Depot needs to be careful.
good,You work with uneducated minimum wage people that love drama and it feels like high school. Home depot doesnt care about customers and has benifets for the retired
good,"A typical day of work consisted of me getting there early in the morning. I used an ""Inventory Scan Gun"" to scan all inventory on the shelf and conducted ""Customer Service"" occasionally. I was responsible scanning the inventory on the shelf and reporting to my supervisor what needs to be placed on the shelf. I was only there for a short time before I went to G4S."
good,"Very good job to have, managers wasnt all over me as long as my work was completed by the end of the day and pay is very good also everyone was very easy going and nice on the job"
good,it was a fun place to work with a lot of good people helping and making the job even easier. it taught me different culture being in that diverse work field.
good,"The priority of the job was customer service, and making sure that the customer was satisfied each and every time they entered and left the location."
good,okay to work for this company.  I like the people with family like atmosphere. co workers great.  job is very active and physical.
good,"The people were great to work with, but the management was the problem. Have no real sense of direction, and let their egos get in the way of actually making a difference. And they are very quick to fire people (I didn't get fired)."
good,customer service is great love helping people.managment when i was there was awful i worked there 3 yrs an she was hiring new people off the street at 40 hours an i was only getting 29.applied for several positions was never givin the chance.
good,While working in returns at Home Depot has it's positives and negatives especially when it comes to shrink and protecting the store products. The most enjoyable part of the job is simply just being there the environment is great and the camaraderie makes teamwork very fluid but the hardest part of the job is the growth within the company which at times can be difficult.
good,punch in and go to your department. find out what needs to be done . help customers and clean department. put away inventory restock shelves and move inventory to fill locations and packdown all over stock.
good,same ole job day in and day out. boring. not a skilled labor job depending on position. boring pushing buggies. did not enjoy the job. enjoyed most people I worked with
good,great place and great people.  learned alot about retail and how to keep the customer happy frm the associate perspective to the lead perspective
good,great people to work with most of the management is great front end people are awesome hardest part of the day is getting someone to sign up for credit but most customers leave with a smile on their face
good,"it was a job. that's about it. low pay. they expected a lot of work out of you for that low pay. bright side, even part timers received vacation time and sick days."
good,This company was very knowledgable and willing to help in all areas.Management communicated well with their employees.I would recommend this job.
good,"Overnight freight works closely with managment and supervision, which is great,but for the team i work for we are very understaffed. The workload that we handle is way too much for this short team we have but somehow we make it work. There was no offer for overnight differential and the pay is not the best.Its a very physical job from start to finish and requires a good work ethic to be succesful everynight. Home Depot does offer Forklift , Reach Truck training, and order picker training for associates who would like to operate the machines but the in-store certification you gain does not carry over to any other company, which i have a major problem with. The most enjoyable part about the job is working alongside my colleagues everynight, everyone is easy to get along with which make the night go by easy."
good,"The hardest part of the job was trying to keep the lot clear under extreme hot conditions, I couldn't go inside much which bothered me but I never complained."
good,"Everyday proved to be different at this company. I would show up to work to preform my normal job, but often times would be pulled by mangers to preform tasks that they knew they could trust me to do. It was reward to know that people respected my integrity."
good,working for this company was fun. the hardest part of this job was having co workers that did not want to come to work. typical day at work was stocking shelves with merchandise and front facing
good,I have learned many different useful skills while employed. I enjoy customer sales and being able to help customers in need.The hardest part of the job is the unexpected long days and having to come in on days off.  The pay is not adequate for what all is expected of any supervisory position.  I am looking to relocate to Colorado to be closer to family and progress in my career
good,Really friendly co workers willing to help new employees out.This place had great benefits even for part time employees . Great hours
good,"typical day:  depending on schedule, opening or closing dept. assisting customers, maintaining replenishments, aisles, preserving"
good,"Home Depot had many different hours that people worked, we had a schedule that changed daily, we all got along for the most part.  Every job has there up and downs but overall Home Depot was a good job and would recommend it to people."
good,The HD headquarters location is a very stressful place.  A LOT is asked of each of the employees in a very short time frame.
good,Manage the breaks and lunches for cashiers.  Solve any issues that the cashiers had with customers.  Keep customer lines down. Resolve any customer issue that arose.
good,"A typical day at work consists of me opening up my department (tool rental), checking the daily tasks left by the department head, taking the tools for sale outside and setting them up for display. Throughout the day, I deal with customers, helping and educating them with the tools they are interested in renting, and help customers that call with information and price inquiries. The hardest part of my job can be that there are not many people in the store that know the tool rental system, so if I am not scheduled to work with someone, it's hard to find coverage so that I may have a break. The most enjoyable part of my job is my customers. They come from all walks of life, and I always find a way to connect with them, so that they feel good about their shopping/rental experience with me."
good,"I operated forklift to replenish warehouse. Unload pallets from dock and placed pallets on floor locations. Pulled full pallet order to ship to different home depot locations. Enjoyed working at the home depot, fun environment. Did not like scheduled hours."
good,They offer this job as a customer support however after getting through training it is heavily geared towards sales which you don't have control over if everybody calling in is calling about existing order with issues.  There is no way for have your sales quota met by constantly receiving logistical problems with orders.
good,"As an MEA you will perform in-store merchandising service activities such as merchandising projects, planogram maintenance, overhead organization and display/signage maintenance designed to enhance the customer experience."
good,Just keeping busy on the weekends.  Enjoyed the customer service with all the visitors of the Home Depot.  I was able to stay out of trouble and made a few extra dollars.
good,At first i really enjoyed working at Home Depot after being there for two years barely getting a raise I began to get frustrated. The benefits suck the company has high standards a lot of rules a lot of labor but don't like to pay you more money.
good,People are nice but very little is shown for the work that the freight team does. Not very good insurance or pay for what you do or how long you have worked there.
good,"Decent part-time job. Good people to work for, and fairly decent upper management for a large corporation. No benefits for part time employees though."
good,Good place to work and meet interesting customers and associates. Difficult work hours and schedules. Only hires part time and max hours is 24 per week
good,"As a cashier at the Home Depot, you learn that cashiering is not the only duty that you will have. Customer Service is a task that you perform on majority all positions there. The co-workers makes it a fun environment and management appears to form relationships with their employees as well. The enjoyable part of the job, is that we knew how to work as one big team and family and had fun while doing it!"
good,"Most days you stay busy and there is always something to do either in your department or somewhere else around the store. Stock shelves, pick up things left laying around by customers or associates, There is ample training videos you can assign to yourself. Co-workers for the most part are easy to get along with and willing to help. Management is approachable and will listen to you and will also try to resolve customer complaints or issues."
good,Home Depot was a ok place to work .They dont pay that well when hired told me i would be full time and i wasnt .i still did my job to the fullest even tho i felt lied to.
good,"Very hard to get acknowledgement in the company. Must be a all team player and be willing to share credit for own work, but overall a good company to work for the knowledge"
good,Customer service oriented company.  Enjoyable with great co workers.  Required some heavy physical labor and odd hours.  A good learning environment for a very large company
good,"Though working with the public can be challenging, the department supervisor was hard working and made my job more desirable."
good,"Good employer."
good,Busy workplace with various shifts. Meet and greet shoppers. Provide assistance to DIY on their projects and recommend the best way how to do it and with the right materials.
good,I Just Didn't Like Being Harassed By My Supervisor And Losing My Job When Being Late And Calling Off Are Two Different Points
good,Set store to planogram and company standards. Merchandised shelves in store replenishing product on the shelf. Packed out shelves and also completed special projects.
good,"I just started working for home depot, From day one i never been late or call in I work in Receiving( Inbound) Verify shipments and place clearly identified stock in the appropriate storage locations."
good,Great company. They look out for their employees and make working for them an enjoyable experience. Would have received higher score from me if it wasn't for local management issues.
good,"Home Depot is a great place to develop personal and time management skills . From open to close there were always tasks to be completed, everyday was pretty fast paced! I learned a lot about the different aspects of a salesperson, teamwork and definitely multi-tasking. Most coworkers were really friendly and were willing to help out whenever asked.  Overall, the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to assist and connect with all the different customers. Being able to assist everyone with any issue from technical product information to online purchasing was a learning process. Receiving their positive feedback, and feeling confident I did my job to the best of my ability was my goal everyday."
good,Great company to work for. It allows growth and development if retail is a career choice for you. It provides you with the opportunity is meet new and exciting people everyday.
good,"Home Depot is quite busy, normally during the day the business starts out slow, and then it picks up real fast. My experience at Home Depot helped me learn how to drive all operated machinery within the facility. The management is good, they will work with you, and the co-workers are nice to deal with. The hardest part of the job is lifting very hard objects, and the most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know a lot of contractors."
good,"Good environment with a good chance to make great money. Must hit high goals. Not a ton of control over goals, but they are attainable. Daily metrics are annoying but not a deal breaker."
good,given little supervision and trust to get the job done. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to make decisions without having to always contacting a manager or supervisor.
good,Taking care of customers is always the first priority. Walking throughout the store asking customers if they need help and providing service to them. Ensuring that they have everything they need to complete their project.
good,"Micro management at its best, this company has potential is they put the right management in place to run the company. In order to grow with this company you have to be apart of all the politics that goes on."
good,"I get good hours, you get worked pretty hard."
good,N/a i'm sure each home depot varies so i'd rather not give my biased opinion about the company. At  times it can be enjoyable while other times not.
good,"fast pace job with a lot of different chores to complete and constant changes on the schedule,require to work every weekend"
good,"Typical day  varies within the department you are in, enjoyable part interaction with  customers, hard working co-workers, the time schedules made it hard to have outside life"
good,The day is spent greeting and assisting customers as they work on their various odd jobs in their home or extensive renovations.
good,"Knowing eye to eye voice to voice Contact"
good,"The team members was great it was just the mangers wasn't supportive. A great company to work for, I move up fast by performing my duties."
good,The job itself wasn't too bad. Management wasn't as professional as I would have liked. The pace was too slow for my taste. Made the days go by extremely slow.
good,"great place to work if you like working with customers, no two days are the same each day brings a new challenge. one negative is that there is limited room to grow within the company and the fulltime employees try to weed out the part time employees"
good,Loved my job there.loved the people i worked with loved doing the merchandising. good people good company but the District Manager Was Very unfair
good,The environment is very relaxed. There is not much room for growth. The company is more of who you know rather than what you know.
good,Ok place to work but only if you are full-time and single with no commitments.  Expect you to put work before everything else.  No work/life balance at all.  Wouldn't recommend for long term career.
good,"Great people work at Home depot, but there are too many customers and not enough workers to keep pace. Hard to advance within company."
good,"Good company poor pay."
good,Fun & Good Place To Work can get busy heavy at times always on my feet.. It was busy all the times helping people & fellow co-workers always having to hurry and sometimes had to work alone for a few hours.
good,"Basically as any of the customers can attest at this store, you basically work alone, while constantly being harassed over the walkie."
good,enjoy working at home depot just wish i made more per hour and more hours only get a top out of 29 hours per week this company is one of the nicer companies i have worked for
good,"Standing in front of a bay, cleaning, down stocking, relabeling product pricing. "
good,nice environment good management. learned customer service skills better. helped customers with their needs. effective in strengthening skills
good,"done filled this out once, and it is asking me to do it again on the same company."
good,Was working over night with a god group of guys.Had fun working there.Never a dull moment there always had stuff to put away.
good,counting inventory and ringing people on check out. the management and coworkers are always happy. customers are friendly
good,"Home Depot would be the best company to work if they pay their employee very well."
good,Everyday is about the same except for the moods of coworkers and lack of communication between managers. You get a good amount of breaks if you work 8 hours.
good,learned how to multi task in a fast paced environment. Used computer and machine operating skills to maximize profit for store and to become a dynamic hard worker.
good,Managers at Home Depot cares nothing about the employees period. An associate has to have a strong will to grow and develope on their own.
good,Overall Home Depot was not a bad place to work. enjoyed the physical activity but Management could be more involved with associates and the company needs to give better job security to associates
good,I learned the differences between working for a smaller private company as opposed to working for a large corporation or governmental organization.
good,"The hours varies, management is alright. I do overnights and some times its hard for me to obtain the maximum amount of hours because of other situations. You won't have the same supervisor as they change positions like every six months. You may even have issues with your schedules because your hours don't stay consistent. Then again, I am a part-time associate so that may have something to do with it. Its an okay job with okay benefits and good management skills but aside from everything else, if its a job that you want to work for then by all means apply."
good,At Home Depot the hours are long and you work every weekend.  The pay is competitve and benefits are good.  Home Depot is on the cutting edge always trying new merchandising ideas.
good,Was Not For me wasn't really active i like to stay busy. They Gave Very little hours and didn't work whit us on giving more.
good,"I started as an lot attendant and cart runner for a year, then worked my way into being an order puller for six years and then i went to the hardware department for a year. In that time I learned customer service skills, retail and sales skills, I learned about building materials and home improvement, as well as got trained on the LP Forklift, The Reach Truck, The Order Picker, The Slip Sheet Machine and the Electric Pallet Jack, as well as got to work with and become friends with many contractor's."
good,Great part time hours. Worked well with my school schedule and great staff. Stocked up the bays in the store and set up displays.
good,"Loved kitchen design, selecting stove, fridge, countertop, flooring, paint, cabinetry, and project synthesis with client from beginning to end. Bath selection of various materials for overall project."
good,"Homedepot was a great place work, many things to do but , it'll be easy to done home depot helps many people.My time at home depot was great i made friends and i miss them, but i was upset that I had to leave"
good,fun workplace with flexibility. Sales and customer service based. learn about home improvement and meet plenty of new people.
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. "
good,The daily at work was measuring wood and managing money. It was fun learning a bit of it all like drywall and light bulb and different types of nuts. In all it was a great learning experience but the head cashiers were not all that great they each had favorites.
good,they taught me a lot of the skills that I use know pallet jack reach truck and forklift I learned all of those things at this place
good,I worked at my desk and had little interaction with people other than customers. I never felt like I made a difference. The days all melded into the next
good,Overall a good place to work with good people. Hardest part of the job was the hours and the computer systems. Management was always there to help along with coworkers.
good,"Safe and Secure company to work for"
good,"This job deff requires a strong back, for both pallet build and fluid load you are manually moving boxes off of a conveyor belt and building either pallets, or entire walls. I got into great shape working here, but it is very difficult work to do for long periods of time"
good,co workers and programs were excellent. reward programs were good extremely knolagble workers due to training..was a good invirement like a fanily seting
good,Fun work place with supportive management. All around great customer service through out the company. The best part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them.
good,"As with all sales and service jobs, entirely dependent on the customer.  Too many duties for too little pay.  A good job when there is little else to chose from."
good,Colleagues were great. Management was too. Work could be extremely stressful if you a re working in any of the Specialty Departments. These department require installs and no set time for anything to take place. You could be with a customer for 15 minutes or 3 hours at any given time. other department are less demanding and much easier to plan and navigate your day or work load.
good,"Im a contractor via intelligrated out of Mason Ohio.My task are daily P.Ms, corrective work orders, conveyor/sorter equipment up keep. Equipment is modern but not high industrial quality. Management and supervision is not highly knowledgeable or qualified to run efficient production line operations. High turnover in associate employment. On the job training for each department and position is very limited. Overall operation is grade C with much more improvement needed for a higher out put of product units per shift."
good,"The work was very physical ,my work associates was the best part of the job they were very freindly and helpful my overall expeiriance at home depot was a good one ,the only thing I didn't care for was the mandatory monthly meetings at 6am on my day off."
good,I've learned how to develop my people skills. I learned how to deal with multiple personalities at once as well as handling customers. hardest part of my job is finding out what every product does. The most enjoyable part of my day is meeting new customers.
good,"Not a bad company to work for as long have you have goals and a plan. There is room for advancement if you are interested, but it is a bit more difficult than they make it seem."
good,Here at Home Depot I was employed as a sales associate. My job was to educate the customer on new and existing materials and explain the difference between. At the end of every day we would clean up the store. Sweeping and dusting was a part of the cleaning process as well as making sure everything on shelves and on the floor underneath was lined up and flat; even. Customers were a great part of the experience as many of them were well informed already and did great to help me learn about the new products that early on I had no knowledge of. Overall The Home Depot was a great job that I would recommend anyone.
good,"Paid vacation"
good,The home depot was a pretty good job...Learned alot there to prepare me for the future and met some great people there and provided great customer service.
good,"Very fast-paced, requires alot of work for little pay, great team morale, and great leadership from the big wigs. All in all this was a great place to work but not for someone who is trying to make a career out of something."
good,Sometimes we would not get a lunch break.It was hard to go into a department according to your experience in what you know what to do.You don't have a chance to clear your mistakes.
good,"If youre young and want something to pass the time, then ths is the place. You wont get paid a lot, but it is customer service so yeah"
good,staff is friendly and working in then heat is a big downfall. most of the managers are really nice. overall it is a decent place to work
good,"Benefits help to pay for tuition, and scheduling requirements help maintain a steady flow of income during school. Good place to learn valuable DIY skills that everyone should know"
good,"	Assisted and executed projects with HD Expo and Signage indirect spend totaling $3MM."
good,"This job taught me how to work in a fast pace environment. Also, it taught me how to interact with all types of different people."
good,Great company to work for. Fun working environment and great people to work with. They treat everyone with respect and fairness.
good,"Learned CAD computer program. Hours in pro-sales fit my lifestyle."
good,"Pay is great for college students, promotions are based on favoritism and who knows who. company based on the customers, tools needed to learn more are readily available"
good,Good company with a lot of opportunities. Plenty of locations and each store has about 150 employees. Benefits could be better however and the pay could be better.
good,"My typical day at work, involves walking around the store, greeting customers. Marketing our Cabinet Refacing Program, generation leads for our sales team.  "
good,"Management refused to follow up on harassment claims.  The woman made it her business to make my shift as hard as possible.  Every 2 1/2 minutes, she'd take me from my task or costumer to make me do frivolous task.  Costumers even complained about her rude and sarcastic tactics.  The manager I complained to was transferred to another store and no one else in management took the necessary steps not to lose a VERY GOOD ASSOCIATE."
good,"A typical day at work as an appliance specialist has the chance to be fun or boring, it just depends on the weather, time of day and the type of customer that we get. For me, I don't like to be idle so when we are slow, I tend to go to other departments to see if anyone needs any help. Sometimes we get backed up with calls, customers and minimal help from fellow co-workers or management. Depending on who I am working with determines how much help (if any) I receive. I enjoy helping people find what they need for their homes but it is frustrating when you spend so much time with a customer and they end up not purchasing anything. However, that is the nature of the beast when it comes to retail."
good,"Great place to work to learn some life skills. Many different departments to learn new skills. Lumber, flooring, kitchens, bathrooms plumbing etc. etc."
good,This job has it's physical demands and challenges but nothing is put on one employee more than they can bear. I enjoy the consistency in my schedule and they hours I am given.
good,Cares about your personal growth and development. Effective team. Cares about providing the highest level of customer service.
good,Good benefits that are available for all employees including part timers. Some co-workers are very enjoyable to work with.
good,"typical day at work includes unloading trucks, separating merchandise, helping customers with their needs, stocking shelves, and helping each department if needed."
good,I worked at Home Depot for a short time and it wasn't a bad job at first until I got hurt. This job mostly consisted of me gathering shopping carts in a large parking lot as well as assisted customers with loading heavy items into their vehicle. I enjoyed working there because all of my coworkers were nice and very helpful. It only got bad when I injured my back and all of the managers thought I was faking it until I had to make a lawsuit against them.
good,have to be very flexable and willing to work all hours and weekends. lots of management changes which made things hard. not as stable as I would have liked it to be
good,"Not a bad company, but certain store, certain districts make their own rules to make the money and protect their interests.  You can either stab your way to the time, remain off the radar, or dig in and hope for the best."
good,"A typical day at home depot was first hazmat, then after that take some training classes for freight. All of my co-workers were all good people and good people to learn from. The most enjoyable part of my job was really helping customers with what they was looking for to solve their problem...."
good,Working for this company was very exciting and entertaining. Learned how to operate in different positions within the company. The  hardest part of the job for me was keeping underage youth out of rated R movies without an adult.
good,Job is enjoyable. Like the responsibility of working on projects in the store and the feeling that I am making change and helping the store to make money with the execution of projects.
good,On a typical day I stock shelves throughout the store with merchandise that comes in off freight trucks. I also make sure aisles are clean and well organized for when the store opens. I help customers locate products and help load heavy products into customers vehicles. I learned how to locate products throughout the store quickly. I also learned how to read packaging labels and how to deal with a wide variety of different customers.
good,"Love talking to people  making them feel good and find items looking for! Stocking merchandise,Retail,and getting customers to apply for credit cards.I really got to learn a lot about myself such as    I thrive under pressure and I have excellent organizational skills.I love working as part of a team to accomplish what the company needs done because when the company prospers so do it's employees."
good,The Home Depot is a very typical retail big box establishment......long hours.......very busy....a lot of customers.....
good,"typical day is loading and unloading 3 trucks a night using a ride on forklift. Recieving and counting frieght, packaging frieght and seperating different products with a handheld device"
good,"This is a very aggressive sale driven environment,the company strongly believes in promoting within and it gives you an opportunity to grow and excel."
good,A typical day at work for me while working at Home Depot would be getting all customers and making sure they have what they came in for and to keep them coming Customer Service is the first key to  a happy Customer.
good,"Home depot is a fast paced, high quality, customer friendly home-improvement store.  Often co-workers are treated like family and was a delight to work for them."
good,"It's a great company and you learn values and great assets from the veteran associates and management that truly cares. Your customers are typically within the surrounding communities and neighborhoods, so they almost become like friends. The hardest part of the job would be from my experience, is the inconsistency of ownership and accountability from associates in authoritarian positions."
good,My day was very productive. Meeting and providing customer service to everyone was very rewarding. The Management and staff are very professional.
good,"Working at Home depot was a big learning experience.  You have to deal with irate customers who personally blame you for things you aren't even involved with, long hours, working holidays.  The biggest thing I learned is I prefer not to work in retail."
good,Decent work environment but can be very hectic at times. Good education on customer foibles. Some great co-workers. Some good managers --- others not so good.
good,Typical day at work would be going in doing aisle packdown and customer service. Two days of the week department associates will do pack down which means filling in empty product. There's a time in the day that associates could only take care of customers providing service. Working at the home depot is an okay job but its really hard to get full time. Sometimes you feel like they favor other people. You could be a hard worker and a new associate could get the full time you been waiting for. If you're just looking for a side job (part-time) then its a great place to work at.
good,"very interesting culture...if at an associate level, the job is great for students, or semi retired persons. if seeking a career that you want to last until retirement, ensure you apply for positions that will help you grow with the company."
good,Help customers load car and find product that they may need for there project. Management can be deficult and not willing to listen to concerns. Hardest part of the job is dealing with nasty customers and the best part was that I got to leave at a decent time of the day and still had time to spend time with my family.
good,I enjoyed helping customers with their plumbing problems. Management reduced the no. of assoc's and at closing you had to clean up several areas.
good,worked 6-8 hour shifts while being pregnant and was only allowed one bathroom break throughout the day. Management never took other peoples opinions into consideration and played favorites with other co-workers.
good,"Assist customers with setting up appointments for having flooring installed.Calculate how much flooring a customer would need, when self installing their own flooring. My co-workers are supportive, while allowing me learn and grow. The hardest part of my job is when an instalation is done incorrectly/something has happened on the jobsite I have help calm the customer and assit in fixing the situation. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I assist customers in how much material they would need, choosing corresponding colors, as well as product knowledge."
good,A typical day would to be helping customers find products they need to fix their homes or add to the yards.  Restock shelves was an everyday job.
good,"Positive employment environment for big box store."
good,"After clocking in on time I would answer phones and direct customer calls, then proceeded to write associates schedules. Sometimes I would coordinate customer install appointments with vendors and installers. After my office duties, I began to work on the floor more, helping customers and being the face of Home Depot. I searched for customers to help, and after helping any customers in my area, I then began to front face our shelves."
good,worked here twice as a seasonal/temp employee and enjoyed the time I had there. Most of the people there were fantastic and it was a fun place to work.
good,"My typical day at work would be to come in and provide excellent customer service to all customers in the store. Whether I am doing a floor sale or phone sale or cashing out customers my job at the home depot is to make sure every single customer leaves with complete satisfaction and a smile on their face and only then I know my job is completed. At the home depot I've learned the company's core values such as doing the right thing, respect for all people, building store/customer relationships, and most importantly giving exceptional customer service. The management team at the home depot are very friendly and welcoming but can not always be found when associates on the floor need help and should be more respectful when disciplining associates. Like most jobs they all have pros and cons, the hardest part about my job is opening up new home depot credit cards but the most enjoyable part about my job is being a team player and getting to work with some amazing people."
good,"don't make it a career , terrible hours and customers where extensively abusive, the bottom line if you need a job apply but if you're skilled in any sort of trade go do that"
good,"Great place to learn and grow! Low wage but able to get feet wet."
good,A call center environment that is structured with the point system. Not for those who do not like to come to work on time or want to call out on a regular basis.
good,It was a well run school.  It gave older students the ability to go back to school for courses they needed to be successful.  Outstanding learning environment.
good,"I worked in the garden dept as the live goods buyer and customer service. Ordering plants for the actual area we lived in to assure customer success was very rewarding, especially when customers would bring photos of their projects. Dealing w/ the vendors was also very educational as they were always suggesting new ways to work w/ the plants."
good,"I worked in most departments while at the Home Depot. It was enjoyable for the most part. Working returns gave me nightmares, but otherwise it was a fun job. Learned how to operate many different kinds of equipment including forklifts, cherry-pickers, motorized pallet-jacks, etc."
good,"A typical day at work is helping out customers, stocking the shelves with product, and scanning the store every night to see what inventory is missing. Great job just looking to start in new work field with a talent agency or talent management."
good,"overall I had a good time working at Home Depot. I like to be apart of a team working alongside other people. The hardest part of the job would be nonstop walking on hard concrete, eventually wore on the bottom of your feet. Most enjoyable was getting to work with a great group of people."
good,Management needs improvement in communication and treating employees better. My co workers are awesome. I'll update this later.
good,A great place to work. Made a lot of friends. Enjoyed training the cashiers and working with the customers.  Learned a lot about DIY and plants. Had good training program when I started.
good,The Home Depot Warehouse was a very productive place we stayed busy at all times and had standard working conditions and a nice work atmosphere.
good,The Blue Springs Home Depot has caring people to work with and that I get along with well. All of the cashiers under me enjoyed working under me and always looked forward to working with me.
good,I got hired for a temp job and was laid off when the job was up. I was able to get my forklift certification. Co-workers where great.
good,"Took custumers in all of their needs. "
good,"Good work environment, but not so good management. Hours and pay were good to start but got cut down quickly a couple months into starting. Assistant store manager didn't even really know what kind of work ethic I had almost six months in, assumed that I was irresponsible and was always fraternizing. After speaking with the other store employees and managers and found that I was not only an exemplary employee I son after received employee of the month but was never told about it till halfway through the month. Showed interest in becoming head of my department but was told the position wasn't available, only to wind up training a new department head myself a couple months later. Then my hours got cut down to 1 day a week. Very poor way of doing things."
good,Typical day In Building and Lumber departments can be very busy and tiring being pulled in many directions at once. It can make the day go by fast at times. More employees in departments would be very helpful.
good,"Most days were easy typical customer service days. Employees/managers were generally nice people. Best part of the day for me was getting to talk to customers, learniing what home projects they are working on."
good,Great set of managers to work under and train with. Good ability to grow with the company in the long run. Cross training available to move to other departments.
good,Fast paced and energetic place to work. option to learn all sorts of different trades. co-workers are easy to get along with as well as management when the have the time.
good,"different hours every day 6-3 or 1- 9, 9pm-5:30am. Stock selfs, talk to customers worked in all departments of the store. Pulling orders for customers, bringing carts in, picking up returns and stocking them."
good,My coworkers were fun but the 4 managers were all a piece of work. they only care about themselves and do not care about you.
good,Provided customers with prompt service and displayed excellent customer servce. Great experience with manager and orking together as a team.
good,"I was brought in to help boost sales and get customers interested in their outside services of roofing, guttering, siding etc. They had contractors working for them that would go to customer's homes and put together what the customers purchased. "
good,"A typical day at work as a Head Cashier would start by coming in and seeing what paperwork needs done, making sure that cashiers are getting their scheduled breaks, cleaning my area, and completing tasks that my front end supervisor has assigned me for that shift. I am responsible for making sure cashiers stay busy by filling pop machines around them, cleaning their areas, and pulling customers into their lines. The hardest part of the job is management. Sometimes they do not fully understand what is going on because they are not on the floor nearly as much as another person. I enjoy my co-workers and maintain a healthy work relationship with them. I have learned how to deal with different types of people whether friendly or not, always act in a professional manner. Compensation is something that could be worked on because many employees feel that they are being told to do the job of multiple people but not getting the pay for it. Overall, it is a good job for learning experience for people learning work ethic."
good,"management is a little lackadaisical, I have learned how to deal with high stress environments ,co- workers are a pleasure , department worker very lazy"
good,In charge of making sure all associate are providing great customer service. Giving assigned tasked to every associate in department on what has to be done thru out the day.Getting paper work done in regards to shrink on department. I have learned that running your own business takes a lot of commitment and hard work. The hardest part of this job was trying to make up list on tasks due to the department was well maintained. Filled with a lot of great associate.
good,"It was alright. Very understaffed, and poorly managed. Good Associates that have taught me a lot of things with in the store. Showed me that it wasn't all bad, was there for a little over a year, and had fun while it lasted."
good,WAY underpaid for the amount of technical knowledge you need to know to successfully help customers.  Home Depot does not set up sales associates for success as they do not require ANY knowledge of the departments.  If youre the person you knows what they are doing YOU are doing all the work while others are getting paid just as much as you are for sitting around and pointing EVERY customer with a question in your direction. In my opinion its unfair.
good,"A day at this warehouse was simple, you went to work unloaded trucks or picked any order they told you to then you left. The hardest part of the job was the pace. It was definitely challenging."
good,I currently work for home depot. It ha been a good experience thus far. I really enjoy working with the customers and getting to meet new people. I would recommend this company to others. They even have health benefits for part time employees.
good,"Great company. Great place to learn patience, problem solving skills, and manager skills. Very fast pace. Required great patience and customer service skills."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to better my associates and take care of my customer's. My passion is customer service and serving diverse communities.
good,Great work place for meeting meeting people and developing social skills. Shift hours are little of inconvenience however very flexible with time off . Mangers and co workers are friendly and willing to assists whenever they are available to do so.
good,"Provided services and assistance to 100+ customers on a day-to-day basis. Handled high volumes of cash and other forms of payments such as credit cards, checks, etc. Made important decisions while working in a fast paced work environment. Monitored and recorded inventory for coca cola products, accessories, gas, and supplies"
good,"Easy job, gets a bit boring because there is not much to do at times, everyone is nice, but there seems to not be enough motivation."
good,Fun place to work at with enjoyable people to be around. The hardest part of a job is restocking but others wise very fun working with the customer
good,"A typical day consisted of helping customers with product knowledge, special orders and transactions. "
good,"I've learned a lot about customer service and being passionate about assisting people. Management could be better, and the stores morale needs to be improved drastically."
good,it was very fun to work for home depot specially the management and the schedule of work according to your time and experience .....
good,It is a good place to work. I enjoying working there for the most part. It was challenging trying to convince customer's to listen to your sales pitch.
good,"This is not a great full time job, more of a starter job or a good pt job to make some extra money. Training and pay are minimum."
good,"Simple day unload truck, place product into assigned bays, Learned quit a bit about Garden, management was very nice and motivational also co workers, love the feel of job"
good,"I greet customers. I help them find product locations. I assess charges and collect payments. "
good,The only problem I had with this company is the excessive training. I sat in front of a computer in total for almost a week. That doesnt include the hands on training. There were many times I would have to sit a computer to do more training on my 15 minute breaks just to keep up with all the extra training that was added every month. I thought the amount of training was a little too excessive for even the simplest position offered.
good,"The opportunities at this job were great, but the training is pretty poor at the job. The experience I had nobody really wanted to take the time to train one on one. The only training I really recieved from there  was from a computer program that only explained things and showed examples."
good,Home Depot is nice place to work.The employees and customers are friendly and keep your day going.The managers do as much as they can to keep the customers and employees happy. The wages are not that great which is the only complaint I really have with this company.
good,The management is is pretty cool for the most part and the most enjoyable part of the job is to celebrate holidays set up for customers and the co workers sometime can be abit pushy but other than that they pretty good to you if u know alot better
good,Enjoyed working and learned a lot of things about home repair. the company offers many opportunities to learn how to fix things.
good,The managers are good they work as well as have a good time but get the work done the store could be much better with some more discipline but its not cared about cause they make lot of sales due to their location and the brand.
good,"decent company, good benefits not enough full time positions. poor execution of customer service values. no career advancement employees waiting years to just achieve full time much less promoted,"
good,"I always learn from my past. I do my best to keep people around me happy and excited when it comes to business or outside. Sales and reaching goals are things that I always enjoy doing because there is no such thing as ""impossible"" to me. I am self-motivitated person."
good,"They should pay bilingual people more. The management is good and the job culture is good, but you can't make a living unless you are a manager."
good,"Not a very good work to personal life ratio, always demanding more and never seem to be satisfied."
good,"Overall a great company for what they do. I would say the only bad thing about this job was the low pay and lack of benefits. The culture was great, and the job was very stress free."
good,"A typical day at work usually depends on the time of day and day of week. Sometimes, the days are fun and interesting and other days are boring and bland. I say this because I am a cashier and I'm confined to one space. I like to move around and interact with people, but this job position will not allow me to."
good,Hard day of work. Palatalize all different types of product of all different types of weights and sizes. Wrap the pallets in plastic and close them out using an RF gun.
good,"great job the location was just a issue, it's down the street from valhalla jail & no constant public transportation around the way."
good,I mostly enjoyed the customer and employee interaction daily. I enhanced my customer service and multi tasking skills.  My most enjoyable moments were satisfying my customers.
good,A great job to get started into the workforce. You learn a lot about customer service and what it really means. Besides helping customers with their needs you have to do what management tells you to do.
good,a great place to work and adapt a do it yourself attitude.do you know how to snake a drain?the right size blade to cut through plywood?The Home Depot taught me that.
good,"Home Depot is an interesting company to work for. They have been very slow to grow, improve or make a bold statement as a retailer, however they continue to hold strong market share thanks in part to their niche in the home improvement industry."
good,"I enjoyed Home depot for the most part,but it had no room for career advancement.A typical day at work is a long 9 hour shift.Ive learned that management will not always be leaders at workplace.My co workers were very enjoyable and we became like a family."
good,"typically I will come in to work and go the service desk, check orders in, call customers, check deliveries and will call cage, process returns and refunds, set up orders and assist with money handling. I have learned that I am very come in a fast paced environment and am able to excel. everyone on the home depot team is helpful and knowledgeable. the hardest part about my job is there is not enough time in one work day to fulfill the duties at hand. the most enjoyable part of this job is the experience itself."
good,"needs more employee services, such as employee discounts events etc... management needs better training ...good employee base nice people to work with"
good,"great people, long hours, ok benefits, constant change in management makes it difficult to work smoothly amongst others. A lot of politics/gossip as with other big box retailers."
good,"Learn a lot about tools, good learning opportunity about leadership and management. The most enjoyable part of the job you got to meet a different type of people."
good,"This company is a very productive company, with good management and co-workers. As many other retails stores you work 10 times harder that what you get pay for. The good part is that you do get a great feeling from helping others and getting great compliments."
good,"A typical day at work; call center environment. form your own conclusions. Compensation was nice, and the benefits. Nice environment, and good culture. They recognize their employees doing a good job."
good,Provides the ability to move within the company to further your experience and knowledge. Good benefits. Driven for great customer experiences.
good,This company is a good place to work if you can handle dealing with customers on a daily basis. It can get very busy and overwhelming for some people. Due to being a retailer with a main focus on customer service you will work late and early hours and almost every single weekend. it can some times be hard to manage your home life around your weird work schedule. As you move up with the company the stress level increases more than the pay scale.
good,At times a fun place to work and grow from others. I enjoyed working with my coworkers and completing tasks that need to be done before the day is over.
good,"long days, time goes super slow, dealing with rude customers, working for minimum wage when selling customers huge orders, bosses often are under qualified and unhelpful"
good,The Home Depot provides a very stable job and provides a lot of space to learn and grow. You will meet a lot of interesting people which helps great a fun environment.
good,"Worked part time, after Christmas, worked only 10 hours a week, which only covered the insurance, not a bad job overall."
good,"The Home Depot is a huge store where we deal with the customer's, constructor workers, and vendors on a regular basis. I've learned that providing a great customer service and knowing the customer needs is a key. During the time I was working, the management changed a few times but the sole purpose of the store was the same, putting customers first. The challenge of the job was dealing with the angry customers and customers asking for the product we don't carry in the store. However, working at the Home Depot was overall good and the events such as cashier appreciation month, cashier Olympic, and Christmas celebrations are the fun part."
good,My experience at home depot was a learning experience and made me want more out of life. It was my first job after having my daughter and I was grateful for it. Its a good part time job.
good,I began my typical day at work by helping the customer with any questions that they may have had. I also gave them advice on how to best use the materials that Home Depot provided. I gave them new ideas on how to do something better and I advised them on how to save money and time. When I was working here I learned that customers required constant attention so that I could answer any question they may have had. My co-workers were ver focused on what they had to do and I constantly helped them and they helped me too. The most difficult part was when there was an excess of people at the store that needed help and I was trying to help everyone by myself. I enjoyed that I was able to receive more profit and help my family economically.
good,"This has been the most motivating experience to keep my head up through rough times and never giving up.  The reward was meeting the diverse collection of associates and members involved with this location.  Everyone had something to offer as a team, never will I regret such an opportunity given to me and I will always remember the sincerity I received.  Keeping in mind the unfortunate event that occurred about two months ago due to a loss of an associate, everyone has come back strong, refocused on the duty to provide for the working public and I couldn’t be more proud of a job well done."
good,Change has been good with this company and a lot of change in transportation department which has proven beneficial.  It is a good place to be with room to grow
good,"generally you are pushing carts but if a customer needs loading assistance you must stop what activity you are involved in and go help them. Often we are understaffed and improperly scheduled so a large load is dropped one person. That tends to become a difficult task when your lot is filled with carts, your a steadily being called for loading then some customer ask you a question and you must help them while trying to do the things required of you. Co Workers will ask you to stop and help them but when you finish assisting everyone there are carts still in parking lot that havent been brought in and carts must stay full to accomodate new customers. The people are the most enjoyable part of the job, employees I mean for the most part and management team is very friendly. Not necessarily a hard part to the job it is just a bit frustrating juggling so many things and trying to meet expectations but your wages make it hard to keep food on the table, gas to get to work etc."
good,"Everyday is something new, there is not a day that is the same in Home Depot. The work can be challenging, but co- workers can make the environment fun."
good,"I learned to not follow the manager around the store like the other employes, I always smile so I kept that even though the working with co workers and the management wasn't very pleasant."
good,The Homedepot location I work at is okay not the best but okay. on some days its great working there love the customers. and on other days its complete choas
good,"Look for customers and other co workers who needed help, sweep, collect carts, throw away trash. I learned more customer service, and more information on different types of products. Management could of been better. Like half of the co-workers are nice and friendly and the other half don't even acknowledge you. Hardest part of the job I would say is lifting heavy objects and the most enjoyable part of the job was learning more information on the products that they sell."
good,I learned how to run self check out. I have helped out with putting candy and drinks out every day. I also did self checkout and cash register as well. I work in a team environment where everyone has fun with each other.
good,"This was only a temporary position, but I learned a lot from everyone there and had there been an opportunity for a full time, regular job with room for advancement, I would have stayed there."
good,The Home Depot is a good company to work for. Management is not the best. I worked for 3 different Dep (in corporate) and all three was bad. The company gives you decent pay (in corporate) and great benefits.
good,"At work I would be welcomed by many fellow co-workers before going to my shift. During my shift, I would have to lift heavy boxes and stock lots of items. On weekends, I would have to assist other fellow associates. The managers always came around every so often to observe my work ethic and offer help, which is never a problem for me. The hardest part of my job at Home Depot was labeling items high on the ladder because I am only 5' 2"", and wasn't able to reach few boxes, but I was able to find an associate who was willing to help me correct the issue. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know new people including customers and all the projects they work on. I learned to become more social, and I've stocked so much that I could direct people to the correct department to find exactly what they are looking for."
good,busy but that is good coworker wise yeah not that great at times. learned new things I have never done before on a few things
good,I really enjoyed working at Home depot. it was a fast pace work environment that kept me busy. I also learned how to package inventory before it went out to customers.
good,The Home Depot work environment was never anything less than exceptionally productive. I'd have to say in my opinion the most enjoyable part of my day was assisting customers to the best of my ability and making sure the department I supervised was kept up to par.
good,I had some fun working at Home Depot just some of the coworkes where not to freindly as some but other wise its A ok place to work if you like working with tools I am not to much a fan of people who are mean and dont show respect for others.
good,the callers would always say negetive things about the brand and that they wanted to speak to someone who knew what they were talking about. even though the were just giving employees a hard time.
good,I loved Home depot it was a fun place to work.  Then new Distract Manager came in and changed that.  He had to cut costs and the one area he hit was long-term employees
good,"Responsible for keeping goods stocked and tidy in the Seasonal department. Answered questions regarding product information. Learned about outdoor furniture and gardening product brands."
good,I enjoyed working at Home Depot. I loved helping customers with their home improvement projects and helping them find what they needed.
good,We would build things for kids on Saturday it was called kids work shop.we would have food and games.we would aslo give away turkey on thanksgiving day.
good,Although the people who work here are amazingly caring and kind but if you work part time you pretty much get forgotten about and over looked. The hours are constantly cut and you cannot survive on these hours. A lot of favoritism going on and no opportunities to work in other departments even though you may get pulled to other areas to assist customers.
good,"After given the daily goal for the day it's a fast past effort to gather the customers product to be shipped out. I've learned to work quickly, efficiently, and safely. I've acquired license to operate all of the various warehouse equipment like forklifts, reach trucks, electric pallet jacks, and order pickers ext.....  Although the warehouse worker may have individual jobs, we would still be working together to get the customers orders out. The hardest part of the job is trying to get the job done and the equipment has mechanical problems. The most enjoyable part of the job is as long as your doing your job know one bothers you."
good,overall great company and great team members. I loved the team I was part of. But sometimes senior level management did not help us as best as they could.
good,helping customers with there questions and help with products to do remodels at there home or business. Learned a lot about how to manage people and products.
good,"Interacting with customers and helping them with merchandise, I learned plenty about home improvements and money handling. The job was quite fun."
good,Retail work is never fun. Management is a joke. The most enjoyable part of the job was the coworkers. They're what made the job worth it.
good,"Learned new selling techniques and how to sell major appliances. Management was good and coworkers were friendly. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking with customers and creating rapport, made my day go by faster"
good,I learned a lot about what it is to be a working man. The overall experience wasn't bad I just wasn't used to having a job. The management wasn't terrible but not great either. It definitely taught me a lot about what it is to work.
good,A typical day within this environment is to provide swift checkout service to customers at register and ensure the highest quality customer service experience.
good,"I have worked at Home Depot for almost 10 years and in that 10 years there has been quite a few management changes. There were 5 different store managers and I can't count the amount of assistant managers that have gone through that store. I have learned quite a bit I have been a cashier, hardware, tool rental, paint. I'm currently a Special Services associate with knowledge of the RTV system."
good,Learned alot while so far. not alot to go off of haven't been there very long.So far so good. Good days and bad days like anywhere else.
good,many for people that are looking for retail position and no field work. need to really possess customer service skills and have a high energy level to sell
good,the consistency of the management was not there. overall good place to work .  it was great to be outdoors during the summer months.
good,"The employees at Home Depot are very helpful, and work well as a team. I enjoyed working here and I am looking forward to using the customer service skills I learned to continue in my specific career."
good,It was great working at the Home Depot. Great employees and people. But the management would be a bit unfair sometimes. They would just be disrespectful at times it seemed.
good,"The hours weren't so great sometimes. It was hard to move up in the company, even if you were willing to do more work to show you wanted it.  I started off as cashier and moved to returns, then lot attendant and loader. It honestly beat just standing there waiting for people to come to you to check out. More rules are made about staying so close to your register, that it just gets ridiculously boring. My experience might differ from others though."
good,"Its ok working here, it would be better if the managers listened to the employees, And not just care about themselves. Scheduling, etc."
good,"A typical day at work would be a bust day so I won't feel how the time  went by. Helping customers, management, and co-workers would be the routine daily tasks. Harder the challenge, more fun to deal with and solve, that would be the most enjoyable part of the job when serving customers."
good,Cannot live on the starting pay. You must advance to a assistance manager for a livable wage. Difficult to get 40 hours per week.
good,"The home depot is a good place to work.  The down side to me would have to be the pay; however, it is better than I have seen elsewhere."
good,"take care customer every day to meet they needs,drive reach truck to put freight away.take care customers that only speak spanish because i am bilingual."
good,I Didn't Like Anything About This Job At All The Supervisors Were Terrible As Well As The Store As A Whole. The Computer System Never Had What You Needed When Checking Out A Customers So You Always Had To Get Out Of Line To Walk A Find What You Needed Which Leads To A Long Line Of Angry And Impatient Customers
good,My typical day was helping people on the sales floor with appliances.  That was 14 years ago so to write a review on day to day is hard to remember but it was not a difficult job.
good,"Depot was a fast paced job in a busy town during a boom of growth."
good,"A typical day at The Home Depot usualy started T 5:30 am. Co-workers were always great, and a fun place to always work. Management was always fair and supportive of advancement."
good,"Overall a decent company to work for.  The hardest part of the job is trying to figure out your responsibilities without first being properly trained to company standards.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when you have a good team of co-workers working towards the same goal, to take care of the customer and get the job done."
good,"Cashier Job Description Position Purpose:"
good,"You start out in one of our stores as an associate, but with a demonstrated knowledge and interest in a specific area, plus  product knowledge training and individual development programs, you could rise to specialist, department supervisor and into store management. And that’s just one path your retail career at The Home Depot could take."
good,fun summer job and work with great people and made a lot of friends working there. Also very good with working with my school schedule
good,"If you're going to work at The Home Depot, work during the day.  Working at night isn't what is used to be and people who work graveyard shift are no longer treated with respect.  Recently, the upper management raised the pay to $10.25/hour so you'll have to decide if that's worth being treated like garbage."
good,"Although I did not agree with the management team and their lack of professionalism, my coworkers were very nice and easy to get along with."
good,"Home Depot is know as a big important worldwide company, not the best deals in construction materials."
good,"Report to work and assess the workload for this shift and plan accordingly to produce as many positive results and move as much volume as time will allow. How to manage and lead team members and produce results while coaching, developing, and working safely. Limited communication with management and lack of accountability. Great group with the crew I work with directly. Hardest part of the job is trying to implement changes and accountability in a uniform team manner to get more done and not having the support from management to make those changes. Most enjoyable time is working directly with my unit."
good,"I learned a lot while I quickly climbed the retail ladder and my boss was the best I have ever had, it was very flexible with my school schedule as well and offered great benefits, Lowes pays more though."
good,"i learned how to interact with customers whether they are in a good mood or bad mood, i learned how to always put them first in an any situation at the store and i learned how to handle my money better."
good,"I would recommend this company to students or those who need part time work. As a cashier, the hours were compatible with my life outside work. It is highly beneficial to work in a department such as seasonal or lumber."
good,"It tends to be busy during the summer, learnt a lot about common tool. The management is pretty good. Certain co-workers are good to work with, some are not."
good,"this was a great job! I had a lot of fun, and would be willing to go back and work there anytime! Best job I have ever had. management was awesome so was the staff"
good,"The company has good opportunities to learn about the home improvement industry.  Starting pay is good for an entry level job, however the company doesn't seem to value experience and will pay the same wage to everyone.  Schedules are erratic from week to week which makes it difficult to have a balanced life.  Management delegates too much responsibility to lower personnel with out due compensation.  The company uses outdated technologies to manage their inventory.  "
good,Very nice working experience. I became knowledgable with a lot of the merchandise and products. My co workers was very fun to work with. Management was very professional and nice.
good,"Summer job while away visitng family.  Enjoyed working with co-workers and learning new skills."
good,"clock in and go to the department, management needs to be more skillful and be more communicative with employees. Hardest part of the job being working with co workers that are lazy or rude. Enjoyable part it was interaction with customers"
good,it was a good place to work but i understand its getting worse. Its a good retail job. I would work there again if I had to. Management adds a lot of stress to the job...... and don't mispunch the time clock
good,expensive healthcare. very bad communication. management never on the same page with other leaders or associates. co-workers very nice and friendly
good,I would usually come in at 6 am and then i would have to make phone calls to customers that paid for their items but haven't picked them up. Then around 8 am the online orders would come in and we had to pull them and put them behind the service desk. While assisting customers with store problems.
good,customer service can be overwhelming but overall its ok to work here but if you have kids its kind of a lot because there are no set hours
good,"Low wages to start and average increases. Hours are full time or part time. It is what one would expect from large Corp structure, attempts to please everybody while not actually pleasing most."
good,"there is always something to do, yet the older co-workers are very helpful for you to learn the ropes."
good,Home Depot is the perfect job for anyone just starting out. They have cookouts and fun activities every now and again. You are able to advance in any position that you get.
good,"Home Depot was a good company to work for although the concrete floor does wear and tear on your body. You learn a lot about home improvement, gardening, and many other skills. Thy offer extensive training on products and services."
good,hardest part of the job is dealing with the customers who can very verbally abusive. They try to make it as positive of a workplace as possible.
good,"I learned how to research products, find availability in another store and to purchase it for customer pick up. Co-workers for the most part were very helpful. The hardest part of the job was pleasing the customers because at the end of the day that's the main aim, and also to have customers leaving the store feeling happy with their purchases.The most enjoyable part of the job was having your customers leave feeling satisfied, and knowing that you accomplished your goal of pleasing and helping them to make the right purchase. It was a great feeling to hear them say see you soon because then you know that they'll be back."
good,"As a Cashier at The Home Depot, my responsibly was manage cash register operations by processing sales quickly, accurately and efficiently; maintain excellent customer service; and safeguard company assets."
good,"Typical day at work was always busy on assisting customers and salespersons concerns. sell more products to reach everyday quota."
good,"Work days at home depot are always unpredictable.  You could be working a morning shift one day and a closing shift the next or visa versa.  The only thing truly consistent was helping customers and keeping your area clean as possible.  "
good,"Great place to work. Responsibilities include managing staff of three millworks specialist, designing and ordering of special order doors and windows, maintaining in-house inventory, enforcing strict organizational guidelines. Maintain excellent customer service and communication skills. Provide informal and formal performance-based feedback and consult with Human Resources on hiring/firing duties."
good,"Great casual atmosphere.  Onsite, knowledgeable professionals. Good hours. Good work/life balance.  Good benefits."
good,"Working at home depot was okay, not the best job, most of the people are friendly. The job is easy, I worked over night part time."
good,"I like working for this company it was always something to do for me there, I believe the customers/co-workers there are some of the best I have meet thus far."
good,I still enjoy the people I work with.  Miscommunication is a little too widespread for my liking.  I have made lifelong friends and met awesome people.
good,"A typical work day at The Home Depot consists of lots of attention to the specifics of my job description. So therefore i stand a lot communicate with customers to a certain extent since i am a merchandiser. Service the bays within the aisles, made sure items on shelves and peg hooks are restocked, price tags were changed and items were presentable. I learned how to check what we have in stock and if already have items ordered and shipped to the store with Motorola phones. The management at home depot was alright there needed to be more order within the store. My coworkers were very social and kind. the hardest part of my job is when we are behind and i am forced to work alone while others do nothing. The most enjoyable part of my job when we are actually caught up on our weekly set goal."
good,"you learn new things daily, you meet new people. you learn new trades and professions, and you become a do it yourself hands on worker even outside of work."
good,The work was fine but the managers were selfish and only considered their raises. There is room for growth but you have to be willing to put in 20 years.
good,"Co-workers are very humble and helpful. The typical day for me would be to cashier, help customers find products, and leave customers with a positive impression of the company."
good,An okay place to work some times have problem getting answers or finding someone that can answer a question for you.  Some mangers don't know what they are doing.
good,"Nice place work, very demanding though. On a typical day you are on your feet for 8 hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was all you learned."
good,"I will not be writting a review about this workplace. However, out of a 10 i'll give it a 4 stars. That's just me though. I know some people who love it."
good,typical retail work environment. very profitable company with limited employee perks. wide variety of jobs available and average pay rate with benefits.
good,"I am presently employed to a building contruction company under agency. My work here as a Section Head Cashier made me experience to improved my leadership skills, and ability to work in a team environment as well as gives me more knowledge in handling  customer service  but i am not limited to this. I am involved in assisting the needs of cashier, monitoring cashiers performance and giving a beyond expectation quality customer service as well as presenting a good impression to the company I am working with."
good,"Lot of friendly people, Management horrible, they weren't specific with their goals and always give you stuff to do that takes quiet a while to do when you have 10 minutes on the clock"
good,"	Stocked merchandise onto shelves to achieve 100% in stock."
good,"I worked in the paint section, mixing colors. I also worked in the garden section selling lawn mowers and helping people whit there landscaping. I help people place big orders of brick, tale, wood, carpet, cement, paint, wire, and also helped customer come up whit solutions for fixing or remodeling things in there home."
good,Bad management and very dishonest people. Don't go there the only positive about being there was the friendships that were created.
good,"MET is special in the company. Good schedule, no weekend work. However, the whole thing operates on the fact that the Home Depot has undercut vendor reps in order to create MET. You do the work of previous vendors that made twice as much and had a company vehicle. It's hard work. Lots of diagrams, computer skills, manual labor, flexibility, so many SOPs. We're doing the work of $18/hr employees, but for a starting pay of $9.50. Not cool. Expectations are ridiculous. Management is composed of incompetent control freaks and sickening sycophants. Everyone is sleeping with everyone. Company culture is stagnant... unless you're a 60 year old part time retiree, then I guess it's fun. If you're smart and 20 something, it's just annoying. Raises are a joke, annually $0.24. Benefits are good though. Advancement isn't possible unless you join the clique and brown nose everyone. It's definitely high school in most of the stores."
good,"Would go to the hardware department merchandise product in all the bays.  Reset bays to new planograms as required.  Work with the Home Depot associates. Management would call if something special needed to get done.  Other than that you were left to do the job by yourself.  Only had co-workers on the reset team, not more than 3.  Hardest part was moving around the heavy beams and product.  Best part was the travel."
good,"G by Guess is a clothing store that is in the dolphin mall, which is very good for working during seasons of Christmas, New Year and Thanksgiving because everybody buys and its located in a mall which they are many tourist."
good,"Waking up at 3 am to start work for 4 am. Lifting heavy objects/boxes and restocking store. Also operated heavy machinery and pump trucks."
good,"Good company, good benefits, they work around your schedule, good hours, just don't get involved with the drama with the employees and you're good"
good,"Home Depot is very customer service oriented. I learned a lot as far as that is concerned. The training for the departments isn't very detailed, so it was tough to help customers without knowledge of the product or store."
good,"apertura se realiza  el conateo de caja general, se entregan fondos al departamento de cajas, revision de correos pendientes de oficinas, captura de valores recibidas en caja general, pendientes de tel conmutador realizacion de balance general,  captura de facturas pedidos de pago, compras y constantemente de valores y realizacion de depositos efectivo y recibimiento de  transferencias electronicas, aprendi a trabajar bajo presion  proactiva, a resolver variaciones y habilidad numerica, trabajar en equipo y en armonia con mis compañeros,  lo mas dificil poder lograr un buen equipo de trabajo trabajar en conjunto, lo que mas me gusto es lo administrativo poder realizar varios trabajos a la vez  manejo de efectivo atencion a clientes"
good,"pay was good,co corkers worked well with each other,hours were flexible had enough people to cover if you were sick or could not come in for some reason."
good,and just don't. it's not worth it by any means. just be real and don't do it. I am only writing this longer because it is making me. Apparently there is a 20 word minimun.
good,The training for new associates has started to go down hill and the companies structure has gone with it as well. One of the things the company allows its associates to do is to empower them to take care of the customer.
good,"No commitment to their associates and management team.  Home Depot has a rule of three to their review periods, one is moving up, one is staying in position, and one is moving out.  You will see that in their management teams their is a great deal of turnover through this policy.  As a manager you will find if you are not moving up you are moving out.  They really don't care about their associates as a company.  At the associate level can be a great experience with a good management team though, because a good team at a store level does show appreciation, just don't expect it from a corp side."
good,"It was a pleasant work environment I enjoyed the daily interactions with co-workers and customers.The hardest part of the job was not being able to locate customers merchandise in a timely manner."
good,"Offrant un bel environnement de travail basé sur une forte diversité culturelle, la compagnie home depot se démarque par la qualité de son service à la clientèle et  affiche une roue de valeurs convenable."
good,"It was enjoyable but not enough hours provided."
good,"This job was at the least boring. nothing to do and a very slow location at that. not a whole lot going on. few new customers, typically usuals."
good,"Home depot was a  fun place. I adore helping others, and  home depot was all about that. I cleaned, help clients who walk in the store and learned about differernt departments."
good,"Working at the Home Depot was the hardest job I'd ever had.  Physically it was taxing.  I enjoyed my freedom as a Project Specialist being able to walk the store visiting with customers and finding out what they were looking for and what their projects were but even with good shoes, it was very hard on my body."
good,It was a pretty great job. Pay was not the best but they just increased it making it a really solid paying job. some members of management couldn't take advise form associates causing more work or making it less efficient. the job itself is really simple and easy. almost anybody who puts a real effort can do the job asked.
good,"I would get a call and got install several computers and a service at a store, Normally one or two stores a day. This was an on call contract, each day I would get a call about which store to go to and the location"
good,"Cleaning, and managing tools, showing customers how to operate equipment, create and process rental agreements, create and process sales, and repairs"
good,Learned basic home improvement skills and tools needed to complete these tasks. Learned customer service skills from a well put together management team
good,I enjoyed working with this company. I was only summer help. I worked in the garden department the must and enjoyed being outside.
good,"go in put on apron and clock in . water plants ,push all shopping carts to front to make available to all customers. learned how to make keys and a lot about different plants.Co workers were all unique and great people.Hardest part of job was probably all the heavy lifting during the summer to help customer.Most enjoyable part was meeting all the people and knowing and hearing about their future creations."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is being with my co workers. They are amazing. The hardest part of my job is not being able to move around the store. I came from a serving job, were standing around was frowned upon. I am also used to a fast paced environment."
good,Prologistix is a staffing agency.  A good place to start when looking for temporary work.
good,Management was not able to work with certain concerns.  Co workers were great.  Overall a fun place to work at and customers were always nice.
good,"Its  a very good experience to work at Tata consultancy services, had fun."
good,Home Depot is a very well organized company and I thoroughly enjoyed working there.
good,"working at home depot taught me so many things, starting with patience and understanding people more.  a typical day at my job was basically me conversing with my customers leaving their shopping experiences with and smiling and wanting them to come back for more. management was challenging at times but also very understanding, my coworkers and I were like a close knit family we work great together and always look out for each other. the only challenging thing about my job was moving constantly from department to department it was most overwhelming but also a good thing to be versatile."
good,pretty good job to work.. good managers.. supervisors are great! really good company to work for...
good,"Confer with customers by telephone or in person to provide information about products or services, take or enter orders, cancel accounts, or obtain details of complaints. Check to ensure that appropriate changes were made to resolve customers' problems.

good,The people were amazing.  The hours needed to be longer and the pay higher.
good,"co-workers are great to work with, management is  not very strong, I learn to multitask and constantly give excellent customer service, most enjoyable part of the job is establishing relationships with customers"
good,"Fast paced, dynamic never a dull moment, associates and management easy to get along."
good,"Job is decent, you get to meet a lot of people and help a lot of customers, times throughout the year you are able to pick up a lot of extra hours. Wasn't  much opportunity to become fulltime and make more hourly. Overall a great job to save some income while going to school, pay a few bills and build the experience."
good,daily interactions and helping customers was very enjoyable. cashing out my drawer at the end of the night and making sure it was balanced.
good,I had multiple responsibilities there and I enjoyed it but it got slow at times and difficult but I still loved the experience over all.
good,"Good place to work for. They have some nice sites to work at, benefits are ok, and additional training and room for advancement is available for those interested in improving their office skills"
good,Loved working with money and helping with store reports and maintenance. Enjoyed working with customers and learning new things regarding home improvement.
good,"Each day, start out with a game plan with your Sup.or Mgr. There will always be changes to your original list of tasks, so be flexible!  Customer Service is #1. That includes selling the merchandise, retrieving it from over head(utilizing machinery), loading merchandise in cust. vehicle. Be prepared to work in every dept. I enjoyed the diversity of the job.I truly enjoyed my co-worker's. The most difficult part was reaching a member of management in a crisis.Also, having to deal with several assistant manager's with different solutions to issues."
good,"Fun  co-workers/managers, very active job, learned a lot of departments in the store"
good,"i would have productive days at work, im a fast learner, and i get along with my co-works"
good,Stressful and demanding job with way to many bosses telling you what to do. They were semi safety conscious but equipment that was recommended for repair never got repaired. I was offered supervisor position but isn't worth it for the little more money offered.
good,It was hardwork but i loved it.Co-workers made it very competitive.But overall one of the best jobs ive had.
good,"They are not a bad company to work for, but they do not always stick with they plan on doing."
good,"The hardest part they don't pay enough but if they did I would work there. The environment is great."
good,Loved working with tools and learning new skills for home improvement.
good,"Kind of not so good really. No employee discount. Minimum wage to start and no hours. Co-workers are ok, the usual mix of people. Max raise offered was 16 cents."
good,Its great working at the home depot. I enjoy getting to meet friendly faces and helping customers out. All the other employees are very friendly and they are always there to help. But sometimes working here has its ups and downs. There are times when someone gets scheduled by them selves in their department for the whole day.its really stressing when theres a lot of people calling u at once. And the pay is not that good. Other than that everything else is great.
good,its ok to work there short term or its good for students but not for a long term unless you are gona stick it out threw thick and thin and deal with the attitude of some of the negative and lazy people  working there  and bad mouthing the store
good,"Fast paced work environment, exceptional team members that you wanted to work with."
good,"the best thing about working at home depot as a part timer is there is benefits for part timers as well, which include 401k, stock, dental, and vision. customers make the store operate which means building a relationship is key in the paint department."
good,"Its a decent environment with decent workers"
good,This particular company really requires the drive of customers and their experience. Its a okay place to work not necessary to retire from.
good,"This job included the normal cashier duties. Some other unique things on the job would be measuring boards, knowing the size of washers, and knowing the size of different screws, nuts, and bolts."
good,"1. Being switched around from garden, regular cash register, self check out and returns and trying to sell credit."
good,"i done fright and receiveing for 5 years at homedepot unloaded trucks"
good,"As a specialty sales representative, I was responsible for understanding all aspects of store procedure, flooring and decor  and installation process, and maintaining show room appearance. My duties also included generating leads and following up with customers and installers and building customer's quotes."
good,"I enjoyed my co-workers, they made a long work day easily manageable."
good,"Its been a while since I've worked at The Home Depot, but from what I remembered I really like how the pace of this job works. I am a fast pace worker and I like to get things done on time. There is always a lot going on in this store especially at the returns desk where I was mostly at. "
good,I have a full time position which is rare in retail.  I enjoy meeting new people and seeing my returning customers who know me by name.  My day is very busy so it goes by fast.   I have learned so much about the construction business and have learned to appreciate what my customers go through on a day to day basis on their jobs.
good,At times you could get in trouble for others blaming you for things. Supivisor and Manager's wanting the world from you. The hardest part of the job is dealing with manager's. The co-workers are good people. Managment is nice at first. I learned that not every person will help you if they have the time. The most enjoyable part of the job is having customers ask for you directly when they come in.
good,Constantly on the road meeting with customers ensuring  that their projects are being installed to their satisfaction. I learned that your customers can only make you better at your craft. Hands off management as long as you made your sales and took care of your customers. My co-workers came and left. It was a high turnover organization where either you had it when you came there or you left because your skill set could not support your lifestyle. The hardest part of this job was receiving your pay in a timely manner.  You could not verify your commissions until pay day and then you had to wait for pay corrections to be applied. I met new people that I could assist constantly. Friendly sales competitions were great also.
good,"Start the morning off with some quick stretches, then have a brief meeting on what was expected for that day. I learned a lot about merchandising and working in a retail warehouse, also learned how to manage my time as well as meet deadlines. My co-workers were great very fin people to talk to. Hardest part of the job would be reseting and impossible bay. Most enjoyable part was the breaks when wed play basketball or ping pong."
good,"The people I worked with were the ones that kept me there, otherwise the management took advantage of me often."
good,No challenges.To many applications.. Big SAP shop and Siebel shop
good,"Generally a pretty good place to work, managers and supervisors are understanding towards your situation and thus you can be civil about approaching them. However they always push for you to sell credit cards regardless of who you are and what depart you work at so watch out for that."
good,It was fun.  I got to meet new people everyday. The job was close to the house.
good,"good company"
good,Tasking and trying to handle various customer projects throughout the store
good,working there i learned new things and co workers were nice to work with hours were reasonable and everything was mainly stocking and restocking . hardly associated with costumers. i learned to do my forklifting and had oppurtunities to learn things and use machinery
good,Very high paced and detailed to customer service at a high degree. Education in small home improvement issues. Great atmosphere of coworkers.
good,Work can either be fun or challenging depending on how many people are working that day. If it is under staffed consider having yourself a night mare.
good,"Buena empresa de gobierno. Que tenia el fin de capturar todas aquellas actas de naciemiento que no estaban actualizadas, ni dadas de alta en un sistema, mismo que permitiría tener esas actas registradas y no estar buscandolas entre el montos de libros viejos. Afortunadamente ya todo eso esta en orden."
good,I love it its a great place to work you meet people from all walks of life.my co workers are great well the few I actually associate with the management is all good I haven't meant one I didn't like.
good,The home Depot is a great company too work for but management is not the best. They don't acknowledge you when you are at your best just when you are at your worst. They pick favorite's and give management too employees that do not have the experience yet and that only just brown nose.
good,I would recomded working their for anyone that wants  a small part time job
good,"The people there are wonderful, but they diffidently have clicks. Be careful who you are reporting to management, in fact avoid management and just contact the awearline (or it could backfire, resulting with your job on the line)."
good,"No major problems really.  Do your job, and do it well and work will be smooth.  There will always be rough days where ever you'll work, but HD is very tolerable.  Most of the coworkers are friendly once you put the time in, and show consistency."
good,"Stock Merchandise and Customer Service"
good,"In order to service the region, a personal was required. Could not benefit from the job due to a lack of compensation."
good,"The job consisted of a lot of hard labor, but that's something I enjoy."
good,Delivering excellent customer service through using tools and resources to give customer exceptional shopping experience
good,"-day at work consisted of helping customers"
good,Very fast pace not much time for your family if you have one but great pay.
good,every day I went to work and couldn't do anything but help customers for several hours neglecting the other stuff that needed to be done.
good,"I worked in the garden department and really enjoyed helping customers choose their plants,  Sometimes gets a little crazy when your are helping customers and also answering phone calls when it's busy."
good,"The people I worked with and most of the Customers were always awesome. Always a new challenge each day which was actually fun. The hardest part was the store I worked for was a pilot/training store, so we always had new management. Philosophy would change from year to year sometimes quicker, so it was always hard to know what was expected of you. Just as you adjusted to a new flow of how things were to be done they would change. Overall it was a good experience with lots a bumps along the way. I would consider working for The Home Depot again. The corporation itself seems to care about the well being of its employees."
good,"i worked hard and learned alot in different deparments , i was on time and working with the garden center really let me learn alot about plants and other green stuff"
good,"Work with customers to solve their issues"
good,"I had worked for a different home depot than this prior, the company of home depot is wonderful. Its a great first job. But the management was horrible at this store, I had worked there for 8 months and the manager hadnt spoken more then 1 sentence to me the whole time. They looked out for money more then their own employees, every complaint was the employees error even if their was proof otherwise. Home Depot is a great company, but this stores management was the worst ive ever dealt with."
good,"There is usually always something to do, so it isn't slow. I've learned alot concerning plants, lawns gardens and much more. Management is nice. I like my co-workers. The hardest part is dealing with difficult costomers, but that doesn't happen a lot. I like that I get to be on my feet doing projects and talking to people and helping them."
good,"during a day at work all associates were expected to give excellent customer service as well as promoting a strong healthy work environment. I learned many basics in home improving needs and i learned how to converse with customers more effectively while working at the home depot. the management staff was a hit or miss, often producing their own rules whenever they stepped in and sometimes confusing the employees. Also they would tell the associates to demonstrate good customer service while they didnt entirely do it themselves. my coworkers were outstanding but some were very close to management and got what they wanted and also got away with doing things as well. the hardest part about working at the home depot is dealing with the awful management staff that was provided but everything else was pretty easy. most enjoyable part of working at the home depot was helping customers."
good,"Very fast paced environment , Hardest part of job is getting everything done each and every day. Customer service is among the best in the business."
good,"A typical day at work included unloading, separating, receiving, processing freight throughout warehouse. I learned how to drive a stand up forklift, clamp, and electric pallet jack. The turn over rate of management and co-workers was very high. The hardest part of the job was the management's lack of knowledge of the procedures at this warehouse, the lack of friendliness, encouragement, and recognition from management. The most enjoyable part of the job was my paycheck."
good,"Good company to work for, but I am looking for full time and is not offered to me at this moment."
good,time management is a must to complete all duties required. As a department manager and key carrier/ manager on duty you wear many different hats
good,I truly enjoyed working at Home Depot.  Enjoyed learning about different products and projects that can be done in a home.
good,"Scheduled and managed 5-7 customer appointments daily. Consistently closed over $40,000 of sales monthly."
good,It is an ok place to work for.  It would be nice if they would hire people in full time.
good,"Retail management requires flexibility with the ability to multi-task, manage time while meeting the needs and finding solutions to a multitude of home improvent problems that customers may have.  There is satisfaction in knowing that you have helped customers realize their home improvement dreams or offered better solutions then they could have imagined.  I've learned that the key to being successful in any business is being consistence and open to learning new things not just in your area of responsibility but outside of it as well. The more you learn the more successful you'll be at determining the needs of any customer.  The most demanding part of my job is time management, by that I mean finding the time allotted to complete necessary training, mentoring and developing associates, calling customers to remind them that we're here to help them with their projects if they should ever have any questions or complaints, to include completing audits, reviews, regular inventory, ordering, staying in stock and maintaining store appearance. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people from all walks of life and developing those interpersonal relationships that defines how well I've done my job in providing excellent customer service.     ."
good,"Home Depot was my first experience in retail.  I started out as a return associate and moved up to key-carrying manager.  I loved the fast paced atmosphere. It was there that I realized how much I loved customer service and expediting lines to ensure the customer had a satisfying shopping experience.  However, I was performing managerial duties without the proper monetary compensation."
good,"*Fast pace environment from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m."
good,"The Company has served me well since the first day i started, The pay starts off well, You have to be full time to get your benefits. The hours sometimes can be off and on. There's almost never any coverage in the pluming department, just saying."
good,"A typical day at work is providing customer service at the register making sure customer was satisfied with their services. I've learned about taking customer payments in person and phone; creating quotes on in home installation, also learning about home improvement products. Hardest part of the job was moving up as a supervisor because of so much competition and most enjoyable part of the job is creating a friendly relationship with the customer."
good,generally I enjoy coming to work. Sometimes I feel there is a real detachment between corporate and day to day store operations. Many times the left hand doesn't know or understand what the right hand is doing per say
good,"to many chiefs and not indians,certain head dept,personals dont have time to talk with you ,so you do the best you can, no more full timer so they bring part timer ,that why i dont work there ,not need any longer."
good,it was stressful but made many advantages to make a pleasant workday there too many disloyal supervisors and managers but a okay work environment
good,Sales driven industry. Often workforce is spread too thin to cover the need for the business. Company rarely offers full time work anymore and skimps on hours for their employees. You have to take care of your workers to get good production from them.
good,"They take good care of me, but the work isn't for me."
good,"Sell Credit Cards and work in the Garden Dept."
good,If you are going to school and are interested in trade jobs. The Home Depot is a good place to start with a job.
good,customer work was enjoyable but the business itself was full of gossip by employees constantly looking to backstab you the first chance they got.
good,"•	Possessed strong leadership skills - managed staff, inventory, sales and profits while providing an open schedule that included nights, weekends and holidays."
good,I didn't like this job because your over worked and under paid for your service . most of the time you work a department area by yourself trying to help everyone along with keeping stock on shelves
good,"Everyday was a new adventure, There was always something new going on at the workplace, they would have fun activities to do at least once a month."
good,Great place to learn new things and get to meet new people from different origins. As well as maximizing knowledge from computer based and hands on learning.
good,very hard work on your body with high powered preasure washer
good,"Very busy area to work with alot of noise form equipment and area.Have to be able to  multi-task at different times of the day to take care of trucks,customers,associates and lots of lifting and moving of freight to make room in a small area. Work by yourself alot because of shortage of help."
good,"Critical customer service role by providing customers with fast, friendly, accurate and safe service. Contacts "
good,Another good place to get a job to pass the time. It serves well for someone who needs to pay bills and does not want to go far in life.
good,"Fairly typical retail experience. If you hit your sales goals you get rewarded with priority hours, if you don't, you don't. The Management team was pretty good about working around school hours and such. Friendly environment and staff."
good,"Worked with awesome people, which is what kept me at the job so long. The store I worked at was in the top five for sales in the region, very busy store. The store couldn't keep people staffed and those of us who were able to manage the grind were expected to do even more."
good,"Management was ok, sometimes remote management in Atlanta office could not manage what was going on in Austin"
good,"Very busy each day with lots of work to do, always keeping everyone busy. Management could be better. Generally weren't around when needed for assistance and would take credit for associates work. Very fun environment with co-workers."
good,Home Depot was wonderful and I learned a lot about different areas of home repair and maintenance. I also got to learn to drive a large variety of heavy machines and operate power tools for the job most would not get to use on a regular basis. The variety of customers and employees I was able to interact with on a daily basis made every day a pleasure.
good,"it was all about clean, fixing boxes, being outside even if it was raining or not. No customers only Co- workers. I love working with customers."
good,"very active and competitive work environment, great coworkers, horrible management and HR communications."
good,I was on the MET team which was pain. The management was a pain in the but you could never satisfy anyone and paperwork changed every week. Not  for the soft of heart.
good,Project customers vary in range of help needed. Some want to be in and out while others need in depth planning and explanation. Asking the right questions can save both you and them plenty of time.
good,"A typical day at work is functioning as a team "
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. There are management issues they all are very young most were in their mid 20's so that doesn't really help anything. Plus communication was bad. However this was a very fun company to work with. I met a lot of new friends and a lot of fun people to work with.
good,I worked in Mill Works department at Home Depot. I sold doors and windows to customers. Regularly I would assist in specialty orders for customers. The department worked as a good team and they were helpful in learning more about the products for better sales.
good,Stocked all the freight from the trucks that came in throught the day
good,This job really contributed to professional skills. And I plan to take what I learned and apply to everyday task.
good,"HD is a good place to work, starting is just part time jobs but great opportunities to advance"
good,"long hard days, some bad apples mostly good, management not as quailifed as they should be"
good,"No Complaints, Money handling, customer service."
good,"great company. a lot of co-workers. working in the receiving dept was"
good,There was a lot of different kind of people which i liked. I liked the machinery that i got to work with to move equipment.
good,"short breaks "
good,Typical day was continuously assembling and setting up structures within the store for preparation for the new customers. This was a new store that was being prepared to open for business.
good,You learn a lot but are not fairly compensated for it all. Part-timers were required to work 40 hours before ObamaCare began. When this  came about all part-timers (who represent 80% of the workforce) were cut to 29 hours effective immediately.
good,"help customers from start to finish, set up credit cards, help load merchandise"
good,I learned the meaning of hard work and what it is to be a team player
good,"I worked here for 15 years. It is a pretty difficult place to work for when you start forming a family, Company is very demanding of your time."
good,"I learned a lot about business working for Home Depot.  I started at the bottom and worked my way up the corporate ladder. I started as a cashier in 2005 while I was working on my Masters Degree and six years later I was managing the largest department in the store. Home Depot allowed me to run as a supervisor and I was able to learn all aspects of the business. "
good,"You can start out as an associate in the lot and become a VP one day, if you are smart; have ambition; and are willing to make a commitment to this company. The company has great core values that one could live their life by, if you follow those core values you will make out just fine. You meet a lot of interesting people customers and associates alike. And I believe, like any job it really is what you make of it. If you have a good attitude, and deliver outstanding customer service your day will go by smoothly and you will begin to make strides. Or if you want to just show up and do the bare minimum, some do get away with it for a while, but they are only hurting themselves the company and most importantly the customer."
good,"Creative, dealing with customers, lots of product knowledge, friendly environment."
good,"If you are a hard worker and like to keep busy this is the place for you. If you like to get paid to stand around and do nothing, this is also the place for you."
good,"I worked in the hardware department not much to learn or manage just answer where most of the items are,"
good,"Writting quotes for flooring, and following up to make sure customers were billed correctly."
good,Job was interesting. Great co-workers to work with. Loved working with customers and learning new things. Hours did not consider your personal time.  Total flex schedule that changed week to week and could change on any given day.
good,Working there is good because they are willing to work with you as well you are able to learn things that you want to learn.
good,"i enjoyed doing my job there."
good,"Running the front end, Multi Tasking, the nicest co-workers you'd ever meet."
good,"Home Depot is a good place to work if you are a single person, very time demanding and not a lot of time of actually unless you request back to back days, management is ok but they could use a week or so to be taught ""Concept of Leadership"" by the military it would help them out greatly, co-workers are great if you get the right mix in your department, The hardest part of the job getting people to be to work on time and scheduling of enough people for the work week, sometime you find yourself by yourself and some departments are big and it happened a lot in the receiving department I was running but I still got the job done but it can burn you out also. I do not have a particular part of the job I enjoyed other than just having all associates there and getting the job done."
good,"Plenty of options for new work environments.  There is opportunity to interact with customers,and make a difference."
good,The only reason I left this job was because of my schedule. I loved this job.
good,I like a job that allows people to gain experience in several areas.
good,it is a good environment to work. You constantly learn new things as well as put your skills to use.
good,"Dealing with customers and money. Learned how to keep productive. Management is good. Co-workers are nice. The hardest part about the job is managing self check out terminals, especially when customers need assistance and you're there by yourself trying to manage everything. Helping customers find what they're looking for."
good,Felt used. Offered a lot. Delivered on little. Started out only intending to pay off student loans. Was promised department head role. Continued working and training toward that and ultimately elected to seek employment elsewhere.
good,"I love the home depot , room to grow , friendly faces always something new"
good,"I worked there when i was a kid, I guess its a job for extra cash/gas money for high school students"

good,Typical day at work is usually slow unless it is a weekend. The management is usually pretty understanding about things or if you need help.The hardest part of my job is dealing with angry customers.
good,"Hard work, economy rough, lots of part time vs. full time.  decent training for the workers before being put out on the floor."
good,Decent job for a retail position. No OT or extras for hourly employees. Management got all the credit for the work done by the associates.
good,"They try and work with you all they can.  The job can be frustrating, but overall it's a decent job."
good,"•	Manage personal and business accounts."
good,Worked as a Pro Account Sales Associate. Went to school during employment.
good,Every location is different. Lots of foot traffic and customer service. It's retail so it can be competitive
good,one on one customer experience how to deal with upset customers and just learned the company
good,"Working at night was able to get things done, not many people in the way, fast paced, warm and friendly workers. Management informed you of a few things that needed to be done, or what was going on. Hardest Part of the job was to get time allotted for training."
good,Its a great job if your in school. As far as advancing in the company however there the downside. Unless you know someone higher up promotions are hard to come by.
good,"My specific Home Depot was a little unprofessional, with childish employees. Grateful for the experience."
good,Great opportunity to work in a warehouse...if you like that sort of thing.
good,"Inicias el dia con raunion con los jefes , objetivos a cumplir durante el dia, "
good,focused on making sure cashier tills were balanced daily. focused on maintaining functuality of cash registers
good,"A typical day was determining best cost savings for the Home Depot which meant a lot of interaction with the vendors, researching data analysis and reporting. There was a lot of training to bring your vendors up to speed with the Ariba tool that was used for the eAuction online negotiations. It was also required to advise the Global Commodity Leaders on your professional opinion of the projection of the auctions and how it would benefit them and maintaining integrity for the auction, commodity and overall partnership with the company."
good,"Home Depot is a great company to work for but Customer Care is known as the graveyard; once there, it is so hard to get out of this departments. there was no real room for advancement unless you wanted a lateral move to another entity of Customer Care. They speak of an inverted pyramid but the employees are the least of concern and when things go wrong, you expect your leaders to have your back but you're just rolled under the bus and no one has the guts to stand up for anyone."
good,I enjoyed working there the time I did. I gained a lot of experience in customer service from working there. I also enjoyed working there too.
good,Taught me a lot about work ethic and home improvement . i enjoyed learning about the different departments in the store.
good,"Good company to work for, but they need better onsite management"
good,Its OK to work at THD but not that great. Have to learn home depot customized frameworks for all the standard frameworks that are available on the market.
good,i learned customer service and got more training with inventory. my supervisor was very helpful and the work place was a good place to work and meet new and familiar faces.
good,This is a good company and they seem to appreciate your efforts as a whole. Did this while I was attending Kansas State University.
good,"focus only on customers, good customer service, but no resources to handle"
good,As an employee at Home Depot there was stable income and opportunities for overtime hours. The pay was suitable but as always could have been better.
good,"No, benefits or room for growth there needs to be a better environment with stores and it employees needs."
good,"Help customers with issues. "
good,"Typical Day at work is paper works and cold calls in the morning for quotations and preparation for meeting schedules and site/office sales call/visits in the afternoon."
good,"The best part is the people, the staff and the customers. We would not be here without our customers and in these difficult times I am so happy to be in a position where I could  help others. I truly enjoy every interaction I have with each employee or customer. There are times where you can make someone's day and times where you can't but you can help someone understand. If it were not for this high level or interaction I think I would expire. I love the crazy nature of the work and the fact that it is never the same thing twice."
good,"Home Depot is a solid company with great people. In my experience there, though, there is not a lot of opportunity to advance to manager positions. It seems that Home Depot is only interested in people with great longevity with the company and are not interested in quickly advancing people who show great promise."
good,"A typical day for me is going in and working very hard from start to finish. I learned how to operate a few machines that i previously had no knowledge of. The management team seems to try hard, although have proven to be untrustworthy. Many co-workers work hard and are friendly, but some of them are rude and lazy. Not team players. The hardest part of my job is working so hard and receiving so little compensation. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to work, period."
good,A typical day at work consisted of daily meetings and productivity. I learned a lot about the warehouse industry when I started I had no experience and they made sure I knew the job to do it effectively.
good,"It's alright, management changes every couple of months.  And you are not really sure what area you will be working from time to time."
good,"Grew a lot by dealing with many associates and customers over the years in difficult situations. My co workers have been the best part of the job. Management has been poor and inconsistent for too many years at the gj location. Not a overall example of the company. The company in general has many incentives for the associates,"
good,"The job currently focuses on customer service, but yet you have to somehow find the time to do the other things required of you.  All of the creativity that used to be involved is now gone.  Vendors are now responsible for most displays and resets.  All merchandise is MAP and/or planogram.  This can make for quite a boring day if it is slow.  "
good,hard work good people i sold outdoor power tools to coustomers
good,"Unloading and loading trucks of company products"
good,I loved the people that i worked with and the people that went threw my line. I would have couple that if they knew i was working they would come threw my line no matter what.
good,"it's your typical night crew ""box on shelf"" job.Didn't really learn anything noteworthy. Management was good, but if your employees don't agree with the store's choice on who the new night crew manager is it will affect production, and employees might end up quitting. A night crew manager should be working like the rest of us, not walking around, and monitoring us. At most, all they should do is say: hey, i got a pallet of (whatever) in Aisle X when you're done with that one. That's about all we need, that bit of direction, otherwise, we'd just grab whatever would be easy to put out. Co-workers were all great to work with. Hardest part was keeping up with the volume of merchandise that came in. The most enjoyable was when we put in place an organization system that VASTLY improved the productivity."
good,"was a good place to work, at times difficult due to the constant change in management (no legivity); i adjusted and learned to just change/work with new managers."
good,This company likes to please the customer and have knowledgeable employees to assist them. They have plenty of things available to learn whether it be online programs to one on one training.
good,"the work place is nice everyone greets you,the managers are will to hear your thoughts,i was thought how to be a team player,work at a fast paste,"
good,"Good people to work with."
good,"Great place to work with plenty of room for growth."
good,"warehouse atmospher, very busy, thats good, yet not much opportunity for fast advancement."
good,I've been working here for the past 2 years. Its a decent living.
good,"Assisted customers in selecting the appropriate tools and hardware for various home improvement, and work related projects. Performed opening and closing duties of the hardware department, and contributed elsewhere to the store where needed. Management always available when needed. Hardest part of the job was disgruntled employees. Everyday was an enjoyable experience especially when you helped a customer find what they were looking for, or solved a dilemma they had no matter how great it was."
good,"As a Lot Associate it was my responsibility to make sure that the car lot, as well as the front apron was kept neat, tidy, and free of any carts and garbage. Also, if a customer required assistance with something they had just bought, it was my responsibility to make sure they had help getting it into their vehicle."
good,"I've been with Home Depot for over a year, as a cashier, and came in when there were many new employees, and changes in management from Manager, down to Associates, etc.  Our training, and initial experiences were under managed, and expectations to work independently without having supervised training while we were waiting on customers. "
good,"Learned a lot about working in a hardware store, even though I was a cashier I was able to learn about things from plumbing, to hardware, to wood."
good,when i worked there customer service needed help. Dont know if its gotten any better or not
good,Worked with customers very closely. Manager didn't give me room for advancement
good,Good job but people get stuck in one place and never leave and never grow as an employee.
good,"Simple job,  lot of interaction with customers and employees, good hands on experience for household everyday situations"
good,the home depot is a good place to work if you work days and want to get noticed. night crew doesn't get as much appreciation. tough to work hard and not be able to get full time or a promotion
good,Really under paid for what you do and how much business they bring in. The company will rather pull somebody from the outside in instead of promoting an employee
good,"very welcoming co-workers, easy to talk to management about serious issues, true open door company."
good,home depot is a great place to work I learned a lot of management skills to wear I can grow my career into I was crossed trained as well
good,poorly trained management team lead to poorly trained and over stretched supervisors which lead to low productivity and not near enough associates in each department to get a good chunk of the work done
good,"Fun Job I worked Sales, freight and inventory."
good,"Customer Service, cash handling, supervision of multiple cashiers and other associate, stock, customer orders, Fixing equipment"
good,Retrieving carts is constant. Loading customer's merchandise is done when called upon or when improvised upon.
good,This was a good company to work for. I learn additional clerical skills while there.
good,"Ok job while in high school."
good,"my work place was always busy a typical day at work consist of a short break, back and forth walking to supervise front end staff, assisting customers with complaints, refunds, orders"
good,"I did not like the Home Depot, I do not like their management style, but overall I am not a customer service person."
good,"poorly managed, no growth, staff poorly trained, poor morale"
good,Extremely fast paced position with a non typical work day. I enjoy working with my associates as well as customers.
good,"I always started the day changing forklift batteries, then address any problems in the warehouse or special projects going on. Working at the Home Depot Warehouse I learned that there are a lot great employees. My co-workers were very inviting and helpful. I really enjoyed my time with the Home Depot"
good,When I worked there I had a terrible shift manager. They finally fired her after I left. apparently it was for stealing a piece of candy. Typical minimum wage job. Hours can become long. Sometimes unwanted overtime.
good,"Very good place to learn about home improvement and very nice people to work with, very bad hours."
good,"This place has some good teammates and great customers most of the time. the pay can be good depending what you choose to do, and never a dull moment nor not to learn something new or how to do something better."
good,Good place to work and lot of opportunity to learn new things very often. Good clients.
good,"It was an ok part time job for the summer that required a lot of work and energy since I was under the sun a lot.  I gave it my all whenever I was working. I can't complain about the manager since he really never spoke that much, and the co-workers were friendly. I've learned to put on sun-screen if I ever I have to work outside again."
good,"My passion is interior décor, so I ventured into retail management at Expo, a high-end interior design center owned by Home Depot.  While I did not enjoy retail for the primary reason of schedule inconsistency and pay, I was able to hone my managerial skills in this job.  At one time, I managed a team of 25."
good,How well you like your job really depends on which store you end up working at and how you hit it off with your manager.
good,Helping customers locate products and explaining the different ones. Also worked on the freight team unloading and stocking merchandise.
good,Some departments are harder to work thank others. the people are very friendly.  Customer service is number 1

Which I don't mind, but my professional customers do because time is money so I'm always on the mood. management....half the time I wonder how they process there thoughts and actions."
good,The store I worked at was very busy at times and did not have enough cashiers making it stressful but I did enjoy working here for the most part.  Management was not helpful and rude at times.
good,I was a cashier at Home Depot. I assisted customers with check out as well as returns. I provided excellent customer service. I helped assist the customer in every way possible to make sure that they were satisfied.
good,"Poor management."
good,had a great time working there but management wasnt always helpful in promoting and such things
good,"scale out the parking lot and begin sorting the carts to the designated areas, which are mostly located in the store, always respond to radio calls for customer assistance, help other lot engineers with their loading tasks. if opening in the morning, then I fill up the fridges with drink beverages and pick up the garbage and dump then in the compactor."
good,"Day started with getting the equipment and registers ready for the cashiers to use, as well as morning reports on certain issues that arose from giving customers money off of product. Other daily reports included observing the cashiers to ensure they were completing their job properly. "
good,Typical part time job. I learned a lot about customer service. Management wasn't great at the time. Co-worker were okay.
good,By and large the people were good. The culture of the company deteriorated when management was not in the building. Corporate seems to look for ways to keep a successful process from remaining so.
good,"Customers in this area are great, and usually know what they are looking for, Management chooses a flavor of the month of corporate policies to enforce and starts to write everyone up for a week or so, then moves onto the next thing."
good,"Oeprated machines such as the reach , order picker and rabbit. Managment was ok but didnt really have organized decisions.I got along very well with coworkers helping them out when needed.My hardest part was gettn through the night i wasnt use to over night.

good,I was very please okay good work it was good to work/mgt /employees vwree god

good,a work day is fast and full of task to do. I enjoyed customers services.
good,"A typical day on the job at Home Depot for me was just showing up, gathering all the carts from the corrals, and assisting customers with their checkout and loading of materials onto vehicles. This was an overall good job just out of high school and helped me continue to build work ethic in the workplace."
good,"I learned skills to further my career and met nice people.  A typical day was faced paced and busy, which I liked.  They had okay benefits."

good,"The benefits are great. They pay is low for associates, not that you shouldn't expect that from a retail giant."
good,competitive pay. co-workers were fun met alot of great people. schedule really dont care about your family when it caomes to scheduling. its all about home depot and what will better the company not your life
good,"working at Target is like working at any large corporation, your hours are given to you and you have to be available nights and weekends"
good,"Learned a lot, made me a stronger person, just took too long to get advanced or recognized"
good,"Two years of employment there went well, but the opportunity to improve myself in the company never seemed to be there. Loved the people I worked with, but hated the fact that without advancement or a noticeable raise, the workload I was given continued to increase without even a word of thanks for going beyond."
good,"Very demanding on the amount of work needed to be done, while trying to help customers."
good,"As the Loss Prevention Officer, I am In charge of the store security & Loss Prevention. I record all store activity of in house and customers in the store. I am in charge of apprehending shoplifters, filing all report and given out all if any civil Demand to the shoplifte"
good,"Was fun coming up with ideas to best display products through out the store to enhance sales and promote new items. Making sure enough product was down stocked to insure adequate supply on shelves."
good,I was a mentor to grade school children ranging from grade 4 to 6.
good,"My review of Home Depot would be outdated because its been a very long time since I worked for them. When I did, it was in their heyday and I enjoyed working for them. For the type of company it is, they compensated well, benefits where above average and the job culture was enjoyable.Since then I understand things are not the same."
good,What I would do is clock in go to the shipping department and take the items that were just shipped and start to place them on the shelf in a proper manor in a quick time frame to not have stock backed up the next day. The things I learned in this job was how to put things in the proper place and to make sure the (SKU) shipping # matched the place where the item needed to go. The management there was always making sure you place the items in a timely manor so that way by the end of the shift you would be able to sweep and mop the floor. The co-workers there were team players if you didn't know where the stuff in the store were located they would help you out until you understood where everything went and what department the item would be in. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the garden items certain bags of mulch would be ripped on the bottom when transporting to a pallet and you would get your clothes real dirty or watering the plants would get your shoes very wet. The best thing about the job was each person would try to race and see where the items would go in there cart before the next so that way we would finish stock quicker.
good,Home Depot has one of the easiest atmospheres to work in. You are treated like family and everyone is willing to help you if you are willing to learn.
good,"Very busy and tiring, I learned patience, management was helpful i got along with all co-workers."
good,I enjoyed working at Home Depot.  It was always busy and every day was different.
good,Office politics and extensive outsourcing mar this company's rating.
good,Home Depot was a good part time job. Hours were excessive sometimes.
good,"-extremely friendly customers"
good,A great place to work with excellent benefits. While you are constantly resolving customer issues and complaints you leave at the end of the day feeling satisfied.
good,very fast lines moving through checkout line. I learned that contractors come in different variety those you admire and would hire in a heart beat and those you just shake your head at and keep going. I learned that you should be friendly but keep it professional with co-workers. The hardest part was the heavy lifting. The most enjoyable the friendships developed
good,Had supportive co-workers/store associates with whom I interacted to complete ordes placed by customers
good,"Small store, so it seems like a ""family"". "
good,"There is definitely room to move up in the company if you're interested and work hard. Any ""Pro"" prositions have a set schedule and always have weekends off."
good,"I would rate Home Depot a 3.  Don't get me wrong the company has great benefits for full time employees, but not part time employees.  The hardest part of the job was arriving to the  store and the manager would tell me they are cutting hours and tell me to please go home.  Enjoyable things at the home depot is being outside in the garden department."
good,"Fun place to work just not paid enough. I have meet some fun people, and it has taught me that hard work pays off."
good,"nice place to work, co-workers where very helpful. I was only a temp for the company."
good,I think they should change how management runs the store and give people who work hard a show of appreciation.
good,"customer oriented, high employee turn over. raises are minimal"
good,I worked on the Merchandising execution team. Work was pretty easy. There was never enough Home Depot associates on the sales floor which hindered performance in my job seeing how \i was constantly helping customers. The hardest part of job was the physical labour and trying to help frustrated customers.
good,"I liked being around my employees, It was a fun place, The hours was great"
good,Scanning and stocking shelves. Helping customers when needed.
good,"If your willing to put in the time and effort to earn some extra cash as well as earn valuable sales skills, then this job is for you."
good,"Every location is different due to the people who work there. Most of the department workers are great to work with. The department heads are also fantastic to work for. Management however is a different story, they lack communication skills, ask workers to task during “power hours” when we are not supposed to do anything other than assist customers.  Overall it is not a bad place to work while in college or when one is in need of a job."
good,"Learned how to interact with the public,  Typical day could be called ""organized chaos"".  Always a high turn over in personnel for various reasons"
good,my co workers were a lot of fun to be around. I lolved helping people find what they were looking for
good,I am well versed in many of the store departments as well as a lift truck trainer and operator. I am also a first aid associate. That being said I tend to have pretty busy days trying to balance the sales floor as well as my other duties. I like to keep busy so I like the pace. This company has a very diverse group of employees. The upper management of the store tends to change every couple of years.
good,I have received a lot of training that is pertinent to the job description in addition to training that helps out the store in general.
good,"building quotes for customers,helping customers,learning all the ins and outs of my department,co workers are great to work with management does not take the time to acknowledge the good things you do just wants more sales,hardest part of job is not being told what a great job you are doing,the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people"
good,"Throughout the work day, your number one priority is always about the customers.  I feel that is extremely important, because without th customers there is no business. Resposibilities on a daiy basis, were stocking, cleanliness and of course cutomer care.  Management changed quite often, which is good for promotions, but not for employee moral."
good,"Great life experiences, incredible lessons learned. Not a stable position. Not stable hours"
good,A typical day for me consisting of taking carts and pallets of merchandise and storing it into its correct location. In this position I learned how to read location labels and what the information located on them actually meant. Management at this employer were helpful and enjoyed acknowledging employees when they performed their job at an above average level. My co-workers were also quick to provide advice on how to become more efficient while performing job related tasks. The hardest part of the job was establishing a method to meet the quota of pallet put-aways per shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to meet and exceeded the standards that were set by the company. Another benefit of the job was getting aquainted with co-workers and the quiet and calmness of the shift.
good,"A typical day at work included assisting customers in finding what they were looking for and recommending items they may have not known they did need. Stocking and general store maintenance was also included. I learned many different things about plumbing, electrical work, gardening and landscaping, tools and lumber knowledge. The management was the main reason Home Depot was such a hostile work place. The employees were not treated with much respect and hard work was not appreciated by management. My co-workers were a wide variety of people. It was very much like  high school all over again. The hardest part of my job was the physical aspect. I was able to perform all the duties assigned to me but it was very physical. The most enjoyable part of my job was making connections with customers and creating contacts from regulars."
good,"They treat you well, and help out with anything you need.  They will work around peoples schedules, but they just need to pay more than minimum wage"
good,as a part time job it will do but if you are looking for advancement it really isn't really the greatest. the rules are very rigid and tend to stifle creativity and expansion. all in all its great for college students they really do work around your schedule but it isn't where i would see myself making a career.
good,Great place to work as a college student flexible part time schedules
good,"Not a bad job if it wasn't for some customers trained by the retail industry to whine and demand things for free or for discounts when something didn't go exactly perfect.   Installers weren't treated with the respect and consideration that they should have been given, even though they were doing 90% of the work."
good,"Cabinet refacing,bath refacing, Closet and Garage Organization."
good,"Working at The Home Depot is not the most exciting, challenging job I've ever had, but it's a good job for right now while I am in school full time. If you want, you have the ability to move into departments and learn more about that specific department, and there are many ways to get involved with the company other than showing up for your shift. As far as the people I work with and the store managers, I'd rate them all at a 3 out of 5. If you don't want to work weekends, don't apply for a job at The Home Depot."
good,"Home Depot preaches ""take care of your customers and your associates and everything else will take care of itself"". This is not how the company really operates. Their values have drastically gone down hill in the last six years."
good,got to work with pros in aviation and deal with high level execs
good,it a OK place to work but management lacks leadership skills to train staff better
good,"Being an expeditor I assisted several departments with materials, always having the opportunities to learn and meet new people, also delivering good customer service,"
good,Worked for a few years growing in the company had an accident with my car and they needed my position replaced.
good,"Home Depot was a fun team environment.  There was a lot of physical, hands on work that I really enjoyed.  We had to pay close attention to detail and safety.  Management was very approachable and my co workers were super friendly and helpful."
good,I learned customer service. The Management was always friendly.
good,good company to work with. needs to provide better growth for individuals wishing to step up and advance
good,"Nice staff and management. Job availability is nice,but very little opportunity to grow and advance."
good,"A typical day consisted of servicing customers in various departments and ensuring they received top notch customer service and leave with the product they require. I learned how to engage and converse with people from different backgrounds, possessing different personalities including management and co-workers. Management was structured and tailored so that upper management rarely gets involved in day-to-day processes. Co-workers varied in dedication and   friendliness, but the ultimate objective was ensuring that the needs of the customer were met.The hardest part is dealing with so many personalities daily; the most enjoyable happens to be the same thing, meeting new people. When interactions go well, they really pay off."
good,The challenge is to satisfy multiple customers at the same time while completing deliveries. I learned a lot about customer service and merchandising.
good,"Performed multitude of jobs in one day, Coworkers were more than willing to assist when needed. Most enjoyable was seeing a satisfied customer and seeing them crate something special."
good,I was alway looking for the diamond in the rough. i would always take the extra step to gain a new contractor.
good,it is an okay job make no money and they want you to do everything at once
good,"very easy job fun , but they expect way too much for the amount of work you do ,the hours very my experience with them wasn't a very good one ,"
good,"My time at home depot was at the contractor services desk, I learned a lot about building materials and what should and should not be used in areas of homes. Management was ok but often hard to find to be able to talk too, my co workers at the desk was wonderful to work with. The hardest part of my job was being in the lumber yard loading bags of concrete and pressure treated lumber. The most enjoyable part of my job was having people return with pictures of their finished products that we helped them build"
good,Day to day i was presented with different tasks. Had to make decisions based on incomplete information often.
good,"Cashier, sales associate, special services department head. Dealing with the everyday public can be difficult at times."
good,Showing up at work and getting right on a forklift was my day to day activity at home depot.
good,ok atmosphere. busy. lots of customers. pick favorites. dumb rules.
good,enjoyed my work as janitor for llumc for kimco i enjoy interacting with staff and patients
good,"Being with Home Depot for 8 years, has provided me with the skills and knowledge to lead individuals to be successful employees, contribute to the ongoing success of the store and provide great customer service.            "
good,"Assist the warehouse manager in the daily operations, assigned duties as necessary.  A valued team member."
good,Worked at the store overnight unloading and stocking freight.  Management was friendly and my coworkers were great.  Very laid back and fun.
good,enjoy taking care of customers. never enough employees to run the store.
good,Not much opportunity for advancement. Weekend work was always mandatory.
good,I was a floor & wall department sales associate that helped people pick out materials to improve their homes.
good,"fast paced environment "
good,go from start to end--learned many areas of the store and the products--a combo of good and bad--most associates very knowledgeable and friendly--not getting promoted--the coworkers and customers
good,Worked through a contract with another organization but found Bank of America to be a great organization but had its share of challenges.
good,It is a good working environment with excellent benefits. Lots of opportunities to advance within the company.
good,"it was a fun environment to work in, but a little under appreciative"
good,long hours no union unset schedule poor management not stable work environment
good,"Typical day consisted of helping customers find what they needed, learned that you cant please everyone, loved my co-workers made work time enjoyable. everyone is really nice and east to get along with. hardest part of the job are customers who are not so easy to please and snap at you for minimal issues."
good,"I learned quite a bit.  It is a broad range of construction retail, yet it sharpened my social skills with a variety of contractors and do it your self clientele.  It made me aware of market prices and some of the difficult areas of calculating a retail sale for a total or partial job."
good,Position allowed for interaction with all front end staff and direct contact with management on a regular basis.
good,"Typical days consist of assisting customers (DIY and contractor) with finding correct product to solve their issue or needs. I learned a great deal about construction, responsibilities of owning a home. I also gained an insightful view of the background processes of a fortune 500 retail company, both positive and negative. My fellow coworkers were diverse, some of the nicest folks I've worked with. The hardest part of the job would be juggling customer service, required safety practices, and multiple management positions giving tasks often taking longer than the time allotted for them. The most enjoyable aspect would be getting to know local community members and their stories piece by piece as they return as loyal customers."
good,I learned about wood working in the lumber section and how to deal with difficult people.
good,"As lead generator I train associates to obtain sales and enter them into the computers and first phones. My co-workers are great and we are like family. The most enjoyable part of the job is going to the associates after a sale has closed and giving them the ""High Five!"" I love to motivate and reward."
good,Started the day off with positive talks among my management team and co-workers. Was nothing hard about this job and the surroundings and customers were wonderful
good,"I learned the basics of working a register, and being a sales person."
good,Liked the people/employees there; good training; good job to supplement my full time job. Customer service; helping customers w/ purchases.
good,"Unloaded truck deliveries."
good,Homedepot is a great place to work but lately there has been no worklife balance
good,"The Home Depot provided a wealth of experience across retail, marketing, creative and media disciplines.  There was never a typical day at Home Depot given the fast paced environment and competitive nature of the company.  "
good,The work place was a fast paced but was fun to work at. The other sales associates  were great to work with. The customers listened to what I had to say and for the most part followed my advice.
good,A typical day can be very busy with people using the weekends to get major home improvement done.  There are people returning items that were wrong or extra that they don't need or want.  There are also those with erroneous returns and plants that have died a year later.  Management was very good because a satisfied customer was the most important thing. The hardest part was preventing theft.  I found employment here very enjoyable.
good,"A typical day at work would be answering emails and faxes, calling customers, calling vendors, doing daily and monthly reports, training new employees, answering multiple phone lines, handling cash, solving customers complaints, solving customer Home Depot Credit Card account questions and problems. I learned how to be a supervisor type position, work with the public, problem solve an array of problems for customers. There management overall was alright. I got along great with my co-workers. The most difficult part of the job was having to deal with customers that were extremely irate or rude. The most enjoyable part of the job was having customers come back to you because they trusted your work ethic."
good,"Only some people go to work at home depot to actually work"
good,This company needs a overhaul of its aging and behind the times management
good,"A typical day at worked involved greeting customers, helping them find what they need, help them through the checkout process and maybe sell a few Home Depot credit cards or two. I learned to keep yourself calm in stressful situations and to always be positive toward your fellow coworkers and customers and the day should go smoothly. Management seems kind of out of touch with their employees and the coworkers are really nice and friendly. I have never had any drama with them. The hardest part of the job is of course dealing with unreasonable customers and trying to advance or find a full time position. The most enjoyable part of the job is honestly being able to help out the customer find what they need and check them out."
good,Management was sloppy. The over all experience was not so great. This is the reason I left after a year.
good,"Very fast paced, everyday was to hit the floor running, customer satisfaction was the driving force, every transaction, hardest part of the job was keeping up with the constant shift of merchandising and corporate needs and direction, most enjoyable, when a customer felt completly satisfied at the end of the day."
good,At this company you have the opportunity to acquire multiple skills.
good,I enjoyed working for the home depot. I had the oppotunity to learn stock inventory. I had the opportunity to become an sale assitant.
good,It was great while I was there. Benefits were not good for a part time. I had another family commitment.
good,"I learned a lot about remodeling a home from roof to grass. Typical day is speaking to over 200 guest, my management was friendly and encouraging."
good,"helping people check out, maintaining a clean work place, do returns"
good,"I went to my department and cleaned the floor as well as restock and keep shelves always stocked."
good,"A typical day would consist of walking each department for condition and opportunities, approvals/denials for returns, handling of cash, changing of displays, handling customer complaints.  Management had changed in the store at the top and therefore was the desire of District Manager to bring in entire new team.  Co-workers were great and created a team atmosphere.  Enjoyed the interactions with customers and associates alike."
good,It was normal days but had some long overnight days dealing with inventory and department.
good,"Manejo de personal"
good,at this job i furthered my customer service and cashier experience yet at the same time it tested my patience when it came to the hours that would shift drastically and the pay was something hard to live with. there was promise of a fulltime position that was not fulfilled even with hard work.
good,I learned a lot. I started out as an associate and worked my way up to warehouse supervisor. I had a lot of training from the other supervisors they like to promote within.
good,"being able to provide great customer service helped me to become a more understanding individual. Management was not he best, but it taught me how to be a appreciative manager if I ever get the chance to be, and show employees there work is appreciated."
good,Being a cashier there are many questions and distractions both by customers and co-workers. The hardest part of this job was being there late and on the weekends.
good,"Great Place to work, Power hour from 10am to 2pm. Basically this is time we do not task but help customers find products"
good,Working for a big company such as Home Depot has both pros and cons.  It really depends on the management team within a particular store.
good,"A major focus on customer service daily. I learned how to work with the public and how to deal with difficult situations as well as how to manage others in such situations. I enjoyed the management teams ambition to push for success as a company, however, They did not give the employee the necessary tools to learn in order to grown within the company. The hardest part was learning to get over the scrutiny customers push on you in a retail position. Where as my favorite part of the job was working with the public and being of service to my customers."
good,"Loved working outdoors and with the people. Loved the company. "
good,"This company varies drastically.  I loved my teammates but the company management various drastically.  I worked for Home Depot in  several cities. The straw that broke the camels back was when after speaking to the store manager for more hours for months prior to my resignation, I finally got a real job, but did not want to quit Home Depot.  I spoke to the store manager  and informed her that I had gotten a day job but I would like to stay there on a pt basis. She stated she could not give me more hours but she needed me to have an open schedule for part time work every single day. She could not have cared less about her employees. Unfortunately for me, she was fired for stealing from the store about 6 months later by the top dogs in corporate who came from Atlanta to investigate her."
good,If you're looking for a current part time job go for it but if you are looking to start a career i suggest you stay in school and get a degree in business before applying there.
good,"Resolve user related issues"
good,The Home Depot seemed like a amazing place to work with many ways to advance and employees that got treated with respect. After getting out of the training classes and starting to work on in the warehouse with other employees though you quickly see that the company does not care about their workers and all the benefits and rewards that they say you can receive if you work hard are almost impossible to achieve. All workers were overworked and a small number were obviously favorites and got special treatment even though it was said that everyone gets equal attention and opportunities. Management didn't care about their employees and only thought about meeting goals and hitting numbers whether it meant overworking employees or not. They required everyone to exceed what is expected of them and then when we would excel then the next day that was the new normal and we would not even receive any benefits from it besides the supervisors saying good job now do better. I learned that big companies will lie to you and make themselves appear fair and generous but once you are on the inside they do not care and will work you as hard as they possibly can because they know if they fire you there are a hundred other people who would gladly take your job if they had the chance. I enjoyed working as a team with my fellow associates however and they were amazing people but we all were not treated with the respect we deserved and if we tried to say something about it we would either get in trouble or our comments would not be considered in the slightest.
good,"work was not to difficult,an good people,not enough money."
good,Check customers out as a cashier and provide customer service to all customers who need assistance. Go on a 15 or hourly break depending upon the hours worked throughout the day. then continue checking customers out until the shift is over
good,"Pretty lay back job, just making sure all packages we're packed correct"
good,"Home Depot is a nice place to work, however the hours and pay are not very fulfilling. As a Cashier there are some perks like being able to relate tot he customer and also feeling some sense of accomplishment. The only drawback of working at The Home Depot is that unless you work a department or carry a supervisor title you really don't make that much in Salary. As far as management goes where I'm at currently does a fantastic job in ensuring that their workers have a safe working environment and that we all feel welcomed."
good,"Hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting, but other than that its a good company to work for."
good,"Typical day at work involves checking my notes on the email system and printing out the delivery paperwork for the current day"
good,A typical day at work with Home Depot for me was dealing with customers regarding their special orders and with vendors scheduling these orders.
good,"I have a great time going to work. Everyone is really nice, they take the time to make sure everyone isn't being overwhelmed by customers."
good,Seems they are always on a hiring freeze and will only hire people for 90 days.
good,I always learn something new when coming to work and deal daily with customers who seek information.
good,At Home Depot you have the option to cross train in various fields of the company. A good percentage of the employees enjoy being knowledgeable in their area of work. It gives you the opportunity to help the do it your-selfers out there  make their project come to life. The hardest part is not having the one thing that they needed when you where so close. I enjoyed the seasonal products display set ups.
good,"A typical work day  was real busy always staying busy doing something.I learned to multi task, drive forklifts, and to think outside of the box. Some manegers didn't deserve to be managers. I say that for the reason that they would promote the lazies worker and not the people that were actually be on the floor with customers, packing down and stocking. Same goes with coworkers there where some that actually went to work an others to waist your time. I would say the hardesr part of the job would be finishing the taskes they game you with a short time limit. the most enjoyable thing about the job was the customers it was always something new to help them with or that you woould learn from them."
good,Home Depot is a good place to work if one enjoys working with people of different ethnic background. Good for fresher's.....
good,Overall my experience at Home Depot has been good. The company has a very family orientated atmosphere.
good,"Mainframe developer."
good,Keep the lot clean at all times and assist customers with merchandise to their vechicle. Assist in othe  areas of the store when needed.
good,Home Depot treated there employees very well. I enjoyed the rewards we got for reaching store goals. I enjoyed the co workers it was like family. Hardest thing was working in returns beacuse it gets over stocked so quick.
good,"I love working in the customer service field, so Home Depot id a good company to work for"
good,"I got the proper training I needed, Staff was pretty friendly, But when it came time for me to want to go up in the company It was something you needed to know or needed to blow to go up in the management."
good,"Pros: I learned a lot of new things I didn't know about. My bosses were nice to me. Job was simple, yet entertaining at times."
good,Home Depot is a good company to work for. Thy do a lot of functions geared toward their employees. However there is no room for growth in my department.
good,"I worked in the lumber department at Home Depot. My typical day consisted of mainly helping customers pick their orders and help them load them into their vehicles. This is where I learned how to drive a fork-lift, pallet jack, electric pallet jack, order picker, and reach truck. The most enjoyable part of this job was just learning about anything and everything that had to do with construction in a home. I learned how to roof a house, build a deck, poor a slab, drywall walls, build a fence and much more."
good,I drive the reach truck and move pallets. I mirco-manage the millwork deptmartment. I also stock out the shipment givien to the millwork
good,Availability to move up if you are dedicated. Fun and creative workplace. Great benefits and bonus programs.
good,no advancement opportunities to many meetings on how to do something as it changed 4 or more times in the week. not receiving your correct orders from corporate micro-managed  it was hard to feel like a team. Nothing positive to say I moved on as fast as I could
good,"Home Depot is a well managed company but the work is very hard especially for someone past 60. Lifting heavy lumber and articles that were very heavy plus standing on a concrete floor cause varicose veins. The shift was always erratic, never the same from day to day in most cases. It's also a dangerous place to work, moving heavy objects around etc. injuries are commonplace in some depts. like lumber.  "
good,"This company is a great place to learn about doing just about anything that involves any kind of home improvement. There is always the ability to work with other departments, because they make sure you get proper training before tossing you into the departments."
good,"Working for Home Depot is not as bad as i thought it would be. Sometimes the work can be a little overwhelming but having the manager i have makes the work easier. He's not to demanding but he will get to that point if he has to. Overall, as a manager he is great to work for. From the time i started i learned that teamwork is key in various jobs such as this one.If u dont work together the task at hand most likely will not be accomplished. "
good,I work a 9:00am to 6:00pm sch. 5 days a week. I perform excellent customer service Keep plants watered & maintained for optimum quality to promote sales.Keep Nursery clean in appearance.I train other associates in plant knowledge & assist them with customers.Management is not always available so I have learned to solve issues on my own. The hardest part od the job for me @ this time of my life is lifting heavy bag goods & loading customers vehicles.There is never enough help with lot attendants because Management does not schedule accordingly.The most enjoyable part of my job would be feed back from my customers who rely on my expertise .I am consistently mentioned weekly on The Voice of the Customer survey.
good,"I enjoy working for the company, I learn how to deal with angry customer, come up with different strategy to sole every day problems with customer service."
good,"Friendly staff, flexible work hours, great part time job. Opportunity for promotion."
good,"haven't worked there in many years, okay place to work from what I remember"
good,"A night at home depot was a experience to learn dealing with different machines for example electric pallet jack,forklift(big an small),cherry picker,reach truck and slip truck...Also was a fast enviorment with little supervision and a team job. The hardest part about the job was staying warm during the cold seasons and the easy part of the job was stocking the shleves"
good,high turnover with upper management.  Management had its own agendas and never really allowed for associates to serve to their full potential
good,"cashiering, working the refund desk, drive sales, heavy lifting"
good,"Home Depot was a fun place to work Got to work with the customers everyday, got along with all of the other workers"
good,"customer service on a daily basis. Teaching customers how and where to use the product they are interested in purchasing. Management is not around unless there are problems on there end. Co-workers are friendly and easy to work with,but lack motivation. The hardest part of the job is the pay. Feeling like you are working for peanuts. Self motivation and customer service makes the job enjoyable."
good,Company that has a foundation of customer service and cares for its people.  I love developing and training my associates whether work related or personally.  I have learned a lot about different tools and how to build doors and windows and the different vendors and contractors.
good,"Great Job for someone who is just starting the work field. "
good,"i was hired on contract basis for 1 season, but later extended to 2. the workers were great to work with."
good,"I am an effective team member and I am highly valued by management.  I always set out to meet her job requirements and immediately recognized areas that could be altered for better efficiency in both time management and money saving. Under the leadership of my direct supervisor, my innovative ideas have assisted in bringing the workplace an environment friendly to all associates."
good,I really liked working here because i was always busy helping a customer or pulling out freight. I experienced a negative atmosphere from some of the workers the second i walked in for my first day. It was really hard focusing on a job when you have employees systematically mobbing on you during your entire shift. It was very depressing coming to work just to expect the bitterness of other workers and even speaking out to management about it was not effective. Everyone knows everyone here enough to take favoritism. Despite the negativeness i managed to stay positive until i was laid off. This description only applies to the store location i worked at.
good,"My job at Home Depot from 1994-2010, I held many positions from cashiering to district trainer of operations .,Problem solving, To working out on the floor with customers and new employees on policy and procedures."
good,loved the employees.  I did not like how I was told my seasonal work was over with.   Management was good
good,Provides reasonably priced products and friendly service.
good,"Assist customers with selection of gardening supplys, plants, and landscaping materials. Consult and arrange installations. Load supplys into vehicles."
good,If you are looking for a company tht has great benefits home depot is great but its a pain to get hired
good,"Still employed at home depot currently. Been about three months, looking for something else. (better hours, pay)"
good,I loved the people I worked with and dealing with customers daily.
good,I started as a customer service Manager.  In charge of 22 Cashiers.  It was fun The benifits were slim but great staff and room for advancement downfall working all major holidays.
good,"I enjoyed working at the Home Depot  Part time until I found a school to attend. The people where great, and I enjoyed driving forklift."
good,A work place that requires that you are detailed and able to multitask. You must also be able to take change and make good decisions.
good,"A nice place to work that has decent benefits.  The pay is decent compared to other places.  During a typical day, I run the front to make sure everything is running smoothly and customers are getting taken care of."
good,If you just starting out in the Workforce this is the place to be. They teach you everything you need to know about the work environment
good,Not a great mangement skill Company but with that it can be a great Company to work for.
good,"Solves the customers problems, looks for opportunities to say ""yes"" and share product knowledge, empowers me to take care of customer, Working the ESVS priorities are an important part of the customer services expectations for Special Services Associates. Following up on hot customerissues (issues within the priority bin),"
good,"Good, fun place to work, but training could have been better"
good,good coworkers organized but scheduling can be better department heads and management need to communicate better
good,"On a typical day at work u come in and check the back of the store. I then work the breakdowns that come in off the truck from 9:30-12. then we take and break. Next we have a meeting at 12:30 to know what is done and what needs to be done, we also check for what ales need to be worked on and come up with a time to clean, organize and prepare for the customers."
good,worked through college only part time. but they worked around my schedule and enjoyed the cultural diversity their.
good,"rotating random schedules being worked, low paying type jobs dealing with the public. mgt does have the ability to make better money if you get into the in crowd and pay some serious dues to get there but the hours again are retail."
good,"I enjoyed working here, but felt there was no room for advancement."
good,I didn't work here very long. I moved across the state for this job and was let down immediately by the broken promises. I told them in the interview that I was working in a job nearly 40 hours a week and making almost $12/hour and that if I was going to leave that job to come to work for them it had to be the same. They told me I would never fall below 30 hours a week and that the pay would be relatively the same. They lied to me I was getting 18 hours a week and making $9.50/hour. I would not go back to work for a company that has to lie in order to get employees!
good,We have a good boss in our department that don't micro management which made us work even harder to protect the company asset.
good,This is a billion dollar company and they can't stock copy paper and ink
good,"Good employer, limited benefits and salary increases are not anything to cheer about.  Worked at two stores."
good,Everything was fine at the Home Depot everyday.  Friendly co-workers.
good,my typical day at work would be to have a conversation with a complete stranger and getting to know them when they come through my line. Sometimes the customers would be regulars and sometimes they would be people I have never seen before. That's what I enjoyed about my job there.
good,"-Typical day would be complting I-9 forms, conducting new associate orientation, admistering training materials, forecasting , total store scheduling, any time off request, maitianing personnel files, conference calls, planning community events and associate events."
good,"No advancement opportunities, but its a good place to work with, the employees are all very friendly and family-like."
good,if you love helping people and interacting with people this is the job for you. you learn alot but the pay could be way better.
good,The only constant is change.  Customers service is the first priority.  I've learned how to merchandise.  Management changes frequently.  My staff is amazing.  My peers are very easy to work with.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who think they are entitled to a discount on everything.  The most enjoyable part is my staff
good,"It was a ""Big Box"" store. I liked working with the tools. The customers were interesting and I enjoyed teaching them and talking about tools."
good,My experience with this company was good for the most part.  I found that management had a lot of turnovers and most of the management team was not very good at handling personnel issues.
good,When I first started was a good job but when management change it became micromanagement from there
good,"it was a ok job and i would help costumers load, and drive to their house to bring them their merchendise"
good,"The company provided excellent training and compensation, including 401K, stock options and health benefits."
good,"Veru good place to work, I got to learn alot of things about construction and have to fix my own stuff at home."
good,I have worked at Home Depot for six months and its a great job.
good,The hours were bad but other than that everything was pretty much normal for most jobs. Nothing exciting or exceptional.
good,was a good company to work for until about 3 years ago. started to cut back on staff and hurt customer service.
good,I have a lot of problems with the loads that are sent to us. They are loaded improperly which cause my staff more work and their time.
good,"Low pay for new hires part time under 29 hours . favoritism. If your part of the group then you might be ok  was there for 7 years and was terminated for a forklift violation my first one even after giving them  information about other incidences that involve associates being hurt and no reprimand or termination was giving. all of which were nearly identical to my situation .having only missed two days in  seven years always on time Platinum Homer badge recipient numerous customer service awards you would think that would stand for something but just goes to show its not how hard you work but who you know . Also just to give you an idea I was makeing about 17 an hour and when they had to replace me they with the associate I had been training they only wanted to give him 11 an hr . Also managers are on there own system they will document you for being late yet  they are often late multiple days of the week with no recourse. Again with bonuses and awards and being a top performer rating on my review I was able to gross 36,500 so if your going fore a DH position dont sell your self short get that mony or it will take a very long time to make any thing"
good,"okay company, pay was low."
good,A good place to work and close to my home.  I really enjoy working here because I get a chance to meet a lot of new people.
good,My day included taking payment from customers and balancing  my drawer at the end of my shift.  I promoted Home Depot credit cards.  I also learned to work in other departments and did so when needed.  Management was very involved in our duties.  The hardest part of the job was standing on concrete for my shift.  The most enjoyable was my co-workers.  They were great.
good,I worked in all areas and that was fun for me as every day was different
good,Enjoy help the customers with orders and finding what they are in need of.
good,"typical work day involves, customer service, tasking within the department such as packing down essential products filling gaps in shelves and making the product presentable to the public."
good,"Great place to work I worked the front as a cashier, I enjoyed communicating with customers"
good,"A typcial day at work invovles me working with customers and helping them make their sections then,ordering and taking payment.

good,Great people and great products. A real customer first attititued exist there.
good,"Show up for shift, wait for time clock punch in go to sales floor and help customers. many different co-workers also working different shifts, hardest thing is to learn where everything is in the store,most enjoyable is teaching customers."
good,I worked as a cashier being told where I had to stand at all times and not being able to do anything else usually if there were no customers. They also almost never advance a cashier into a better department.
good,I would provide information of products to customers and assist in each customers specific needs. I learned about all the available consumer products for flooring and walls such as organization and shelving. As i would hand off a customer to another sales associate I would listen to the information given to them so that i would be more helpful to another customer in the future. My co-workers were a joy to work with and were very helpful in sharing their knowledge and experience with products. The hardest part of the job was in situations where I did not know how to help the customer but I would always find someone who could. The most enjoyable part was meeting the customers needs and assisting them successfully.
good,Lumber maintenance and customer service. Learned some information about lumber and building materials.
good,"The Home Depot is a very busy place to work, I've learned so much about home improvement and DIY jobs to where I can completely complete tasks at home and they come out very successful. The most enjoyable part of my job is to satisfy the customers."
good,I unloaded trucks at night and put product on the shelves were they belong
good,No Professional Growth and Training. Please look for the details in my resume.
good,A typical day at work would involve me either working outside in garden at the register or down in hardware at the register. Everyone there was very helpful and willing to help you when asked. The work environment was very warm and inviting.
good,"Transferred with this company upon request of parents, due to their failing health.  Depending on store, various positions were held."
good,customer service helping customers if they need to find something
good,"Expanded my knowledge of tools,and products to complete ant project."
good,It was very enjoyable to work the co-workers and customers. The company however lacks an interest in the employees well being.
good,What I learned there was how to deal with different people. A typical day was helping people with any questions that they had
good,"I enjoy working at Home Depot everyday is different, customer focus is number one, solving customer issues and multitasking comes easy to me. I am a people person. I believe everyone should enjoy a positive shopping experience. The hardest part of the  job is trying to handle a lot of customers at once, which  do in each department on a daily basics."
good,Good for those that are looking for entry experience. Mostly high school graduates.
good,But there is no full time any more its a good atmosphere the people that work there but some of the supervise don't do anything
good,I enjoy the people there. They are friendly and laid back. I have made many friendships. Management is pretty easy to work with. I like to help the  customers and feel I have made some personal friends with many of them.
good,A typical day at work is a fast paced inventory driven day. I have learned a lot of the home depot returns process and the logistic part of a return. Management works with you and listens to your concerns with an open door policy. The hardest part of the day is not leaving work behind with the sales increasing it is always work to do. The most enjoyable part of my day is working with my interanl partners and learning from them daily.
good,Worked overnight at the store stocking and fixing the store up. Moved to the shipping and receiving team to bring in incoming products and freight to be put away and stocked on shelves.
good,"I enjoyed the ability to balance the vault for the company everyday."
good,"A typical day for me was I go to work, I provided customers with a speedy, friendly, and accurate service, and I then go home.  The process is repeated Monday thru Friday.

good,its an ok job fun enviorment and friendly its fun to help customers
good,i would print my work out on the computer every morning then drive to the listed home depot i was working out of to pick up my customers door. i would thuroughly inspect the product before it left the store to ensure there wsouldnt be any complaints from the customer and if it was damaged i would call them and explain and seek further instructions. after that i would go to the listed house and take out there old door put in the new one and when the customer is satisfied i recieved a signiture and was able to go home.
good,"A typical day requires a lot of walking, helping customers, and lifting heavy objects. Most co-workers and management are helpful"
good,I did not enjoy working for this company. The communication between staff and management needs work.
good,Working in Home Depot has enhanced my knowledge in lumber and building materials. My goal in life is to be a contractor and i believe this job has helped my skills set.
good,"good place to work, small company, friendly co workers, flexible hours, decent benefits, we had a breakfast club that people brought food every Friday"
good,A typical day at work was constant. Working at Home Depot I learned that customers just want to get what they need inside the store and exit in a respectful timely manner.
good,"Home depot was a good place to work for, despite the cut backs that made work a lot harder, do to the bad economy at the time. The experience was a memorable one despite the set backs. They lived up to good work ethics proper rest and health but failed to meet that acceptation with part time full time employees do to the bad economy at the time. My most enjoyable moments was getting everything done at the end of my sift and getting a pat on the back with a job well done and a cool drink from the hot sun.Despite not being able at the time to meet there acceptations at the time do to medical reasons it was a memorable experience in responsibility."
good,"Operating forklifts, electric pallet jacks, and reach-trucks. Learned how to build up sheetrock, mix concrete, install insulation. Hardest part of the job was the scheduling. And the most enjoyable part was learning how to build objects and operating machinery."
good,I was in charge of large sums of money and great customer service. Since I was the last person the customer came in contact with customer service was a must. The hardest part of this job was working with frustrated customers but sometimes the best way to deal with frustration is to kill it with kindness and that's the enjoyable part of that job.
good,"Because of low morale in the work place and not enough management support it has become a very difficult place to work. The incentives are high, there are nice bonus potentials, the associates  do back each other up however the support is lacking in the management level.  A typical day at work consists of making sure the department you are scheduled in is stocked and ready to shop for best customer experience, the worst is having no one in the department to assist you or to break you for lunch and short breaks due to lack of scheduling, other wise a fun place to work if you like retail"
good,Customer service.  Making sure the customer has everything that they need to compleate the job.
good,"In this job, on a regular day, I arrive a few hours before my shift to settle in. I briefly analyze the work load and try to build a personal goal of completion every day. As a self starter, I get right to work as soon as I have a game plan, and I try to complete my work in an organized and timely manner without compromise. These tasks include but are not limited to staging, packing out and storing merchandise as well as operating of fork lifts and order pickers. I mostly enjoy the presense of my supervisor who always has a way to fill in the gaps in work that I cannot myself. The hardest part is definitely the physical aspect job has taken a toll on me, whether it be both physical, or mental. In honesty it's not a choice of career. It's just temporary until I find something better."
good,"Day of work consist of; watering the plants, fast friendly customer service, stock work, merchandising"
good,I was certified to use 5 different machines to load and unload shipment. I also learned their system of keeping track of merchandise and the correct paperwork process when checking the in shipment and checking it out. This is a very important responsibility because the slightest mistake can totally mess up Home Depots inventory.
good,"Helping Customers with questions and also helping them load items purchased. I learned the basics of electrical, plumbing, and paint. Co-workers were all very helpful if they were specialists in every department. The hardest part of the job was when it got really busy and helping several customers at once. The most enjoyable part was learning how things work and then being able to pass that information to the customers."
good,"Worked as expeditor, service desk supervisor, and a flooring specialist. Everyday was different. Ran large installation services department. Was in charge of taking care of all customer care issues at the service desk. Most employees had negative personalities. Learned many management skills while having 4 employees underneath myself."
good,wouldn't work there again management does not know how to manage people people there are only out for theme self's
good,Everyone was friendly on a day to day basis.  Management was easy to talk to when you needed someone and a manager was always on duty. The hardest part of the job was trying to run 3 different departments at one time.  It was hard to please all the customers at once because at times you were the only one.  The best part of the job was just the atmosphere.  People were a joy to be around.
good,"Typical day at work:"
good,I enjoyed working at home-depot because i enjoy home improvement projects and i like to share my experience with the novice builders who are unaware of what they require for completion of tasks.  A typical day would include me walking around the aisles and making sure that the customers are able to find the product that they need quickly.  The supervisor disregarded customers concerns and was more focused on selling while my co-workers and manager made the work place a fun place to be.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when someone would come in with a project i have previously done and i was able to give them my insight on some of the problems that i faced so they are aware.
good,"started as a great company,taking care of its people.The associates are becoming less important.  Great place to learn merchandising skills. Interacting with customers and co-workers was most enjoyable at Home Depot."
good,Corporate environment with little pay. Very little room for advancement.
good,"This is a good company to grow a career in retail sales, excellent management support."
good,it used to be home depot would take care of their employees. now they are catching up to the new age where they only hire part time kids to come in and screw them over by not giving them full time benefits and starting them close to minimal wage
good,"During a work day, I'm focused on helping customers first. Second to that, I attend to several reports that are checked weekly/daily for discrepancies. I most enjoy communicating with others to expedite customer orders. Customers are happy knowing we do everything we can to make their projects successful, efficient, and affordable. Seeing that customer satisfaction is a great feeling."
good,"Nice place to work, management is great. learn a lot"
good,"I worked at Home Depot #3639 and the experience was average compared to other retail companies."
good,"Work Monday-Friday."
good,Great place to gain experience but needs to take employees opinions in to consideration more.
good,This job is pretty nice for people who are new to the warehouse field. You get to learn lots of new processing techniques and ways to make your work load easy for the day
good,"Sell paint, educate customers on different paint products and painting techniques. I learned about paint and painting techniques. Management was constantly changing. Coworkers were helpful. Hardest part was finding product that hadn't been given the proper location. Most enjoyable was mixing paint and helping customers choose complimentary colors."
good,Great environment but at times too hectic considering I was a full time student. Great co workers and great management
good,"a typical day at work would be fast and hardworking"
good,come in make sure store was ready for the day  greet all customer ask if they need help if so get it done and back out to the floor make sue shelf were full and if not jump on forklift and make it happen
good,The early part of your shift is to stock freight and make sure your dept is clean.Between 10am to 2 pm focus on customer service.Every manager will give you something different to work on. The right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing.Co- workers are great. .
good,"I worked night shift, stocking shelves and cleaning my work area ,I did a lot of lifting standing and walking. I also had to do reports for inventory purposes.Everyone was very nice and supportive , they helped you if you need them ,the management was also very nice and helpful. The hardest part of the job was getting hours to work. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a lot of different people"
good,I'm a hard working person good customer services good working with machines like forklift etc loves working with my co-workers helpfull and i enjoy it.
good,i really like working for the co. i have learn so much about this company in from this company. my co workers make it feel like a family . the hardest part of this job is upset customers .the most enjoyable is the work place it self
good,ok place to work.. cool people everyone got alone including management
good,"In my years at the Home Depot, Ive come to sort of a love/hate relationship with the company. While the company itself is great on the outside looking in, its policies are ever changing every bi weekly or monthly period. There isn't anything I cannot do on the job, as I drive two different machines on the regular, to ensure customers are getting the product they need, the shelves are properly filled, and inventory is correctly managed. A typical day at work includes driving machinery, working hand & hand with the asset protection crew to ensure that high shrink products are well protected, and occasionally making sure that out of stock items are being ordered. Management at my store in particular isn't the best, but somehow they make things flow. However, with the company downsizing and getting rid of full timers, the spots that individuals are working hard for are going to associates that transfer in, instead of those who've been at my store already."
good,its your typical work place  learned a lot about customer support
good,"This job was just a stepping stone for me to bigger and better opportunities. While working at this establishment, the days were enjoyable.The staff was very helpful with getting to know the different aspects of this job. "
good,"Working as a cashier was easy. Occasionally you have to help people load really heavy things into their vehicles. Management was decent. Co-workers were tolerable at worst, but overall enjoyable. The hardest part was occasionally being put out in the lot to pick up carts. It was especially awful during the hot summer months. The most enjoyable part was working in the garden area."
good,"a day at home depot is providing customer service ,stocking ,loading .unloading, etc. I have learn to deal with any situations in any matter or from responsible and safety . work good with co workers in any race or back ground. love customer service"
good,Be prepared to run tons of leads at all hours.  Wear and tear on your personal vehicle with no mileage reimbursement.  The pros are you are representing the largest home improvement company and that certainly gives you clout.  The cons are the pricing structures are out of touch with the market place and we expected to sell based on the Home Depot name regardless of price.  There is no financial stability as the position is strickly commission.
good,I ring up customers and handle their big orders.  provide great customer service to all customers. Most regular customers already know me and most transactions run smooth and it help.  I love interacting with people
good,"slow paced, heavy lifting and convenient schedule for part-time workers"
good,"Design Consultant for Interior and Exterior Window Treatments"
good,"A typical day at home depot would be helping customers, driving a fork-lift, stocking shelves, and building displays. I've learned a great deal from home depot through their training courses and hands on training. Some of the managers are good but there is a definite lack of communication between them and the associates. Overall I would rate my co-workers average, but the ones in my department always leave me to do a job that our supervisor gave us to do and they'll go and pretty much hide. the most enjoyable part of my job has to be building displays and driving lift equipment and occasionally removing the rat snakes from the garden area before a customer get injured."
good,"Boring, could not wait for the days to be over so I can go home. Good part is that there are a lot of open slots in different departments. Seen people get promoted when there is an opening."
good,"When i have a job i believe in being early not just in time, also i believe i am there to work and not create a social life. I feel that you need to make sure you do the best job you can and i am always eager to learn more then just my positon"
good,"Everyone got along, the work environment was very pleasant, work schedules did clash at times, overall a good workplace, but not really a compensating/understanding working establishment."
good,"Responsible for loading and unloading of trucks and inventory maintenance."
good,"Provided construction/product sales and assistance to contractors and homeowners; i.e., delivered effective sales presentations to sell merchandising selection within departments, handled and monies, and assured positive customer relations. Created promotional displays. Maintained and stocked merchandise utilizing fork lift. Oversaw inventory control. Trained junior associates. Collaborated with sales reps to target specific products"
good,"good place to learn work ethic, and responsibility, good "
good,"Enjoyed co-workers"
good,Temp Job load in truck and help people to unload while i drive forklift
good,Fast paced envoinment causing its employees to stay on their toes.
good,"I learned a lot about raw materials, and other aspects of home decor and electronics. Great place to work"
good,"A lot of processes and reports on a daily basis.  I love the job, I just want to advance.  I learned better ways to multi-task, and to get even more done with less than I ever thought I could.  My fellow team members are a great asset, but not recognized enough for their efforts.  I have great respect for the business and the efforts that go into running such a big company.  The hardest part of the job is working very hard but not being recognized for the efforts."
good,"clock in clock out. I learned that to be a cashier is demanding but fun."
good,"A good place to work in learning customer service skills,as well as many training modules for further product knowledge."
good,Good work experience for retail training.Understanding product knowledge and learning customer service experience.Sometimes a lot of heavy lifting involved.
good,Great Place to work. wish that it didn't have to be seasonal.
good,"Great team work ethic, but despite hard work you could not get full time until you are there for a year or more and they limit your hours to 23-24 but if you take a full time job they will not let you cut back on your hours. They took several full time positions and made them part time to safe money in benefits. "
good,"Solid Company, good training, & the starting pay is decent. The fellow employees who want to get ahead, or who are afraid of losing their jobs want to see you fail, and help to get rid of you. "
good,"Meet lots of people"
good,worked three different positions in eleven months. The most enjoyable was customer service/lead generator
good,"If you are interested in starting a career in retail, The Home Depot is a good place to work.  It offers comprehensive benefits and plenty of advancement opportunities for hourly associates."
good,"If you can successfully work at the Home Depot, then you can work in any retail job after here.  There is a lot expected of you every day.  "
good," I am in a supervisor position where I supervise 15-20 cashiers. Adjusting breaks and where the cashiers will be placed to work for the da. Also to make sure the cahsiers are working to their ability to do so. I also work very well in customer service. At The Home Depot customer service is important and so we make sure that we do is possible to make that happen."
good,"The Home Depot is a terrific company to work for. Customer service is the at the pinnacle of the company's goals and values. As a cashier I was given the opportunity to assist customer's with inquiries and solve their problems. This position required me to interact with people, which at first I was shy about. Thus, my social skills were increased. "
good,answered and directed customers to desired departments and worked in other departments as well such as the vault and scheduling 
good,    A typical day at work is productive. I have learned that fulfilling someone's needs makes a happy and lifetime customer. I feel that I have a good working relationship with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is completing the task at hand with not enough resources.The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with my fellow co-workers and customers.
good,"Great job over all, learned about time management and lifting techniques. co-workers were great people to work with. Hardest part of freight team is leaving at 5am every day. besides that, wonderful."
good,"A great work experience "
good,"Answered phones and assisted customers in selecting and ordering special order products"
good,on a typical day we get slammed with freight : some days we don't and it makes everyone's day easier
good,I stock the freight on the shelves. I work with a team that is dedicated to getting the job done. The managers are nice and understanding with all associates. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a close team that is all working towards the same goal.
good,Overall the company was very structured and micro managed. Tedious and time consuming work.
good,"I would come in at 7am and clock in and my day would start. I listened to contractors and what they were doing. Then I would put together a list of materials that would need for that job. Sometimes it would be fast and sometimes it would take a couple of hours, depending on the size of the job. I had a blast at what I did. Management was good. My co-workers were great. I always got along with everyone. through the coarse of my 10 years with the depot I learned how ton lay any type of floor and teach customers how to do it, I taught hands on classes. I also learned how to wire houses and all your electrical needs. I also taught classes in electrical and lighting. I learned how to put in doors, windows, thresholds and molding, and drywall, I also learned how to frame houses. I don't think there was a part of my job that was hard. I always had fun with whatever I did."
good,it was very easy. stocking was like a joke and there was a lot of downtime waiting to go home. at the time I wasn't getting enough hours but it was still a pretty good job.
good,"A typical day at work for me was to come in, water plants, & that was basically it all day. I did not like working there. There were so many employees that I seemed to just be another face."
good,I enjoy working at Home Depot. They take good care of their employees.
good,"- Culture and values tend to run high. Great atmosphere between coworkers / peers."
good,"Definitely not a 9-5 job."

good,"Management were helpful, co-workers all got a long well, and customers were always greatful for the help you provided"
good,"A typical day of work at my Home Depot location consisted of multiple tasks, including helping clients load & unload products, offering solutions to home improvement issues & at times, helping with trahsactions.  I had no prior experience working in home improvement outside of helping my father with different projects, so everything I learned about the products & their functions was brand new knowledge.  My management team was good, but again, consistent team building with co-workers was difficult due to turnover.  The hardest part of the job was patience with the retail environment, but the most enjoyable part was a satisfied customer"
good,I like working for the company but the pay could have been better.
good,"Customers are generally very easy to get along with and very knowledgeable on their own.  My Home Depot did not have a cart corral and so I would regularly have to go out and collect them all.  Between that and some very heavy items that people needed help loading into their cars, this job can be very physically demanding."
good,"Good Job but dead end if you are looking for growth.  "
good,"Good sales experience, Co-Workers were friendly and helpful. Worked directly for store manager who was motivating and supportive."
good,"   good place to learn a lot about home improvement/helpful friendly co-workers/management lacked some skills,needed improvement/  great place to set a career in this field of business and to advance to management."
good,"Advancement opportunities available for associates who are friends of management. Disappointed that knowledge and skills, plus performance were secondary to friendships when advancement opportunities were available. Otherwise, a good rapport with fellow associates although staffing was often insufficient which tended to cause tension. A good place to work for students wanting part time work during the summer, as long as availability is very open."
good,"Management is well compensated but earns every penny and then some. Workload and expectations are very high, greatest challenge is ensuring the resources to execute which often means you often manage the volume of productivity and struggle with the quality of it. culture is divided - company's historic values and business models vs modern, mature retail world."
good,"good people to work with,most managers are great.some were not family oriented"
good,Enjoyed the people I worked with and the knowledge I gained.
good,i check peoples merchandise out and help them decide on product to buy for the right project.
good,"Inteereesting job, meeting new peoope dail, is in a somewhat dangerrous warehouse type ocaion"
good,"Schedules are constantly shifting, and no day is at all like the one before. I've learned how to think on my feet and stay afloat in a vibrant customer service environment. There are plenty of drawbacks though, and I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone with a short fuse. There is little communication between supervisors or management, so we wind up with conflicting instructions much of the time. It's rewarding when things go well though, and I manage to locate the particular item that a customer has their eye on, or when a returning customer applauds my performance on a previous visit. "
good,"The Home Depot is a great company. My day was usually steady-paced, but was easy to manage once I developed a routine. My co-workers made working fun while still managing to get work done."
good,I really enjoyed this company because I got a chance to learn about home improvement I enjoy  learning new things 
good,"High volume environment , fast pace with emphasis on customer service and  employee engagement .Worked daily with sales associates and  department managers ,reviewing  daily sales, under performing categories in order to fine ways to maximize and improve  sales ,productivity and customer service. ."
good,"Variable hours, sometimes start at 4 am, and sometimes end at 11 pm, hard work lifting 50 lb's on regular basis, fast pace, but it was fun helping customers."
good,Low pay and you don't even get an employee discount. Managers hate to be called even if they are the only ones who can help you...such as manager overrides and keys.
good,"Working with customers every day to make sure their projects were started in the right direction; learned a lot about tiling, flooring, and decor; management made you feel like family and still keeps in touch regularly; co-workers treat you properly and are helpful; hardest part of the job was running the carpet machine by yourself and moving pallets of tile by yourself; most enjoyable part of the job was customer interaction and friendships made with co-workers and management"
good,I enjoyed being a head cashier at Bullhead location very busy with all the construction work going on in this town. Had good cashiers to work with.
good,Good place for a career starter. Retail hours are a con and management is forever changing.
good,"a lot of miserable lazy people, favoritism and lack of communication,but I like working with my co-workers in my department they are very intelligent and skilled people"
good,I would have to say that cross training is a problem if you are a cashier.

good,"steady 40 Hours no over time "
good,"Home Depot was a productive and fun workplace, however management didn't give part timers enough hours. Home Depot also promoted employees givng them a bigger workload but only giving a quarter raise regardless of how long you've been with company."
good,"Chaotic working with alot of old people. I sensed alot of racism while working here, terrible customer service except in my department (electrical)."
good,home depot is a great place to work. especially on Sunday they bought us food. 
good,"A typical day is alright, but I like when its busy because it makes the time go by faster. I've learned a lot working in this type of business. The management is getting better because at one time the store manager that we had didn't tell you anything; but the other managers are very friendly and easy to get along with. My co-workers are very nice, we all work together as a TEAM. The hardest part about working here is really nothing its a very easy job. The most enjoyable part about working at this store is dealing and talking to the customers. "
good,Prepared me to be the best manager I can be and learned what it is to be a team player.
good,loading unloading pushing sales customer satisfactory is the main priority
good,Worked with remodeling customers. Assisted customers with product selections and design.
good,Not a bad place to work. good people. stay active and busy. good place to get a good sweat on 
good,"The home depot provides an environment that is educational, productive and safe. I have learned many aspects of home improvement and gained some skills in installation sales. My co-workers are hard working, fun and friendly.I get along very well with my management team. The job I have at home depot is really not hard but it can be a little tedious. I prefer to work with people rather than products. "
good,Very busy work place. You can get all the training needed to do a good job. Their is always training material availible.
good,"Learned excellent customer service, enjoyed the atmosphere."
good,In the beginning other co workers are nice and friendly. They dont appreciate your  hard work and the schedule varies. working their was ok but i wouldnt reapply their again.
good,Great work experience.  Learned many valuable things on the job.  Would definitely recommend this position to someone looking for a great entry-level bookkeeping position.
good,"-cashier,assist customers,clean"
good,This job will help you get your job skills in retail.  The hours is the hardest part of the job they require a lot of your time.
good,The environment in the call center building is extremely hostile. I would ever want to work within that department ever again.
good,I always enjoy customer service on products I am knowledgeable about. 
good,Normal retail job. Working outside in the garden center was enjoyable.
good,fun laid back environment to work in. Lots of cool co-workers who really help one another succeed and get better.
good,Like the people i worked with and the job in tools was fine .But did not like cleaning under shelf's as it mad me sick . 
good,"I loved this job because it was very busy and fast paced and thats what type of person I am, I dont keep still I keep it going and getting everything done on time."
good,"Start at 9:30pm and punch out at 6am, stead and fast pace."
good,Process all cashier duties
good,The Home Depot is a strong company that instills a hard work ethic.
good,"Though this job has the typical problems that come with working in retail, The Home Depot really does try to make a nice enviroment for its employees"
good,Great company to work for. Home Depot was the best job I ever had.
good,"I learned a lot about teamwork, excellence in customer service and responsibility in the workplace."
good,"this job. It cool working there .the staff are friendly but ,some are too friendly."
good,Not too fond of the management and the retail enbviorment. sales and people can be rude
good,I really enjoyed working there. Great Management I learned a lot about retail.
good,"The Home Depot helped me improve my customer service skills. I enjoyed working in a team-work enviroment. I recieved the opportunity to shadow the store managers on his daily job duties. The hardest part of this job was dealing with angry customers, but i became great with dealing wit upset customers. I enjoyed helping customers find their desires."
good,Friendly work enviroment alwyas something to do only problem is I would like to have been treated with trust that i know what I'm doing and know how to do it i didnt like being watched the whole time while I work
good,On a daily bases I would assemble displays that will help to promote the company products that the vendor had made a contract with home depot to make products visible to possible customers.
good,A lot of bureaucracy and change like any big company. Overall good place to start a career at the corporate level
good,I worked here for 2years. I worked freight team ran a register and customer desk. This company has many benefits . Not only medical but they have programs that can provide college money for you and your family members.The have a homer fund to help out with cash for employees having a hard time. I cant even name how many benefits they offer there are some many. I worked at Lowes for many years and they dont even compare to my time spent at home depot. Management was great at leading team work ethics ...the best group of people ive ever worked for and with. I had to leave this company due to lack of hours. After 2 years I was never made full time . I felt that advancement was never going to happen for me. I had great evaluations and managers gave great references to my new full time employeement. The first time I wanted to work for someone but couldnt afford to.
good,Home Depot can be a great place to work. It's too bad the pay is far too low (especially considering the labor involved) and management can be belligerent.
good,"Job requires patience, your dealing with hundreds of people every week including those you work with most employees last about five years that's a high turnover rate. You don't make much more than your starting rate, so bargain about your starting rate before you take the job."
good,i enjoy working at the home depot but theres no way i can continue to work crazy hours when i have a 4yr old and im a single mother with little to no help as far as sitters
good,"Bonne emploi pour l'été, agréable pour les amateurs de bois, outils et rénovation."
good,I started after Hurricane Katrina to help the city get back on its feet. I got along with everyone including the managers and department supervisors. I received the Cashiers Excellence Award. I left when I was 7 months pregnant and never returned.
good,"I really enjoy helping people in general, but in this case I got to explain how to put their projects together."
good,looking for a part time position .highly motivated and enjoyable personality.
good,Pretty fast pace company.I would design kitchen ect for customers. I had to maintain detailed files for each customer. I would close sales as well as process the sales through the cash register. Along with working in design I worked all the areas of the store providing cutomer service to all customers. I enjoyed my co-workers. I did not care for all of the standing and lifting cabinets. I enyoyed working with all the customers.
good,"very nice place to work, when you are a good working, i worked on the freight team so i was guaranteed my hours."
good,Busy environment working with the general public. Learned extensively about paints and techniques. Management not real flexible. Co-workers seemed disenchanted for the mostr part
good,"I work M-F 6-3 everyweek making sure contractors are satisfied with there home depot expierence. Pulling orders , Loading heavy merchandise , cutting wood. I love the people I work with but I cant take the lack of pay im recieving these days with the hard work I put in day in day out."
good,Typical Retail Job. Can be very fast paced which is good if you like to keep busy. Management is usually fair and approachable.Best part of this job is the people.
good,many task required of you during the day. i have learned quite a bit from running the saws to the wire machine and lift equipment.
good,"My EVERYDAY task consist of picking up after the shift before me, while at the same time completing my own assignments, and to top it off, doing the job of others that are too lazy to do it for themselves (Management orders). My co-workers are great, they are the ones that really keep me going. I've been there 2 years now and i feel no type of job security or growth within this field, but i have learned so much about warehouse management along the way."
good,very fun place to work the customers can be amazing and the time fly's because its always busy but not enough hours to live off of.
good,"A typical work day at home depot for me, is very fast paced and attention to detail. All kinds of customers, and solving problemings are at hand. I do my best to satisfy each customer and leave them with a smile on their faces. I count my change strip and send it up each time, I reach over a certain amount of cash. I learn new customer service problems each day and this only makes me more experienced by the day."
good,"Some days can be stressful although the work environment is very comfortable. Not enough employees within the high end departments. I personally learned a lot while working with the company for the past five years. The management team is pretty stable. Moreover, not everyone is on the same page. The co-workers all respect one another and willing to help each other when needed. The hardest part of the job is actually receiving good help. No even is willing to take on certain challenges with out being baby sat. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the customers leave happy. Also building a relationship with the customer and expecting to see them again in the near future."
good,"Helped with Customer Service, Special Orders, Returns and Refunds."
good,This is a good company to work for as long as you have a good store management and good inventory.
good,"uso del sistema manhatan, manejo del personal, habilidad en captura de datos, trabajo bajo presion, saber manejarse en el area operativa"
good,Customer service job that was part time and got to experience first hand the retail business lifestyle
good,It's an okay company to work for although the benefits aren't that great and i feel they could compensate their employees better since a lot of them are there and that is their primary source of income.
good,My work day at The Home Depot can be pretty hectic sometimes. There are reports to be completed along with dealing with customer issues. At the Service Desk we also have to process returns for our customers and answer all incoming phone calls. Most of the time there is only one person scheduled at the desk which makes for a very busy day. I very rarely take a 15 minute break.... the only break I get per day is my 1 hour lunchbreak. The thing that makes it all worthwhile is when I am helping a customer with an issue on an order or whatever the case may be and having them walk away satisfied and with a smile on their faces. That is when I know I have done my job to the best of my ability!!!
good,"Customer service, customer service, overtime I have been exposed to every aspect to home and commercial improvement,forklift, ordering building materials, captain of the Do-It-Herself clinic, my co-workers are great to work with, there is always someone in the management team with a better knowledge and skill to make the work environment workable and pleasant, overall The Home Depot is a great place to work part time"
good,it was a good place to work. it was fun .you help customers find things wait on them .
good,"Overall, this is a great company to work for. I learned many things from working here. Everything was enjoyable about this job"
good,My co-workers are enjoyable to work with. I enjoy talking with the customers and in some way helping to resolve their issues or get them to the approriate person or department for assistance. While the calls can sometimes become extreme...remembering it is not a personal attack is the key to remaining calm.
good,i basically helped customers find exactly what they needed. when there wasn't so many customers i had to stock all the new product and make my department clean
good,"The Home Depot family was good at taking care of its employees and customers, My experience with the upper chain was pleasant and I didnt have any complaints. The only problems I did have was that the work was too strenuous for the pay that the freight department was doing. The freight department worked the hardest but got paid the least, which was minimum wage."
good,"Enjoy working with Staff and Team work. Committed to customer service with the customers, enjoying helping them with their projects and their excitement."
good,Really uplifting people. great environment. good benefits
good,"Greet customers in friendly matter, find out where product are and know about the product. Ring up customers."
good,Always somethig to do enjoyed helping customers with their shopping needs
good,"A good store to work at, some of the management needs improvement on their skills working with employees. HR needs some work. Not enough available full-time positions for associates who could work those positions."
good,My typical work day starts at 3pm and lasts until 12 am. I start staging freight at 5 pm and start stocking selves shortly after that.
good,work is constant not a lot of down time. i learned my merchandising skills and what it takes to help customers identify and purchase products.management and co-workers help with motivation and keeping a fast pace. the most hardest part of my job locating inventory when its not in its designated location.
good,its ok if you trying to get by the pay is not so great only thing i enjoy is just the bonus check
good,"A typical day at work really depends on what time of the year. Winter months are always the slowest.Summer time everyone wants to redo their gardens,build new decks etc.But generally listening to the customer recommending the right tool for their project.I've learned alot about tools and their uses.Management are always there to help solve any problems that may arise.My co-workers are excellent to work with.There is no hardest part of the job i enjoy what i do."
good,Customer service should be focused on more rather than paper work and tasks
good,Constantly learning something new each day I work...management is pretty much on point and most of the people I work with I enjoy.
good,Loved being able to assist customers. Managment was always around. I liked my co- workers. One downfall was no matter how busy I stayed time always went by slow.
good,This is a good job to start with as a a beginning job. There are ways to move up in this company.
good,my shift was from 7am to 4pm help customers with specail orders down stock items in my department
good,"I enjoyed working for home depot, my co-workers treated me with respect but i found that my ability to go above and beyond my duties was somewhat limited and possibilities for advancement were hindered"
good,"Millwork Specialist, direct source for customers interested in doors, windows, moldings, building materials. Extensive customer service, sales and communication skills were qualities essential to the success of the job."
good,"Nice job, and learned a lot of things I could use around the house."
good,"A very fast pasted work place. Friendly co workers, worked as a non profit orginization with church youth."
good,It was an alright job. I learned alot about home construction/decorating/gardening. I enjoyed running the Kids Workshop the most. I got to experience alot of good times with the kids and their parents when building things like mini tool boxes and birdhouses. I even had extra workshops throughout the week with Girl Scout troops and Doodlebugs. The only thing I didn't like was that there were too many corporate rules for every store that might not have been the best for each individual business area.
good,"At Home Depot we were consistantly busy, which was a good thing, because the day went quickly. For the most part my experience was a positive one, even though we had, as would be expected the occasional customer with a bad experience, but we did our best to rectify the situation."
good,The job itself wasnt that bad. The management could have been better and more understanding to their crew members and customers. The job was fun when there was orders to fill but I was working there during the time when the housing market was going down. SO not a lot of work to be done.
good,A typical day at work consists of greeting and solving a customers home improvement needs. If closing the shift still the same the difference is I stock and maintain the shelve making them look grand opening ready for the opener. As an opener you fill the tint dispensing machines walk the department and do a safety check.
good,"Fun, fast paced and friendly co-workers. Never a dull moment in a big store to take care of."
good,This call center was no different from any other except that the diversity among the employees help to break the daily monotony and allow for a fun experience.
good,Fluxuating schedule which was tough at times due to newborn baby then but it was fun helping out customers and deciding on what materials they need for their project. I learned alot about lumber/building materials which I didnt even know how to mix concrete before I started working there. Management was I guess your average retail managers which were by the book people. Co-workers were friendly to help you out in your department as long as they werent too busy in their own. Times were tough when you had a customer who didnt speak English very well and didnt really know what they needed and like always inventory was pretty tough as everyone seemed to be in a panic when the time came. I enjoyed helping the customers. Everything was a new challenge which kept my mind busy the whole time I was there.
good,"Same as Lowes, again, different color, different name! The usual fast paced environment for a big-box retailer. Lots of knowledgeable people, customers traffic is high (name recognition of the store), some room for advancement as they typically hire ""outside"" the store for management positions."
good,It has good benefits and its a good place to work . I had customers that were regulars and learning new things was good for my brain.
good,"a typical day consist of helping customer and maintaining the department in check, which includes cleaning and restocking."
good,"Typical day at work review orders for the day, pick the orders, confirm orders, file paperwork, contact delivery drivers, load truck with items via forklift, help around store, unload trucks, stock shelves. A little bit of everything."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company, The employees we very friendly however It was very difficult to advance in this business, and the night hours were hard for me considering I had a family."
good,"Day at the job customer service, sales, stocking, recovering, cashier, traveling to other stores. Co-workers were awesome. There was not honestly no hard part about this job. I enjoy enteracting with customers."
good,good place to work if you like regular routine and nothing terribly exciting. Not a lot of critical thinking involved but can be fun with the right attitude.
good,"Check patrol reports updates,customer service,protection of customers and employees"
good,Quality guy had it out for everyone. Thats my only complaint otherwise the job was tolerable.
good,the last position I held was in the installation call center. There were a lot of personality conflicts and poor management. We took calls from our installers and their customers and tried to resolve any job site issues. I did enjoy the immediate group I worked with. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was the building of relationships.
good,No room for advacnement and i am part time and need a full time job.
good,"nothing special...just typical sales job. listen to customer complaints, offer false apologies for mistakes of other employees."
good,enjoy helping customers learned a lot about the products and services we carry and provide
good,Home Depot. We all know about the big box stores! Long hours and the shifts are always different
good,• Responsible for daily sales
good,"Working here taught me how to push through. I enjoyed working here for the most part, but management left little to be desired for."
good,A typical day at The Home Depot was ringing out customers purchases and answering phone lines associated with merchandise sold in warehouse. While there I learned how to do minor work in my home such as putting up shower heads and making bird houses. The management team there was good. My co-workers there was great I established some great relationships while there. The hardest part about the job was doing two things at a time. It was a great feeling because I like to feel needed just at times it could get very hectic because my main job there was a PBX Data Entry Operator but when needed there was a demand for me to be a cashier. The most enjoyable part was helping the customers and being very knowledgeable about the business.
good,"Good job, easy work. Just had to find another job so I could get more hours and higher wages."
good,Structured
good,"I was a cashier, Must make sure that every customer has found all the items they were looking for, Promote the Home Depot Credit Card; have new customers sign up. Also worked in other departments in Home Depot."
good,The Co-Workers made this job an enjoyable place the workload was quite demanding.
good,"I worked two jobs starting Home Depot, and when i started school i chose to stay with them. I was let go for a customer complaint that I believe was out of jealousy from my boss. I worked well with the people and associates, always willing to help and was enjoyed and thanked by fellow associates on daily basis. My boss was and is a anti social type person which is my opposite and would not give me direction face to face but through other management. I worked and had good relations with every other person/s there."
good,Customers are rude at times. Very fast paced so the time flies by.
good,This position was just ok. There was nothing spectacular about working here or anything but the people were fun to be around and easy to get along with.
good,If you are young or semi-retired this is the job for you unless you are desirous to go the retail management route than it may be a rewarding experience
good,"As a manager you had to be skilled at almost everything that your associates would do (cut pipe, cut lumber, mix paint, drive the forklift etc.) You never would know when a customer might need help with something and due to a call out there was no one there to help them. The holiday parties were fantastic with many gifts and great food. There were many knowledgeable associates that were great to work with and I still keep in contact with today."
good,"What I learned was how to organize different products in the retail field, in great customer service advice. Management was terrible because they was young in didn't take there jobs serious at this store I was at. The hardest part is dealing with being unorganized. Getting through the day. and learning new products everyday."
good,a typical day started off at 5 am and ended at 2 pm. i started my day off cheking the orders for today and the deliveries for yesterday.i then print out the pull sheet and go pick orders according to schedule. i then will contact the driver and inform him on how many orders we have. then load orders. i learned all the above. Managemnet was cool.Co-workers were cool. The hardest part of the job getting some orders. the most enjoyable part of the job getting paid
good,hitting your goal is key in being a cashier here. Accounts are needed.
good,"Nice company trying to complete each day, challenging staffing requirements"
good,Assist and educate customers about product and services that are provided.
good,"Moved up the company chain fairly quickly, lots to learn, self motivated company."
good,Home Depot is a good fast placed to work for I have learned a lot from there how to manage others and customer service. The co workers there are so undependable that it make your job 10 times harder due to all the call outs. Management there is ok but when you need help sometimes it is hard to get a hold of one. I do love my job I love helping others and managing other because i get to teach them their job and they can come to me for anything thry need help with.
good,too many hours for a part time position wages below avg. people were friendly and job training was excellent
good,get to do different things within job like working on warehouse or delivering orders around DFW.
good,This job was a wonderful opportunity to learn how to provide the best customer service. I learned a lot about home projects and what tools and products were needed for the job. I learned how to deal with unhappy customers and sales through the telephone.
good,"good company but need another lead,i had a good service at the company every single day"
good,"Everything was very structured and straight forward. You are given specific tasks and are able perform well because you know what is expected. The management hovered a little, but nothing ridiculous."
good,"Worked with customers daily, setting up dflooring installs and special orders."
good,Handled large cash and credit card transactions. Assisted and directed customers to correct area of interest. Sorted and organized merchandise for different departments. Zoned near by department to create a sterile and safe working environment in according to OSHA regulations. It was hard to learn all the products that were within the store and the different departments
good,Helping customers needs and restocking of paint and dealing with sales reps always busy never a dull moment
good,a typical work day my day consist of me working on the cash register making sure that the customers that come through my line are completly satisfied with their shopping experiance at their vist to the store and if it wasn't see what i can do to assure that they leave with a smile on their face.ireally
good,"Helped customers load their purchases into their vehicles when needed, picked up carts in the parking lot and put them away, made sure trash in the parking lot was picked up and helped the cashiers and other employees take out their trash and anything else that was needed."
good,try to start a day with a smile
good,Seasonal work to provide extra income for the hours. Great location and a fun group to work with.
good,"I enjoy working with most of the people and customers that I deal with everyday. Management needs a better approach towards motivating employees. Wages are fairly good and benefits are good. The best part of the job is the many wonderful people I have met over the years. The worst part of the job is long hours on your feet without breaks, and the lack of human compassion from management. I have learned to deal with difficult people, multi task, and the importance of putting the customer first."
good,A typical day at Home Depot really depends on the time of year and holidays which was best for business. I learned how to deal with difficult upset customers and how to help solve their problems. Management did their job to ensure satisfaction for employees and customers. Co workers had the most fun with them they made coming to work alot more fun. The hardest part of the job had to be when product doesnt have price and searching for it. The most enjoyable part was working with co workers and decorating during the holidays.
good,"Very stiff competition with other window replacement companies was the challenge selling windows, gutters, roofing and attic insulation as Outside Sales Consultant. Homeowners were very comfortable with the Home Depot Brand and enjoyed a very amiable sales presentation that gave them a generous amount of product knowledge and pricing to help them make an informed decision. I learned you have to be highly knowledgable about product and know your competitors well to earn the customer's business. and quite frankly, I did very well doing this."
good,Associate in hardware dept. Emphasis on customer service and product knowledge. Great staff and good working environment. Semi retired and like to keep busy. Home handyman with experience in many home building projects. Looking for a change at this time closer to home in St. Albert.
good,Loading and unloading materials is a part of every hardware company but they kind of hired me a little too low on the totem pole to begin with low hourly wages.
good,"Fast-paced, high-energy, customer service focused retail. The training available gives one the practical knowledge needed to fix anything in a home that doesn't require a state certification to work on. Advancement is slow in coming; micro-managing from the top down; reluctance to schedule around religious observances. The previous statements, I have come to learn, applied specifically to my location."
good,hard work not enough pay and some co workers dont do their jobs
good,Learned alot about myself and team.
good,"It is retail, but also problem solving. I have learned that the general public is not prepared for home ownership and require lots of help. Customers have many questions and there is much to learn. This is a place to gain valuable knowledge to take care of one's own home and stay abreast in the home improvement industry. You make many relationships and are often recognized around town. My co-workers are fabulous, but management is something to be desired. It is retail, so there is a lot of just do as you are told even if it is not a good decision."
good,Looking for a new career in sales. I was in sales about 8 years and loved it. I am not sure why I left and would love to get back in to it.
good,"My typical day- hopefully it is doing my job- checking emails, calling vendors, updating customers and installers and scheduling installs. More often, it is covering understaffed departments - answering phones, covering a cash register, staffing returns, the customer service desk or a specialty department."
good,Typical day at work is spent doing customer service and reports. Management seemed absent at times and uninvolved in others. the hardest part of the job would be dealing with senior management and getting them to assist in important matters.
good,"Work around people who are doing home repairs. Everyone from employee to customer has a ""home improvement"" attitude which is needed for this job."
good,"Always giving great customer service, I learned that i have to put the customer first at all times."
good,"Fast paced, and physically strenuous job. They did have some policies to ensure that safety of customers as well as associates."
good,"Overall The Home Depot is an okay place to work. Besides the constantly changing schedule and high turn over rate, The Home Depot is a good place to grow."
good,"Great co-workers, the management is great for customers not great for associates. will not allow me to advance in the company while going to school. Management does not understand the meaning of family."
good,"Good place to work, Good training, Community Involvement, Fun Employee Parties"
good,Raises came annually and not on job performance. Different work schedules every week could not plan any outside activities
good,I love working for this company had good benefits and room for advancement would love to go back
good,a typical day at work is demanding helping customer is number one also co-worker
good,"Order product for my departments, work departmental reports. Stock product for customers. give worklists to associates. Manage associates and department."
good,"• Retail cashier for nation chain, serving retail, and commercial clientele."
good,"If you like to learn and work part time flex hours this is the place for you. Training is available for all departments, good as a second job or for retirees looking to fill their days with social interaction."
good,The customers were usually regulars and I loved working with them.
good,Hard work in any type of weather. Assisted customers and helped other coworkers in their departments.
good,"Great hard working people as part of my team. Poor work/life balance, but learned a lot in my time spent there."
good,Its a nice place to work if u are looking for your first job and still living at home but if u are looking for a full time job this is not the place to start looking it take to long. It needs to come up with a plan to work and give the part time workers more hours so they can pay bills or have fun
good,Sold and rented out tools.
good,As far a retail jobs go...Home Depot is amongst the best. They offer benefits. The schedule is terrible. One cannot plan a life while working with this company.
good,the hardest part of the job was that most of them spoke spansh
good,I make sure every morning that the 3PL is set up for shift by making sure the right containers/trailers are opened and worked. I make sure that all live loads and containers are received in correctly without overages and/or shortages and loads are closed out in a timely manner to make sure we have a continous flow of the dock and the yard. If there are loads in the yard I make sure that they are brought to the dock for unloading. Making sure to schedule the containers/live unloads are set up for delivery to the off-site and/or Winchester facility. Making to to meet production goals for the management department. What I have learned is that communication is the best policy. I am in the process of learning SOP's for the organization. The hardest part of my job is making sure everything is communicated in a timely manner to the right people. It is a fast pace production and we change our direction several times before implementing the right direction. My most enjoyable part of my job is the people that I work with. Without there assistance I would not be able to meet the production goals set forth.
good,"Worked really hard everyday and worked in extreme conditions (heat, cold)."
good,"typical day at work is making sure that customer's are taken care of and that we follow work rules and regulations. Management assists all associates with work duties. The hardest part of the job are the physical demands. The most enjoyable parts are working with people, team work and helping customers."
good,"good company to work for, but not much room for advance in the company, overall it was ok."
good,"Good pay, managers we're very motivating, overall good place to work"
good,"Lots of appliances, lots of lifting. You have to be strong. Different people working here. So some of them are nice but some are not."
good,"8 hours of work. No breaks, you have to eat while working. That's the hardest part. Some co-workers are nice but almost is not."
good,"Nice work environment, iw orked in outside garden a lot of hard labor physically"
good,"Everything from the start of the day to clock out time is good. People thats been there for a long time teach you the ropes. management help go over everthing top to bottom on what to do with safey,rules, customers"
good,"My daily routines was to walk entire building and sales floor verifying that all safety issues noted by management or supervisors was corrected and done properly while locating areas that have or may cause loss. I would run and review reports from profit and loss, cashier monitoring reports, inventory reports, receiving reports , special order or service reports noting indicators that may be creating loss or where loss had been created ensuring that these losses could be corrected or notated for inventory purposes or which may indicate a more serious problem such theft or training issue is occurring. I would review the reports against cameras to signify the exact problem to create solutions. I would meet with salary management daily to discuss events or issues occurring in the store. I was the safety coordinator whom overseen a safety monitor in which to promote safety awareness. Would utilize and expand company programs to help entice participation of 200 employees. I worked closely with Salary Management in the store and at other locations. I utilized and teamed up with department heads and supervisors to help complete tasks that needed to be accomplished as well train all associates in those departments. I worked with other asset protection employees within the company and out of the company in proximity to the Home Depot. Communication was vital part of my position and I relied on others to be just as communicative to complete, understand and execute tasks. I worked on the inventory team in my district along with my District Manager, Loss Prevention Managers and Store Managers."
good,"The company drives customer service, and encourages employees to be self reliant and learn to solve customer issues before involving management."
good,I learned alot from Home Depot. I started as a cashier and was promoted to Head Cashier. I managed cashiers. I enjoyed my coworkers and the hardest part of the job was keeping up with the changing schedules. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people get what they need to imprve their homes.
good,I worked at two different positions at this job- cashier and food service. An overall decent experience and it was fine for what I was looking for at the time.
good,The best part of the job is you have to interact with your customers. You learn their needs and I am able to assist them in providing solutions.
good,Fast paced environment with alot of friendly people. Always learning something new and everyday brings a new challenge. the hardest part of the job would definitely working the schedules which sometimes clash and makes your work day very long.
good,"Supervised the store in place of manager and worked daily in whatever capacity needed including making sandwiches, customer service, cash accountability, cleaning, and prep. Resolved employee and/or customer issues, counted down register, conducted inventory, and processed paperwork. Opened and/or closed the store, handled the security system, and entered truck deliveries ."
good,I started out as a cashier in 2009 and in 2008 I was promoted to the contractor services I was able to help the customers more then I could when I was cashier. I help the contractors order the supplies for the job site. I helped customers with ordering lumber and other supplies to be delivered to there home so they didn't have to rent a vehicle to take home there stuff.
good,I first began as a Sales associate. Assisting customers with questions and concerns about products. Constantly replinishing the shelves with inventory. I moved on freight team after I assisted in the yearly inventory of the entire store. On freight team I drove the tow motor and cherry picker on night shift putting heavy merchandise on upper shelves and restocking the lower shelves around the entire store. The management was very helpful in insuring I was happy and the co-workers were very friendly. This job was very enjoyable because the customers and co-workers were all an interesting bunch.
good,I have been awarded with a Bravo and Homer Award that the company provides to excellent employees that does there work in a professional manner..
good,Learned a great deal about the daily financial transactions of major corporations.
good,"good hours, good employees, needs better pay and a better beak room."
good,"I learned the value of hard work, and how to think on my feet while helping customers with their issues."
good,"As soon as I get in, I had to walk my dept. Talk to my early associates and follow up on them. I start taking notes on what's on sale, what needs to be done (stocking empty shelves/ bring down merchandises/look for items for customers/order merchandises via online, etc), helping customers in between. I love working with my associates. My managers were okay, but because they keep changing, we keep changing everything. One day, we are doing one thing, two months later, we got a new boss, who has his/her way of doing things. Hardest part, the ever changing managers from Store Mgr/Asst Mgr to Dept. supervisors."
good,I again loved my job as designer. It was very high pace.Very hard to give the customer the attention they deserved. But it was very knowledgeable with a lot of education. Daily I was scheduled customers who I would introduce to the materials and then be able to design and sell all that they needed. This was the easy part. The hard part was being pulled away from your customers to do things in many different department. It made it hard to establish trust and a professional environment. My co-workers were also hard working and as frustrated for the same reason.
good,•a typical day at work pushing baskets
good,All my coworkers are very encouraging as well as management. I've never had to ask for help more than once.
good,"Meet and greet customers understand there needs help solve problems, Co-workers get along with variety of people, Management taking orders to satisfy management, Finding materials in the store is the hardest part of job, the night crew seems to put alot of product wherever there is room not necessarily near where it is on display. most enjoyable is a happy customer"
good,It's a good place to work doing school. You can learn a lot from the customers and build network fast.
good,It is a good place to go for health care. Company can be a little top heavy in the management department. Can be a tough place to advance into management positions.
good,"A typical day at work can be either overwhelming or extremely dull depending on the sales day. I usually interact personally with about five customers on a daily basis. Management is easy to deal with regardless of the issue, they are very professional. I learned a lot about how to communicate and listen more effectively in order to help the customer acquire what they need. The hardest part of the job is that it is extremely monotonous. The most enjoyable part of the job is actually helping someone and making a connection."
good,Great place to work at. The product knowledge was amazing.
good,"very nice fast past, coustmoer service learning experiance."
good,very fun and i enjoyed working with wood and building materials. I learned with the job was how to use different products and could pass on advise to others. co-workers weren't all that friendly there was no real hard thing to do as long as you did what u need to do. most enjoyable part was the chrismas party.
good,I liked the job but I got started in Aviation. The co-workers were nice and friendly.
good,This proved to be a very interesting and rewarding position. Prior to this I had not worked in retail. I learned a lot about customer service.
good,You learn some nice stuff wish they had more full-time spots.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of restocking shelves, assisting customers find items needed, or directing customers to the appropriate department which they were looking for. My coworkers were wonderful and helpful. The hardest part of the job was when a customer would come in upset about the service he/she had experienced previously and were already expecting a bad experience when they came back in to shop. The most enjoyable was being able to regain the trust and loyalty of customers that had, in the past, experienced bad customer service."
good,"The store works at a fast pace, it gives you the variety to work with different people. It also allows you to explore the different departments by the customers items being purchased."
good,"I assisted in opening a new store, so most of the things that I learned was due to trial an error. There weren't any associates brought in to help you learn the job your hired to do. They didn't explain associate responsiblities/duties. Majority of the department supervisors can't complete the duties that associates complete daily, that is the same for management."
good,"I loved working for the company, and the friends I had there. It was pretty good working there as far as perks, earned ones. I was one of the top employees there and had one more award to be at a platinum status. They never stood up for the employees when there was conflict. You were at fault. I had another weeks vacation coming to me, a bonus, and at five years the company couldn't fire me, only corporate could. I was also going to be getting a raise. I think they just wanted to save the money. I was accused of being rude to a customer, which I wasn't. I had a customer come in and want to save 10% with her contractors discount, but when I tried to give it to her through his name or number, it wouldn't come up. It was a pretty new program and I told her that he could bring in the receipt on Monday, (this was a Saturday night.) because the contractors weren't here on the weekends. She didn't show any signs of being upset with me, or didn't raise her voice. I offered to help her in every way I knew how, but the total was over $300.00 and I didn't know if the contractor really did give it to her. I couldn't find him. The head cashier was busy, and Like I said I didn't know that she was upset at all. If she would have asked for a manager I would have gotten someone for her. I thought she was ok with giving the receipt to her contractor. I loved my job and felt that I was unfairly fired. I tried to protect the company. We gave so much away to people that new how to work the system. I loved the people that I worked with, and the people that shopped there. I had many awards for my"
good,Direct supervisor was not a leader. Overall the company is great to work for.
good,If a worker is trustworthy and hard-working they will be given a lot of responsibility.
good,"Assist cashiers in ringing up customers, give out breaks and lunches, give manager approvals, solve customer problems, answer phones, help customers find what they need, make customer orders. Work with nice and energetic people."
good,Fun place to work if you in high school. Its alot of work but good experience.
good,Home Depot was one of the giant home improvement stores with good opportunity to learn retail.
good,I enjoyed working here because I learned about tools and gained experience in a different trade.
good,"Although I enjoy the work, and the pay is decent (for retail) what really makes or breaks this company is the particular manager you have. If you manager values his employees as a valued asset, then the work place is much more enjoyable. If, on the other hand, they view their employees as something that is simply keeping their bottom line high, then the workplace is dismal"
good,"Being a Met member I get to learn the operations of the company, always stay busy. The set schedule is a big plus, however the pay is very uninspiring."
good,"I learned many aspects of the front-end with cashiering and customer service, as well as, sales associate skills while working in the other store departments."
good,"Days work included stocking some heavy stuff, up and down ladders waiting on customers,placing special orders,coordinating with receiving area to get needed inventory, operating fork lift and order pickers in tight quarters, etc.Definitely learned to multitask and work in a fast paced environment.Management average to sketchey with a few exceptions.Co-workers good people.Hardest part of job was usually schedule.Best part of job was that the day flew by."
good,I learned alot about customer service. Most of the staff was great. Way too many work politics
good,"i had a good time working there, learned a lot of new skills moved from different position to different position."
good,"A typical work day is Greeting every customer that you come in contact with. I learned that all customers are not the same. Every manager runs there store different. Co-workers will take advantage of you, if you let them. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep each individual happy. The most enjoyable part of the job is going home knowing your job is complete for the day."
good, Wrap pallets for storage/ shipping
good,"saw me as a number and not a person, I received employee of month and perfect attendance but they let me go because I went to court with my ex husband and I lost. saw this as a violation of a code of conduct"
good,A lot of customer interaction and providing product knowledge to the customer.
good,Very busy customer service.
good,"A typical day at work is coming in contact with a lot of different customer's some good, some bad. I learned how to cut carpet, I learned different measurements for tile, carpet, and blinds. I also know how to cut blinds to a certain measure. My co-workers are fun people sometimes that's what make the day go by smooth. There's not really a hard part about my job. I just enjoy working around a lot of different people."
good,Best part about working at Home Depot is the knowledge and experience you gain. Worst is dealing with difficult people in management.
good,This company has a habit of hiring only part time employees therefore there is always a lack of department support on the floor.
good,"I typical day at work is full of getting things done making sure that everything I need to get done is done. I learned how to be more patient with people. Management is ok, very demanding but that is there job. The Hardest part is balancing work and home, and trying to spend time with my family. Most enjoyable is when a customer is leaving and they are very happy with the customer service they recived."
good,Keep Front-End clean
good,The associates are what made the days go by fast with great conversation and willing to help each other at any time without hesitation!
good,"The Home Depot Paint Desk is very fun to work at, playing with colors all day keeps you smiling!"
good,stayed pretty busy but my feet would start to hurt after standing for so long on the concrete floor
good,At The Home Depot you must work hard and make sure each customer walks out with everything they need for their project. Customers come to Home Depot because they know we have experience people who can answer any question they may have about their projects.
good,They have long hours.
good,"A typical day at work can be exhausting, all in all its a good place to work. The only downfall of the work enviornment is that there is not a lot of coverage in certain areas. Other than that it can be an enjoyable place to work, most of the people are very understanding and good people to work with. I've actually learned a lot from my time at The Home Depot."
good,"My experience at Home Depot was very positive. I enjoyed being a cashier. I really enjoyed checking out the products for the customers and was able to talk one on one with the customers and be of service. Most of the co-workers were very supportive and helpful. Management was very professional. The hardest part of the job was pushing for sales, most customers are there to shop for a certain product and do not like to be pressured."
good,"I learned a lot about the products we sold, and I really enjoyed staying busy and helping others. The hardest part of this job was simply, trying to comply with other workers and management, in which they would not allow me to better myself outside the company. On a daily basis, I stayed busy the entire time, even missed lots of lunch breaks, because I was the go to guy."
good,Full time overnight employees began & part timers like myself would follow suit. Management would delegate. The quota for each individual was attainable though administered with hostility. Friendly managers were transferring. I was promoted without pay increase by a fellow hard worker and different time slot manager. This person had good work ethics and encouraged me to remain with his crew when another promotion opened. I pursued the position and began 20HR weeks attempting to complete 40HR workloads. I enjoyed the challenge. Working under pressure while young builds character. I encourage high school grads looking for experience to consider Home Depot and opt for tuition reimbursement and doubly encourage healthy relations to return as a senior citizen and enjoy the benefits of senior life working with HD.
good,Working at the home depot one can learn how to fix things around the house.
good,"I worked the night shift stocking shelves and putting up overstock. The manager was hard to get along with, very laid back and understanding. if not for the hours I would have probably stayed. pay wasn't much though for the amount of work one did."
good,"as far as the co-workers they can be great at times, you get to meet new people every day, management needs work, over all its ok"
good,"help press operator set up and operate machine. co workers were great and management were great as well. the hardest thing was replacing all the different inks, and films,"
good,A typical work day was to make sure customers got what they came for at the right price. I learned how to deal with very angry customers and maintain a positive outlook even when their wrong. I never really had a problem with any of my co-workers they all did there job. The hardest part was leaving to go to school. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I was helping make a difference in home improvment.
good,The job entailed doing a lot of the same thing. After four plus years. I was just tired of dealing with the public and wanted a change. It's a good job. I just didn't want to make a career out of it.
good,Work started at 9 and ended at six. Not to demanding which I didnt enjoy. Supervisor wanted to leave early on occasion cutting back the already short hours I had. The co-workers were occasionally rude. The hardest part was doing most of the work and getting little praise. The most enjoyable part was actually having a full night of work from start to finish.
good,"Standard big-box store environment. Many corporate rules and practices set in place to follow. Great training resources, very clear in what duties are to be fulfilled. Fun job, hard work in this particular department."
good,It was a seasonal job. Respectful custmores and employees. I loved working out in the garden area
good,Home depot is a good place to work if your looking for a starter job and experience.
good,This is a retail level job. You will spend most of the day stocking shelves and talking to customers.
good,Basically and up beat job always working on orders we had certain season when we were slow and then the pace would pick up.
good,Typical day at work at the depot i enjoyed it everyone was nicei was a cashier i would not mind working there now unforunately it was temporary but it was fun while it lasted.
good,get my work done to the best of my ability team player very hard worker
good,Clock in and work directlly and indirectly with customers.
good,"this was a very fun and exciting job. It was sometimes challenging, but it was worth it."
good,* A typical day to me was face paced and as hard as I worked productive.
good,Managers willing to help you with any problems.....very physical work....helping customers is always a pleasure......
good,Working at home depot was like working with a bunch of new friends. It was competitive yet there was something fun about going to work every day. Helping customers is the main priority but mostly you see the same people day in and out. Manegment is set up with a military type format and there is specific procedures to follow when speaking with higher ups. The hardest part of the job was to keep the image up of what was expected of you and the image of home depot.
good,"It may not be the best place in the world but it certainly is not the worst. The work environment really depends on the store manager and the assistant managers. I have had an awesome store manager and then a terrible store manager, and the morale of the store was completely different with the two. For the most part they hire some really good people that know the products and are good with customers."
good,Every educational on home improvement. Enjoy learning how to do things yourself without spending alot of money.
good,I learned a lot from working here! I worked in every department. My coworkers were easy going as well as the supervisors. Hardest part was working in the seasonal Christmas tree section. Was interacting with clients.
good,"learned new things, but easy."
good,I would work a variety of shifts as either a cashier for product transactions or as a customer service representative to help customers return faulty or unwanted merchadise.
good,Challenging environment that is always welcoming change.
good,"I have a pretty laid back work environment. I love working with the customers and helping them with what they need. My typical day is me at a register 4 to 8 hours a day checking customers out. I love my co-workers, everyone is so friendly and helpful. The hardest part of my job is meeting the expectations of selling credit cards to customers and making sure they fill out our online asking them how well i did as their cashier."
good,Understaffed and Overworked. Communication is lacking between associates and management. Cannot raise a family on hourly compensation.
good,"The HRSC is a disorganized, disjointed business group that is mis-managed and is a classic case of the inmates running the asylum."
good,This is a good starting job for someone out of high school tryin to get a foot in the door and gain experience
good,I learned a lot about home improvement working at Home Depot. They make it so easy for you to install just about anything in your home.
good,Busy during the day. Very slow at night. I personally enjoy working the busy shift. Love to keep busy.
good,"I respect the company as a whole because there is an abundance of online training that is provided for the new employees as well as the current ones. Benefits are given to full-time as well as part-time associates, but the workload is insanely stressful and the pay is very low."
good,"I love working there, great place new people..nice things that came in to stock"
good,"bussy,the companies product,management good, co-workers good,nothing,helping and learning"
good,A typical day at work is filled with constant deadlines and problematic situations. I've learned how to affectively lead and work with others to get our most important goal of customer service accomplished. The hardest part of the job is to see certain associates not care about how the deal with orders that we send to our customers. The most enjoyable part is meeting my needed deadlines of orders that need to be filled for a customer in an effective matter.
good,"Work consisted of assisting customers with merchandise or any questions that they had regarding the meerchandise. I rang up customers purchases, adjusted prices accordingly, and counted my cash drawer at the beginning and end of each shift. I learned how to give great customer service with a smile. The management there was good and the co-workerrs were excellent. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers and the most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers."
good,The company used to be better and went for the worse. They gave me a hard time when a family member passed away. My co-workers were great and management worked with us to try to impove. Everyday was a day to make money and improve our sales and make our store shine.
good,"It had its good times and its bad. The customers had everything to do with how your day would end up going. Sometimes they were the sweetest, then other times there was nothing you could say that they wanted to hear."
good,Not very please working for this company. supervisors are lacking experience and no room to grow in this company
good,Work hard and deliver and you are rewarded. Staff turn as senior leaders change seemed to be the norm.
good,I enjoyed working for home depot for 12 years. Then I said something in pressured time to an hourly associate that was taken way out of context.
good,This company is a good retail company to work for. Most of my co-workers are hardworking and willing to help out. Some of the management would benefit by being as friendly to associates as they are to customers.
good,"I've been here 2 years and I can't complain. It's my fallback job/secondary when working in my field. Pay is horrible, but, the hours are there and most management leaves you alone as long as you do your job."
good,nice staff fun coworkers worked register learned to manage money better.
good,Fun place; great coworkers and some management; a little unorganized.
good,"Good place to work. Generally helpful and friendly coworkers, and necessary work tools are supped by the company."
good,Very friendly atmosphere loved my time there would love to obtain another job at this site
good,I would be able to work and learn all sorts of things from the customers and be able to build a relationship with them.
good,there was a lot of favortism and scandalous relationships within the company but other than that if you are looking for a job to just go and do it and come home this is your kinda job
good,"I enjoyed working at Home Depot, for the most part. However, my schedule changed almost weekly, and my hours did too. Unfortunately Home Depot would not hire me on Full time so I had to move on. Had they moved me to full time and given me the hours promised during the interview I would have stayed."
good,"Never was a typical day hours were never the same but a challage. I learned how to be a good department manager , how to keep cost down and how to interact with the public. mangement team was great to work with,so were my co-workers. The hardest part was the different hours daily. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with and the customers."
good,Worked many areas of the store. The work was good but there wasn't much teamwork.
good,"Company has a slow growth process, makes great pt job. Offers on the job training."
good,great for first time workers or high school kids good starting foundation
good,Working here has helped to multitask in the different departments
good,"A good company that is customer service driven. However the pay isn't that great. This is a good job for people needing part time work who need extra money. But, you cannot live off what you make here. This would be a great place for students or moms and dads seeking additional income. Also nice for seniors who need additional income."
good,I worked for Home Depot during and after college. I only left the company to pursue a career that I was more interested in. I did not feel that Home Depot had the right career path for me.
good,"It a good place for anyone seeking part time work, they are flexible with shifts. The management at my store, is good and always helpful."
good,"working at the home depot had it's ups and downs, overall i enjoyed the time I woked there I met a lot of amazing people,"
good,After hard work and grueling hours advancement can be achieved. Overall good organization to work for and you need to put in hard work as expected.
good,"Advancment is more difficult for older employees. Raises are minimum, no cost of living increase. Benefits are good. Not enough employees to meet customer demands"
good,good to work for as long you can satisfy all the managers without getting in the middle
good,"I was thankful to be hired in a speciality department (doors & windows) because it allowed me to sit down with customers and discuss their needs for new doors or windows. I usually worked evening shifts and Saturdays, as well as the occasional Sunday. As a student, it was a decent part-time job that helped pay the bills, and HR was always helpful when I had a scheduling conflict between school and work."
good,Great people to work with not the greatest hours due to their new FAST system its a little all over the place but if it doesn't bother you then it would be a great job .
good,"The Home Depot is a great company with some great core values. As a retailer, they tend to hold themselves to a high ethical standard and emphasize Customer service, which is nice. However, they tend to pay very poorly for the reasonably skilled labor that many of their jobs require. Unless you've been working there for 10+ years, or came in with loads of real world work experience in the department you're placed in, chances are you aren't making a good wage per hour. The work environment can be stressful on busy days, and management always seems to give you more than your fair share of work for each day. But after all, it is retail. What is most frustrating is the fact that even if you take the initiative to learn and become certified to operate fork lift equipment or other valuable skills to help the company, they offer no pay increases or other incentives. If you start from the bottom, you pretty much stay at the bottom, with a .20 cent pay increase each year (if you are lucky). Employee benefits are not bad, and if your store makes good sales you can get a small bi-annual bonus check. Like all retail, scheduling is completely unpredictable and you usually have little time for family around Holidays. Overall, Home Depot is not bad for retail, but it's definitely not a full time career and it's not a job you're going to want to stick to unless you're doing it for part time extra cash, or you've somehow lucked into a Management position which is salaried."
good,"high customer service,probably one of the best places to work ."
good,"A lot of times, departments are left with inadequate coverage. Some of the Department Supervisors are openly disrespectful to the store manager.  Associates would rather point customers in the direction of products, rather than engaging and taking the customer to it.  The company does have a great success sharing program. They are also very involved in the community."
good,It was a fast paced company that greatly initialized my skills and abilities. The pay was good and the hours were fair. The environment is settle just make sure you’re organized.
good,"""Home depot is a good company to work for."" Good benefits, flexibility, community driven. Core values, Homer fund to help people when in need. ... Turnovers, full timers have to work extra hard during off season because of cut hours of the part timers."
good,They emphasize lots of cross training which is pretty good. I would say it is a stressful place to work. Often times you would find yourself outside of your department helping customers or helping other supervisors. Yet your sales numbers would go down while out of the assigned department. The bonus is not that much compared to other places. I would say they give you a fair chance at advancement and will raise your pay if you produce.
good,"My time spent at The Home Depot has been fairly rewarding & has set me up for progression within the company. Alas, the last year has suffered some major changes & not for the good of the company or it's associates. There is a severe lack of communication & professionalism from upper management, along with holding people accountable for their actions."
good,Was promised a raise after one year I completed all of my (PK's) product knowledge after my first year instead of a raise I got a good reference because I quit
good,"The managers when I was working at this Home Depot were always about themselves and other managers. There was no sense of team work, as well, management didn't support their non-management and often did not take accountability."
good,"management are great, they helped you, always there for the employee. it s a fun place and stressing too but my experience there was good. Pople respect you"
good,"It was a very pleasant place to work, Management was very friendly and we all worked as a team! I really enjoyed my job there but was hard to work all weekends and all shifts."
good,"There were a lot of in-store drama and shenanigans at the store I worked in particular, but my first year and a half here were great. Great managers who took the time to get to know me, employees who cared about one another, foods/celebrations for those working on holidays, etc. You honestly can't do much better in ways of culture when it comes to a retail part-time job. "
good,I think Home Depot is a good company to work for. There are a lot of good benefits. I personally think they don’t always put the proper people in the right departments.
good,"I was thrown under for god only knows why, and was let go under the excuse of supposed ""negligence"" on my part. Overall, it was a nice company to work for."
good,Excelente el trabajo de resurtir la tienda.. Más no la presión y el estrés por parte de los gerentes
good,HD finds a way to fire those who make the hourly top dollar/hour. Great way to save corporate funds for the super rich managers and CEO. Please! COULD be a fabulous work environment if they would go back to their roots. I LOVED it. But was offered a job making twice as much.
good,It is standard every place now days stop shoplifters without touching them. When did thieves get more rights then the companies they steal from. If you commit a crime you shouldn’t have any legal action against the company no matter how they choose to stop you
good,It was home depot... It have its share of good and bad the people for which i worked with were all good people enjoyed the environment there.. other than that.. it was Retail Sales
good,Home Depot was bit of a Challenge a lot of difficult questions from guest about hardware there was big part lack of management and training great hours
good,I enjoy working for The Home Depot. If you love helping people and problem solving Home Depot is a great place to work. Advancement is possible with hard work. Fellow employees are helpful and understanding.
good,"I love the people I work with and my job itself, but management makes everything harder than it needs to be. They don't communicate with each other and that makes it harder to get accurate information from them."
good,"Home Depot started as a great place to work. I started at $10/hr, which for a kid still in high school was awesome. Moved from lot loader, to cashier, to head cashier in less than a year. The people have always been the best part of the job. The work isn't terrible, but expect to constantly do things outside of your job description without any extra compensation. Management severely overworks the good associates and lets the lazy ones slide without much accountability. I've been here for almost 3 years and only make $11.90/hr now. That's with a dollar raise for the head cashier position and 2 yearly raises. Home Depot is falling behind on pay."
good,The biggest surprise & slap in the face was that they don’t give an employee discount. If you’re a cashier they do give little incentive prizes for getting Credit card applications though which is pretty nice. They mainly offer Part time so if you are looking for FT I suggest you try another place.
good,"Good experience on forklift and cherry picker, but no a/c in the summer. Was a dusty place to work. This was Home Depot Interline Distribution Center, not a store!"
good,"Shift start til shift end was very positive. Employees went out of their way to ensure I had the help needed to do my job  TEAM WORK"
good,Working here is about what you would expect working as a retail cashier. Everyone is willing to help and teach you about the products and have a lot of patience with the customers.
good,My store has changed a lot over the years. In some ways for the better and in other ways for the worst. Asking for more work to be completed without increasing pay. New tech makes certain parts of the job easier.
good,It was okay. Stressful at times.  Wanted to change departments but wasn't accepted. It was not a challenging job but coworkers were awesome............
good,"Each store is different. If you don't like one, it does not mean they are all the same. You have the ability to move from department to department and can move into a supervisory position quickly at times."
good,It was fun working at the Home Depot but you gotta be quick on tour feet and jump to customer needs. If they needed something dropped you had to get a flagged.
good,I have worked there for almost four years and we have undergone several management changes. It has been very hard to adjust to each management styles.
good,"If you are a regular associate you just work your hours and don't take the job home with you. If you're any form of management, they expect more from you than they are willing to pay for."
good,"Answers to Customer Questions regarding store Merchandise, department information, and pricing."
good,I used to enjoy working there. Then after a while management waived off my concerns about problems with another employee. It was becoming stressful for me. Then coworker went to management and lied or me; saying I threaten a coworker without proof.
good,Home Depot is a pretty good job If all you’re doing is working however if you have other things to take care outside of work it can get pretty hard being that they give you a lot of hours. They pay good and give good hours but some of the management could use some work
good,I learned a lot from Home Depot I worked hard I operated all the machines there now I want a better career with better pay I also want to learn more in life
good,I worked part-time and was always more than happy to cover for others.  Never a negative review but I made $23.00 an hour!  I was in specialty.  My peers were let go and replace with designers that were happy with $13.00.  I was 66 years old and they needed to get me out. They harassed me until I quite.  Ve
good,"Each store is different based on management, but the staff is what I loved about this job. They will train you to move up, but you better be able to fit into their requirements. You can work as hard as you want for this company, but if you are late more than 3 times in 3 month period, they might fire you. I'll admit I'm not the most punctual person, but I work hard, come in on my days off when needed, work late when needed, and came in early when needed. They have a 7 minute leway on getting to work on time. No matter what you do for them if you don't fall into that 7 minute time frame they will let you go. If you don't have a home life and have the ability to never be late, this a great job. They love to tell you how important home life is until is causes you to show up at 8 minutes after instead of 7 minutes after."
good,"My store was understaffed and poorly maintained. Most times of the day there was only one associate per department. Under payed and over worked. 85% turn over rate. However other stores as I have heard from friends dont have this problem. Home depot as a whole has a 40% turnover rate for reference. Good employees and co workers, just poorly structured in the office."
good,It wasn’t a place to make a career out of unless you wanted to go into management. The pay was horrible. Pretty much minimum wage. They don’t hire full time either.
good,"Having low team members isnt the way to go because the business could really drop sales and be called a ""horrible store"" that lowes is better because we barley had anything that customers needed"
good,"I was hired directly after retiring from the military into a supervisor position. They knew I caught on quickly, so that threw me right in. It is a sales job first and foremost, so if you don't like people you do not want to work there. You are ALWAYS on your feet, constantly walking, and if you're a supervisor, you're dealing in unhappy people 80% of the time. It is challenging if you're disabled. We had a reasonable dress code. I worked a lot because you did not get paid well (again, it's sales) and if you did not work overtime (which was limited but available) sometimes it wasn't enough for the bills. There was a slight company culture challenge with tenured employees bullying other employees to the point of quitting but I think that's been addressed."
good,It was a great job but it would have been better if management was better. Head Cashier would tell us to to do something one way and a manager would come along and ask why we are doing it. It got to be really overwhelming and confusing.
good,The people are great there and always helpful. When it gets super busy tho it is hard for people to help you find things. Management at times isn't the greatest
good,Good place to work for someones first job only issue is that they never told me about a no call no show results in a final warning. Overall good people and fun place to work.
good,"It's a good company, with great benefits. They tell you that they want people that are willing to drive companies policy and procedure to ensure a better work environment, they don't really want that. They want people that are okay with bending the rules and being okay with things being wrong and not fixed. I however, believe in policy and procedure and want what's best for the company."
good,HD Culture at the higher level is not quite as rosy as it seems the training provided indicates. Lot of expectation upon management roles that can supercede time
good,"If I had not been coerced into my last position as lumber recovery, I might still be working at Home Depot. I had great success with Home Depot until I took over lumber recovery."
good,"Friendly environment, and an easy medium pace work load and pace. "
good,"Its not an easy job at all and certainly not worth 12 bucks and horrible milage. the amount of work expected of you is a bit too much because of staffing issues, it doesn't help that you'll drive close to an hour to each store every night..wearing down your car in the process. There are definitely worse jobs out there, This one is simply not worth the pay."
good,4.3 stars sometimes people take advantage when they suppose to help you they let hang until they ready for you to each is own you meat good people motivation
good,the amount of time that I worked here I met a lot of cool people and got to experience new techniques with this job moving from two positions gave me a better feel for this job but over time it became very overwhelming.
good,"Home Depot is a decent place to work. Very few people enjoy working in retail, but if you have to work in retail, Home Depot is a probably one of the best options."
good,Fun place to work at as a student. Flexible schedules. Management was good but could've been better. I learned alot of everyday lessons I can use in the future.
good,I loved working at store 1208 .But when u worked more than 6 hours they gave u your lunch and break together so after that u had no more breaks until it was time to punch out for the day .
good,Pushing you to be strong and a leader hard work test your patience. Magament movemnet is slow part the best working schedule for this job gruop actives are nice
good,"Worked there for 8 months, loved it at first. But it’s very easy to become the “reliable part time” guy. Busted my tail and was repeatedly told that a spot would open up. Watched three people who did less than I did nightly get promoted over me all while day in day out I was getting praised by managers and supervisors all around. Good pay and great benefits, as well as a great work environment. But they think cooking hot dogs once a month makes up for neglecting hard working employee"
good,The training that they provide will help you be good at the department you are working. They try and make everyone feel welcome. Sometimes you can feel like you are behind due to having a lot of customers and not enough time to take care of your area.
good,"I found myself constantly striving for better communication from management. I spent 3 years working full time in Las Vegas, Nevada. That experience was terrific and set a standard for Home Depot’s everywhere. The Temecula location is not a bad place to work but it is time I find something new in a field I am really interested in and have the qualifications."
good,"Having just been hired at the home depot, I had no knowledge about Flooring. But with the harsh work environment, it taught me self reliance. Ask questions. Call up companies , read up on your products, have good social skills with consumers and contractors. 13 years later, most Contractors will only talk to me."
good,A good place to work. They do have a lot of favoritism but if you stay in their good side you'll do good. its hard to move departments and become full time but hours are good.
good,"When I first started working at The Home Depot, our Store Manager was great! (Smiled, came up to individual employees and told us what a great job we’r Doing and that we were appreciated, gave us incentives to do even better, had occasional in-store parties with cheers, awards, etc)  Then he was called to another store! Since then (in 3 years), we’ve had 3 or 4 different store managers and all that time, the morale has slipped drastically! It’s like we don’t even have managers! We are understaffed to the point that Customer Service is not good and employees have to do 2, sometimes 3 job titles without extra compensation... they are running ragged and stressed out! People have begun to not get breaks or have to wait awhile to go to the bathroom because there’s no one to relieve their position!"
good,Customer Service is the day to day responsibility and ultimate High Priority. Store Merchandising/ Stocking priority to make sure the product is on the shelf for the customer to buy.Helping Customers load product into there vehicles and gathering carts in from the parking lot assist in excellent customer service.
good,If you have a family you can’t afford to work there. The work is good and the people are nice. The benefits are also good but most can’t afford to invest in them because pay is not sufficient
good,"Pretty comfortable place to work, departments are mostly fully-staffed and  the managers were pretty competent. You'll likely learn a lot about home improvement and the products if you don't already."
good,The workload isn't complicated or hard to understand. They guide and teach you through everything you need to know. The pay could be better based on department and what work you do in the department.
good,"a typical day at the home depot would start off with me clocking In and going to my department and start putting up returns if theirs any and after that start cleaning up and trash around and bandages that are stuck between the wood,the management there is fine they'll help you with anything you need and if theirs a problem with anything they'll help you solve it."
good,Working for the Home Depot made me want to further a career in retail.  The atmosphere and the helpfulness towards customers made me more excited to work there.
good,"You had good days and bad days. Most were good, this is not the best job but it sure as can be not the worst. Management for the most part is good. Pay can be a little better."
good,"Team works, hard work. hot building. no bonus for driving forklift. Management change often. flexible schedule. good environment. help to improve. fun associates"
good,"Overnight stocking working at a fast pace. "
good,"You get decent pay (about $12 an hour for freight team). Though, the hours are scarce and they have extremely high expectations. If you dont like to sweat then do not work here."
good,"If you looking for something quick apply here but, if you trying to make this a career good luck! The managers are horrible! They only look out for people they’re close with!"
good,"management sucked but pay was pretty good for the position, gave many bonuses (based on your performance and performance of the store), constantly had plate sales / cookouts, off on thanksgiving and christmas, fun people to work with. there really is an opportunity to move up if you try hard."
good,"Lots of retired folks that have valuable experience in their field.  Training in the technical areas like the front desk lacks, as there are many functions and no guidelines there at the desk or the comoputerto help you."
good,"It’s a lot to deal with, you have to ask Customers about applying for a Home Depot credit card and if they don’t get one it all comes back onto you and your supervisors and managers get mad and They watch and make sure you’re r asking for credit. It’s ridiculous. It’s stressful"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers and having great conversations with them. As some physical work is involved, I am getting stronger than before. It is just not a place that I can work with my work experiences."
good,The hardest part was the high turnover. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help the people who needed it the most. I learned a lot about customer service and about different things in the garden department.
good,i mean if you want to work for a billion dollar company that barely pays it employees and has an extremely high turn over rate for employees then this is the place for you.
good,People don't stay at Home Depot because they love what they do.  They stay because they enjoy interacting with their co workers. You're all going through a hard day at work together and can relate to each other.
good,You will dread coming to work every day.  You will walk 8-10 miles in a full work shift as an order puller.  You will find camaraderie with your co-workers in complaining over how much you have to get done that day.
good,"The Home Depot is a good place to work if you don't need a lot of money right away. The starting salary should be higher and they should have better incentive than free food occasionally. I like it here but that's mostly because of my co workers, not so much the work place."
good,a typical day just consists of giving customer service and ringing up customers. i've learned customer service is one of my strong suits. management is okay. sometimes they can forget things but who doesn't just remind them. workplace culture is eh. hardest part of the job is standing 8 hours and not being able to move around unless you are on break or lunch. the most enjoyable part of the job is working with some good people.
good,"The team you work with really determine your experience with this job. If you have a cashier or manager who refuses to listen to you, it's a frustrating environment. However, if your team is mostly positive, it's easy to make friends and get through the day with most of your sanity. Full-time positions are tricky, especially for closing shift. You basically have no life outside of going to work, coming home at 11 p.m., sleeping, waking up around 10:30, having breakfast, and heading to work again. If you want to see your friends or family with any degree of frequency, do not work the closing shift."
good,"Coworkers are super nice and very helpful, you see dogs almost everyday (which is a plus). A lot of regular customers, so you get to know them. A good place for a summer job."
good,I enjoy every role I’ve encountered. It’s a great company to work for just wish they’d pay more being a chat associate as well as treat their associates with respect and take action ASAP when things happen in the call center.
good,"male coworkers touched too much & made sexual comments. uncomfortable to work at in times, sometimes felt like management didn't care about you. felt racism too."
good,"It’s a great place for someone who is looking for a temporary job, but not for someone younger planning to stay there. They don’t pay enough for the amount of work that we do, and break a lot of promises."
good,"In working there, I learn so many tasks which elevated to so many levels, And I also received badges, for my many achievements within the company. I am also able to help the customers save 25 dollars off a Home Depot card to help them save money. I have also been placed as a head cashier when needed."
good,The job isn’t bad. They just forget to give breaks. And when the head cashiers switch shifts if its your time to go home they’ll leave you waiting for like 10-30 min. If you need money for your drawer it takes them forever to get it to you and customers end up getting mad because you don’t have change.
good,"Lots of spectacions, not enough reconnicion. Lack of leadership from the top. Typical corporacion culture, to save a dollar. they willing to lose good workers."
good,Great culture that continues to strive to find positive servant leaders... Still working on that. Work/Life balance is not great. Company culture is great.
good,"Mainly reason to have another job, isn't absolutely to quite the company, in order to go to another, but is just to aggregate more hours to my weekly work time. My plan is to stay at Home Depot, as a full time associate, or sum more hours, to my income, working for another company."
good,"The job I got was only part time yet it felt more than that. Home Depot gave hours whenever possible so all my weekends were at work. They don't give out any type of employee discount, but they offer a 401k plan which is nice."
good,"Pleasant, fast paced environment. Fun with the right supervisor. Lots of support except during really busy times of which there are plenty. Varied work schedules"
good,Clean environment and good people to work with on the freight team. Management was not as flexible with schedules and training on the equipment was often not utilized.
good,"cool fellow employees"
good,"Good Job, just need a change.  Current promotions being offered to outside talent.  So to move or grow anywhere I will need to move outside of Home Depot."
good,Solo falta un poco de humildad a los gerentes de area
good,"Pay was a little above minimum at the time, pretty physically demanding especially during spring/summer."
good,"Working overnights was nice since there are no customers in the store, and supervision is minimal. The work is not very difficult but in the busy months there is a lot to do. Since it was overnights, upper management often neglected the team and gave very little support. In my 3 years as a seasonal worker I had 5 different supervisors for the freight team"
good,"Like Cash Saver, co-workers and management were actually a blast. Some customers were real butts, and the teaching of how to do things is not very clear AT ALL."
good,fun for starting work easy money easy life was promoted within the first couple months of working there they pay attention to who works the hardest so if you put your work in they notice
good,poor scheduling  either not enough employees available or over staffed. The hours weren't the best either and employees weren't allowed to hit overtime
good,"Freight team full of the B.S It's a bunch of  ignorant ,disrespectful,childish ,fools..that don't do their part of the job,but hate you for doing your job well. Management is a bunch of stupid trolls that shows favoritism to those who does nothing but gossip and be clowning talking 💩 the whole time, pointing fingers at each other."
good,"Management is not helpful, they are never found when needed. They are hard to be flexible with school, they only care about themselves they don't care about the employees. Supervisors think they are managers and don't like to work. They have short deadlines when given a job to do. But they do provide food for you every couple of months which consist of breakfast, lunch, and dinner. They offer 1-HOUR LUNCHES AND 15 MINUTE BREAKS FOR EVERY 2 HOURS YOU WORK."
good,"In my time there, it was non-stop, always something going and had some turnover which made the job challenging. With that being said, everyone helped each other out and pulled together."
good,I come in put on my apron clock in have our meeting and stretch before working our shift. Pull product and get ready to put on the shelves. The hardest part is the shift time. The manager that hired me likes me very much.
good,The hardest part about this job is how fast pace it is. You are demanded to meet production on a daily basis or the manager will have a talk with you.
good,Workplace is structured. Management know their responsibilities. Operations and fair to staff. Overtime is mandatory. Organizational culture seems to be friendly.
good,not very flexible with hours but the people are very decent the only issue i had was the limited hours and the bad hours they would give me because i was new
good,Working at the home depot is a nice clean environment.  I learned a lot from my peers and felt like family The hardest part is communication with the management team/Store manager.
good,"Good position, decent benefits good management not much room for growth and poor flexibility in terms of hours given. And poor sick time accumulation strategy 2 months can’t even cover a single work day shift for part timers.."
good,"Great company to work for but inventory is beyond crazy mess"
good,"It was a good place to work. "
good,"There was never a time when you didn't have something to do, it helped in making some shifts pass quickly. Stocking shelves and helping customers will always keep you occupied."
good,"You get 2 15 min break that are paid and half hour unpaid lunch, not very stressful job and fairly easy. get your own desk to work at. management is always available to talk with you about issues you have. They try to work with your schedule."
good,"I liked working here it was a good job for me at the time with my children being little, went in at 6am and off by 2pm they would offer overtime but never demand it so I had a choice. Management was very nice and understanding."
good,The hardest part is dealing with crazy hours. Some days being there at 5 am and others being there until 11 pm. As you move further up in management the crazier the hours get.
good,"Pretty cool company, with changes for advancement and good benefits. Management seemed understanding in most cases; However I felt The Home Depot was all about Home Depot. They in my experience don't really give a chance for personal and family life."
good,"Great Cooperation, this is where I learned most of my managerial and operational skills and procedures.  It's multifaceted company with a plethora of different postions to work."
good,"It's an ok place,but its very hard to get into full-time work,all part time positions.Managment is great,but need more hours to get full benefits,etc."
good,It's ok benefits are too tier the managers suck. Co workers were pretty cool but not many did their job and you will get blamed for others inability to work.
good,"A reasonable work place, very sociable, everyone gets along  well.Departments work together, to help the customer. Training is some-what easy. all in all good experience for a first job."
good,I would recommend it if they weren’t so hard on their workers. They do feed us and give us great benefits but it’s hardly a compensation for the stressful and hard labored work environment we are in. They pride themselves on execution and safety but slack when it comes to associate appreciation. The management is terrible.
good,The job is fast-paced and patience is a must. Lots of people that need extra help. customer service focused people will thrive there. Every customer is different with very different projects.
good,"Day to day activities includes mostly helping customers find products and assisting them in other areas such as making special orders, orders for delivery or pickup. Management can be great at times however they have their favourites which puts them above all other associates. Pay can be better over time."
good,It is an easy job and the expectations are reasonable. the people are very nice and it has a good company culture. the pay is bad and there are not promotions or raises until you have been there working full time for at least five years.
good,The job was a great company don’t get wrong I love putting in my labor the thing was they wasn’t trying give me more hours to take care my family which I just had a new born daughter so that leaves me here today looking for better... and I’ll be so grateful to work for this company I just appreciate this company giving me a chance. That’s all thank you.
good,Current student at a college and working part time at home depot. The training starting off is long and necessary to learn everything about your job you applied for to only have the management move you around and tell you what to do on a shift by shift basis.
good,"It wasn't what I thought it would be. The pay was okay, but I did not like one of my managers. He did not care about the employees there and it showed."
good,"My hours shift and I was never ensured a good week full of hours. I have worked there for a long time and the people I work and worked with were great! However, management keeps changing."
good,"Again, there's a lot to learn about home improvement. Home Depot provides the materials necessary to make a house into a home. Its employees are pleasant to work with in addition to its prices being affordable."
good,"customer service associate"
good,when it is busy you will be asked to stay over time. low pay but people who have worked there over 5 years will be helpful and show you about bonus programs
good,"I think our store just has a really bad atmosphere as I've heard great things from other stores. However, management is NEVER on the same page, you could ask every employee in the store a question and get a new answer each time. There's very little direction given and then all blame comes to the low man on the totem pole. "
good,Good overall atmosphere. Good overall team feel. Opportunities for advancement in same store. Low stress compared to commission sales. Good middle management.
good,"What was said about management is true but I can honestly say that 1 manager in particular had my back.. "
good,Home Depot can be a lot of fun if the managers start seeing the need of creating a fun environment for the employees that will help provide a better system for the customers to see some relaxation and comfort instead of walking a tight rope.
good,"Work is fine but there is limited promotion potential and the hours they give you as a part time employee are VERY limited, about 15 to 22 hours a week."
good,Ok job but it can be very stressful the job had a big turnover. very hard work in the paint department. some of the management really suck. but you make the best of what you can do.
good,"Management is not one to work with you, rather, above you with little respect to your placement within the company. Decent pay. Flexible hours. Full time spots very limited."
good,Wish there were more opportunities for advancement and that the pay was better.  There is a high turnover rate with the part time people which affects the departments and the ability to serve customers in a timely manner.
good,Good company but has no real pay advances and be advancement in the company.  Mandatory breaks and lunch. Customers good and bad. Most employees are fun to work with.
good,"It was fine, and I was payed well, unfortunately, the store on some days was very understaffed and you had employees filling in many jobs within their department all by their selves"
good,If only regional manager would understand how to promote from within and maintain the current store managers and not promote an inexperienced manager to store manager
good,"customer service consisted of returning items and picking out orders"
good,Independent direct sales representative for HDE. The culture was very loose with very little supervision. There were quite a few installation issues. Service issues were common as well.
good,"Home Depot as a company is decent, very decent benefits at a fair price.  Salaries are kept very low (typical raises are .25 and .50/Hour) given annually at the associate level but scale up significantly as you advance.   "
good,"chance to learn alot, long days and hard hours, rewarding when things get straightened out. group think tanks and lots of conference calls to help stay organized."
good,working at home depot was a challenge at first...but got the hang of it..i enjoyed operating the different hysters required and unloading the trucks....putting data in the company computer was a task in its self......the people i worked with was ok....wasnt the best and most friendly.....the pay could of been better..at that time...only 10.00 an hr
good,liked working there in the beginning but got tired of it overtime. home depot works well if you are going to school so you can work what is best for you
good,Most employees were team players. A very user-friendly cashier system. Break times are fair. They provide a place to store your food and heat it up when you are ready to take a break.
good,Work life and family balance does not work well with family life. Demanded to stay late or take calls and or work from home on off time. Been with the company a long time
good,"flexible hours but terrible management, not willing to work with your health needs . I had a situation going on that had to do with my overall health and could not attend work, they overlooked it and told me it didn't matter and that i would still receive occurrences"
good,"Constantly helping customers in fast paced environment, ensuring a quick and easy checkout, as well as providing good customer service. Most of the time spent standing."
good,Depending on your goals and aspirations The Home Depot can be a fun place to work. It depends on your role and what you are suited to. It can also be stressful at time when meeting deadlines and sales goals. The pay is low but there is room for advancement if you are ambitious.
good,"This is the kind of job one would seek part time. If you are a motivated person with an extensive knowledge of home improvement, you might rise in the ranks but it might require a lot of time to get to where you would like to be."
good,The company was a good place to work. This has been a good company to help me while I look for my next job.  The managers are really cool and really understanding.
good,Home Depot Is a decent job there are many different levels of Home Depot you choose from met team or cashier and the sales floor or night freight team
good,Work is mostly self guided with manager input. Often manager will want you to work on too many things at once. Very little recognition. Focus is often on negatives.
good,A typical day was working alongside the customer to make sure they were satisfied with the products offered.  The hardest part was working alongside some of the other employees as some do not have the same work ethic.
good,"I started working for Home Depot in 1988, was an amazing company then, I worked there 10 years and it became a large corperation and no longer took care of its employees"
good,It’s not a hard job to learn but if you were at a store like Panorama City and your think your ready to move up you’ll have to compete with the managers favorites and a lot of the time you won’t get it because of that
good,"My time spent with the home depot was poor to say the least. Never got any on the floor training l, and rarely got to train on the computers. Management was horrendous, and they couldnt make overtine pay so they cut hours."
good,"I like the every day challenge, the atmosphere of the work place is sometimes cool. Sometimes customers can be really rude but the best thing is to calm down and be professional. Smile and be responsible"
good,"Part-time and full time "
good,"Considero a Home Depot una buena empresa en general; la parte que no ha desarrollado es el paquete económico que tiene, así como las prestaciones."
good,"The store that I was working at had somewhat poor management, but I cannot speak to the level of knowledge for other Home Depot locations nation-wide. Working here as a part-time cashier provided many opportunities to learn and grow as a team member and as a person. The experience you gather is applicable to other jobs, for you become knowledgeable in handling money properly, providing excellent customer service, importance of being professional etc."
good,its good innovative retail company. The environment though sometimes relaxed is a brisk and active environment. Has a lot of foot traffic and customer interaction.
good,A good place to work for something that is temporary. By no means should this place be a career for an educated individual. This place is a career for those who do not have any other options.
good,lots of training which is excellent and busy environment at all times.  always learning new things and working closely with the customer to make sure they are happy when they leave the store.
good,"•	Provide front line services to customers seeking painting goods. "
good,"Working with home depot was fun because you stay busy between taking care of the customers, restocking the shelves, doing certain projects that need to be completed. Sometimes you have to assemble certain items for promotions. One thing that is extremely fun is the tree tent during the Christmas time you cut customers tree greet the children with candy canes, cookies and hot chocolate. Pretty cool!"
good,"I got to hang out with great people"
good,"This company has plenty of room to grow but there training is lacking, they are not consistent with there work schedule.  You could close one night and have to be back at 5AM to open the store.  They cut hours randomly & give supervisors more work then what they are being paid for."
good,Great place for a young individual to start in the work force. friendly environment to learn and grow and as a employee. Flexible hours for part time employees.
good,"The work is alright, it all depends on which department you get put in. What makes the workplace not so much fun is a combination of the people as well as the area. My co-workers dont care about working with one another, theyre selfish as well as the managers."
good,"Home Depot does NOT allow you to grow or Supervisor does NOT listen when you explained to him/her over about 10th time about any issue or situation,"
good,"Working at the Home Depot is great. It is a very successful company, which is why it can take a lot of time to advance. That is the only negative thing I can say about it! Customers, for the most part, are great. I also love all of my co-workers!"
good,"The job you sign up for is fine and can be fun when there isn't a lot of things asking for your attention. Unfortunately the majority of the time people from other departments are asking for help with things that timing wise overlaps with the things you are doing. It has gotten better over the last few months but is still a thing. management has gone through some troubled times."
good,"Bon cadre de travail , mais difficile d'évoluer!!!"
good,"The home depot is a decent place to work. The hourly wadge is above minimum though employees that participate in the more physically intensive positions are not compensated fairly. "
good,"Big on customer services, big on store appearance (clean and uncluttered), Big on in stock, big on safety, Oversaw unload of trucks and making sure store was ready for opening"
good,"the company puts you under a lot of stress for low pay, in my opinion, this would be a good part-time job but nothing else for career advancement. would recommend only to students."
good,Fast paced environment.  Not enough associates to help customers and work load.  A very physical job.  Pay should be more especially for floor associates.
good,I recommend this job to anyone in between jobs. Customers and staff both enjoyable. Job was easy to learn and offered continuous trainings and meetings to help improve.
good,They Sometimes Treat You Ok While Other Times They May Treat You Different . They Only Have You Work Overtime When It’s Beneficial For Them If Important People Are Coming To Walk Through The Store
good,"Working at the Home Depot was an experience of having great customer service. No matter where you are or what you do on the job being able to work with others and giving the best feed back of information to your customers or employees is a must. Being able to work on your feet moving back and forth throughout the warehouse and having to deal with all kinds of emotions from different customers. Coming to work with a positive outlook on everything would make your day just a bit better to having to deal with the constant changes that go on within the Home Depot and facing new projects on the rise to be a better store. Interacting with the specific customer or employees each day to understand how to get along within the work space that's giving. Would make each day worth coming back for. Touching base with the customer you help goes along ways to showing that you care not just about their needs in finding a merchandise, but to show how much you love doing your job and providing more. The benefits a lot."
good,"Work is simple and you can find your self becoming a solid member of the team quickly if you work hard and show initiative to learn new skills like driving the machines,"
good,"I enjoyed the time I spent with some of my coworkers, but if you're seeking a well paying job or career to build upon I advice you to seek a different career path."
good,"Negotiate going in for what you would like to make. Because raises are small and slow after your hire date."
good,"Home Depot was a good place to work for over 20 years, but when I had issues in my life that made me no longer flexible, I quickly became unneeded. My previous managers would have worked for with me for a few years until the situation resolved it self, but my current manager had no interest in working with me"
good,"I was blessed to work for this company for 12 years starting as a lot associate and quickly raising to a store manager running a $60 million dollar store. Great salary and good bonus structure. The cons to the great pay and advancements is  working 70+ hours on average as a leader and lack of family balance, if your single and want to grow with a company this is a great place to work."
good,"Started out working for MET, where i learned a great deal of tools, measuring, teamwork and time efficiency. If you have little to no experience with tools, and learn some small home improvement tricks, MET is a great job to learn those skills. After a year i joined Store side to meet my class schedule in college. I started as a Hardware associate, where i continued to learn more about tools, fasteners, and home security systems, and heating. I left the company for two months, and returned as a Lumber associate part time in order to work with my primary job.(I wanted to return.) Upon returning, a new assistant manager came in, and took immediate management over lumber department. When I returned, he was my direct report, and I have never had such an uncooperative scheduling followed by an uncooperative manager who either ignored me or looked past me to talk to another associate. So it was a great place to work, until he came."
good,"Meeting then assignments meet customers at their homes and sell product."
good,Relaxed environment. Not a lot of room for growth and improvement. Not a lot of training was provided. Benefits was okay. Pay was not very competitive.
good,Not a very challenging work environment but the pay is fair I think. I had a horrible schedule though so it didn’t work out for me. The do try and make it fun by providing games and a basketball area.
good,Good job if you don't need much money or want to get promoted. The pay is low and the work can be very fast paced but not too difficult. A good supervisor will make it or break it.
good,"It takes so long to get full time and when you do, a lot of people are bullied out of the position. When I worked there, people were being accused of things they didn't do, and since they couldn't prove it, were written up and walked out of the store.  The managers made it hard for you to fix a customers problems by not answering the calls when an issue arose.  They were also not willing to help the customer at all when they did speak to them which made it hard on the employees.  They were often the ones who had to deal with the customer's wrath."
good,Home Depot is a good place to work. I enjoyed meeting new people and interacting with various people. Hours were quite suitable. I throughly enjoyed my time there.
good,"easy place to get hired and to start getting warehouse experience. very physical work, 10 hour shifts so you work 4 days and have 3 days off. very tough on your feet and legs."
good,"I had fun , while I was there . I did my time there now I am ready for my next challenge so I am moving on ..........................................."
good,A great place to learn about many different trades. Lots of options from flooring to paint to decor plus ... Can prove to be demanding physically (e.g. lifting...).
good,Had a great time working there. They sent me to training in various departments and aspects of home improvement. Learned a lot about customer service but they sent me to all that trainig and failed to compensate me for it.
good,"Home depot was a decent workplace but not my preferred working pace. There's always a sense of family, but even family can be at odds. overall i enjoyed my 3 years of work experience with home depot"
good,"Working there is ok, you do learn a lot about different departments. You do have to deal with different types of customers attitudes not all of them are going to be polite and you have to be real patient with them. Management is ok everyone has there own favorite. Everyone in the store are ok."
good,"Great atmosphere with a wonderful culture of associates. Working for the THD was rewarding for my family and me. Even under pressure and stress, it was a team effort to be successful. I miss working there however; I am challenge to bring the positive energy with me to my present employer."
good,My management team plays favorites pretty severely. If you aren't one of them then you get no opportunity for advancement. They also get to spend more time off the floor and receive more gifts. It's hard to be left outside the circle when you work harder than they do.
good,"From my years with the Home Depot I learned how to build strong relationships with my customers and colleagues, as well as how to be a strong leader. I was given the opportunity to learn more about my field of study through an in-house field placement and a corporate contract."
good,It was alright working there. The inconsistent schedule was a big factor in my decision to leave. The lack of communication between managers and employees clearly needed improvement.
good,Most of your day is spent stocking and putting returns away. In between you assist customers with projects. Assist overnight with resets and other big projects.
good,"A typical day at work includes being at the service desk, transferring calls, managing orders. I've learned how to coordinate with vendors, delivery teams, fellow associates, and to manage difficult or upset customers as well as learning how to provide excellent customer service. Management is okay. Workplace culture is good, I love my coworkers. Hardest part of the job is having no coverage, I am often stuck at the desk with many tasks for hours on my own with no assistance. Most enjoyable part of the job is my coworkers."
good,You come into work and clock in. Sign into your register and computer. Answer phones and answer questions. Check inventory for accuracy for online orders and special orders. Assist customers with refunds and sales. Clean your area before you leave.
good,Home depot is a nice place to work. The pay is lower than exspected and it is very hard to get full time. management works with employees. It is easy to have flexivle availability
good,"A place thats willing to teach you about diferant departments.so you can allways help in other areas.Managers were great.Everyone is friendly.MY day at work was fun I ran the garden shop.stocking cashier, costomer service."
good,they cut the hours so you are very busy because they don't have enough cashiers to handle the crowd. If your not liked you get the bad hours and you will not advance in that job.
good,"This job is always eventful especially depending on how many people are scheduled to work in your department. You are constantly learning irrespective of your department do to customers coming to you for questions. You also learn how to use different machines and equipment which is really fun.  It is fast paced and can get hectic if your department isn't scheduled well enough to meet the demands of customer traffic. Closing can be stressful depending on how your department aisles are and if you have help closing or not. All in all, it was an interesting experience and would work at Home Depot again if I wanted some extra income."
good,Lots of people who have been treated unfairly and others that have been treated too fairly just because of skin color or because of butt kissing and excuse me for the language.
good,"the company cares about associates but they don't pay enough."
good,"Working for MET at Home Depot is a little different than just your average hourly department associate, you preform service to each isle in every department and execute projects to reset the store and set seasonal merchandise. Not as customer service intensive as the departments but faster paced work."
good,The home depot allows teenagers to work and get a better taste of what the real life working labor intensive world has to offer with many skill sets to learn.
good,"I have been with home depot for quite some time. I have really enjoyed the time I have had at the depot. I made some really great friendships, my boss was always easy to get along with and always told me what was expected of me. The pay is not great, but they do have a lot of benefits to offer employees."
good,you have to be able to work in other departments and be abe to have good bit a time. You have to be able to think about muliptle things and have all your things done  by the end of your shift
good,"Come in say 5am, turn on one computer to start until the morning crowd comes in. Check to make sure all return bins are empty and check off the items listed on the opening check list, and sign to be sure nothing was missed while opening, same for closing. Then its just about surviving a work day at the service desk. I learned not to take life too seriously or myself. Management was cool, they worked very hard. The hardest part of the job was dealing with theft. I enjoyed the heavy lifting and challenging myself."
good,This was a good start up job. The company is friendly and also the managers are to as well. Being with the company for the time period i was helped me learn a lot about home goods.
good,Extremely long hours; often six days a week.  Paid holidays are always consumed by additional hours before and after the time off. Upper management uses guilt to reduce time off and changes to schedules.
good,"The Home Depot is a fabulous company. It has many benefits for its associates. The balance it offers the associates through its consistent scheduling program is remarkable. The Home Depot gave me a chance at advancement and I was dedicated 100%. However, the screening of its members of the store level management team is a bit undesirable. If the management team engaged in their leadership team with transparency, I believe they would have much less friction among the leadership teams."
good,"I had a lot of questions as a new cashier, and although they were pretty respectful to me, they did not manage well. I asked for my paycheck that was in the back nobody would check, or they lied about it not being there. When I had an appointment that conflicted with my work schedule, they told me to call in advance (and I did several times) but nobody acknowledged it. Then I was marked extremely late to the shift, and they had neglected to tell me they had no excused sick days for seasonal employees. They also threw me on the register without explaining some processes that are not in the training videos, despite my asking (and getting in trouble with customers), if I had a question they would just do it for me instead of telling me how."
good,"Home Depot cares very much about its employees. Sadly I was working at the Trumbull Home Depot, one of the worst in the state in terms of managment and sales. People were constantly being fired and hired, I mean constantly. I liked the people I worked with very much. I worked about 27 hours a week doing pretty much anything you can do in a home depot but all under the title of ""Tool Rental Associate"" despite only working in Tool Rental maybe 50% of the time becuase the store was so mismanaged. I would work in garden lifting and loading mulch, cement, soil etc which I enjoyed. I was put in plumbing, which I knew nothing about. I was put in electrical, which I knew nothing about. And I would often work as a cashier."
good,"I conducted physical inventories and cycle counts (routine daily, weekly, monthly counts)."
good,Not a bad place to work. they take care of the workers. biggest killer for me having a family now is work life balance. Management is good and they live to the core values
good,"The company culture was great.  I was not especially pleased with my position or department, but I got my foot in the door.  Once in, I found the employee reception to be vastly uneven.  There were always accusations of favoritism floating around, but moreover I think they just tended to neglect those that mgmt. didn't care for rather than throwing favor at anyone."
good,I only helped stock shelves. was a side job during the winter. it was hard to even get the job with all the online nonsense you had to do. I was only there a few months
good,Home Depot claims that we're all family when we work there but the reality is you're not you're just another person working that they control. It's All About Numbers to them
good,For my first real job it was fun. Gave my enough time to focus on college while also gaining knowledge in multiple areas. Picked up lots of tips from men and women who where pros in their construction field.
good,"great place with good ppl but some managers are tough to gt along with, but i met some good employees, had fun while it lasted. would recommend friend"
good,"The Home Depot has offered me a steady job, however the amount of work expected and the lack of pay were constantly conflicting, and this issue seems as though it will be present for years to come. The people are fantastic, and management is generally nice, however money talks and there was not a lot of talking."
good,This is a good company to work for. Very convenient for the college students in my area. Flexible woth your school hours. Understanding management syestem. Team player enviroment.
good,This company payed fairly but not if you are living fully independently. It was a relaxed environment that was welcoming and calm. Poor management that was not collaborative
good,"The Home Depot has provided me with so many growing opportunities, especially learning things that I didn't know before. Cross-training from one department to another, helping customers and spending time with them, and watching training videos has helped my acknowledgement of things that happen daily."
good,Can be a hard place to work when there are different customers and associates to deal with but still quite easy. Learning at The Home Depot is easy and there is always something there when you have a fun environment with people who are driven
good,"my job was rewarding.,loved working with employees and mamagement.helping customer with their projects,and hearing about the outcome.speaking with customers about their day ."
good,I was hired with a promise of up to 32 hours and most weeks received less than 12 hours.  Not sufficient enough to support a family.  The environment was positive and I never had a problem with management
good,You deal with all types of customers and the environment is fast paced but it always keeps an associate busy and working. Managment is great and will work with whatever availability you can give.
good,"1. Advancement can be slow. Especially if you're going for higher positions like supervisor or assistant manager. Advancing to those positions takes months and years. Career building is possible there however you won't receive decent pay until you become a assistant manager or work there 10+ years."
good,"The Home Depot is a fun place to work 3rd shift because you get to use different methods of thinking when your not dealing with customers. Management understood that it was a part time job for someone looking to make some money for some sort of financial stability. That helped create a relax work environment., and as long as you took care of what you were supposed to as far as your job then you were good."
good,Had a lot of changing of hours per week some times maybe 25 hrs. than the next week you would work 11 hrs. Your time would always be changing. Sometimes you would miss your break because they missed you.
good,"I learned that as the staff cycled throughout the years, the veteran employees left, the younger ones hired in had a vastly different work ethic and sensitivity level. Management in general is superficial and driven by earnings. All other considerations are secondary. I had a fantastic manager for my team luckily."
good,"It had its ups and downs, I learned a lot from Home Depot. Making customers first is always a priority, Great place to work and transitioning career opportunities are available as well."
good,"Store manager tells you one thing and the Assistant managers tell you something different"
good,I worked there for 2 years and it was solid place to work at. I worked there to mainly to get credits and to help customers. I enjoyed working with customers but for the amount of work I did for the company I  thought I was underpaid.
good,"I have worked in The Home Depot for about 1 year as an order puller. And within that year it has been extremely stressful. off the bat the order were extremely insane and could not be completed in any given time. when other other pullers tried to help one another to try and finish the job quicker, management would split everyone."
good,"If you want to work hard with little composition and even less recognition work here. It can be good if you have a couple of work associates to pass the time with but most management will be a pain. The money is not bad but for the amount of stuff you will have to put up with will make you question why you are working there, yet other days are slow relaxed and fun. The training is mostly on the computer and it will last a long. it hardly gets you ready for on the floor work."
good,"Management cares less about people than it does regulations and numbers.  For instance, they set unreasonable sales goals not on growth patterns or the size of the community and income level but based on what percentage they want it to be.  We sometimes hit the goal but most of the time will not.  People make mistakes but the will fire you if you do.    They also cut people from departments and run a skeleton crew but expect the same results, but I do not blame management... I blame corporate for that one.  I guess the same could be said for the others 2.  Success sharing is a farce because management determines how much we get."
good,As head cashier I worked closely with management and handled customer concerns. Trained new cashiers and kept front end running on time with lunch and break schedules.
good,"The pay is not good to support a household. "
good,I had fun here and would work there again but the time I was in school and my own personal issues wasn't helping. So I had no choice but to leave. I would work at a different location that store went under after new management. One day I hope they fix that.
good,"Good company over all, it is a very large operation, management is what you would expect from a fortune 50. Work life balance is way off, they expect you to work days, nights and weekends."
good,I’ve held many positions at Home Depot. Only favorites have selected for positions even if the person isn’t qualified. Management only cares about numbers. There is no balance between work and personal life.
good,Great job good people good work place. Typical work day wasn't stressful. Management was kind. The hardest part of the job was the concrete floor. The
good,Many supervisors are there for the money so give little regards to employees. Quite stressful because of employees & or customers. Hate it when some employees didn't work much & got advancement or no one told them nothing as compared to most of those who did
good,"New management did not conduct itself in a professional manner, favoritism was out of control, enjoyed the customer interaction."
good,"An average day at work was quite active. I was on my feet at all times, and quickly needed to learn how to balance and prioritize tasks. Management was very friendly and the work environment was always inviting."
good,"Little space to move forward in career, not enough hours given. Management is not very good with communicating with each-other and do not seem to take the needs of their staff into consideration."
good,"A typical day was busy and stressful. The day shift would leave things for us to do that should've been done during the day, so we had to do way more than we should've had to, to be able to do our jobs correctly."
good,Returned from maternity leave and didn’t get my position back was replaced and put in a different position. Work life balance was difficult needed 1 particular day off and was denied due to the means of the business so was forced to quit
good,great company to work for. Was very easy but depending on the department you are in. very friendly workers just hated how dirty it was my hands would get black just by touching something.
good,Home depot is a good place to work we have friendly customers coming in and out. all employees are very helpful we all help each other around home depot. managers are also nice and really cool. the hardest part is working in lot by yourself when store gets really busy.
good,"The great thing besides the benefits is working with the public and trying to help them with whatever they are working on. They staffed on average of 140 associates, was always great seeing the new associates come in around April, and getting the chance to meet and train them is great."
good,I've been with the company for many years. I am a supervisor. With this position I have no control over my schedule. I enjoy working for the company but due to the  in-flexibility of my schedule  I must find a job which will allow me to have consistent hours so I have time to raise my child. Some weeks I am scheduled to work 3 nights a week which makes it impossible to have family time with my child during the school year.
good,If you are looking for something to keep you busy in a work setting do not apply here. Male sure you know what type of job youre expecting before you male a final decision
good,Tough job if your a person who likes a very tough job then Home Depot is the job for you.you often pick things up to 70lbs and your on your feet for 10 a day .
good,"While working at Home Depot while you can move up, you don't get the required training for positions. They throw you on the floor and expect you to know things instantly. Not fair to the customers or the associates you have to work with."
good,Just another part-time jobs for young people and retirees.  You can't make a living there unless you are management.   The training is hurried because hey need you on the floor.
good,I had the opportunity to learn how to drive a forklift and a reach truck also learned about gardening and about the chemicals for graden and animal pest
good,"- hours aren't guarenteed"
good,I was always encouraged to work faster.  Supplies needed to perform the job were hard to come by.  I enjoyed the people I worked with.  I had to work in inclement weather.
good,It was a good place to work for part time job. Not sure is career with company is an option. Advancement is slow and but once promoted growth within the company is possible.
good,"The overnight freight associate position is very demanding and very physical. However, the company is great and there are a TON of opportunities for advancement of that's what you want. It is especially a good place if you don't mind hard labor."
good,"Its just a good company. If you like it great, If you don't oh well. You get what you signed up for. Although sometimes you have to do more work than you'd want just like with any other company."
good,Durring my employment at homedepot I got the worst version. When I got in the first week I was by myself and had zero department management. My department head was absent for about 5 months. My co-worker did nothing and was lazy. He would best leave the department and not help do anything. I was left with a ton of returns every shift (carts of them lined up the aisle on average 7) for months. I was expected everyshift to get rid of them while dealing with customers which was constant. Then they tried to put me overnight when I told hem I can’t. I was fired because I didn’t show up to it.
good,I enjoyed my time at Home Depot. I had a great deal of satifaction interacting with my co-workers as well as customers.  interactions with customers on a day to day basis. Over all Home Depot was ok to work for.
good,The job is very challenging and very physical where you are constantly on your feet for hours helping customers and maintaining a clean environment. The pay isn't bad but I think they could pay a little bit more
good,"Working at home depot for customer service could be stressful at times, especially when the store is short staffed. You do, however, learn a lot about interacting with customers."
good,Working at Home Depot can be challenging for a new associate as it is a busy retail environment.  They ensure you have adequate training prior to placing you on the sales floor and interacting with customers.  You are usually paired with seasoned associates before being left on your own to work in a department. There is encouragement to cross train in other departments and programs to assist in advancement in the company.
good,Working for home depot was very stressful. All work had to be completed by the end of the day while being short handed and supervisor never in the department. The hardest department in the store only had women working in it. Management shows favoritism to the associates.
good,"My job at the home depot isn't too hard until i'm stuck working 3 jobs at once. Many associates don't work well with others. I have a lot of fluctuations with how I feel going to work. "
good,worked loading trucks with forklifts using a scanning gun. sometimes sent to other depts. to work if they needed help. we only sometimes worked weekends when there was a heavy load of work
good,"for it being a relax work environment as their mantra, it is a very stressful place of employment.  the employees and management were okay to work with"
good,"Un día típico es llegar y realizar las mismas actividades diarias."
good,"coached and mentored employees on business development, personal growth and performance management. Supervised and trained employees in daily job responsibilities. Provided superior customer service and work quality while demonstrating attention to detail, flexibility and innovation in resolving problemsc"
good,Home Depot is a decent place to work. The managers are not always the nicest people and the hours can be extremely random. The job has benefits even in a part-time position.
good,Ok company to work for fast pace depending on your position hours varie need people good benefits enjoyed working for the company I liked to see area.
good,"Monotonous work and alot of pressure to exceed numbers daily, always had free food for employees though. Working conditions, as far as accomidating for weather temperatures could be improved."
good,"I was in inventory and it was at my own pace for the most part, some people were helpful, others were more into their own jobs.  Lunches were an hr long, but the pay was too low."
good,Some days you go in and your schedule will be changed. The work is really easy. The pay is a great pay for minors. There is paid training. You can't start actually working until you finish the computer training.
good,Work schedules are really messed up. One week they need you to work 27hrs then next you get 20 hours or maybe you only get 10 hours.  Days are all over the week and it makes it very difficult to plan anything with family or set appointments.
good,"The store that I worked at was one of the busiest in Southern California. I was computer certified for operation of forklift, reach and order picker. I could not find any of the certified trainers to test me on actual hands on operation. The never could find the time."
good,"Was a good work experience, only problem was on my M.E.T i had a few coworkers that weren't the nicest and didn't treat me fairly well. Manager sometimes didn't seem to do anything about it considering the same coworkers continued to do what they did."
good,Employees misuse his/her lunch breaks for more than thirty minutes or an hour. I have learned that decision could lose customer's trust and their quality time.
good,"Its your Typical Warehouse work.The work pace is fast and everything is done in a timely manner. Management Isn't the greatest, due to the supervisors."
good,Its fast past but fun job great people learn a lot about materials for your house /garden. Most employees are very helpful easy growth within the company
good,"If you are interested in working as a team, working with-in guidelines that are VERY demanding and enjoy people, then this could be a good fit. I enjoyed my time at HD working for the vendors and their products. Customer service is a daily thing as retail is usually lacking in scheduled staff but what better way to show a customer that HD has employees that know where things are in the store. MEA's touch every item in every isle so they know the store and where the products are."
good,The working environment is fine but the hours are weird and they expect more for little pay. Everyone works as a team and help each other. the main problem was management.
good,Only way to advance in this company is by becoming great friends with the supervisors or any other management. Otherwise they will turn you down overtime you try to advance in the company. Supervisors don't seem to be doing their job much until a walk from corporate comes. A lot of associates aren't that helpful/don't like working and you will find yourself doing a lot on your own. Non-demanding workplace.
good,Home depot rewards hard work with merit badges. Schedules are rotating. People treated well. Duties and responsibilities included stocking warehouse with merchandise. Retrieving and storing product with lift equipment.
good,Not a bad place to work.  Management Issues on occasion.  Work conditions could be better.  Moral can sometimes get low because of poor management and understaffing issues.
good,There is no carrier path at the home depot. College students who graduate from college always most a times look elsewhere to seek their carrier path. I hope things can be improved.
good,Consistent seasonal employment for high school or college students. Mediocre pay and tuition reimbursement programs. Environment was enjoyable but interdepartmental communication frequently caused issues with scheduling and paycheck deposits.
good,It depends on the store you get into for work. Some are really great and some are not. However I really enjoyed a lot of what the job was about as a job.
good,I get sick easily and a lot so they didn't like that
good,"Home Depot provides many great opportunities to develop a career, provide excellent customer service, learn the home improvement business. Building a collaborative team environment is strongly encouraged."
good,"The store has about 90% of all products needed for your home project."
good,If you like customer service you would like Home Depot. It can become very busy at times and you have a lot of interaction with management. There are many ways to advance your career if you choose to.
good,I held many positions at Depot. All were fast paced and the culture was the biggest selling point. The business model had some changes but now has gone back to the original core values of the company.
good,The management and supervisors there were quite aggressive and therefore abusive. People were constantly being fired there or leaving due to inappropriate treatment. I do not advise anyone to work there unless they can truly deal with the disrespect not from the customers but your own supervisors. I don't wish to speak ill of the company but they do need to look into store #6378 and figure out what the problem is there.
good,"Decent company, the culture isn't what it used to be.  As with any retail job, your direct leadership can make or break your career, no real job security once you are salary."
good,Great job for beginners or people looking to build a nice career in a solid company. Also great for people that have made mistakes and are looking for a second chance.
good,I like the fact that i worked with people all ages mad you understand what it really feels like to have a job and have to be able support family and kids even though i did not have any kids.Just seeing other peoples perspective on life.
good,"great place to work if you intend on going to school, before you begin a family life. I would not recommend this place to support a family. environment is definately top notch!"
good,It was a go in to work and go home job. Nothing special about it except some of the other employees you would get close to working together. It is very hard to advance up in the company and even harder to get a raise.
good,"Walk the store and look for shoplifters and also giving customer service,and safety plans and inventory plans. Protection of alll store assets. report writing"
good,"A typical work day is to come in and work 7 reports from orders processed from the day before.  Continually answering calls and customer's questions, concerns and complaints, as well an answering any question other associates have in the store. Cashing customer out and processing returns. Building orders, as well as signing them out when customer's come in to pick up their orders, whether it is stock, special order, Buy Online Pick-up In Store, order online orders.  It can be a fast paced environment in which one needs to multitask as well as prioritize each situation you come across.  each day is a new day with different situations and scenarios, which allow you to learn and grow your customer service skills, problem solving and communication skills."
good,"Home Depot is a decent place to work. Great for college students looking for a well paying income. But, work and school can interfere with each other if you don't manage your time wisely. Part-time workers barely got any benefits. Career job for anyone looking to move up in the company and who's looking to be there long term.. Management can do a lot better and be more helpful. Competitive work place, customers come first..."
good,"it was a fine place to work as long as it was a temporary job or a second job  "
good,"This is a fun place to work. It is very fast paced, however you are on your feet all day.  Have to greet all the customers regardless of where you are in store.  If you do not know a product you have to fake it to you make it."
good,"I enjoyed the work but not the people. A lot of them would go off and sleep under racks and in the loading area, which is the poor taste of the supervisor who knew what was going on but did nothing about it."
good,"Have been working at Home Depot for one year, the people are pleasant to work with, the work load depends on the season. Unfortunalty the pay is very low and little room for advancement"
good,Great place to work for even if you don’t plan on growing with the company. A lot of companies like seeing it on the resume. If you work hard and try every day you’ll always have a job
good,it was an alright place to work i enjoyed the management and staff pay was basic but all in all not to bad of a place to work. dont get terminated they wont rehire.
good,"The company was not bad, the pay isn't great unless you have worked many, many years.  I was working part- time but I hardly ever had hours.  After 1 year, I still never received a raise.  I felt like I wasted my time."
good,"It was a good place to work in order to earn extra money.  There are no health benefits, which I feel they could have offered to part timers, especially since the pay was not good.  But overall the people I worked with, and directly below, were great, and everyone i worked with exhibited a good work ethic.  I had a sales quota to meet, which was not difficult for me, but I wish i hadn't gotten pegged as a salesperson.  I would have loved to work in a department i was more interested in than appliances."
good,Very fast paced environment with product sets changing with the home improvement seasons.  Very knowledgeable employees within each store I've been in.
good,I have nothing great to say about the company nor nothing bad. Enjoyed some of my time working here and met some great people with whom I still keep in touch with.
good,"You stay for the people you work with. They seem to hire fun, fantastic people that you just fall in love with. The job itself is no different than any other sales job out on the market except for the great benefits they offer."
good,"I have enjoyed working at The Home Depot, the hours are flexible and management is understanding of times constraints on students."
good,Everyone is passionate about their job. A well run and profitable company. Fantastic culture with doing the right things to provide great customers service.
good,"This Home Depot was full of great people, and it was very flexible with my hours and school activities. Great part time for retired people or students."
good,"I dont really have much to say about this company was is a family friendly store to work in and good Environment. Wan't advised that vac/sick time will not roll over, time was lost and not paid out."
good,"Very fast-paced culture. Learned a tone about leadership and serving others. My particular manager was not family friendly and work-life balance is/was a huge challenge. Love my team, the stores, and their leadership."
good,"It's a retail job. That's all there is to it, Show up, do your job well, go home. "
good,"A typical day at home depot,was fairly busy. I was a cashier so my days consisted being busy all day. customer service was a big issue there and my customer service was at 100%"
good,management needs to learn better people skills would only recommend working here for part time work they will treat you great as full time unless you have a status there you likely will not move forward in the company
good,Of the three managers at home depot i only really respected one. The other 2 were inconsistent with different management styles and could not stick for oral agreements they had with employees s
good,"it was a ok job not one I wanted for a long period of time. they start you in one job and move you to another with know notice. which I did not like. would not work for them again,"
good,Enjoyed my time initially great team. Management changed so did the culture. Don't think I would want to work there at this time. Helping customers is what we were about.
good,While the daily work environment is great the compensation is not. Wages are very low for new employees and the only way to get higher pay is to stay with the company and suffer through making no money.
good,Assist customers by loading their vehicles and maintaining a pleasant and clean store entrance. Responsibility of providing a safe working and shopping environment by following all safety policies & standards completing specified safety training immediately correcting hazards & unsafe conditions or reporting conditions to the Manager On Duty and working safely as not to endanger themselves co-workers vendors or customers.
good,"My time at Home Depot gave me more life skills than I ever would have thought.  I developed home improvement skills, sales and leadership skills.  If you work hard, you can do anything with this company.  Unfortunately, the work life balance is not great."
good,Home Depot is an okay place to work. The most enjoyable part of my job is my coworkers and the hardest part of my job is trying to perform my job without the necessary tools. One thing I have learnt working at THD is the customers aren't always right.
good,"A regular day is about 20 orders for a 3 man group, orders ranged from 1 item to 100+ items mostly frustrating when people call out, it makes it harder to work. I learned how to successfully get an order ""palletized"" and ready for transport, as well as how to operate a forklift."
good,It was a fun place to work got to learn alot about home projects. It becomes very fast pace in the summer. And you tend to cross train in multiple departments because they tend to be short staffed.
good,"While one may expect an overly macho atmosphere, I have worked with a wide variety of nationalities, ethnicities and lifestyle orientations with little or no friction."
good,I learned from the Home Depot is that your hard work does pay off. With every retail & customer service job there are a many different personalities. From management and their own management styles as well as customers and the many different ways you can assist them. My time with the Home Depot I truly enjoyed working with my fellow associates. The most challenging part I must say would be balancing your work that needs to be done with the customer service. In this sort of work environment the customer service was always the #1 goal. But at the same time you were given tasks to be completed and at times that could present a challenge.
good,Overall a good place to work for retail.  If dedicated there is room to move up. Fun people to work with. Do not have to have construction experience.
good,"I loved my job it was a high paced, high stressed job. Customer service and helping people is something that is top on my properity list. Home Depot preaches this and use to train this but the new generation of management and associates do not practice this. I was transfered from the Nashville market to the Bowling Green area to help increase sales. The management that I worked under for the first 3 years was very supportive and active in the business and sales increased at a rapid rate. Desk sales were barely 8,000 to 10,000 a week with 5 people working the desk. After the fist year we lowered our hours to 80 hours a week and increased sales to an average of 60,000 per week. After 3 years I was leveled out at 2 associates (80 hours) and was averaging 100,000 per week. The management change as does with large boxes and we received a new inexperienced management leader with his own agenda. Commercial Sales have dropped down again and hours are up and I am no longer employeed. "
good,"It's a job basically.  Low pay even after advancement. People there 10 years only making $15/hr.  So pay isn't great.  Decent benefits, 401k and stock investment. Work to get sick and vacation days. Not a bad place, they just don't pay great."
good,You could be in charge of many different areas of the store. The operations manager is responsible for all front  and back end functions. Department managers are responsible for each individual departments though out the store.
good,It depended on what position as to whether the quality was high or not. The loader position was extremely taxing and most people expected a lot of going above and beyond constantly to be standard even when they were not doing so. You end up doing many other jobs while still being paid the least in the store.
good,Not to sure it was a long time ago when i was there so I cant remember too much about it. It was a job that i needed for the time. I did enjoy it there.
good,Fast paced with demanding deadlines for each customer with minimal staffing and lack of support due to associates knowledge of each departments responsibilities.
good,"Home Depot is a good place to work however you start off part-time. I feel like for what I do every day (packing out doors,cabinets,vanities) then putting it in the over head and pulling it from the overhead, I deserve full-time. It makes me feel like i'm doing a lot of work for little pay."
good,"I am a lot asscoiate over there and I work a lot. CO-workers are cool to work with or get to know, but customers often at times are rude and annoying.  Nevertheless for the position I have I always do my best to help customers out."
good,love the people I work with and the environment. Not really sure about other locations but the management team here is poor. Nothing is really hard about working here its a pretty easy laid back work place.
good,Rental and Sales of equipment and tools. Repair of customers tools.Make the sales goals the store had on a daily bases. Work with team of 7 associates have everything in place .
good,"The Home Depot offers better benefits and compensation than many other retail companies but their wages are not any better. if your looking for a simple part time job for some extra cash or want to make a career out of retail and get into management then its a great place to work, but if you are looking for a full time job to support yourself until you find something your passionate about its not the best. You only get one raise a year and its often less than 50 cents on a dollar. Unless you get into management or been there for many years, the pay sucks. Overall the environment is good and it's not usually a stressful place to work. They will teach you how to drive many different fork trucks which is helpful if you decide to look somewhere else for employment driving them."
good,"Typical day was Doing Check lists, doing hazmat, Unloading and receiving trucks, i was self trained to the department, had many different supervisors and manager(s)."
good,Overall home depot was an okay jobs. Its just when we're on a mandatory 12 hours for 5 days that really got to me. But if i could yes i would go back and work for them
good,Manager and Assistant Managers were excellent to work with and for. A typical day in the role that I played was to engage the customer for home installations. I learned a great deal about good customer service practices. The hardest part of the job was not getting an employee discount. The most enjoyable part of the job was the personnel I was giving the chance to work with.
good,"At Home Depot you are expected to know everything there is to know about home improvement as part of their goal to be the best customer service retailer in the world. Even in a role where you do heavy physical labor, you are expected to have product knowledge and give improvement advice on over a million SKUs. "
good,"one on one interacting with contractors on a daily basis. while taking care of the customers work was very easy, you give the best professional treatment to the customers and they will always come back to shop more. Busy work environment and easy to perform. Multicultural"
good,"Depending on Management, Stressfull , Lack of help. Throw you too the fishes and you basically swim or drown. Lack of Management Help. Hard to become fulltime"
good,I work at the service desk which can be very stressful.  working with the customers at HD   can be  OMG  or you can find very nice people. The hardest part is dealing with online orders. the most enjoyable is the people I work with.
good,"I generally love customer service so I excelled at my job.  If you are a ""not my aisle"" kind of person you should not apply here.  The store I worked at was in a somewhat rough neighborhood and was disorganized which was very frustrating."
good,I enjoyed working there the time I did. I Would have loved to become full time but at the time that was not an option. During my time there management always complemented me on my work performance.
good,"A typical day at work consist of packing down boxes from overhead, front facing, which means just making sure items on the shelf is visible and easy for customers  to find. Everyday i learn something new in different departments/ Overall management is well. Workplace culture is very cliquey. The hardest part of my job is the lack of teamwork from other associates. The most enjoyable part is helping the customers and just meeting so many different people and building relationships with customers."
good,Very busy store in Texas which often required working at various positions within the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was the employees i worked with.
good,Great associates to work with management can be better and care about us more than what they claim to care and can’t advance if you don’t know anyone wages are not bad
good,I grew a lot with the company and learned what I wanted to do for my career. It provided a lot of opportunities and benefits for my family during my time there.
good,"This place of employment is very fast- paced and achieving in every aspect. There’s also growth of employment, with the many departments you can transfer to. But they’re always lacking staff, in every department.  Being a cashier for the 2 years I was there, made it difficult to do my job at times.  Customers would complain, that they cannot find any employees and will sometimes take the frustration (Verbally) out of the cashier. Also they’re flexible with accommodating employees with their school schedules."
good,"Overly laid back environment. It is great if you are just looking for a paycheck, but there isn't much opportunity for new skills unless you jump around between departments. The company is pretty old school and very rigid. But most people seem pretty happy day to day."
good,"Most of these Jobs are entry level and way below poverty line, I would not have any more to say at least the nation is moving, most of those employees are serving over 10 years they are mostly permanent."
good,"management styles vary from store to store"
good,"Workload was relatively easy, however high demands for pushing additional services and credit to customers caused friction with new customers looking at products for research. Chain of management was broken multiple times in the few months I had worked there due to regime changes in store management."
good,"When peak sales season ends in September, Home Depot will cut hours for its Associates. It brags about it's profit sharing plan but it's really not much. For instance when store gets a $20,000 reward check from HD for going above sales goals, and there are 200 store employees, your share is roughly $100. lf you are an appliance salesman, you make $11/hr with no commission. If you go $15,000 or more over you sales plan, you get nothing - just a pat on the back. In addition, management constantly tells you to sell more, more and you are threatened with write-ups if you don't meet their goals."
good,"Typical day at work involves those who want to micromanage."
good,I would rather not provide a review for The Home Depot at this time.  I have been fortunate and blessed to be able to have secured employment with another GREAT company after being laid off.
good,"Home Depot has opportunity for those willing to work for it, but you have to be ok with working weekends and anytime between 5am and 11pm. Also, make sure you understand what it is really like to stand on concrete for 8 hours. I have seen many people come and go because they cant handle it. The only part of the job that is hard to take is the lack of recognition. I dont need big gifts, but an occasional ""thanks"" would have been wonderful."
good,"This is a very structured working environment with very specific"
good,"busy and quick, learned a lot working in the lumber dept. some management were team players, diversified, dealing with disrespectful customers, helping people with there problems."
good,The managers at my store don't know how to run a store so it is very messy and stressful. If we had a better management system it would be an ok job. It's only temporary.
good,"Typical day at work could vary. Sometimes it's slow and peaceful, you can work on your assignments, documentation and defects.  Others it's all about support, some production issue and you must work until resolved.  And once in a while it's everything at once - production issue and deadline and support.  Fun."
good,"Working at Home Depot as a Cashier was good when I first started there and then after a month or so, my days of working decreased when they would hire new people. I tried to wait it out but nothing would change. I did however before it got complicated enjoyed the job, I enjoyed working with people and the customers made my days sometimes. If you are looking for an extra job with working full-time already i would recommend this job, but I would also not recommend becoming a cashier."
good,"It really depend on the position, and upper management. I was fortunate enough to work under managers with a high level standards. "
good,The best thing about this job is customer service. I have learned a lot about all the Departments and their roles in assisting customers. Management can be a little bit more supportive. Some days there is Team Work and other days are about rank in how long they have been with the company.
good,"The Home Depot that I was working at was not a great start for a first job mainly because the schedule was all over the place and it ruined my work experience. Overall, I suggest you not apply for Home Depot if you don't have any work experience."
good,"Good people to work with in terms of co-workers but management can be corupt and they need to increase pay. A lot of ""performance punishment"". If you are capable of a lot, good worker, smart, expect for them to take full advantage of it"
good,"Age discrimination"
good,"The salary and benefits for an entry-level position are not bad.  However, it can be difficult to advance if you're not in the spotlight."
good,Worked as a Paint Specialist but the paint department often served as a Customer Service desk. Clients were pleasant and a lot of repeat customers that made it fun once you got to know them. Co-workers were organized and always helpful.
good,"I was let go do to my own errors. "
good,Co workers are great people. The problem is the lack of management and they do not address problems that need to be fixed. Hard to trust the management.
good,"I am in sales and am a top performer, but the pay isn't good, but the benefits are, good insurance both health and dental, as well as employer matched 401k."
good,On a daily basis I mostly enioyed my job my break times were exact and I left work on time everyday. my supervisor is very tolerant of my other jobs and the work atmosphere is lite and considerate
good,It's a great opportunity. Decent pay. decent benefits. Steady pace constantly on your feet. It's a good work experience. Very nice employees.  I recommend working here.
good,"I was hired on as a temporary worker, so I did not get to know the company as well as most people would. It was mostly a stress free environment and management was too laid back."
good,A day at depot was ok. Employees are usually good to work with. Management was also ok. The scheduling was the only hard part of the job while in school.
good,"Taking care of the customers special orders. Writing schedules, counting tills, reviewing time off with human resources, making sure special orders were accurate."
good,This is a great conpany to work for with the benefits ypu recevive but they use to hold base pay down. The corporate office has the right cultures it is just not passed down to the store level correctly.
good,its alot of hard work customers will always have attitude when they come in but u have to be calm and listen to them and help them out as much as you can
good,"This was a major departure for Home Depot going into the home decor market, specializing in the high end. I worked in the paint department for years, good company."
good,I never stress at work. life is very relaxed and management is kind. I'm not micromanaged and left to do my work in peace. the actual workload is never too much.
good,"They constantly change management and no one is on the same page. They have department heads that want to be managers soo badly, but they never promote the hardworking ones."
good,its a ok company depending on what department you work in. They can improve a lot with pay as and lower health insurance cost. The management is pretty friendly
good,"Its a simple place to work and better for people who love to be on their feet, not a good place for older people unless you are working in the phone center or greeter."
good,"The people at Home Depot are all very professional and nice to work with. The selling process for exterior products is not consistent with current trends. I describe it as a 1950's style ""Sears"" selling model with 1950's metrics in a 21st Century culture. At this point in my career, it is difficult to deal with petty issues associated with small deals."
good,"A lot was expected as a Garden Associate such as heavy lifting, customer service, and maintenance of department. The job was fun and provided me with a lot of customer service experience. I faced a lot of different challenges from loading vehicles to solving a customers problems with merchandise or at home."
good,"If you only want part time & enjoy helping customers,this is for you. You can learn many types of trades from lumber,paint,gardening,flooring,etc... I've learned many different aspects of retail that I never knew from behind the scenes. This was/is a learning experience for me."
good,Pretty easy place to work once you start to know and gather knowledge of products within your own department. Friendly and helpful coworkers. Work is work it always starts to suck once you get to comfortable.
good,"I had to receive, & scan all packages! Sweep cleaning station, make trash bails! Follow all manager instructions! I had to rap store products into pallets!"
good,It was an okay place to work before we got new management and then it go to stressful and the management didnt really seem to care much about the associates
good,"The company was VERY good to its folks back in the ""Bernie-Arthur days"".. Now just slightly a step above Target.. 2 steps above Wal-Mart..  Better than average tho -"
good,"I enjoy all my work, but this was a little too catty among the women. I had items stolen part of  and management blamed me, etc.. I was a cashier so my customers were my focus and my pleasure. By far the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Difficult to make ends meet if you have any dependents and you are on your own."
good,"its a job where people can work and get hours with the minimum wages, but always one dollar up it. They are picky on who they hire full -time. Like you can be there for 15years and some guy from out of state who just started got a full-time and benefits. No matter unless you willing to move up to corp. there no need to seek further employment."
good,Consistently working short staffed contributes to many short fuses for employees.  Absolutely need to work as a team since you're covering various departments at once.  Some of the assistant store managers don't back up their sales associates with customer issues.  Store manager seems unwilling to make necessary changes.  Pay scale is adequate for part-time high schoolers but not for single adults with bills to pay.
good,"not a stressful place, you do what you need to and that's it. the only problem i would have to say is being a women working there can be a bit awkward, especially helping out in hardware or plumbing since most male customer would rather have a male associate to help out"
good,"Bad management. They say they care for the associates but they really dint, just want there big bonus checks twice a year. Great to start out but then management starts moving around from store to store then before you know your surrounded by total strangers!"
good,"Depending on your job assignments, it can be very boring to exciting, like most other retail stores. In my last position I was charged with customer service for installs provided by the Home Depot"
good,"I enjoy most of my customers, however there are those few demanding ones that just rub you the wrong way. My day consists of  quite a few of those type do to the area I work in, Therefore my customer service skills are tested daily. Some of our management are on top of things, unfortunately the management that should be isn't, I do however enjoy the people I work with and majority of my customers. Coverage and help, or lack there of is probably my biggest issue and makes my day very difficult because it causes my customers to become frustrated and irritable. That makes my job that much more stressful and hard. Though after all is said and done, I do have say I do enjoy seeing the smile on my customers face when I was able to turn whatever negative experience they just had into a very positive one, Ensuring their return to our store as a valued customer."
good,"When I first started there, management cared about employees.  They always showed us they appreciated us.  Usually with a party or at least a paid lunch once a month. They really showed that family was always important.  Now management has changed and it no longer feels like a  great place to work.  No appreciation for cashiers, only get 1 wknd a month off regardless of what's going on in your life. I used to love going to work.  Then I really started to dread going there."
good,"I loved working at home depot. Management could've  been alot better. Worked with great people from all ethnicities and it was really fun. I appreciate the store "
good,Always something to keep busy with or helping customers. Managing the front end is just not working out for my in a time aspect of it. Nothing bad to say about working for Homedepot
good,Great Environment with a fast paced work environment.Different costumers everyday with an ability to grow costumer service with diverse clientele.Great management.
good,"Working at the home depot has its pros and cons but so does every job, i feel as if some positions are under paid being that they often require us to do so much (Customer service specifically)."
good,"Lot Position. Its what you make of it. Nothing more. It can be demanding or very easy; its up to the individual. There are no guildelines. Its easy to get lost, to become a good or bad worker while doing the same things."
good,"Management was annoying, some of the employees were intolerant, but most of the people there were nice enough.  Still have some people I talk to, but not really disappointed to leave."
good,"As a sales associate I had an opportunity to learned new fields of work that I considered a complete turn around in my work experiences in the Philippines. How ever, having the guts and fashion to learn I can say that I can strive but considering the fact that I am not physically fit to do more of a lifting activities, I believe it would be unfair to the company that I cannot totally perform my job in this aspect. "
good,"Starting the day in receiving you first had to organize your area, from the previous night to be able to start receiving freight as soon as you come in.  The next item you had to inspect all the equipment for safety, then you had to process all the hazard materials that had been brought back or left by customers to insure it was sent to the right facility to be handled. Third ups, fedex  would start coming in by other carriers to be checked against bill of ladings for complete or shorted shipments."
good,The tone and vibes were always happy and friendly and the work was balanced. Making sure your section was neat and clean for customers can have a safe environment to shoo was the main focus and help as much as you possibly can
good,"As is in most large conglomerates there's a disconnect between administration and staff.  Ok place to work for entry-level positions, but very stressful demands and low compensation for management staff department heads."
good,"It is a great place to work with great benefits! However, the cost is most of your check unless higher up. Overall great place to start and go back if you leave."
good,Good working environment. I enjoy working at home depot. Salary is fair enough. You can set your own schedule of availability. It can be a good long term job.
good,"Customer service focused, involved in the community. Benefits and Discounts for FT and PT associates. Opportunities for advancement. Equal opportunity employer"
good,"I loved working at home depot until I had to transfer locations because it was getting to far to drive, when I went to the other lactation the manager was horrible and never satisfied and didn't appreciate the hard work anyone does."
good,"Good as a first job."
good,"At times it  was hard working there but when you got used to the fast paste,products knolege taking  classes to show you  what to dou  to better help customers it really turned out to be a wonderful place to work fore."
good,Good for a temp job while your still in school. Management in my location could have been significantly better. They do not treat employees well so don't expect any nice treatment.
good,poor management over took my overview of this company. Over all most people who work for home depot seem to love it. Benefits that are offered are great if you stay long term.
good,"There were no extreme likes or dislikes to this job. It was an overall good place to work without anything completely uncalled for. Shift work changed with each position, but overall it was what you would expect."
good,"As a cashier at Home Depot I was responsible to take care of the customers before leaving the store.  Having worked in the Corporate world this was an eye opener job.  I enjoyed it at first.  The staff was fun and there was no pressure.  Management was nice and caring.  The hardest part of the job was to get credit card applications.  It was mandatory to get 3 credit card applications per week.  It was during a time of financial difficulties in 2008 and I had problems forcing people to apply for credit cards when they could not even pay their bills.  I therefore left Home Depot because it was against my ethics to force people to sign for credit cards."
good,"They have really good benefits,as well as health care, 401k. Another thing would be flexible hours and days according to the employee's needs. Overall okay."
good,"Its a great place to learn many tricks and ways to do certain jobs depending on the product you sell. There is a ton of learning experience available while working there, as well as great co workers."
good,"The culture is very cooperative. Everyone is very upbeat and kind. The schedule of the MET team cannot be beat in the retail industry with a set schedule including nights, weekends and holidays off."
good,It was a stressful job where I was because they had so many customers in the garden dept there. I liked the people working there and people helped each other out. It was hard to please everyone when you are busy because you have people lined up to talk to you and then people call on the phone so it was hard to balance it out. It seemed the day would fly by because we were so busy.
good,"I help customer with order on flooring, tile and blinds and sock and maintain area."
good,It's a good place to learn how to use pallet jacks and opportunities to move up to different positions I learn how they process all the return items the pay was good
good,"The Home Depot, was more for their employees, they heard their concerns, and gave that employees chances to grow, and move up in the higher roles in the store, if you wanted to. Open oppotunities, for people with degrees to get better positions and better pay options."
good,"you must stick to your area "
good,this was a very good place to work-I enjoyed helping the customers and working in multiple departments  the chance for advancement was very limited and they started to take things away from us
good,"...what a career! This job makes me seek employment elsewhere. Very pleased with my experience, management could be a little bit better with the store I worked in"
good,Not a bad company. Its not the company you quit its the managers. The company does recognizes you accomplishments has good benefits.  Overall upbeat company
good,Perfect for people going to school and or retiring not good for people who are trying to live on there own. Was good for what I needed it for at the time now that I have graduated I need a different job.
good,You will learn how to be handy and how to deal with all types of people.  Non-managerial roles get a set time schedule. The only time the store is closed is Christmas and Thanksgiving
good,The job was good but the management sucked with the exception of only a hand full of people. The hours were fine but the management was lousy they didn't do anything for themselves or put their responsibility onto another person without any direction. My personal manager for my department was very willing and went above and beyond for everyone at the store.
good,I loved working at home depot. back when I worked their the management was amazing and everyone always helped each other. although lately I hear different..
good,"Good pay and the company likes to help associates with any problems they are going through. "
good,"Must be a people person.Customer Service is the top priority. Physical job, walking,lifting, stocking, maintaining store appearance , training new coworkers. Must be able to work in team environment. Opportunity for position advancement"
good,"A typical day depends on the department you're working in. Since i worked in the lumber department i pretty much had one of the most difficult work load compared to any other department associate. It became more difficult since some of my co-workers were lazy and i had to do most of the work. the management was almost no existent since they had all departments to look after and left you to do what was needed, if you did the work and were in good standing with the management you'll be fine. I did learn how to drive the fork lift which is a plus. hardest part of the job: dealing with customers, co-workers that didn't do their job, a lot of heavy lifting. The only enjoyable part of the job was driving the fork lift."
good,"While it is listed as a retail job, you will be expected to go far above and beyond what any retail worker would have to do. Move 80 pound bags of concrete, 60 pound barrels of paint, loading cars, working random departments with no training, and things that are normally left for managers or night crew. You are also expected to almost always work weekends, and if you request a weekend off, be prepared to work an entire week with no days off."
good,The job was okay. It started to get very busy and thing starting changing. This is a great job for someone who is a fast learner and can pick up fast.
good,overall decent place to work. you rarely get stressed and you basically know all your responsibility so as long as you do them your job is secure. one annoying thing is theirs to many chiefs and not enough Indians.
good,The managers are pretty good to get along with but they should always put a limit to they friendship and remind associates that they have authority and treat all associates equally.
good,"I worked part time, at night. As a closer you put away many return carts and help customers find what they need. Often you have to answer to many mangers on one shift."
good,The hardest part of the home depot is trying to keep up with the company's plays. the have short timing and not everything come in order some time s when the product comes in it disorganized.
good,"Home Depot's strength lies in the diversity and dedication of their associates.  Unfortunately, at times mid level executive initiatives tend to get in the way of employee work/life balance and even get in the way of providing world class customer service."
good,"Home Depot is a company that compensates their associates very well.   However, in return for this ""battle pay"", the expectations are extremely high.  "
good,"A typical work day starts with pre-shift meeting, stretches, and passing Homer for recognizing team work among the associates. Working in the office, unless someone from the floor acknowledges your hard work, you are not recognized. However, working in the office has its enjoyable benefits we get to whistle while we work. In other words, we get the job done and have fun. We have a very diverse culture that works well in the organization. There is no hard part about my job for me but others might find it hard maneuvering through different spreadsheets to complete a single task but for me that is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Home Depot is very good about making sure employees are fully knowledgeable about each area before releasing them to work in that area. There for if you ask someone a question you can be confident that they are giving you accurate information.
good,"Was a cashier, but most of the time, no one really has personality to them. Every thing seemed hollow, it was justs WORK and thats it. And i understand its work, but if people spend 4-14 hours a day in there with each other, its nice for more conversation and open attitudes."
good,"When I started at The Home Depot in 2001 the pay scale was relatively liberal. I started at $13 an hour and the lot attendants $10 an hour. Pretty good. Over time, as with most big box companies, the pay rates were degraded. People were coming in at $7.50 an hour."
good,"The best thing about the company, in my honest opinion, is the experience that you can take away from it, there's alot to be learned within this company."
good,"They got me through financially while I was a student in Winnipeg, Canada. Great workmates and I really enjoyed the interaction with customers, as well as the challenge of dealing with the ""not so happy"" customer."
good,I have had man bad experiences at Home Depot and do not wish to keep coming home frustrated and mad cause of work. There are so few customers that come in during the week it is not funny.
good,"The Home Depot is a good company to work for, but the pay doesn't match the time and effort they demand from you. A company that's a heavily shopped as this has the funds to do so. The people and Atmosphere are great though."
good,"Xxxxxx sometimes hectic , more work learn more about home products , get to know things to do by ourselves (diy), still good , but times managers work with less people to earn more bonus"
good,"Okay place to work. Had a lot of shoplifters, so always had to watch what customers were doing. I loved dealing with the customers, and cashiering. I loved my hours, very flexible."
good,worked there over 7 months told i'd get full time 4 months in as we was under staffed. around half the ammount as needed for my job. and when they got new hires they often quit within a month.
good,Lots of pressure but I've learned a lot and helped so many in the communities. The customers and associates are one big family. reaching numbers and leads are when it slows down hours and less hours means less bodies to do all the same work.
good,The people are nice there but some of the managers shouldn't be allowed to be in charge of the store. A lot of the time they don't know what to do in certain situations or handle things the completely wrong way.
good,the structure of how things are done is organized chaos. as a sales associate its more chaos. customers are usually rude and impatient. and the departments are usually understaffed.
good,"Mostly enjoyed the time I spent at the Home Depot. Met many wonderful people who made a lasting impression and taught me many valuable lessons."
good,The Company itself isn't bad but the culture isn't too great there are way too many bosses who don't come together to work as a team even though they promote teamwork overall. That boss to employee balance is very thin were our over looked as the worker an your experience over someone who may have gotten the job as manager but doesn't know the job but wants to make choices just because there the leader but doesn't even understand what it is into the job itself.
good,"i was a window and door specialist, i would take the customers measurement and then take those specs and make them the perfect custom patio or entry door based on what it was they needed, usually handled big contracting customers that spent at least 10k on a job and i never had a complaint against me"
good,Job was pretty good but management was not always around to help with problems with your job but it was very fast paced which I enjoyed. Made the day go by really fast
good,"As a cashier the main job responsibilities are preventing loss of merchandise, processing the home depot credit card payments and transactions. Training could be better because as a cashier customers often ask hardware related questions which can be intimidating. Training is done on a computer."
good,"Home Depot use to be a job i enjoyed a lot , but due to the behavior of the managers and some leads , it makes it non enjoyable now. The benefits are great , 401K plan is offered , as well as discounts for things such as six flags, vacations and dinning."
good,"its a fun place to work , as designer you are better paid rather thn others , but the managing system and dress codes ( in 100 degrees summer you cant wear sleeveless or skirt or open shoes !) and some more stupid rules they dont even know why either ."
good,"Relaxed atmosphere, steadily busy with options of 30 min to an hour lunches flexible schedules, gym at the workplace, food trucks twice a week and bonuses"
good,The Home Depot was a fun working environment. Everyone was like a family to believe it or not. The hardest part of working there was dealing with upset and difficult customers.
good,You walk into work excited about the day. You clock in and do your shift while providing excellent customer service. The co workers are excellent and fun to be around.
good,I liked the people I worked with but found that some supervisors made their own rules and liked to over rule other supervisors when it came to employee duties.
good,"A typical day at work. If you enjoy interacting with people then this is the job for you. This job is definitely a good start if your planning on working in any of these fields (construction, architect, or urban planning)."
good,"Great environment with great people to work with. However, the hours as a part time worker are inconsistent and scattered throughout the week in short increments."
good,It was a great place to work but the only thing was I had to travel every other day. But for the most part it's a good job to advance in the company or to travel to other state with the company
good,Home Depot is more concerned with making more money than providing excellent customer service. They have too few employees to meet customer demands and have bad local reputations among the community.
good,I enjoyed working at Home Depot. My coworkers were all great and I enjoyed assisting the customers. There was always plenty of workload every day so I was guaranteed to stay busy.
good,It a good place to start and learn how to become a Manager but not the best career choice. But not is not to say you can't make a career out of it because you can...
good,loved my coworkers. lots of fun activities for employees and great benefits. the pay was horrible and so was management. def opportunity for advancement. i was promoted pretty quickly. i just dont think i was treated fairly by management.
good,"Comfortable place to work, great management and fellow employee support; however, the pay is abysmal.  I liked the job, but couldn't afford to work there - had to find a better paying job."
good,Home Depot really teaches you the value of the costumer. Working in the RDC is very fast paced and allows you to decide how well your incentive is. Really diverse company
good,"Loved working at THD"
good,"Great working hours, able to work around your schedule and great benefits, great co workers, but bad management . Great intensives. Lack of necessary equipment"
good,i learned a lot of thing about home improvement that can be taken in to everyday life. customer service and product availability was very important. they give bonuses every six month
good,"When I started at Home Depot, it was a place that still focused on its employees and its community. Now that the new CEO has taken over, the focus is increasing sales."
good,"A lot to learn and remember.  Different managing styles from different managers.  Lacks consistency between store locations. "
good,"Going into this job, I had a very rudimentary knowledge of home improvement tasks and general DIY information. Everyday, in the duties of dealing with customers' questions and needs, I had the opportunity to improve that knowledge base, both by learning from other associates as well as having to improvise solutions and learn on my own. Between associates at the same level as myself, business was very smooth; however once management got involved, they often sided with the customers, even if that meant going against clearly stated policy, all in the name of good customer service and making sure those people would provide return business. There is an in-house assistance program for employees who are struggling financially, whether through illness, loss in the family, car troubles, etc."
good,I work in the Tool Rental Center where we rent various styles of tools from the average do it your- selfers to the professional who  paid to work commercially.
good,fun place to work just needed fulltime need nothing pt at my current age dont even think that this is revilent to the contrary. great company just not an opportunity to advance stressfull about obtaining credit cards to customers
good,"Love working with customers face to face,"
good,Home Depot was my first job and they have a very kind and friendly work environment staff wise. The hours are a bit on the other side due to how late or early you can work but they are flexible. Pay is really good for starting out.
good,"A typical day at the home depot would start by me arriving at 6:55pm to start my shift, from there to the locker where you store your job essentials including the signature home depot apron along with a knife and some gloves. 7:00 pm i'd arrive at the back of the store where the trucks are unloaded and stay there for aprox 1:30 to 2 hours unloading a truck with the other members of the 7 O'Clock freight team. 9PM 15 min break and back to the floor to stock what we previously unloaded. About 10:45pm I and the other 7 O'Clock freight team members start cleaning up our areas and make our way to the back to put away our things in the lockers provided and clock out to start the day over again tomorrow."
good,On Monday's they have a smart list that the supervisor is supposed to do but always make those under him do. Then if there are any issues with any orders that he is given to do by his supervisor he pass it to us to do .I learned how to Delagate work.Managers rarely want to help .The hardest part about this job is trying to get a day off. The most enjoyable part of the day is break time.
good,"The job itself isn't horrible. The management needs help, but I've met many people there who I call friends and these people help make the job a better place to be. There are other store in this company that I can tell treat their associates better than this store does. I believe this store is lacking on a lot of things. In order to keep customers happy, you have to keep the associates happy and over my 3 years of working here, I see that going down hill and associates attitude is dropping. They have made some changes to the service desk that have been nothing but a hassle and it's making the job harder to enjoy. You can't get to what you need to get to and returns is constantly a mess. I have had experience in the passed that I see to be favoritism. There is also a lot gossiping and adults that act like children. It could be a great place to work if a few changes were made."
good,"Was on a cash resigster most of the time, got breaks and lunch some times on time, there was times I didn't get a lunch or break, the associates are very friendly and very nice, the management was good at times!"
good,"The Home Depot is difficult customer service. As a head cashier I was responsible for the cashiers working during my shift, dealing with upset customers, money handling, etc. The store only cares about how many credit cards you sign a customer up for in a day and if you don't perform, they will terminate you."
good,"If you need part-time job The Home Depot will work with your schedule. It can be a fast paced environment with rude costumers at times. So if you have the patience, this place will be good for you."
good,The people you work with for the most part are great and become almost like family. There are times when you do not have enough help to support customers. There is also lack of communication at times between management and the associates.
good,This position is a great starting job for college students. The hours vary but with the right schedule it can work well with your schooling. Benefits are included even with part time work.
good,"I feel I cannot give this place a justice review because I was placed in the LOT department (pushing carts) a lot of the people I worked with were all around nice people, I appreciated it, but I received close to no help when I had to load concrete and mulch which happen to be the bulk of my spring / summer / fall shifts, I only weight about 120 at the time and I'd get stuck lifting more the half my body weight pretty bad on the back, customers were disgusting thru and thru, we finally hired some help in the lot but they never did their job and management wouldn't enforce it, I left on good terms but I regret having stayed as long as I did. Bottom line,its good if your a high school student to do the job i was doing, but I don't recommend staying longer unless you get in the store, which in my case once you get placed in lot tough luck getting out."
good,The job was okay. They pay really well for going into that kind of work. Part time employees do have the opportunity to get benefits not only the full time employees.
good,The coworkers were fun and very productive. Loaders and forklift operators could be unavailable at due to assisting others. Managers were understanding and fair.
good,I love the people I work with. But too often there aren't enough people covering the departments and you're doing the work of three. The raises are few and far between. HD used to be a great company to work for... now it's an a job you do while you look for a better job.
good,The environment just wasnt cut out for me. its extremly cut throat and in training i really wasnt trained. my trainer would tell us what to do and watch us do it.
good,"I was part of a team in a fast paced environment while providing excellent customer service. Job duties included following direction under supervision, and being extremely knowledgeable about our products. I also worked in the warehouse."
good,"I was second in command to the supervisor. I was certified on all machinery and was a forklift driver every night. Every nigh i would have to up stock heavy merchandise with the order picker. I learned a lot about how to be a team player, be a leader, and work along side management. Every night was a fun work experience because we always had a good time and got everything done in a timely manner. The hardest part of the job was when the warehouse was over stocked with no where to put the merchandise because then we'd have to quickly look come up with an on the spot solution however the most enjoyable part of the job was the team i got to work with. we all liked to tell jokes and have fun while working together to get the store stocked and grand opening ready."
good,"Overall I learned a significant amount while working for Home Depot. I learned a ridiculous amount about construction and how to fix things so that I could relay info to customers. In some ways, I gained confidence to go out and fix my own home when things broke down. "
good,"Not a bad company, just a little behind on the progression of it's internal development. There are many good things that Home Depot does with the community. In all not a bad place to work."
good,"Good work environment but lots of rules about attendance and other company policies."
good,"It's retail. Pay is above minimum wage. Expect the usual 20-26ish hours a week unless you somehow luck into full time. Despite what they'll say there's not a ton of room for career growth."
good,The Home Depot will drive you into the ground. They will work you to death. There is very little work/ home balance. Some of the management is good and others are terrible.
good,"Provided a basic income and stable, part-time position. Management emphasized the development of culture and provided above-average work packages/benefits for their employees."
good,"Overall THD is a great company, store support center has great amenities like gym, cafe, credit unions, ups, startbucks, atms, cleaners etc on-site. However, IT leadership has serious issues and lot of bad politics within IT. IT managers/directors are scared of their senior leaders and hence don't paint the right picture. New IT development sheriff treats his managers/directors like dirt and doesn't like when he is challenged. This is a good place for junior developers."
good,I enjoyed most days working here. Most employees I liked and most were friendly and willing to help. Hard to advance as management can be cliquey. Hard to make any changes as managers always say they want to help but corporate is in control.
good,do not work at home depot the harder that you work the more they treat you bad. I did not like how managagment favored certain people and did not offer growth
good,"Large turnovers, understaffed until summer, making scheduling for a life impossible. Overall customers are friendly, most will need to be taught everything. (DIY movement)"
good,"Helping people throughout the day if it is fixing a bad problem or designing a new house. I learned great communications and interpersonal skills, along with tons of building knowledge. Hardest part was working overnight from time to time. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping others."
good,"A great job but, as a 16-year old I felt out of place and judged.  Fun work environment and O.K. management, I felt my department manager was awkward and out of place."
good,"Overachieved the monthly expectation of customer resolution and retention by 10% over the prior year."
good,"If you want to move up there really isn't a work life balance regardless of what you are told. As a supervisor you are expected to give your life to that place. It is a solid company to work for but typical Politics of most job settings unfortunately handwork doesn't speak for itself and that was frustrating. The benefits and 401k are great. The pay can be really good if you move through the system the right way such as certain departments and positions. If you stay in the same position raises generally aren't that great. Bonuses can be good if your store performs well and success sharing. If you are offered the opportunity to get training in ATL that was the best part of my time with the company, great and beneficial experience. As with any job there are pros and cons."
good,"Loved working with the customers and my co-workers.  Too labor intensive in the paint department.  Pay was not very good, but it was a fun place to work."
good,"I worked in many departments, learning valuable skills to impart with guests over the many years worked there.  The hours demanded can be intimidating at times, however the employee compensation was generous."
good,"Like my co-workers, they're great! Management is in my opinion looking for their next move. If you want to work somewhere that you can get paid for the work you do this is probably not it."
good,"The Home Depot is a great atmosphere to work in, the people that I work with are amazing and most work hard. The management is less than mediocre and will contradict what they say and almost never follow through or help with any kind of training."
good,"Great people to work with"
good,"Day to day can get repetitive. You can ask to job shadow in other departments but they won't raise your pay based off your experience. Some managers are great and are good leaders, while some are just power hungry and definitely NOT customer service material. Workplace culture is good, employees get lots of treats during the month and fun activities. The hardest part of the job is standing on your feet and dealing with irate customers, it's not so bad though. The pay isn't the greatest but is better than most minimum wage jobs. The most enjoyable part about the job is definitely the people that work there, everyone is usually very friendly."
good,I enjoyed working for the Home Depot and learned a great deal about shipping and receiving which has kept me in this similar field of study. The team/family environment made it pleasurable to work in the company.
good,"Was a cart wrangler for the entire summer of 2016, but a man has to do what he has to do to pay rent. Made a lot of good friends and had a good time working."
good,"My responsibilities at work usually included running the register, helping customers, and other duties. Management is understanding for the most part, but every person is different. The hardest part of the job as working in the Garden Center on a hot day with a huge crowd. The best part of the job was knowing that everything was done to the best of my ability."
good,"Good benefits for their employees, smart team- family oriented. Only problem is the age gap between many of the employees, younger side tends to fill with drama easily in ANY store!"
good,It's a good company to work for but the culture in the workplace is deteriorating. There is a lot of jealousy between co-workers. The work is not difficult and there is help when available.
good,"It was a great company, good people, great management. If i wouldn't of moved Id still be working there, Hopes this help. Good pay, good hours, highly recommended"
good,"Most customers are great, most co-workers are great, managers do have favorites but home depot has given me the experience I need to further my career as a bank teller which has been my dream job.  I've learned a lot working in retail & I'm grateful.  Management has gotten extremely strict but the hardest part of the job is staying open till 10 p.m. now."
good,"Retail based job that has many opportunities to learn new job experiences. Management are helpful at times, but for the most part, are lazy. Advancement is based on politics, along with raises."
good,Home Depot  has changed over the last 10 years from a great company to work for and make a career out of. to a company that is no longer looking for experts to help there customers to less experienced associates running their stores and taking care of their customers. They are just like any other big box store now.
good,"A typical day at work involves me communicating, with staff members and customers inside of Home Depot, Doing alot of moving an rearranging merchandise."
good,"Good place to work, but management needs sensitivity training. Sometimes understaffed, but excellent customer service.Job was minimally difficult. Yes"
good,"It's a great company to work for with great benefits and values, but every store is ran different depending on type management. schedule isn't consistent and you work every weekend unless you request off. over all if you work in a store with decent management you will enjoy working for the company. You obtain a lot of useful information on products and on how to do DIY projects."
good,"Ok place to work. Management not so good, one manager says one thing another says the opposite. Not enough employees so you end up doing the job of three people. They keep people on part time to avoid paying benefits. If not for lousy management would be decent place to work."
good,I'm learning new retail skill everyday.  The management team cares about help you improving and furthering your self in the company. They offer great benefits and every six months a bonus check as well.
good,"You would start your day with a good attitude but surely enough all of ones associates would be sure they gave their boss a hard time, and bashed the overall establishment. "
good,"Day starts out with bring freight out and getting started on the bulk items. Like I have to do plumbing which is toilets and water heaters. lifting up into the area they go in. Doing it by myself without any assistance from another person. Management is great, I haven't learned a whole lot. workplace is okay,"
good,"I have learned a lot working for the home depot, which makes me a better over all sales person. I was hired as a millworks specialist but they had me on the pour hours instead of doing the job I specialized in.v"
good,Customer service for Home depot corporate is a very rewarding yet stressful place of employment. Very quiet and cold work environment. Very rude management.
good,"This was a great summer paying job when I needed it. I am great with people and had a good time with sales associate. I also diversified myself in different departments so I can work in some of them also. Before I left they asked if I wanted to earn my reach truck and lift truck licences. I happily accepted and achieved both before I left.Overall great experience, great people to work with."
good,"Acomodó de mercancía. Atender a los clientes y orientarlos sobre sus necesidades "
good,typical day at work review the orders that need to be pulled in the system print the orders out then i pull and organize them  so they can be put on the delivery truck the next day.
good,Company made a great comeback and under the last CEO customers were the main focus. Each year I was with the company it became more and more like working for Wal Mart with little changes here and there which were more focused on bottom line and not a balance of taking care of the people who work there and customers.
good,"Home depot is a great place to work. The store culture is amazing, but can be watered down by the nonexistence of adequate management."
good,"I was hired as a part timer and was not employed here long enough to get a full time position or benefits. Co workers were fun and very helpful. Always willing to assist. A typical day for me was to go in at 5 am, sit down with our manager and get all instructions on what needed to be done for that day. Usually, we had to clean displays, replace price tags and set up new displays as well as new plan o grams, stock and straighten items on shelves check off inventory lists. The hardest part of my job was dealing with my manager, who unfortunately had an ""unsettled personality"".  The most enjoyable part of the day was working with nice coworkers and feeling like the part of a good team."
good,"I learned to plan out kitchens and help with design ideas, I did 2 months of design training, I spent a lot of time training but never felt comfortable doing anything by myself"
good,working there was so good that everyone feels like a family to you . i did faced a lot of hard steps but with my workmate we managed to pass it . in general working with them was fun .
good,The Home Depot is the only retailer with whom I was employed for more than a year. There was profit sharing and a fair amount of opportunity for advancement.
good,"The job atmosphere was great but when it came down to figuring anything out about your position or advancing, there was just allot of stuff fed to you to make you happy without any real facts being given to you"
good,many of the managers only like a few associates that are always doing what the ask. not everyone likes how we get ignored at times nor how when a day is requested off they still want to schedule you and make you use your vacation time  when it was there issue.
good,It is a great place to start working but it will prove difficult to advance. Will cut back your hours significantly on top of not giving full time job. They have a thing called a pt tracker or part time tracker where they monitor your hours to make sure you don't go over 27 hours if you do they drop it to only 20 or less hours a week so make sure to have another source of income. It is a hard place to advance to as well
good,"+Training and Development"
good,It is a great place to grow and learn there is always opportunity. You can go as high as your ceiling and passed it if you want. I had great experiences and challenging ones as well. Never a dull moment.
good,its a fun place to work and start off learn about home improvements and always learning new things. Just that management is poor an the departments are always short handed
good,You do not get recognized for anything being on the night shift freight team. It is physically demanding. Otherwise it is a very brain dead job. Unload trucks and stock shelves with product.
good,The Home Depot remains an instrumental power house in this country and should be seen in this light. There is simply the matter of fundamental conception to be previewed.
good,"I gained vast knowledge in the DIY department mainly about paint products and accessories and garden type variety items such as plant life, food, and pesticides. I also assisted many guests with questions and concerns and answered the telephone about the products the store carried. I was also mixing, color matching, and stirring paint to the correct color the customers wanted it."
good,"Management is fair minded. Co-workers are awesome! The benefits are good, and a strong team and community environment is promoted. There is a lot of physicality to the job, I lost 20 lbs trying to keep up with the work load."
good,"- if you are a student or are just looking for part time job, this is a great place to work."
good,Working at the HOME DEPOT has it's rewards.  They provide good training and I have learned quite a bit from them.   However it seems that Home Depot fosters a culture where some people are allowed to slack off and leave their post simply because they are friendly with managers.
good,"Home depot was pretty frustrating if you want to get something done and aren't taking orders directly from corporate. That's how most retail environments this size are, I imagine, but corporate didn't specialize plans for a store our size meaning we often ended up way overstaffed and with a revenue goal that was impossible to meet."
good,"Great company culture and people, but little room for advancement. The training is good, but the management system can be sometimes  a bit off. Great if you love working with people, but the pay is not something you can live off of."
good,"The company is a nice way to start your work experience. Teamwork and communication are very important to achieve customer satisfaction (especially when looking for a certain product either in store, online, or in another store). Supervisors organize lunches for the employees on holidays (for example; 4th of July and Christmas). Other activities like voluntary work are also part of the employees's growth. Due to the company's principles, coworkers care about each other (many consider the Home Depot ""their family"" as well)."
good,this is an interesting place to work. lots of upward mobility but the compensation isnt always worth it. the company itself is really great but every store has their issues.
good,Overall my experiences were positive. Good culture. Possibilities for advancement. Good way to build up your resume and gets lots of experience in one place.
good,"The Home Depot offers associates  the opportunity to meet people from different cultures. This makes working at The Home Depot an exciting, and rewarding experience. However, with such a diversity of clientele unmatched by its competitors, every customer project or issue is in its own form a puzzle. Especially, when DIY( Do It Yourself) customers have no idea what it takes to demolition a bathroom and reinvigorate it with the right materials and tools.  My tenure at The Home Depot has been invested in solving problems that seem basic, but require creativity in solving. Dedication to making sure customers receive the attention their problems deserve has rewarded me with the experience of meeting very influential people in different fields, and enduring friendships that expand beyond the working environment."
good,"Depending on the department, a majority of the day you are assisting customers with their home improvement needs. The company has a great culture, but that is only enhanced by the the store management. You definitely get a great deal of experience in home repair while working there, which comes in handy when you own your own home."
good,"Could use better management. Great co-workers. Very, very busy store. Would like to grow in the company, but not much in acknowledgement or incentive to train for higher position."
good,I try to make work a great place for customers and co-workers.  I help customers find all of what they are looking for. I am a cashier so I make sure they had a good experience. When there are kids too I great them and enjoy making them smile..  The hardest part of the job I have found was to get full time and further my self in the company.  I think the most enjoyable part of the job is to help customers have a great day and cheer up anyone's day I can..  I love to make people smile.
good,"working for this company was fun and productive, just needed better management. I loved the customers and also the energy that my fellow employees brought to work everyday on the job."
good,Give great customer service. Learned multiple positions. Had great team leaders. Coworkers helped and were kind. Difficult to operate lumber machinery
good,"It was a great place to work but I did have a few issues. I was never shown around and I never shadowed anyone so it was extremely hard to get around in the beginning. Other than that it was a wonder place to work, people were friendly and the customers were great to talk too. I recommend this job."
good,Work hard you can grow and build a career from working for that company..there is no room for slackers very fast paced and can get extremely busy during the holidays.
good,"Typical day processing returns, special orders, sales and addressing customer concerns not addressed at the cashier level. Knowledge of store layout and wide variety of home improvement practices very helpful. Always enjoy resolving customer concern both simple and complex and using others' more specific skills when appropriate."
good,Dar oportunidad de crecer a quienes en verdad se lo merecen...
good,If you don't mind working overnights and not getting off when you are supposed to then by all means apply. I wouldn't suggest it if you have to take your kids to school in the morning. The money is excellent at full time and benefits and perks.
good,"I have been with The Home Depot now for 6 years, but feel there is no  where for me to advance in my chosen area, so am looking for other employment.  It has been interesting employment, learning the ways of retail, though my background leads me in different directions.  I would like to get back to a clerical or office type of position, rather than on the sales floor."
good,"A decent company to work for. After working in over twelve stores on a regular basis, I found most of the associates to be very friendly, upbeat and a generally good morale."
good,descansabas sabado y domingo y se respetaba tu hora de entrada como de salida
good,"hardworking getting along well with co workers and customers in general providing top quality customer service in different work related situations on a daily basis with people overall. "
good,"have worked sales and with people face to face but never in a situation like Home Depot...helping people decide what they need/want, etc. They helped me move up in the company and if i didnt get the opportunity for the electrician job i may still be there."
good,"It's a nice company to work for. They recognize when you do great. They have success Sharing, I love the Awards. They acknowledge customers and help them."
good,"The store I was in could've been runned better,wasn't paid for the work put in, my coworkers for the most part was a pleasure to work with, Iam overall ok with my time spent at the Home Depot"
good,loved flooring department. associates were great. customers were uninformed and needy. upper management is entitled and condescending. when you work here your life doesn't matter your just a peon. lower management is good but nobody is reliable and you need to cover your but and you need to do 3 jobs at once.
good,"You will learn about every area, which it's so bad you learn so tips for fixing your own house. Fast breaks. All ways keep in mind were the general area for all the department you will be ask if you work in the department when you walk by."
good,Overall a good company with success sharing and good health insurance benefits. The logistics to execute tasks is good. The culture seem to be good.
good,"The Home Depot is an easy place to work at if you try. I learned many things about every single department in the store, as well as, customer service, receiving, management, how to operate lift trucks, etc. Management is pleasant and easy to work with and learn from. However they were to lenient at times and other times absent when we needed them. The co-workers are pleasant as well but some are just unmotivated and untrained. The hardest part of the jobs was understaffed days and not enough evenly-trained associates. Meaning, not enough associates were certified with the lift trucks and couldn't operate equipment necessary to help customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fun environment and opportunity to learn daily."
good,The surpervisors of the departments are really nice people and great people to work for. As for upper level management certain managers were nicer than others maybe due to level of stress. Coworkers were amazing I still miss majority of them to this day. Hardest part is keep quiet when customers were screaming at you for their order being wrong and you had nothing to do with it.
good,"Typical day was helping customers and stocking shelves."
good,A typical day at home depot is usually busy. Depending on how many hrs you've worked sometimes you will not get a paid 15 minute break even though the head cashiers will  take as many cigarette breaks on the clock as they want. The actual managers are very lazy and don't care if youre sick they will still expect you to work if you don't have any personal time.
good,"Great people to work with, at least the associates, the managers were okay when they weren't green and constantly getting let go.  The store is too big to have two or 3 managers struggling to get everything done"
good,"Checking for safety violations, down stocking products, putting up freight, greeting customers and helping them. Helping other departments when short on team workers."
good,It's not a bad place to work but there is alot of clicks around there and it's bad with the click with management . You get vacation after a year they offer medical.
good,"Helping out customers in person and on phone. Product layout and Advertising layout, Forklift Operator, deliveries , organizing store. conducting ideas for better workforce."
good,"Large work load "
good,"you'll build your communication skills, customer service skills and there is more thing you will learn day by day . the team I had was a great team really helpful ."
good,"management issues,bad communication great benefits. No hours, Has its ups and downs. Its hard to move up in the company if you don't follow managers all day."
good,"Is a good place to work if you are a good worker. They provide  success sharing for those who have been there 90 days or more. It is a busy place, and not for those who are not self motivated."
good,Home Depot was really good to work at. There was lots of areas to learn and teach. There are many opportunities to move forward into other areas of business.
good,"Dealing with Contractors and Customers on their specific projects is satisfying when you assisted them in getting what they need in a timely manner."
good,it was a great place to work met a lot of nice people hour were good Managers were ok they were willing to work with you if you had a problem and needed time off
good,Typical day involves clocking in and not being closely supervised or monitored by any superior. Pretty relaxed work environment that encourages self-motivated productivity.
good,working for The Home Depot taught me to set a pace for myself and focus on my work. My co workers and I enjoyed the luxury of working at night because we have majority of the day to ourselves.
good,At the upper level of management in the company the core values are high and extremely viable. As you move down the management ladder the to the District and Store level management the values tend to be less and the focus on profit and sales more valued. But that is dependent on witch Store and District you are in. Some as say they Bleed Orange and are the ones to work for that will take care of those under them.
good,"being a cashier for home depot was fun and you always learned about the products inside the store. i have learned a lot from working there for 3 months. Management was open to teach you new things if you asked, and the co-workers with great and friendly. the hardest part of the job was finding the right worker in the department, sometimes they were not scheduled until later on the day. but the most enjoyable part was working in different departments during work hours. educating the customers about power tools or other equipment in the store."
good,"My work day consists of following up on pending sales for measures that have taken place for flooring and window treatments and communications with the installers.  There are many different facets of this position which include knowledge of all of the products and assisting customers in selecting the appropriate materials for their projects.  If they are needing assistance, I need to set them up for measures and discuss their options to determine what they want so that I can build a quote for the installs once I get the measures back. Another part of my day is dedicated to aisle maintenance and down stocking merchandise.  Above all of the product knowledge required for this position, I have learned that outstanding customer service will keep a strong bond with the customers and that they will continue to seek your assistance.  Management needs to be well informed of daily operations and maintain a relation with their employees in order to receive the best performances.  My co-workers are hard workers and punctual which makes the work environment easier on the other workers.  Communication is essential to keep everyone on the same page and my co-workers are always leaving notes for each other.  We all have phone numbers for each other so if we run into any issues where further explanation is needed, we can call one another.  The hardest part of my day is getting everything done.  Occasionally, I have to rely on my co-workers to help me out on finishing a given task.  As far as the most enjoyable part of my job, I would have to say that it is the people I work with and my customers."
good,"All in all Home Depot is great place to work as long as you are only looking for part-time. The management is a kind of bitter sweet situation, but they are all good at getting things done and keeping all problems solved."
good,Home-depot is a nice place to work.There is many opportunity to with in this company. Home depot works well with your schedule. The only problem is the available hours here.
good,"I don't mind working here, people are great,very helpful, pay is not bad executable with my experience, hours are bit long. drive is a bit tiring some times."
good,"A lot of the management lacks intelligence. They worked their way up by solely being buddy buddy with previous manager and department heads. Their attendance policy is not lenient at all. If you were out because of an illness, even with a doctor's note advising you not to work, they do not care. Very poor communication skills between managers switching shifts."
good,They're flexible with schedules so it makes for a good school job. Not enough hours given to part time associates though.
good,"As a cashier, the day was easy breezy, consisting of checking out customers, loading lumber and bags of concrete for customers, making sure proper is change is given, covering breaks and skipping your own to cover others (which was consensual on my behalf, I normally didn't take any because I didn't think they were really necessary) and directing customers to aisles and associates as needed."
good,"Helping customers solve their problems is a lot of fun.  They provide us with an excellent break room.  Turn over is very high and we are usually short staffed, which does put pressure on those who are working."
good,"Always something to do, be it stocking shelves or tending to costumers. The fellow staff were bitter and cold but a few were nice to work with. The management was bias and a bit unorganized but over all a fun job."
good,"Great job and the hours are great. Management talks behind your back, plays favorites, and doesn't listen to each side of the story."
good,Its a great place to learn product knowledge and to show initiative. It depends on the store manager and the 4 managers on whether your experience will be enjoyable. Sometimes it can be a joy to work with your coworkers and other times you are the only person on the floor due to everyone abusing their 10 minute breaks or lunches. I was one of the few associates that would greet every customer and help them when I could. If every associate applied themselves it would be the most helpful retail store in the world.
good,"A typical day would be going in, stocking the shelves inside and outside sales floor. Great training process, great mangement. The hardest part is keeping up with overstock. The would bring in so much of one product and not enough of another that would make the overhead bays difficult to find merch."
good,company is good they just act like pushing credit is going to do anything. they expect too much out of cashiers not paying the employees enough for the stuff they expect. Don't tell me to push credit if you don't have a home depot credit card. This goes particularly to management.
good,"schedule was all over the place, morning, noon, night without any regard to life balance. compensation was pretty decent for the area. the hardest part of the job was standing up for hours"
good,"A typical day at work for me would just be coming into work with a positive attitude and just knowing that everything will not be the way you want it to be, but just deal with it in a positive way and do your job and offer great customer service.."
good,"Worked in so many departments, able to pick the hours that I need to work and the days that i need to be off for any family matter or emergency. As long as you are willing to learn the trade, you can be the most valuable employee and the company recognize hard working associates."
good,"50 to 60 hr work weeks during spring. Pay was nice but didn't get much time off to spend it. Good customer base. Not enough employees to take care of the novice customers. Always busy so time passed quickly. Opportunity for advancement was good, Got along very well and built long term relationships with fellow employees"
good,"break down the mixed pallets on to carts at the start of the night, when finished cleared the break down aisle to their departments and going to my department to start, i have two breaks and lunch to take through the night, when finished working my freight in my department i put up my over stock with the Order Picker and bring down stock with it to fill holes on the shelf.  help with the clean up buy clearing pallets, trash, empty carts and sweeps the floor.  "
good,"Before I would clock in I would go to receiving to see how the associate is getting on and what ll came in.  clock in assemble the break down aisle to start splitting mixed pallets in to their departments. while that is going on either me or the other DS gets on a reach to help the receiving associate run the bulk to the floor.  Between doing theses chores get with the other DS and my ASM to help plan the night and delegate a associate a designed area for the night.  work in area myself and between work that area walk the floor seeing how everyone is getting on are see if they need my assistance.  Once i'm finished my area i'm more visible on the floor helping the associates finish or start clearing the floor of trash or empty pallets.  between 4am or 4.30am i'm visiting with every associate to get them extra direction and seeing their progress in their department.  Between 5am and 6am we our in clean up mode making sure we are tight for 6am, like over stock all put up, pallets trash al cleared of the floor, in receiving the trash is all done, the front of the store is clear, get with the management team to do a walk through before i leave.  "
good,"Working at Home Depot you learn a lot of technical information about your department and pretty much everything to do with home improvement. Like any other retail job you will always have to deal with customers and provide excellent customer service. Also like any other retail job you will never know what your schedule will be and you will never get weekends off, although they seem to be more lenient with older people (to not stay too late). Physically demanding work, which is a positive to stay in shape. Management scrambles to please upper-management and communication is scarce between everybody above hourly sales associates. This leaves a lot of confusion and frustration when expectations are misunderstood or management cannot agree one another. Again, a lot like any other retail job."
good,"Management was a bit of a letdown. They were really nice people outside of work, but when it came to working they were rude 90% of the time, and when they weren't being rude to you. They were sitting in the back room talking and not doing anything worth while."
good,"It can be trying working here, but that could just be because of this particular store's location. Otherwise compensation is good. Kind of harsh on personal and family life seeing schedule can be quite hectic."
good,"I love home depot due to how friendly everyone is"
good,"The Company is overall okay to work for. However, any type of movement whether it be to new positions or moving to a different store becomes a hassle. They only promote you if you are part of their ""click"""
good,Days go by very slow co-workers were great nothing difficult about the job best part of the job is communicating with customers
good,Work schedules could change in a moments notice and there was no flexibility. Management didnt really care.. they are just paid to act like they care..
good,"Home Depot isn't a terrible place to work for they have great benefits, but the management isn't the best they pick favorites and don't recognize the people who actually work and reward the people who do nothing."
good,very demanding for management employees but financially rewarding.  Strong customer service focus at all levels.  Component managers but very focused on sales at the store level.
good,"Solid company Enjoyed the team jobs were being rebuild in my time in the company, they were going to transition ceo and leadership"
good,its fun due to the activities they do to keep the workers in a fun enviroment. but the managment and some of the employers arent that very well when it comes to customers. i would always try and make the cutomers happy when they are in a state that they got bad customer service.
good,"Every day was a new opportunity to learn and grow although in general repetitious in scope, their were chances to learn from and assist others. My team is like family we are very diverse but we learn from one another and help each other."
good,It is a reliable job. You always know where you stand. Management changes a lot. The most enjoyed part of this job is weekends off.
good,"Helping customers select and purchase doors and windows. Custom and non- custom, Enjoyed helping the new home owners make and learn the process. enjoyed helping customers."
good,"Home Depot is a fun place to work but the hours are not reliable for part-timers. The employees and the Management tend to be kind and reasonable. The main problem is the computer generated scheduling that could leave you with anywhere between 12 and 40 hours a week with very little predictability. If you need to make an appointment that is more than 3 weeks out, you are out of luck, because you will have no idea whether or not you will be needed to work that day. The work itself is not too hard and fairly interesting. The hardest part of the job is really that it can get a bit boring during times that there are not any customers to help, management will likely have you do a lot of sweeping or send you home early."
good,"A typical day would be clocking in, and starting my daily duties. Such as stocking, caring for plant nursery, and customer assistance. Learned a good bit about retail, and helping people. Co-workers were friendly, but mainly out of my age range. Management was good. There's been a lot of new faces around that place. Raises don't come around too often or very little unless you take a department head position."
good,Great place to work if you're hired in full time.  Most of the emplyees are part time seasonal so you're constantly training new people.  Fun place to work and great traing program.
good,They hire to many young people with no common sense. They do not have any customer service experience nor do they wish to.
good,stocking lumber.customer service mangment noticed the work your doing co workers are nice and friendly hardest was flat stacking the lumber at the end of the daythe most enjoyable was serving the customers
good,"Helping people with home improvement projects. I learned alot of handyman skills working there. managers where understanding, and easy to work with. Co-workers where friendly, and inviting. hard part of the job christmas time (cutting trees). most enjoyable was weekend work stations, when kids com in and learn how to build things with there hands."
good,A typical day includes providing excellent customer service while coordinating Department product and maintenance requirements and managing activity and monitoring performance of assigned associates.
good,"Working on the Merchandising Execution Team at The Home Depot you have the ability to work a morning shift and have weekends off. I have learned how to use a range of tools and power tools.   The hardest part of the job is resetting a store area for a major holiday or season. Which will require a lot of physically demanding work that, considering the pay rate you will not feel compensated for the physical strain."
good,Worked load was steady. Customers had ups and downs. The management didn't really know what they were doing. Coworkers were pretty good. I learned a lot about gardening. Hardest part was the weather being exposed out in the garden center. The most enjoyable was some of the people I worked with.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of seeking out customers during busy hours of the day and when not helping customers I would be tasked with stocking shelves and merchandising product. I learned many valuable skills such as operating lift equipment, ordering systems, and department machinery. The hardest part of my job was dealing with scheduling issues. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with customers and my co-workers."
good,"Good people to work with which makes for a fun work enviornment. My typical work day involves checking in with my head cashiers to make sure that all of my cashiers are accounted for and know what is expected of them that day and making sure that we are meeting our credit and scan % goals. Then depending on my coverage for the day I'm either stocking registers, training or running a register myself."
good,"Very challenging environment at home depot. Love to work. Management is good. Hardest part of the job is that lot of work and less time to complete. Most enjoyable, it is very challenging and I love to work in challenging environment."
good,"The people who work at my Home Depot are extremely helpful, nice and courteous. My typical day consist of checking customers out, whether if it's at the self checkout or a regular register. I also help the customers load their items into their vehicles."
good,Decent pay and raises. Working with forklifts all day can be fun. All training is done in house. There is heavy lifting and you're on your feet all day.
good,i like working there but the pay is not that good so yo cannot rely on it as a primary job for someone who has a family to support. but i does respect your culture  and the benefits are good comparing it to other work places.
good,"Pays good for retail, but hard to get on sales floor from cashiering.  What you are hired in as is usually what you will stay.  They typically only move you when its convenient for them.  Hard to move with full time."
good,"Things can get hectic around the holidays but having great people to work with can help calm your nerves and get you through anything."
good,"A typical day at the Home Depot can range from, ""Hey, I got all of my reports done in an hour!"" all the way to the end of the day, ""Why did they send us 30 bunks of plywood when I have no where to put them and my closer just called off..."" If I have learned anything in this position it is that no matter what you thought your day was going to be or what it became if you have the best person next to you it all looks the same. My Co-workers have been there with me for ups and downs and have really developed into a family unit its great to have a home away from home. The hardest position in the entire company literally is the first level of management as a Department Head you aren't a regular Joe and yet your also not a manager. If you can find a good work/life balance and your looking for a challenge life is great."
good,Home Depot is a great company that is truly customer service oriented.  We offer real warranties to consumers and take the risk out of construction projects.
good,"management was helpful they made sure i knew all merchandise and that i was measuring correctly on lumber products."
good,"Laid-back environment with diverse employees. Management was personable,fair and provided great training with good communication."
good,"Great healthcare benefits and they do try to take care of their employees in the instance of a death in the family or other health issues. But they can be discriminatory, no matter how long you work with the company they insist on treating you like a newby. Working with contractors is amazing, you get to know them and their lives, businesses, and sometimes even their families. The satisfaction you get when you are able to assist someone in completing something big is wonderful, helping them with a small project is just as great. But with the changes in the company the management team is not as willing to help out those with a big project or even donate to assist in a small one. Yes, it varies from store to store but as an ""orange blooded"" associate, you should be willing to do what it takes to help them get what they need which some of them are not willing to do."
good,"Worked as a cart attendant/loader. Okay job, lots of heavy lifting and staying out in the sun. As for management, it was okay, didn't really feel like theres was much opportunities to move. Besides that, an okay job."
good,"cuando llego pido dinero para tener cuando hago devoluciones,"
good,"Clock-in, work for six hours with three breaks including a lunch break, get constantly badgered by customers wanting to know highly specific information (like whether or not the metal for the Zinc products was mined in the Rampura Agucha mine in India), clock-out."
good,I loved my shift and the people I work with. I did not like howthe promotions hinged on how well you interview and not how well you do your job.
good,"Great environment with amazing co-workers, as a student I couldn't keep this job because they did not have flexible hours"
good,"Normal amount of red tape politics,but to be expected. The turn around is a little high.The raises are small. It can be very busy and then dead."
good,"A typical day at work  I remember when wjorking with paint department i sometime was left alone with all the customer coming thou an getting their orders of paint color an I ask for help about 5 time no one came until the end of two or three customer thier was about 10 to 12 customers, I try t handle as possible as i could and fast .  What i learned is is keep balance at all time when possible an get the work done.  Management they were back an forth to there job pass my area an would say I get you help but help did not come,    The hardest part of the job is when you try your best to organize in the alse the 5 gallon on paints in the alse to where is belong and the spill of paints that has happen to clean it up .."
good,Was a pleasant work environment. Each day presented a new challenge to problem solve. I enjoyed working with my fellow associates. I loved making people happy and this environment provide many opportunities to do just that.
good,A typical work day involved focusing on the pro customer's needs as well as helping D.I.Y. customers. I learned about developing relationships with customers and vendors. I learned about the different products and their functions. My coworkers were great to work with. The hardest part of the job was the physical toll the job took on my feet. I enjoyed taking care of the contractors and having them return time after time for different projects.
good,work place was what you made it. Opportunities to move up. Was focused on performance Numbers. Management only gets involved if there was a issue.you are standing for 8 hours. Benefits were great.
good,Home Depot has a strong work culture. They know that the employees are what make the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was the employees.
good,working at this company has its days where there are good and bad days. Management is OK some things are off the wall. I just go on with my day and pay it no mind im just here to get paid. But this job has taught me a lot with customer service dealing with the crazy contractor's and the DIY's
good,Great place to work and always stay busy with customers and freight. Great place to gain knowledge on how to build and repair projects. Management and co-workers were great to work with and would always help when needed.
good,"This is a workplace that requires a great amount of patience and interpersonal skills. Constantly having to assist customers, some not always pleasant to deal with, while at the same time having to deal with inventory and stocking issues. There's also a lack of recognition or thanks within the store itself, cashiers tend to be favorites and treated better by management. However, at the same time, when needed, corporate is more than willing to step into the situation in order to make the employee feel better. Although it can be fun, you meet some rather amazing people, and the benefits are amazing, it is a very stressful environment at times."
good,The assignment was temporary. The management was inexperienced and unprofessional. The temporary labor was not truly engaged in the success of the assignment.
good,"home depot is a good company, place for advancement, good benefits, special treats, recognition, needs, working as a customer service associate was great for me. working with others and assisting customer was a wonderful experience in the good and also the bad and difficult times, my supervisor was wonderful very caring and understanding, job duties was a daily responsibility"
good,Cool place to work. Lots of learning opportunities. Many departments to get involved in if you are interested in different trades. You can also meet lots of contractors and learn a ton from them.
good,"Management is awesome at this store, the possibility for advancement is slim. They are already maxed with full time associates. I love being a part of the team and there is never a dull moment. I motivate and educate my fellows associates on the installed services home depot offers. In order to obtain leads for the pipeline goals to meet the satisfaction of our customers. I personally need to have a more stable income and would like more time on weekends to be with my family."
good,it is a great over all company for this with no family and a flexible schedule. College kids and older people this is a great company
good,"Typical day is MUCH walking, usually I walk about 5 miles or so a day. Heavy lifting. Team lifting. Answering customer calls. Responding to associate pagings. Putting away returns on shelves. Walking aisles to help customers. Making sales. Making service sales and promoting service sales. I would love this job if I got paid more."
good,"very friendly place to work, but lacked the sales to sustain full time employees.  Overall, it was a good place to work but working part time did not help my family financially."
good,"On a typical work day my responsibilities weren't unreasonable or difficult for me to accomplish. I was assigned specific tasks on each work day depending on what department we were working. I would go to my assigned sections and clean up trash, place product in the proper place, fix displays, replace damaged/missing signage and replenish stock. I had prior lift equipment experience, but while working at The Home Depot I learned how to operate  reach fork lifts, electric ladders and order pickers also known as cherry pickers. I had no huge complaints about management or my co-workers and generally got along with everyone. The hardest part of my job was fixing damaged fixtures caused by improper lift equipment use by the night staff. The most enjoyable part of my job was leaving at the end of the day with a feeling of accomplishment and self worth. My only complaint was the extremely strict attendance policy which resulted in my termination."
good,I got along very well with my co-workers and customers. I always completed my tasks by the end of the night and always made sure that the customers came first.
good,it is a okay place if you want to work part time but I would not recommend anyone work there fulltime. The head aches and things you have to deal with isn't worth the wage
good,Le probleme de chez Home Depot est que la direction du magasin est souvent changer comme les assistant directeur.Mais bien souvent il sont a leur debut et ne savent pas gerer un magasin a grande surface et encore moins gerer  le personnel .Donc il y en a des bon et des moins bon et la derniere fois que j'etais la c'etais pas bon du tout que je suis parti de la car il avais un grand manque de compétance envers la direction.
good,"Answering phones at the start of my shift while assisting customers in line with a return or purchase. If there was an issue, though, that I cannot solve, we are to call a manager, but management there would take forever to respond even though the customer is waiting or would get mad at you if you didn't handle the situation yourself (even though a lot of situations call for approval from someone above me).  There would be no communication amongst management to associates or with each other for that matter. Sometimes the hardest part is trying to please each customer no matter what.  I love being able to talk to customers and being able to solve an issue myself.  I love that there is always something to do."
good,"Management is good, just the pay isn't there. The work load is quite a bit for the pay grade but the people are good, and there are benefits but unfortunately it's tough to pay for them."
good,"I worked here part time while I went to school. They were very flexible with my schedule. While I wouldn't want to make a career out of it, it is a good place to work to make just a little extra cash."
good,The Home Depot is a great place to work as far as the culture and the benefits that are available. The hours and flexibility to work/home life is pretty good. Job transfers to another home depot even during hardship times has been next to non-existent for me. The down-side is that job security is not all that great. The Home Depot has a record of cutting departments which cuts jobs. This also hurts in the advancement in the Home Depot. For an associate in the Merchandising team to advance they would have to wait for the supervisor to leave or advance which is a rarity. The only option available is to transfer to the store side. Transferring to the store side could result in going from a full time associate to a part time associate and working back up to a full time position.
good,"moving carts, working in the store. Being able have a flexible schedule. Most enjoyable was the experience it gave me and the growth you can gain from the company"
good,"Worked at a high volume store. No, downtime, high expectations. Great management team highlighted by store manager, who in spite of high demand and volume made it a point to ensure we had the nest quality of life."
good,"Working at the home depot I learned a lot about flooring and how to install flooring since I did work in the Flooring Department. Also, I learned how to operate various lift equipment safely in a warehouse environment."
good,The opportunity to advance from cashier to head cashier was nice. Work and life balance was average. Management was supportive.
good,"Perform stocking, organizing, and cleaning duties at the request of the management team"
good,"Home Depot is a company with values, I so appreciate coming to work each day knowing my values won't be compromised. I'm asked to wear a lot of hats and held accountable for things that are very hard to control that should be someone else's responsibility but those people are not being held accountable. I enjoy taking care of customers and the spontaneous environment but as with most retail I don't feel like I've been compensated for the amount of effort that I put in. I can barely afford the insurance for my wife and child."
good,Home Depot does not take care of their associates but the customer base. Staffing is horrible and associates are over worked. Hardest part of the job is working with people who are content with what they are doing.
good,"Working and filling out the reports each morning, creating special order and stock orders, returning special order and stock merchandise, contacting vendors for status of orders, checking out customers, helping customers find and inquire about products sold in the store, and return damaged merchandise to the vendor."
good,I love that I get to learn many news skills and meet new faces. There is always something new and the days go by quickly. Home Depot help me get a better education and I'm thankful for that.
good,I like working for that company. I have learned many things. The safety level is very high and co workers are very understanding.
good,"fast paced environment that keeps you busy, always learn something new everyday, mostly positive management, great co-workers, job requires great customer service skills with the ability to multitask, positive work atmosphere."
good,You can meet some really good people but they cut hours like crazy. This is not a dependable job for part timers. Also they work with your schedule if you are in school but you have to be available during weekends.
good,"Home Depot was a good job when I started their upon leaving Walmart, it is a good job to start if you are newly out of high school and looking for a part time."
good,It's a great company to work with as benefits are great and environment is also safe to work at. Helping customers is the utmost priority
good,"A typical day consisted of helping customers in any department they needed help in between my duties as a designer. As a designer I designed kitchens and bathrooms for private and commercial uses. My biggest design was for a hotel. I learned a lot and their training was never ending. I learned something new everyday. I was able to certify in several departments, and moving up was encouraged. For the most part management was alright there was more turn over in those positions in the four years that I was there than I would expect for a company and each had their own way of doing things,The co-workers were amazing to work with I have much love for most of them and will miss them dearly. The most enjoyable part of the job was all the people I got to meet and help, our customers were also great."
good,"I started working at Home Depot while attending school because it provided flexibility with my school schedule. Now that I have received my associates I am in pursuit of greener pastures. Working here for 2 years has taught me that management believes what they hear from other coworkers instead of what they see. The hardest part of the job here was constantly being held back from advancement due to favoritism of certain employees by managers and their own personal opinions. It may sound biased but I can assure anyone that it is not. I'll give one example of this, associates of home depot are supposed to help all customers regardless of the question or department to which that question pertains. A common thing to hear is ""this is not my department"" simply to avoid helping the customer no matter what the issue is which most of the time is asking where an item is. This is where the favoritism comes in, if I am on the sales floor doing my job, helping customers, but my coworkers cannot see it they assume that one is not doing anything. The thing is that those same associates who make those claims cannot see what happens on the sales floor because they are not on it, they stay in a specific area of the store and they do their best to stay within that radius. It might sound like an opinion as well but I have learned that when I am around these people nothing gets done and as long as I am within their line of sight they do not make complaints with management. I have literally been told that I cannot be helping out customers and that I need to stay where I can be seen. To these people"
good,"I learnered how to speak with customer more professionally .  My coworkers were very nice to me, The hardest part of the job was when it was slow it was not a lot to do but just staning around.  I like to be active in a job setting."
good,Management doesn't have your back when you try and discipline your associates. The think I like most is when I can help all my customer's that come to my desk.
good,Productive  but store manager had negative attitude toward college students. Worked in gardening dept. young co-workers always avoided work and left you carrying work load. When department is busy no breaks were given.
good,"As with many retail jobs, this job consisted of customer service tasks like answering questions about products and providing assistance with certain needs like key making and whatnot.  This job allowed me to learn a lot about home improvement, and also how businesses run and conduct daily tasks.  I had knowledgeable, helpful coworkers and the management team was as good as one can hope for in a retail setting.  The job had its disadvantages with inconsistent scheduling and the occasional rude customer."
good,Home Depot was a fun and exciting place to work at with excellent trainers. Management was informative and easy to communicate with.
good,"Its an ok place to work, i learned alot there and enjoyed the people. I got an education in lumber and building materials and learned to use forklifts."
good,I enjoy the Home Depot experience because I enjoy helping people and make sure the customers is able to understand and make their day just a little bit better.
good,Was able to learn how to lead people through motivational speaking and learning how to get people to buy in to whatever the goal of the day was. I always wanted people to feel like they wanted to work for me not feel as though that they had to work for me.
good,"A typical day at the Home Depot would be me walking into my department, the Tool Rental Center and cleaning any tools that were returned throughout the day, while still helping the steady traffic of customers that come in. Before my experience at Home Depot I knew nothing about any commercial grade tools, let alone even a simple carpet cleaner. But after the training process in the Tool Rental Center, both on the computer and hands on, I can say I’ve gained a lot of knowledge and skills that will surely benefit me for the rest of my life. I really do love my job, not to mention, my fellow co-workers that make the place so functional/productive but yet so fun at the same time.  Yes, sometimes it can get a little crazy during our busy seasons but there is always someone there to lend a helping hand. The best part about this job is the environment. Your customers ranger from “Do it yourselfers” to Professional Contractors, and with every conversation comes a great learning experience!"
good,Learned about working in a retail operation.  Enjoyed the fact that my job was not routine and changed every day.  Liked dealing with customers and explaining to them how the rental tools worked.
good,There's always a new challenge in the workplace especially those problems are just encountered for the first time. I've learned to develop my analytical skills in situations that needs proper decision-making.
good,"Not much to say here! its a dead end job with really low pay especially for the amount of work that is expected to be done before the store is reopened in the morning, besides that everything else about the job is nice, its only the pay that is my only issue its just simply isn't enough."
good,"Most days I worked at the cash register, assisting customers with their purchases and helping them locate certain goods they desired. "
good,A day at Home Depot was very even paced.  What I learned was to always have a smile on my face all the time when I worked there to show that I was there to help the customer whenever they did it.  Management was alright they always tried to help whenever they could.  Very friendly to the customers and answered their questions to the best of their knowledge.  My co-workers that I used to work for were friendly and very supportive of each other.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that my co-workers always tried to make things easier for everyone especially when someone needed help to understand certain things better.
good,"Worked with customers who did not need their purchases or did not like their purchases."
good,great hours really enjoyed my job very good to their employees. I learned time management. excellent co-workers benefits were great
good,Very fast pace business. High volume warehouse that pushing a lot of product on a weekly bases. Fitting to customer demands
good,"Merchandising, stocking shelves, price changes, customer service, building displays."
good,"-it's a relaxed and soothing environment"
good,Recieved shipments and stocked shelves. I gained the ability to operate the order picker and electric pallet jack. The management was helpful. Friendly co-workers. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep the different departments clean and organized due to the lack of communication between the department heads and the associates. The best part of the job was the work experience I gained and the benefits that they offer their employees.
good,"Management was always very helpful, most employees were friendly, the training was good, the hardest part about the job were the rude customers."
good,"Working for The Home Depot.as a M.E.T team associate was an okay experience but some of the managers were not professional when it came to work.  The hours for the workers was good weekdays working and weekends off which was good for most workers. Great co-workers, everyone got along just great.  I learned how to do counts and prices changes for the store."
good,"The company has good benefits and lots of perks, but the hope for advancement and store politics make it difficult. The customer service is need of repair by futher training or better hiring."
good,"My time at Home Depot has been amazing, I have grown tremendously as a manager and learned more than I could imagine about customer service, running and growing my own little $40M business. While corporate cost cutting and infrastructure synergies continue to make HD a fiscally sound company, proven by the significant ramp up in stock price, these measures have out paced the increasingly dissatisfied associates that have hours and positions cut, while ever more demanding work load has reached a tipping point. I predict that with the improved job market, Home Depot will see a pattern of employee turnover, especially at the management level. After more than a decade at Home Depot, I am looking for new challenges and a work environment where my ever-growing skills are tested and appreciated."
good,"Long days seasonal "
good,"Working here is neither good or bad, but obviously places have their very good days and very bad days. There's very flexible scheduling and the working environment can shift a lot as far as pace is considered, but if you can handle that, it's not too stressful."
good,"The task were easily and the other employees were always nice and friendly. Great place to get a start. Home Depot helped me further my customer service skill as well as my leadership skills. Near the end of my time there scheduling became a bit of a problem due to the store no longer having their own HR to schedule, they were then using a computer based method to write the schedule which didn't always work with my availability I had given to Home Depot."
good,Good Company but no training. reduce to much the staff so it's hard to serve costumers. the pay and benefits are ok. the lack of direction   make the employees get frustrated and that make the customer service low
good,"Most days were alright. Some management were very kind and helped to advance your knowledge and your place in the company. Some of the other associates were demeaning, however the overall environment of the store was good and the customers varied, as with any retail store. All in all, it was a decent first job."
good,"Department maintenance, customer service, pulling and sending out deliveries, etc. Most coworkers and some customers were enjoyable to work with although, some customers could be difficult to deal with."
good,The home depot is a good company to work for cause the benefits are really good but the management is really horrible like they play favoritism and don't even acknowledge the actual hard workers like myself. Ive learned a lot while working there as a flooring associate.
good,"The home depot is a nice place to work. There is room to grow at the home depot if you want to put in the time and training to do so. The pay is low to start, but if you put in the time you can make a great living."
good,I enjoyed working as an order selector. Supervisor was nice and pleasant to work for. Co-workers were nice and competetive. No real hard part about the job
good,- Good company with positive outlook. Great work life balance. Fast moving. Lots of opportunities for advancement. Very strong career foundation.
good,"On a regular day, you are asked to unload multiple trucks while loading trucks as well. You are crammed into one corner of the building with less than adequate space to have 15-20 forklifts moving around one another safely. "
good,"Gained experience in departments as Cashier, Special Services (including Penske), Receiving, Return to Vendor, Flooring Specialist, Decor Specialist, Paint, Garden, Appliances, Kitchen and Bath, and Customer Order Specialist.  High Attention to Customer Service, Phone skills, Computer skills, Machine operation, Very active environment."
good,"I need a full time job that pays more than 9.50/hr. If you need a job to support yourself and family then this isnt a job for you. It would be fine for a college student that gets help from parents or loans. A person can not live off of $470 every two weeks with many bills that need to be paid for. Im also not eligible for miles when everyone else is because i live ""in the middle of each store"" that is unfair considering i still use gas to go everywhere and ive put a bunch of miles on my new jeep because of working for MET."
good,The company is so large and you start to feel lost and forgotten working there. It also didn't seem to have much room for growth.
good,Managers didn't have very good communication with other managers. Which caused disappointment with customers. Didn't feel very supported in that company.
good,"Good place for an entry-level applicant"
good,"I was working there while being a full time student. I worked in the outside garden. Overall, it is a good student job, but the problem is that is seasonal job. The management is so-so but the guys I have worked with were amazing."
good,"A typical day at Home Depot is managing daily coverage of cashiers including breaks and lunches. A typical day often includes providing a superb level of customer service. Other duties include arranging time for cashier training sessions, motivating the team to reach credit and sales goals. "
good,"Good flexible hours, wage low but average for retail business, lots of opportunities, good place to learn customer service"
good,"More often you work for a company that never really relates to its employees or you just feel like you're part of an army of workers with no communication with your boss. Unlike most this Home Depot is filled with nice,respectable, and conversational people and managers. The training is great, the benefits are nice, and the hours are decent."
good,I liked going to work at Home Depot. Every day was like a learning experience and i thrive in hands-on position. I love learning new things on the job and i was never bored working here. The management taught me everything that i needed to know and i caught very fast to every task.
good,"I would take care of the parking lots keep them clean and clear of carts and debris. Take care of the customers help the with there needs and also help out in departments when they were short handed or in need of extra help."
good,"Was usually assigned to do task that were given by managers, since I was licensed to operate most of the forklift machinery. I learned to always exceed peoples expectations whether if it was helping a customer or assignments that I was given to do, I had to go above and beyond. Management made you want to help them because they always made sure that they appreciated what you did for them. The most enjoyable part of the job was tackling any given task with co-workers that you were close with and knew that you could rely on them that they can help balance the weight of the work with you."
good,Took care of customers. Informed customers  about promotions or sales. Exchanged or returned merchandise for customers. The first month and a half I was there I received two service awards. I enjoyed working with the customers. I love interacting with them
good,"Everyone there was like a family, it was a fun place to work, made sure the employees were happy."
good,The Home Depot is a very busy environment. I leaned how to priorities and manage multiple tasks.
good,stocked items with no time limit various knowledge on all are products from management
good,"i liked how layer back it was."
good,"I like going to work every day at the home depot. Interacting with costumers to me is honestly great! the work flow is awesome, I've learned many things from Home Depot, such as selling our pro services to the everyday costumer. The hardest part of the job is loading full pallets of concrete. Home depot sells the pallet, and costumers do not want to buy the pallet. So we have to hand load all of the 52 cement bags by hand. The part that I enjoy the most out of working there, is interaction with costumers and also the team work that we have loading merchandise."
good,At the Home Depot I enjoyed getting their early my fellow associates  to open the store. I implemented a lot of rudimentary skills i learned from The Home Depot into my life. Few of my subordinates and co-workers were notorious for being cohesive. The most challenging part would be dealing with distraught customers.
good,Had a great busy time everday. Meet new people everyday. The team is great and you will never get bored.. Always something new to do.
good,I worked here for about 6 months it was an ok experience although management was ( like any other retail store) bad. starting pay was $10.25
good,"After clocking in, I do my daily rounds for carts and buggies, check for hazardous debris in the parking lot, find other tasks, I've learned a few skills far as marking down items for store use. A few of he managers looked out for their employees but most of them were in their own worlds til they've switched to a new store manager, then everything slowly changed. I deal with most of the co-workers pretty well, joke with them on our down time, most of them are great to work well with as well. Hardest part of my job was dealing with customers. Employee gatherings were a good part of the job."
good,Typical warehouse job.  Unless you have a degree don't expect to ever become a manager though.
good,"Home Depot is a great place to find stable work with great benefits, unlike many other larger companies. I worked for HD for 2 years and I became a supervisor after interviewing several times. So I am familiar with some of the process. If you know the saying ""Mo Money, Mo Problems'"", then you will know what it is to advance to the next level with HD. "
good,Loved the company and have been with them over a decade but recent changes to the management structure have gone away from what made Home Depot great. The greatest asset home depot has always been the culture of the associates and the connection between associates and management. New changes to the way of doing business are creating a divide between the two making them grow further and further apart.
good,"busy"
good,"Management,at this store not open to suggestions from employees."
good,"ring up customers,return merchandise for customers,procees credit for customers,and customer complaints my chance to make their visit pleasant.Management was alright could be better.I learned there are all types of people in this world."
good,"Continuous labor, learned the company and its values, management can and should be more involved with the associates, co-workers need to work together as a team,"
good,"I was happy with my Job but, felt there was no room to advance out of the position that I proofed I mastered."
good,Fun place to work but starting salaries have decreased recently.
good,"Late hours. Hardly any hours at that. I got certified to operate a forklift, reach truck, pacer unit, and electric ladder while employed through Home Depot."
good,"Working as a cashier and occasionally a “lot associate”, I was required to be very alert and aware in my duties. Handling large quantities of money in a high stress environment, I was expected to complete my job quickly and efficiently. Part of my duties were to pay close attention to all merchandise to be sure the correct amount and quantities were being payed for. In working lot I was required to help people loading large, awkward merchandise into their vehicle. This company is very driven toward customer service and satisfaction, on many occasions I was rewarded for my friendliness and was mentioned numerous times online in the Voice of the Customer Survey."
good,"Things were always changing on the job. For a while we were required to go to the customers home, measure kitchen, design it and then customer would come in to go over the design and make what ever changes were necessary. Most Kitchens were sold with counter tops materials that Home Depot offered. "
good,Great place to work but in order to go up in company you have to give a lot of your time
good,You go to work to do your job and that is about it. Not a fun atmosphere to work in.
good,If you don't mind crazy hours and working weekends it's a fun job. Pay wasn't bad and there was plenty of opportunity for advancement.
good,"Overall Home Depot is a decent place to work. They have good benefits and a team atmosphere. A typical day depends on what department you are in and what level you are at. You need to learn to be a jack of all trades. You need excellent customer service skills and a lot of patience. Retail is exhausting work. Your management team will change on a more frequent basis than other professions. I find the best part of my job is the people I work with. I have great relationships with my coworkers and on a bad day, it is those people who help me get through it. The hardest part of the job is split between two things. The chaotic, ever-changing schedule (nights and weekends, and holidays are a constant that can become wearisome and hard to keep a life outside of work. There are also times when working with the general public in a servant position uses every ounce of your patience. The only thing that keeps that smile on your face is knowing you need the paycheck to survive."
good,"A typical day at The Home Depot begins at a bright 4:30 AM. By 5:01we all meet in the Lumber aisle for a good morning stretch and a brief meeting with the MET Supervisors. "
good,"I enjoyed working with people. I loved my customers even the"
good,The Home Depot started me off in the Millworks Department specializing in doors and windows. I was given the extra task of training new incoming individuals on SOP and company policy as well as to introduce them to their new responsibilities. Shortly I was moved to the Pro Account Sales Associate where I’m trusted to help contractors on their major project such as building homes. I had to maintain a Sales Per Hour of $200.
good,"It's a low hour, low wage job.  20 hours a week at 9.25 an hour and everyone has their assigned jobs which never deviates.  The only positive thing is their health care/dental and other insurance plans they have for associates who have worked there for over a certain period of time, which is 6 months I believe.  From what I've heard department managers don't get paid much more than the other employees, at least for freight associates."
good,The hardest part of the job was the Spring Black Friday sales when we were short-handed in the Garden Department. The most enjoyable part of this job was my co-workers and how willing everyone was to help me out and teach me new things about the job.
good,"A typical day at home depot is kind of crazy. There is a lot expected "
good,"Solve customer issuses,and help any and all customers that came in to the store.I learned alot about solving your home repair and remodel. My department manger was great and always encrouged us to think out side the box. Co workers where pretty fun to work with. Hardest part of the job was the crazy scheduling open and closing. Helping "" DIY"" ers getting project done."
good,Biggest challenge was advancement unless you had someone pulling for you.
good,"Pretty decent company that cares for their employees. Very customer oriented. Store management is also very helpful. Rotates dept. supervisors i believe every 6 month, so you have a chance to learn a lot about the stores different departments."
good,Not a learn term position but it can be fun and great room for advancement if seeking it
good,"A typical day consisted of helping customers at the registers. Some days can be very busy and when there isn't enough help, it can be very stressful. Co-workers were always nice and easygoing which made the day go by."
good,"I would arrive at Home Depot and would organize the carts in and around the store, help people load heavy items into their cars, and sometimes help direct customers to the products in the store. What I learned there was how to treat customers and to not to pretend to know the answer to a customers question, it is always alright to ask a co-worker for help. The management wasn't very nice to me or the other young employees, I never felt like I truly had their respect. The people that I worked with were very nice though, and were always willing to lend a hand. The hardest part of my job was making sure enough carts were available on a busy day. The best part of my job would have to be the friendly, joking environment of the break room."
good,help with driving of sales. use of forklift and mobile pallet jack.
good,"The harder you work here the faster you will excel. The work itself can be hard and the customers difficult but the Management and coworkers tend to be understanding and offer a feeling of community. The H.D. offers many classes that teach you everything you could ever need to know about their products, services, and even about how to do many household projects you never would think to try on your own."
good,"A typical day at this point consists mainlyion of unloading incoming deliveries, processing hazardous waste, shipping defective and damaged merchandise back to the vendor, driving a forklift for unloading freight and for loading customers, organization and cleanup, coordination for accomplishing tasks between departments, delivery scheduling, research on shrink issues."
good,"Typical day at work: Assisting customers with information and choosing the right product for their needs. Assisting customers with the purchasing and delivery options with major appliance purchases."
good,"Although my job was brief with this company, it was a very rewarding experience to work for Home Depot. I wish I could have stayed there longer. Unfortunately this job was only a seasonal job. I left on very good terms with everyone, and if a permanent position every comes up; I will consider working for this company again in the future."
good,There was always something to do. The tasks that needed to be done were completed every single night without hesitation.
good,"Unloading material from trailers to receive. Counting checking material for damage, processing material to send to stores. "
good,"There are so many different sorts of supervisor, managers, leaders. Its actually kind of unorganized for this big of a company but it leaves it so that not one person can have all the say for the store."
good,In store culture and pace very different from outside sales department.
good,"After computer training the supervisor threw me onto the floor to stock merchandise in a store with over 30,000 items. When i didnt move fast enough they would shout at me. I had no real training. They spoke behind your back and didnt make the job fun at all"
good,Early morning shifts are the best. Do able set day to day work hours. Co-workers are easy to get along with.
good,Work usually involves attending to customers' needs and requires a fair deal of technical expertise or knowledge considering many customers' inquiries are related to home improvement. Management is straightforward and co-workers get along with each other just fine. However the major drawback is that for a new associate it may be quite hard for them to attend to every customers' demand for that you're put into one department of the store and customers usually expect you to know the answer to their questions regardless.
good,"One of the better retail companies to work for. The only major downfall, is having to constantly push credit on customers. It's required. I think I sucks, cause while I do enjoy helping people and customer service, I hate pushing things on people that they don't want. Especially in this economy, an additional credit card it the last thing people want or need, with the exception of contractors and new home owners taking on giant home improvement projects."
good,Good work environment but bad paid. The hardest part is the clients .They cut be nice or very rude.
good,the job is real work  non stop work but helping customers will make you feel better
good,"Systematized inventory management to make the merchandise more accessible to customers and employees.Provided customers assistance with merchandise by transporting purchased consumer durable goods. Utilized multiple payment types, using in-house computer system to accurately perform customer transactions. Management was consistently busy with many other things such as swapping cashiers, finding time to give employees breaks. Hardest part of the job was remembering all the departments and their inventory."
good,Very busy work environment. Tons of rude customers. Bad communication between co-workers. Good benefits like 401k and stock purchasing plan for part-timers
good,It was a nice seasonal job to have. I enjoyed the co workers and staff.
good,The work place is very friendly and we all help each other out in our daily tasks. Hardest part is dealing with upset customers and standing around. I love when i make people smile and there happy with there shopping experience. Management is not very organized. I wish they'd tell there staff more about incoming shipping days. etc
good,The Home Depot was a great place to work while I was trying to figure out what I wanted for a career path.
good,"Si hay mucha gente los jefes se enojan y comienzan a precionar , aprendi a tratar con ese tipo de personas de que todo quieren que se haga rapido y al miomento , mis jefes son de que si el cliente esta contento gritandote no importa siempre y cuando el este feliz , mis compañeros sin duda alguna son buena onda te apoyan cuando lo requieres y si esta en sus manos te ayudan , la parte mas dificil es cuando tienes que tratar con los clientes enojados por que algun producto que compraron no les funciono como ellos querian o de plano viene mal de fabrica , lo que mas me gusto es que aprendes a manejar tu paciencia y a controlar tu caracter ademas de poder tratar con personas enojadas"
good,"Not your typical 9-5 job however if you are a creature of habit, this job could be a fit for you. The daily duties starting and ending your day will be significantly similar everyday."
good,I work overnights for over 2 years and like the flexability to do so.
good,the job is hard at first but if you put in your proper amount of time it becomes a lot easier to move up and out of the stores. But be prepared to give up what seems like large chunks of your life with the rotating schedules.
good,it was okay i never really enjoyed working there. the people i worked with made it worth it. the management was great though they were always very supportive and helped me though out my career with them
good,I supervisor the front end of the store. I am responsible for getting breaks and lunches of my cashiers taken care of. also I deal with customer complaints such as if an item is ringing up at a higher price than it should be etc.
good,Being a cashier at the Home Depot was a good job because I love to work with people. I learned some new techniques when it came to working the register. I felt like some management needed more training when it came to their jobs. I think the only thing to be not the hardest but the most challenging was to keep up with a line when they where short staffed. I enjoyed the most working with people I love to make people smile.
good,"Depending on district, is how it all goes. The work is okay. customer interaction is what i loved the most. Fixing their problems and helping pick out product is why i went to work everyday."
good,"Because of cut backs we were responsible for 2 to 3 departments, and I feel the customers were not being helped in time matter. Very disorganized, and where were problems with some of employee's with their work ethics.  "
good,"As a sales associate, great place for networking if you are into home decor or residential repair. Very flexible hours for student life. The entire store receives a bonus twice a year which is determined by its sales and costumer service rating. "
good,"Work culture and management are generally laid-back, but very stringent with project regulations and deadlines. Working extra hours without compensation is to be expected during busy periods."
good,"1.typical day at work wasn't so bad."
good,customer service/ how to run the front end as a head cashier/management is good/co-worker good at what they do/didn't have a set schedule/ meeting customers
good,"First job, decent experience, and I wasn't making minimum wage. I liked worked there."
good,typical day start with responding to customer requests and assisting them finish their projects
good,I would no longer look at this company for a career. Many changes have taken place since the originalowners have left
good,"Its a good job for people looking for part-time work."
good,Really good company perks even though the salaries during my tenure were less that great.  Management needed more development.
good,"I liked working for this company for the most part. The management wasn't for you when there was a problem with a customer. The customer isn't always right. They have bad days also and take it out on you. I gave a lot to this company and did my best and had many awards in the almost five years there. My co-workers were good but could have been nicer and not so clicky. The front end cashiers were great...somewhat over worked because the management didn't want to deal with it. I enjoyed working with the people that were our regulars, when I left several of the people I saw later told me they missed me and wouldn't go there again. So I know that I was a valued employee. I learned a lot and always took advantage of classes or experiences to learn new  things."
good,Working at the Head Office in Toronto was a great experience
good,This is a Corporate driven company where you will realize that management cares about their own personal gains.
good,"over all the its been a very steady and reliable employment with very flexible hours and friendly co-workers.  However it is set in a retail setting, so a special breed of individual is needed to handle the rigors of working with the public."
good,Home Depot was a great place to work but raises are not good but benefits are great. What made Home depot great were the people you work with.
good,"Worked on night freight crew for first 6 months then went to night receiving. responsible for all inbound freight from trucks, supplying freight crew in a timely manner with merchandise for shelves. Operated all equipment, learned the RF scanner system when it was implemented and became receiving supervisor. My duties included all paperwork, auditng freight bills, packing slips and purchase orders. Proper department asignments, storeage locations, os&d rtv and all special orders. We worked as a team for the common good of our store. Hardest part was people who didn't know their departments or products. The knowledge of a job well done and keeping my area clean as it was the dumpng area to keep the sales floor clean."
good,"Great leaders, good customers , advancement is their. The BIG Three is a must."
good,"This is a company in which you can truly thrive if you are willing and able to put your all into it.  The job can be interesting for the right person.  That being said, it is extremely difficult on family life due to the amount of hours you will be expected to put in.  Just keep that in mind.  Know where you want to go, because the assistant manager role has become one of the most difficult roles in the store side of the business"
good,"A lot of work for little pay. I was department Head for Lumber. Hardest department and most of the time things go wrong. The experience was great and management was awesome. They pretty much let you run your department the way you want to. This is what I like and I believed that I made a difference to the department. Like working here but hours are crazy ""F shifts"" I think you know what the F stands for . You work random hours hard to have family.  Some days I close the store at midnight and have to open the next morning at 5. Had to do this and also work 6 days straight with random hours."
good,"A new challenge everyday at work. learned a lot about the structure of a business/corporation and what it takes to keep it running. "
good,"Good people, and a decent culture.  Benefits were good especially tuition reimbursement."
good,great if you are attending college. great room to move up in company if you are dedicated
good,"good people, stable job, no work life balance, the company is very political."
good,"the day start off with getting the team on task and setting goals for the day"
good,Have learned to work with public.And everyone is different with different needs and ideas. To treat ALL customers like I would like to be treated.Most of all to make sure everyone smiles when leaving.
good,its a Good job while your a temp once you become part time it goes down hill from there
good,"Busy or slow there is always something to do at Home Depot."
good,"A typical day at Home Depot was to come in find out what kind of estimates needed to be worked up after checking emails; followed by cleaning up the department and providing customer service at all times throughout the day. Multi tasking is very important in Home Depot. Home Depot put me through a lot of intense training; I was one of the lucky ones to open up a brand new store and to get the training that was offered at that time, which they no longer do. I learned a lot about products in the flooring department and how to install the products in flooring with hands on training. For the most part I enjoyed working with all my co-workers even though there were some that didn't take their jobs seriously and they got away with doing no work while others were picking up their slack. The was no really hard part to the job but there were days that multi tasking became a little rough especially during the busy time of the year. The most enjoyable was being able to help customers with their needs"
good,i enjoyed working at homedepot . really good hours for the met associates . the schedule is monday thru friday .
good,Home Depot is supportive of its employees and offers its emplyees flexibility with schedule. Great when attending college.
good,Its a good steady work place but nothing long term and had some mangers say unethical things.
good,HD is a great place to work if you are single or as a part time second job.  The totally flexible hours makes it impossible to get a second part time job to offset the low pay.  Working with the customers is one of the best parts of the job.  The hardest part of the job is managing your time to allow you to do what is required and still make improvements as well as ensure your department is getting the attention and training they need.
good,"typical day would be bringing heavy boxes down from the overhead, help customers with projects that they are working on and consistently organizing the shelves. The training is good, but has nothing to do with your job or what the customers want."
good,"Customer Service, working as a team, organization skills are some of my positive traits."
good,A typical day at work started at 4 a.m. taking inventory for the store before placing orders. I learned to work with upper management and vendors. My co workers included 3 other inventory managers. The hardest part of the job was keeping a good balance of inventory so the store was never out of product without over stocking. the best part of  being a inventory manager was working with venders and upper management.
good,"If you do not like customer service, this is not the company for you! The company offers great benefits and the potential for growth.  Long hours of standing on your feet in a cement warehouse with no relief. I have permanent damage to the ligaments and tendons in my feet from years of standing and walking on cement.  You will see hundreds of customers a day and it gets very grueling dealing with the public and their home improvement issues.  The training is fair.  You will work what you are scheduled and it will be varying shifts including nights and weekends."
good,"A typical day in my past position involved beginning the day with a safety checklist, store safety and HAZMAT compliance. Attending to customer's needs.  Processing and completing credits for recalls, returns, buybacks via our automatic system, contacting vendors personally and directly, and shipping product back to centralized return facility and/or vendor locations.  Shipping out and receiving in."
good,"During a morning shift, I will typically survey my department and complete a pack down of all the out of stock items. In addition, I will help customers in person and on the phone while completing the pack down. I've learned how to manage my time better. Between helping customers, stocking shelves, and doing store projects there is always something to do. I've learned about many home improvement tools and promotions. I've learned how to use the fujitsu software that home depot uses to write orders, check inventory, help customers on the phone, and complete various in store task. My co-workers are very helpful. Home Depot is a team environment and we all help each other to better understand and serve our customers. The hardest part of my job is knowing every single product in the store. On the other hand, that's the most enjoyable part of it as well. Everyday is learning experience."
good,"My day was always making sure I had things on order and priced and displayed where the planogram showed. I have learned a lot from my associates on how to deal with other associates and if I work with them, I get more results, than if I just tell them what to do or had them a sheet of paper telling them what to do. Communication was the key factor!"
good,"Based on the position desired, the candidate selection process for The Home Depot jobs can include phone interviews, one-on-one interviews, group interviews, or panel interviews. Most entry-level candidates participate a single appointment with a hiring manager. Managers may experience several job interviews throughout the Home Depot hiring process. Background checks, drug tests, and skills assessments could also prove essential for Home Depot jobs. Particular hiring structure and job requirements usually vary by hardware store location."
good,"My typical day at work starts by me making sure, that all merchandise are put up and ready for sale. Also to make sure the sales floor is safe and conducive for customers and fellow employees. "
good,Really enjoyed working at the Home Depot and their customers projects.
good,"This place is good to work for, you must be flexable to work day and night, training is good"
good,Typical day is sorting boxes and orders for different stores
good,Enjoyed being able to assist customers with the problems they may of had.
good,"Most days when I get to work I pull into the parking lot and greet customers and give them information on products outside of the store and may even get a sale before I get into the building. Sometimes I get the same types of sales going or coming from lunch or leaving for the day. Going to lunch one day I wrote up a roof order for a potential sale with a dollar amount larger than any I had ever done. I get lots of leads that way going and coming in and out of the building. I also sell lots of products on a daily basis sometimes I will sale one or more high dollar items in in a day that are not leads at all. In just walking a customer to the nut and bolt aisle I have wrote orders on HVAC whole house automatic generators. I have also sold flooring or I might have to write up a measure for flooring or mill work. I have also special ordered doors.  I help in all parts of the store include being a cheerleader for all the associates. I greet customers and get to know their projects and the troubles and woes of the projects and celebrate with them in getting thru the hard work. The customers have bought me pictures s of the completed project or they come by and do happy dance once the project is complete. I educate customers and associates on credit special finance products and services. Come up with ideas for sales promotions for the store and website."
good,Hard but was steady work. Merchandising and the whole staff was awsome to work for
good,"A typical day at work starts at the sign in post. From there we head downstairs to our respective sales areas in the store. A check of inventory is required for safety and stock up if there are no customers that need immediate attention. If everything is in good standing, we roam around our sales department looking for customers to help."
good,A typical day of work would be to check my chart and do all the get all the work on my sheet accomplished before the day is over.
good,"The hiring of managers that are untested or no experience in the area the supervise makes no sense. The upper management not being open to idea's says they are only in it for the power or money.   Management there was horrible but I will say its a great place to work if you don't mind follow the leader.    "
good,"I like the atmosphere at home depot. The customers are generally very friendly and so are my co workers. They try very hard to keep up the morale by giving incentives such as food for the cashiers, they give awards for good customer service and bonuses like profit sharing if you've been employed with them 6 months or more. I've learned so much about cashiering and there's more to learn. The hardest part of the job can just be standing on your feet all day. The most enjoyable part of the day is, for me being allowed to interact with people's pets when they bring them in. I always have dog treats available, I have to say it's the highlight of my day."
good,"A typical day will include helping customers from start to finish, diverse group of co workers and management. Hardest and most enjoyable thing about working paint would be the people you encounter, angry contractors in a hurry or, interesting people that make your day."
good,"check emails, walk the floor to make sure associates are doing what there suppose to, set ads, walk departments for opportunities. new store manager, no teamwork amongst co-workers.  hardest part of the job were the hours, most enjoyable part was talking to and helping customer and seeing associates succeed."
good,"a typical day at work would be to unpack new product skids, put them in the right isles and bays, maintaining existing product on shelves, and cleaning out overheads making room for new product. i learned how to prioritize my time and work well alone, my coworkers were ok to work with but had a lot of problems with the job. hardest part of the job was finding a place for everything to fit when there is absolutely nowhere to put it. most enjoyable part was operating the machinery such as fork lifts and reach trucks."
good,"Overall good company to work for, great benefits and competitive pay. Very fast paced."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job is working with the associates and taking care of the customers.  I have learned many things working there such as ordering, computer skills.  I have held many positions from Operational to Merchandising.  The hardest part of the job is the long hours and work/life balance."
good,"Home Depot is a great environment however, with the change in government health care issues Home Depot has decided to not hiring  for any full time position or move part timers to full time. As well as with the change they have decided to drop there health benefits for part timers. The management is wonderful and hours can be flexible."
good,"I advanced pretty rapidy and the compensation for an assistant manager is nice.  $52,000 to start plus bonus potential of $10k twice a year.  The Store Manager can make you or break you, mine broke me.  He was extremely angry all the time and nothing was ever up to his standards.  LONG days, I worked 16 hours a day like it was nothing and have even worked 24 hrs straight.  I had a fellow ASM that worked a 31 hr shift.  If you get lucky and have a Store Manager that cares about people, it will be a great job and career."
good,The atmosphere was a good one and the people I worked with were nice.
good,I have thoroughly enjoyed working for this client. I had worked here as a SharePoint Developer/Admin
good,"I started here as a lot attendant. It was OK with a back brace. I didn't like the fact that they locked you out of the building if you weren't finished on the lot after a certain time. The pay wasn't that good either. I did my job well so after a certain amount of time I was promoted to garden associate. The pay increased by $1. The training was not good as it is mainly computer based so I was pretty much thrown to the wolves. I was mostly in the department by myself as people were constantly quitting. When the opportunity came to be promoted as the former garden team lead quit, I was a shoe in. Instead they chose a person from a different department that had been there longer. I had to train her. Her pay went up $3. The only problem I had with it was that, that opportunity didn't come along that often."
good,"Provide excellent customer service, assist customer with their needs,"
good,"THD was a large and stable company with good benefits for its employees and a large footprint in the market."
good,"Stated off in Gardening Dept quickly advanced to Bath & Kitchen Designer & then was placed in charge of promoting & selling & coordinating all Home Services. Training was always offered, lots of room for advancement. Complaints not handled in Professional manner due to personal relationships Human Resources had with other employees.."
good,"Management is rude"
good,"Hours vary, but go to work help customers, and also do varies task to keep store appearance up. Learned a lot about products and customer service. Enjoy working with co-workers and management."
good,"Flexible hours, overtime when you want, plenty of opportunity to learn different departments."
good,"A typical day of work began  with scanning out of stock merchandise, followed by changing price labels and signage. Other duties included indentifying the average time to identify out of stock merchandise and inventory of selected in stock items."
good,"Wake up and get to work by 4 a.m., and start changing prices and inventory counts. I have learned many things above what I already know such as how to take care of bay and product placements. The management isn't compliant to your complaints. My co-workers are great people, and come from different aspects. The hardest part of my job was finding prices that were'nt able to get changed, due to misplacement. The most enjoyable part of my day was around the time it was the busiest."
good,home depot is a great place for young people working through college or anyone that wants to be apart of a fast paced environment with quick advancement with hard work and determination.
good,"days go by fast"
good,Very long hours and did not get home to see my family most nights till after my children were already asleep.
good,Home Depot is not a great place to work if you are in one of the store. You start as temporary part time with no benefits for 6 months. Once you become a permanent part time employee you are stuck at part time until someone that is full time leaves. The pay is atrocious especially since I have years of work experience the still started me at the same pay rate as an 18 year getting their first job. It was disappointing that they did not attempt to keep me.
good,Enjoyed working with my co-workers but the lack of business gave us limited amount of hours to work.
good,"They hire more part time and less full time. They work shift work and expect any one person to work 3 to 4 departments by your self while dealing with at least 20 + customers at the same time. I did 9 years and would never do that again. The stress level is high for everyone who works in those expected atmosphere. All in all, the benefits are great especially the insurance. The hourly pay for what is expected is not good."
good,"Created my own position and was respected and encouraged for being a versatile, self motivator."
good,"On daily basis I maintained the front end operations, from scheduling cashiers breaks and lunch to developing there registers and managing the money. I also worked hand in hand with contractors and making sure that they had proper amount of products for there building needs. Hardest part of the job is making sure that everyone is satisfied with product, customer service, and prices. Enjoyable point of the job is when customers are completely satisfied."
good,"I believe the Home Depot was a good place to work, if the environment is right for you. I liked the environment and my co-workers as well as customers, but they do not pay very well and have very high expectations from everyone. I learned many things about our products, the customers, and what they liked, I also learned many great things about the company and their accomplishments. The management was okay but wasn't excellent because they did not respond to requests promptly. They took a very long time to do things so it frustrated both our employees and the customers. That was one of the most frustrating things about the job because customers would get mad at the employees when it really isn't their fault."
good,"Its an okay part time job, management was allright, good benefits for a part time job."
good,Typical day included a lot of interaction with customers depending on how busy it was. Learned to be patient and Listen to the customers. Management was ok. Co-wokers were ok. Hardest part was finding help for customers in other departments. Most enjoyable was the hour luch break.
good,"just not enough hours/ good management kind associates"
good,To be a full time employee you have to be available to work early morning shifts and late night shifts and you are required to work almost every weekend unless you request off three weeks or more in advance and the request must get approved so you have to plan your life out in advance and life doesn't always work that way.  If you love to help others and you like to work on your feet rather than behind a desk then this may be the job for you.  There may be some labor involved but you most of the time you don't get dirty but you may break a sweat from time to time.  If you work in a rural area there may not be much room for advancement because of the lack of surrounding stores.  In a larger city there may be job openings in management in surrounding stores.  I worked here for about 8 years but was never fully satisfied so I say it's a good job while working toward getting your dream job.
good,"A typical day at work would be me clocking in going to my locker grabbing my apron and heading to customer services to retrieve my walkie-talkie for the day which was my way of contact and communication with supervisors and other co-workers. As a Lot Attendant it was my job to maintain the parking lot grounds and storefront by gathering and organizing the store carts, flat beds, and lumber carts for customer access. Transport merchandise and heavy material to a customers vehicle upon request. respond to walkie-talkie when assistance was needed throughout the Home Depot warehouse. Upon closing or the end of my shift i would go collect and bring in all store carts place them in order sweep the storefront then go through the store collecting garbage bags and recyclables and taking them out to the back to be disposed of. then return my walkie-talkie and apron and clock out. I learned quite a bit about gardening and supply's throughout the store that i never knew about and how to go about certain projects and what tools to use. I think the hardest part of the job was tending to multiple customers at once and trying to be productive in your attempt to help them all loading two maybe three cars at once while trying to keep the customers waiting calm as you finish up with your current customer. I most enjoyed converting and giving helpful hints to the customers on any projects or questions they may have had as i was assisting them."
good,it was a good place to  with. to much politics in it. The management team will make your life hard if the don't like you
good,"I had a very good experience, unfortuntanly it was on seasonal work and i needed somethinf full time at the moment, but there staff was good to work with and I liked to be around the crowds of people. I guess the hardest part of the job was when there was a big turn out for games the staff had to be on there peas and ques as for keeping the place cleaned up at a moments notice. The different events they had at the stadium like rugby never seen so many different nations of people attending this sport."
good,"Every workday at The Home Depot is Enjoyable, I've learned a lot more about Home Products then I have ever known. Overall great people and management to work with. Hardest part of the job would probably be handling big orders, The Most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with different customers and personality on a daily basis."
good,I would being the carts in and help load customers  vehicles and close   
good,"long days, when i had to use the bathroom I had to wait until someonecould take my place, working outside with the plants and garden things was nice, co workers was pretty good, management was alright"
good,"its a retail job. day to day dealt with customers , and setting ad's. the highlight of the job was success sharing. there would be a big party and you'd get a bonus. "
good,"Working here, you put up with a lot and you make very little and are provided few services or opportunities to learn how to do your job better.  "
good,"-Start with an opening checklist to make sure the department is in safety regulations"
good,check to see how much work you got and then estimate time of getting it done.Then go from there.Being there for a year I learned that its a process of getting the items to the store and its more than just stocking product on the floor.The job itself is easy going just sometimes so much in such short amount of time.Being around your co-workers makes the job easier and make a liitle interesting.
good,"I did not enjoy my time at The Home Depot. I was the Freight Team Department Head. I had a manager who would constantly throw me under the bus in front of employees. For example, at the beginning of one night, my manager said we were having problems with people texting on the work floor. The policy stated that we couldn't have cell phones on the work floor. So I brought this up at our breakout meeting and asked everyone to leave their cell phones in their lockers. I told them it was fine to use them on breaks, or if they had any special circumstances, as long as they made us aware of it. Immediately after I brought this up he contradicted me in front of everyone and told them it was OK to keep their cell phones on them as long as they didn't text. I took him aside after the meeting (something he should have done with me) and explained to him why it was a bad idea to allow them to have cell phones when it was specifically prohibited in the policy. I also asked him to discuss any disagreements in private, rather than in front of the employees. He did the same thing several more times after this."
good,"The Home Depot takes safety very serious, and stress the importance of customer satisfaction."
good,"shrink plan, weekly paperwork ,recieve trucks, organize freight associate to be as productive as possible, clean store after every shift,key carrier, close vault nightly ,security of outside product,setting of alarms and locking up nightly"
good,"a typical day at work focusing on customer service, cleaning up and loading"
good,This company used to be amazing at taking care of their employees but lately they've been favoring their management more than their regular employees. It also used to be a lot about the customers but now it's all about getting numbers. The people that work there made it fun.
good,Job is fun during lunchtime
good,"Home depot has outstanding co-workers, but upper management can be a bit over-managing. And the company expects a lot from its associates with minimal support."
good,"A day at work included keeping things neat, clean, and orderly along with greeting and helping customers in finding what they are looking for along with anything else that is needed."
good,"I enjoyed this job, learned alot from project to project. At this job you never take work home and sometimes it gets tough to complete the design as quickly as you would like because customers walking though the department are always needing help, and you know that the customer always comes first. Lots of nice people to work with and great customers."
good,"Typical days were spent, walking inside and outside, pushing standard shopping carts and lumber carts. And occasionally helped customers load purchased goods into their vehicles."
good,"Enjoyed my time at Home Depot, met a lot of interesting people and learned how to be a better employee."
good,Working for the Home Depot was a great experience!! Coming from the trades to retail was an adjustment but it taught me a great deal about communication and customer service. I cant speak for every store but the ones that I worked with have great people. I learned so much from them and was thankful to have an experience like that in my life for I feel that it defiantly made me a better person. A day at work was dependent on the season but regardless it was a great company to work for.
good,Part time at Home Depot is what they offer when you first get hired with the false pretense that you may become full time. The company has excellent job security because they let you transfer without any complications.
good,A typical day working at Home Depot was keeping customers in mind and calling them to make sure everything was ok on their install or orders. I learned alot of office detail and how to manage many accounts all at once.
good,"It was always a great pleasure in working at the Home Depot. It was always a daily learning experience, being able to take care of my customers needs and provide the utmost customer service. Being able top teach train and develop associates on daily basis. I had great support system with my team and peers which makes the job so much more easier. The most challenging is getting your higher ups ( Store Managers) to have consistent communication with the entire team. Most enjoyable are the Associates and the Customers."
good,Seeking out customers to help them with shopping and purchasing items. I've learned more about tools needed for home improving and how to handle tense situations with customers. The managers are ok some are better than others and most of my coworkers are fun to work with. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who seem to never be satisfied or come to the store seeking to cause trouble. The most enjoyable part is getting paid and working around certain people.
good,Great place to work for but not for everyone. Requires the kind of time and commitment that often can interfere with family or student life especially at management level.
good,good people
good,"My time spent working at The Home Depot was alright, but very unsteady. My coworkers were a blast and the team mentality was super strong and my favorite part about being involved with The Home Depot. Also, I enjoyed the constant training for product knowledge because if there was anything new to know, we knew it the second it was implemented. This made it very easy to upsell customers and keep them informed as well! Setting proper expectations always kept people our clientel and that impressed me very much. Unfortunately, the job was very unstable and hard to work my life around my schedule. The schedule was different every 3 weeks and I never had the same day off in two weeks. Could you imagine how difficult that was to run my errands for the week when I had no idea when the week would end and start until a week before scheduling took effect? I made this work as long as I could, but eventually could not take the instability. Lucky for me, I have kept close contact with many workers at The Home Depot and am still involved in community projects with the old crew! They're all still a blast! I just had to move forward with career choices and find something more suited to make my ends meet and keep my life running routinely!"
good,This position was a very constructive position allow me to open myself to many different cultures and ethnicity. It was very fast pace allow me to feel like i achieved something in the end of the day. Co-workers were friendly and fun to work with. Managing their positions throughout the day and ensuring that jobs were being completed were at ease when i had seniority. Then of course there were un-honest customers that always ruined your day.
good,"it was ok, just boring and long . Also you meet a lot of people so costumer are fun to deal with."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is the relationships that I've built with coworkers & customers as well.
good,"If you are a student, this place isn't bad to work at. I have enjoyed it, but the favoritism within the store really hurts moral. I have learned so much in regards to customer service. The most enjoyable part would be that of our lovely bookkeepers. Even though management may at times be negative, you will find many people working with you on the floor to be great people. It really varies from location to location."
good,"My experience at Home Depot was that of no other. I've learned many things not just from management but from associates as well, Maybe more so from associates than management."
good,"There is little to no room for a life in this job they never seem to see thing from your side. Management love to tell you one thing then change it or not do it at all. Just as any company top to bottom all about the sales at the end of the day. co-worker are the only true plus to this job, if someone stays for longer then a month they are nice people."
good,"This was a fun place to work, and there are plenty of people who have done well by making it their career."
good,Every day was a good day here. Came to work ready to put on my apron and go out on the floor to help out the customers with any check-outs and/or questions.
good,"a typical day at work is to get everything to get all the products out from the receiving department and have them work and put them in the shelves.organizing the sales floor to create a pleasant and safe shopping environment, and providing customer service as required by customer demand. In addition some Freight Team Associates as designated by the Assistant Store Manager, operate reach trucks and order pickers to bring down merchandise safely from the overhead bays to the sales floor."
good,"My typical day at work usually started around 9PM and ran until 1AM, so i was pretty tired at the end of my shift. didn't really learn much because they wouldn't teach me anything. I only liked a few of my co-workers and the rest of them were trying to get me fired. Thehardest part of my job was trying to work with people who didn't like me and working with people i didn't like. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to do my own work the way i wanted to and not having to worry about my co-workers messing it up. The management there was probably the best i have ever seen. They were always reaching out the their employees, trying to help them in every way they could."
good,"I was responsible for all updates of materials that had anything and everything to do with Kitchen and Bath, from the kitchen sink to the bath room toilets. And helped customer choose what was right for their needs."
good,buena muy buena ya que te dan todas la prestaciones de ley y el ambiente es muy bueno y sano
good,"Great customers, I learned excellent time management skills. Co workers were great. Scheduling wasn't always the best."
good,There is no work/life balance. The Home Depot refuses to provide any stability in shifts so you never know from week to week what you will be working.
good,to pull tickets and be kind and friendly to everyone to help with directions to help them to there cars to be able to store them how to get to the main lobby without leaving your both
good,I regret leaving. The home depot is an amazing place to work. The management cares and training is excellent
good,a typical day at work would ve helping customers in their every need. iv learned how to communicate better with coworkers and customers. my coworkers were fun and easy going always helping. the hardest part of the job was when i couldnt help a customer and had to find another associate to help. the most enjoyable part was assissting customers.
good,wining tips driving all day was really fun i would do it again if i could
good,"In my position included verifying and clearing up reports of the special services desk. Daily inventory of special order items, calling customers to collect their items and pay balances due, managing 8-11 associates at a time, creating their schedules, assisting in other departments when asked. The most enjoyable part of THD was the involvement in community projects, i.e. partnering w/ KaBoom and building playgrounds around the community."
good,"Pretty much its just a job, not a career. Can't really advance they usually hire externally. Also, just like any place favoritism. Honestly you can make enough to support your family but that's it. Been there for almost 2 years now and still not Full-Time."
good,customer service was top priority here and we strived for it! this job was a good learning experience for me because i learned how to use differnt heavy machinery and also learned plumbing skills amongst others. the hardest part of my job was dealing with more than 2 or 3 customers at a time.the most enjoyable part was helping the people with the construction of their homes.
good,"Some days can be slow which makes time drag on, other days can be fast-paced and busy. I prefer the busy days."
good,"A typical day for me personally included alot more then most associates. In order to make myself a more valuable employee I took on additional training and in store projects. For example I was trained and designed custom decks and sheds for customers on a daily basis. I was also one of very few employees trained on all the forklifts and other lift equipment. I constantly volunteered for store projects including building displays, building a mock bathroom, and designing and building a $2000 deck for display. Also on typical days I would problem solve for customers to help them diagnos the problem and best solution that would fit there needs. Always maintained a safe work environment for all employees and customers. Assisted and directed coworkers in my department in stocking shelves, display placement, returns and picking online orders."
good,This company is a solid company to work for. I would recommend it.
good,I was the flooring department manager at a new opening Home Depot in Mattooon Illinois. I was responsible for vendors setting their areas prior to grand opening and then open communication with them after the store was open. I learned about flooring and how to measure and how to meet our customers needs.
good,"Fast paced store in the spring and summer months, But very slow paced in the fall and winter months. Liked being here because it was something different for me that I had never done. I learned about cutting flooring tile, and carpet, also cutting blinds."
good,"Provide excellent customer service, stock merchandise, receive merchandise and keep inventory"
good,"- Downstocking, running lift equiptment, working with new and returning customers, selling"
good,Fair pay for the work done. Hired to help manage new inventory brought into the store for Spring sales.
good,Home Depot is a great place to work. It provides me with new challenges everyday to help customers solve their projects.
good,"Company has great beliefs/value, but the hours required to be a full-timer can be difficult for families - require 4am until midnight availability every day, and your shifts are different every day reflecting this availability."
good,"A typical day at work with The Home Depot is fun and very fast-paced. I've learned to work extra hard even if the pay doesn't match up to where you want it to be. It's all about customer service in the end. Co-workers there might have been the best part of my day. Everyone were very friendly, helpful and awesome teammates. I've really enjoyed being employed with this company."
good,I would unload freight trucks and stock merchandise in its proper place on the sales floor. I would also at times assist customers in locating a certain product. Management was fair for the most part and my co-workers were great. The hardest part about the job would be the extreme amounts of heavy lifting and the most enjoyable part of the job would be the fact that we worked overnight so we always had fun.
good,Retail warehouse environment that is very fast pace with emphasis on strong customer service. Very physically demand and lots of repetitive work. Lots of machine operation so safety is a top priority. One of the most enjoyable part of the job is working with different people and cultures. I learned that change is the most consistent thing in this environment.
good,Poor Leadership....tight environment...direction was NEVER clear....started and stopped projects consistently (never completed).....too much waste
good,This Home Depot Store a typical day is busy; which i love because time goes a lot faster. In this store however there is a lot of favoritism and I notice it more every day. Management is okay but don't insure equality. My co-workers make work more enjoyable because lunch with them is always a surprise.
good,"Middle managers lack maturity and are brainwashed (?) By the company system and ""hoo-rah"" atmosphere, intended to be motivational to employees."
good,The day I started working there I learned alot about pluming and appliances. The hardest part of the job was trying to figure what works out for the best results.The most enjoyable part was the people I worked with they were excellent! very nice and respecting.
good,Selling to contractors and commercial customers. A typical day would consist of calling on customers and visiting them at job sites. Preparing quotes for customers and waiting on retail customers that needed assistance.
good,Co-workers were great to work with. Great company had a good experience. Hardest part was lifting the heavy trees. I learned a whole lot about plants fork lifting and much more.
good,"Typical day involves coming in at night, helping out the rest of the night crew team bring the pallettes of merchandise on the floor and stock area as required. Whenever my side is done, I am free to help others out so that we can together as a team finish our work on a timely manner. The hardest part of the job are the hours. I don't like being away from my family in the evening. The most enjoyable part is that in the summer, I can at least see my family a little during the day."
good,Home Depot really took pride in training their employees making sure they had the product knowledge needed to preform daily aspects of the business.I learned new things every day and enjoyed helping customers and being apart of the sales team. I enjoyed the fast pace environment and performing management decisions ensuring cashiers had everything the needed to preform their job.
good,Benefits are expensive out of your pocket. pretty good chance of getting promoted from within. if your open to moving you can advance pretty fast depending on availability.
good,"Assisting customers with office supplies. Working as a cashier , and cleaning ."
good,Only bad thing is hours arent steady overall a decent company to wok for
good,"Schedules were poorly staffed to meet the needs and demands of the department and customers, job was very physically demanding, and communication was poor for the need to get assistance."
good,"Treat you well vastly underpaid,can't make living their.You need a second job.That is the biggest disappointment.Home Depot has good benefits,but their not affordable under my Salary.You work overtime ,you have to cut your hours.Even though your treated well its sad to say they are top fortune five hundred company,they are very CHEAP company also"
good,"It's a good place to work, most co-workers are pleasant to work with. Management is better then most places but nothing special about it. Benefits are good, received benefits within 3 months of work. Overall I do enjoy working for Home Depot."
good,Home Depot was all work and no play.Not enough help.Management helped out when they could.
good,good atmesphere. The hours are good and positive minded managers
good,Its a decent place to work. There are great teammates to work with. They all the necessary eqiupment to get the job done correctly.
good,Good place to start working. It is fun and the people are nice. The customers are great and friendly.
good,Home Depot is a great place to work. Would be an even better place if they care more about the employees that work hard. They hire more and more people and then cut down everyones hours so they don't go over for the week. I understand the business side of making sure we don't go over the hours mark but why hire more people when you have employees that are willing to work all over the store. We need to feel valued. Know one can live off of 22 hours or lessmore a week at $8.50 a/hour. Would love to be valued and thought of. I am willing to learn new things. I love to work for my money and I promise not to let anyone down.
good,the most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people everyday.
good,"You will more than likely love your coworkers, management doesn't micro-manage too much, wonderful with schedules and family issues. Doesn't pay beans and insurance is expensive and limited."
good,"I enjoyed being able to help customers either on the phone when inquiring about a product, on the internet to help find an item, or face-to-face on the sales floor."
good,A typical day at the home depot for I would be :
good,I woulg get to work and hour early and run my reports. With this i can start my day and not rush. This way im ready for my crew.
good,My typical day starts at 6am through to 3pm with morning meetings to highlight on the days activities and plan.
good,"usually the day is busy depending on the weather, which is good, other days can be slow, learned how to deal with money situations, terminations, management is little to be desired, my co-workers are great, i consider most of them part of my family, hardest part of the job, when management doesnt show up to verify, or you're inconviencing them, enjoyable part is knowing that im helping customers from inside a locked room."
good,"A typical day at work consist of greeting customers, handling money , managing returns, keeping the front end clean to make a good first impression for our customers. I learned the basic skills of customer service which is patience , respect , and to be attentive . The management in my home depot can be better . My co-workers are very helpful and we al work as a team. I don't think that any task i get at work is difficult , i love what i do so i believe the most enjoyable part is interacting with our customers."
good,"Good compensation, lots of room to growth in the company, health benefits not up to standards and not competitive."
good,The Company itself is great but management is lazy and corrupted
good,"Started out positive with alot of support and smiling faces with promises to move up the ""ladder"". I have been working there for more than 3 years with only a couple of unrewarded homer awards, and a $1.50 increase in increments of 15-24 cents. I never moved anywhere and saw people with no work ethic move up past me and management working their own scehdules to their liking and giving preferences to their ""favorites"" of their schedules and day requests. I eventually grew less and less enthusiastiac about my position there because regardless of my bilingual skills and hard work ethic, i remain at the bottom like the first day i started."
good,I learned about Customer First. It was a program that we went by to assist customers in a efficient manner.
good,"A typical day at The Home Depot was providing exceptional customer service throught your shift, taking care of customer's needs, and providing the customer with the proper merchandise. I learned how to be more friendly with the customer, good communicating skills. Managment and co-workers were friendly. I did not find any part of my job hard just challenging when customer had complaints, and the most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers."
good,A typical day at Home Depot for me consists of making sure all cashiers have what they need and that they get their breaks on time. The management are all really nice. My co-workers are all nice for the most part. The hardest part of the job is all the down time and the most enjoyable part is helping customers.
good,"Not your typical warehouse job, Coworkers are like family."
good,Home Depot is a fast paced enviornment. The company provides training which is helpful in and out of the workplace. The hours at Home Depot are full flexed so it does'nt allow for a healthy work/life balance. For a retailer it has the best compenstion. The most difficult part of this job was fulfilling all the demands within an 8 hour shift.
good,- Stressful and aggravating
good,overall wonderful place nice clean store. i learned to be patient and multi task in fast pace environment. a typical day beings wit signing in opening you register making sure your till had a certain amount of money before you begin your transactios.
good,"The Home Depot is a nice place to work. I am normally the closer, I have to clean my departments, assist customers with their projects and problems, and to cut wood so customers can fit it in their cars. I currently have a great management staff in charge of me. They listen to my problems and concerns and try to help me slove them. My co-workers are great. The hardest part of my job is when we don't have enough associates on the floor to assist our customers, but we all work as a team and make sure we can help everyone who needs to be helped. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I see customers that I have helped, shows me how well the project I helped them with came out"
good,"My typical day at work would be go to my cash register, and spend the whole entire day getting screamed at by customers. My enjoyment was a few regular customers and customers that needed my help and thankful I took the time to help them. The hardest part of my job was the fact I was told I could change which area I worked at and I enjoyed out side garden I was best there, I knew stuff out there, it was peaceful and they said working there for three months I could change work area. I was there over a year and no changes just same either customers yelling at me over the oddest things or the really awesome customers that you wished came around more. If anything this job taught me to ""toughen my skin"" and just keep my self with a happy face while getting screamed at everyday and still help out those type or customers."
good,"I've been with the Home Depot since I could start working there. It's been a great learning experience, but there doesn't seem to be any room for advancement, and I feel that I'm not being challenged enough."
good,Home depot was a very fun job i loved going to work every day i always learnd new thing and was happy to see my customers they were wondrful and never gave me a had time. the mangerers was also wonderful
good,Great company values but work/life balance isn't all that great
good,Great benefits and flexible schedules. The company has help me with various life activites. I have gained tremendous work ethics and experience.
good,Descent company to work for. Reason for leaving: to join the military.
good,"Workplace culture is just great everybody just working and it's all great vibes there, But the only problem is  if you work overnight stocking it takes a toll on your body so if your not willing to put the work in then I Wouldn't recommend this job for you ."
good,Management could be Better trained. Thus becoming better leaders and building better Team Players. During my Time there many of Superisor’s and Management were shifted around in terms the company did much hiring and firing. People grow in terms of who you know and brown nosing. I witness great people quit and get fired and step down from positions as well as employees who had terrible customer service be rewarded. The pay doesn’t compensate for the work required and the environment isn’t welcoming. The experience altogether was the worst retail I have ever experienced in 18 years of working in the background.
good,The Home Depot is an easy job to get into but when you get the job just make sure you are on top of your work. But it’s an easy job but you can get fired due to slacking.
good,Home Depot is a great place to work and everyone is very nice and understanding. They always put their people first. Work life balance is also a plus!
good,"To much work of stocking and customer service expected of you."
good,okay place to work -worked there for a while.  benefits okay....work culture sometime okay. development is an issue. the company is a diverse company.
good,"excelente ambiente laboral, oportunidad de crecimiento"
good,As a lead I was always having to help with problems although I didn't mind I had to run chores for my managers like getting her lunch or going to the store to get her nail clippers.
good,"if you are looking for challenge, this is the place. very diverse. I started out as lot attendant for one year, then got promoted to Hardware associate"
good,Overall I grew and learned a lot working at the home depot . There are some cool ppl you will meet there . Overall though the job Has it’s cons the customer are rude and you expected to make there happy all the time . Management is cool but they look out for them selves it’s all about sales for them . If your a front end associate you don’t matter to them honestly .
good,"Been there a while. Love the customers and working with them. However, not a good balance of work and family time. Always there not enough time to spend with family. Do not pay you what your worth."
good,great place to work as long as you have good managers. i have been with them for almost 14 years and they were really good accommodating my needs as a single parent. the benefits are good and  they gave my kid a $2500 scholarship for college. they raised the starting pay since i have been there witch is great for new employees but didn't affect me at all. jan. and feb. are really the only slow months otherwise it's really easy to stay busy.
good,"De manière générale, bonne entreprise pour travailler, mais le salaire est peu satisfaisant."
good,"I liked the job, but not the co-workers, they would act like children in middle school and talk bad about people, even the customers. They have a bad issue with insulting customers in front of them."
good,Although the pay was not good what so ever for the work they make you do the people their are really nice so it was nice to stay at work just know your going to work a lot
good,"fun    coworkers    and    costumers    just    supervisors    are    "
good,"Homedepot is a friendly place to work with many perks offered.  Although,  some there.  My supervisors and managers were easy to speak with and always helpful.  Disspite feeling under paid,  homedepot wad a great place to be.."
good,The management was good for the most part. Was sometimes complicated to talk/ get ahold of one when needed. busy work place so you are never bored. Nice people
good,Good company to work for  with great benefits but poor management.But there is a lot to learn and opportunities are there. Not really a family oriented
good,Was a great place to work at first but after about 8 months you come to realize they don't care about you and they don't care if people are screwing around most of the shift
good,"It is a good first job for individuals with no experience, and are eager to work. The company is flexible with individual's school schedule and other part time job."
good,sometime  you have  to be plumber and electrician and kitchen designer or something else to satisfy the customer the reason is every worker  had to be a sales no matter what is his job .
good,"This is a EXCELLENT company for young people and retirees to work for. HOME Depot has 401 benefits, Investment plans, also they have loading  assistance."
good,"Buena empresa para laborar, en cuestion de crecimiento hace falta mas oportunidades para la gente que ya cuenta con experiencia y años."
good,Good spot for entry level worker.  Management always striving to developement new talent.  Best advice is to find reputable manager to act as a mentor.  Use internal developement tools widely promoted by Home Depot and made readily available.  Work Hard.  Job is a walking standing job in a big box store.  Look to be physically active and many time dirty.
good,It was fun to work there the other associates made it fun and to not be so serious and enjoy yourself while providing excellent customer service. was very satisfying to be able to provide knowledge and experience with products to what a customer is looking for and needs
good,"Great staff, thankful for the opportunity to work there. Good training, technology. Reasonable schedule, employee discounts, able to travel or relocate within the company."
good,"Very busy store, hardworking associates, very helpful.  Store was located closest to the downtown Cincinnati area.  Relocated to Orlando Florida and soon afterwards left Home Depot after 6 years after management and adjustment issues in 2005 down here."
good,"In the 5 years I worked at Home Depot, I was able to hold 3 different job positions. The advancement was there but my pay was not. The management was really good at helping me have a good work/life balance."
good,Everyones friendly and great environment. They make you feel great when you accomplish something. They are always holding events and what not to encourage the employees.
good,Was a good place to work. You were rewarded for your hard work thru commission. Took care of employees with perks like free lunches and holiday gifts.
good,"Home Depot needs to increase the workers hourly rate. There is a by far huge disparate gap between all Store Managers in $160,000 per annual and the rest of the store workers at $10 per hour. The fearful thing is absolutely, there is no job security."
good,Normally for me when ever i would clock in i would always get told to allot of major things. Like Drive all the heavy machinery to fill the isle with products or to make the company as a whole look good.
good,"Fue una buena experiencia , aprendí mucho y hay oportunidad de crecimiento rápidamente."
good,"Very fast pasted and crazy place to work. Can be fun. Great place to practice leadership skills and grow as a team player. Lean to multitask "
good,"I’ve been here for almost 2 years and although the people are nice and the place is a good job, sometimes we can be understaffed and it’s super annoying to have to get help to customers (when you’re a cashier and can’t move from that cash). It’s a lot of standing on hard concrete which can mess up your joints a little. Also, if you’re wanting benefits, make sure you work a minimum of 20 hours per week for 3 months in order to be eligible for benefits. No one told me that when I started and I received my benefits over a year later."
good,"You are paid paultry  sums and expected to work like a slave. Whatever you do, DO NOT BECOME a DEPT HEAD. Minuscule pay, more hours, too much stress, no control over your schedule. And the drama of all of the employee’s in your Dept. "
good,C'est un bonne emploie pour les étudiants. Les avantages sociaux sont bons et les caissières sont vraiment accueillante.
good,"Frequent staff events and free food. decent Christmas party.  Fairly large turn over rate. Often short staffed, little to no available overtime except for during times of high workload (inventory, holidays, hurricanes)"
good,"Nights are long and range from very intense and hard to very easy and calm. The job is what you make of it, but you should be prepared to do a decent amount of heavy lifting."
good,"1. Putting things where they go and then if the home was full throw the extra stuff up"
good,"I did last two years here with fun, nice employees but parking lot work put too much pressure and pain on my feet so it was a very stressful campaign."
good,"It's a good place to learn skills and put them in practice. "
good,"While this job needs better management, it guarantees my job will not be terminated for not being a ""good fit"" or being under qualified and has many benefits, even for part time employees."
good,"The Home depot is an OK place to work, but the experience you have as an employee,  is so heavily dependent on your supervisors, and management, that even one bad manager can block a promotion, when the rest of the middle- management team sees potential.  I saw it happen time and time again. The pay and benefits are good, as they pretend to care aabouttheirememployees(efull time only"
good,"Good opportunity for first-time jobs and retired individuals, but it is a stressful environment. During a daily shift, you are required to serve customers (good and bad) while merchandising to provide a quality shopping experience."
good,"My experience at The Home Depot started off as a Lot associate, where we were very underappreciated, but as time went on and we started showing our potential, promotions came into play. You have to really work for your job, and they make sure you are taken care of and loved. However, the management is a bit weird, and can be a super hit or miss. My experience with management varied, where some managers were there because they cared for us, and others cared for their paychecks. Overall, great store and made friends and memories."
good,Home Depot always treated me well.  As I chose to advance my own career the work life balance began to become unbalanced.  My family began to grow so I needed more balance which Home Depot could not offer.
good,"The knowledge I gained at Home Depot is invaluable. I enjoyed troubleshooting concerns and finding solutions. Customer service felt like my true calling while I was employed there as it was enjoyable to work with the public and the pro customers. The most difficult part of my job there was feeling overwhelmed with the sheer number of responsibilities placed on a highly customer-facing role - it was often difficult to finish daily tasks assigned due to customer volume. Staffing was always an issue and the stress that caused made me feel exhausted nearly all the time. I had a difficult time meeting their stringent policy on attendance because it was hard to get out of bed and knowingly place myself in that situation and I was terminated based solely on ""attendance"": I would clock in for my shift within 15 minutes of my scheduled time and work my scheduled hours, but due to a 7 minute grace period I would receive the same punishment as if I had not even shown up for work. Of the 10 variances I had in my file, 7 of them were of this nature. I was always praised for excellence in customer service and was often told how I was ""the best one at the service desk"" - recognition for excellence was not as frequent as it could have been and I didn't feel I was compensated to suit my skill level. I regret how soured my relationship became with Home Depot over time as I had seen with so many of the long-term associates, but was saddened by my departure."
good,"Home Depot does not support most workers with hours during winter, which is when most need more money, not less. Good atmosphere, they do treat employees with food during holiday hours and bonus checks twice a year. They offer financial help when employees have emergency. Overall a good place to work. Too bad they don't give more people full-time."
good,"Job work is fair and leads to useful skills acquisition depending on the departments you work. Plenty of opportunity for advancement if you establish a network early on and exemplify company values. Management is a hit or miss, thankfully the manager over my departments was extremely organized, methodical, hands-on, and always had a presence in the store and worked along side everyone he came across. Job culture is more about the people you work with over the actual company itself, which ironically is the core value of the company. Bonuses were pretty poor however, other benefits were solid."
good,overall nice place to work but they ended up putting me outside in lot even though i applied to work cashier i have only work there a small amount of time and i enjoyed it at first but some of the people there were very mean and talked behind customers backs on how bad they were. now normally his type of behavior happens all the time but this one lady was constantly warned about it. overall job was nice until i got screwed and had to work outside after i started at the register.
good,"Good company with excellent values and employee support, on the surface... but with poor store management and poor work ethic from coworkers that drives down morale of actual working employees."
good,"The company itself has really good values and those drive the entire company. Home Depot really values its associates. there is some disconnect there though. Often associates are expected to do more than compensated for, feel grossly overworked, and are in very high stress situations with customers and do not feel they get anything back for it."
good,"Typically, I would spend almost every day retrieving carts and putting them back in place. I would also frequently help customers load items into their cars. If I was closing then I would also be expected to refill the fridges with pop at the front of the store and empty the trash bins in front to the store. The work environment was fairly good, though I mostly interacted with the cashiers since I worked in the front of the store. The hardest part of the job was when I closed during the summer. Because of the increase of customers during the summer there would be a larger quantity of carts in the lot to take care of as well as more customers asking for help with loading. Because I was by myself, I would be running back and forth nonstop for several hours, sometimes not being able to take a break. I did enjoy being able to be outside every day and moving around, rather than standing in one place all day. Other than closing in the summer the rest of the job was somewhat enjoyable."
good,"Hired part time. Hard to start out full time. Great day schedule and no weekends. $11.00 per hour. Had fun working with the other associates. Company against Union's. Not enough pay, had to move on.. Dental,vision,life and wellness plan available. Not real health unless full time."
good,"After going to work realized it was a lot more different than what I expected learn to work with the people there. I'm currently not real pleased with my own work environment looking for a change, not happy with the people to work ratio."
good,It's a good place to work but management in some stores is not up to par. Employee shortage happens everyday due to poor scheduling or call in's causing a lot of stress on those who are working.
good,Currently a manager in charge of the freight team. Have experience in merchandising being the manager of that before going to nights. Open availability.
good,"Great HR, but rest of work professional could be better. When i worked there they would move the management around to different stores with no thought of what it does to the rest of the staff that has come accustomed to working with them, and they would transfer another management in return. Not a good idea."
good,Definitely Corp America pretty flexible with hours. Great place to advance and grow and see the world. They did many fundraisers to help the community
good,"in the freight team the environment was very face-paced and fun. unloading deliveries and organizing where products go was the easiest thing in the world, thanks to my fitness level I could keep the intensity up and finish the job at a perfect timing. Management didn't book my vacation days and it ultimately lead to me leaving the company due to bad scheduling."
good,"The Home Depot overall is a decent job, part timers  but full-time employees is a kind of stressful.  Home Depot allows part-timers to get vision dental and 401(k) in sick time  also share options.  Once you become full-time you’re able to get health insurance that’s pretty decent."
good,very busy and multi task and problem solving a must and lots of people skills is needed both internal and external customers. Lead by example leadership and hands on a must
good,The hardest part of this job is dealing with all sorts of customers but not impossible..management is really bad seems theres a lot of preferences.. its always busy which is a great thing makes your day go by faster employees are easy to work with and get along
good,"My Home Depot is usually ran pretty well, but when problems arise they come hard. The work can be stressful at times, but you are allotted quite a bit of time to do your daily tasks, Overnights were nice with no customers in the building. It makes work easy and once you get a handle of the job time flies. Management can be hit or miss sometimes and they usually switch supervisors every 6 moths it seems like so be prepared for change, Coworkers make the job fun. While for the most part you work alone, the times you do have with others is usually fun and makes time blow by. I would recommend working here if you don't mind a bit of hard labor, and the occasional mess."
good,"Good for students and older individuals.  It's an ""ok"" job. Nice coworkers. Just seemed unnecessarily micro managed. If I had to go back I wouldn't mind."
good,"On paper the company is good to work for, and if you are part time, it's great. However the value of the associate decreases the more responsibility they have, with the exception of supervisors and managers. You can be a specialist and make less than a cashier, despite having much more responsibility. Even if you are a specialist in one department, you are expected to be an expert in everything"
good,"You have to have a lot of patience when working with a variety of customers of unique backgrounds and skill levels. Take advantage of learning the tools provided to you. Do not feel bad about asking for help, especially when the job requires more than one person. "
good,"You get thrown into an area of expertise in which you have no experience in, and from that you learn so much more then trying to learn things on your own about sales, and the merchandise you're selling."
good,Overall The Home Depot is a great company.  There are a fair amount of growth opportunities. The opportunities are slightly above a lateral change.  The culture is very laid back. The Home Depot has a nice amount of work/life balance.
good,"Good place to work , but the salary is to low .. for the cost of living in America . The Store armoni depent of the manager of the store, if the manager is good and fear everything will work good - assiting manager folow the manager in behavior"
good,"I love the work that I do. I get to meet a ton of great people customers and associates alike. Each day is different than the day before. I have learned so much that I can put to use in my home life like how to take care of projects in my home and maintain my home. I always enjoy seeing associates that I have developed move forward in their career and advance. I work in a High volume fast paced building, that comes with its own kind of stress and struggle. I manage the freight flow right now and it takes a lot of pre planning to ensure completion every night and it can become quite stressful but I do enjoy the challenge. Overall The Company is a great company to work for however, a lot of the advancement is based on your manager ""liking"" you not so much the work you put in."
good,Not very rewarding. Management doesn't show appreciation for those who go above and beyond. 10% do 90% of the job and aren't well compensated for it. Good people to work with. Little to be desired for giving the workers initiative to try harder.
good,"Aprendi a trabajar en un empresa de retail, ampliar mis conocimientos en ventas con capacitaciones por parte de la empresa asi como de los proveddores."
good,They really don't give hours you have to ask the management is terrible they are VERY RUDE you can be a cashier and they will have you doing everything in the store they let customers steal and they do nothing about it
good,"While working at The Home Depot, you will be alongside amazing coworkers, aside from the managers. Now the department managers can really be lovely, but the every ASM I have worked with has had the worst superiority complex. They will talk to you condescendingly in front of customers. The hardest part of the job is probably the fact that you have to deal with complicated cases if you're at the service desk, for example orders going missing."
good,"Great company to work for. "
good,"Home Depot strives for a fun culture and work environmental, they encourage open door policy and try to encourage growth and promoting from within the company"
good,Engaging with customers to fulfill their needs and or product knowledge. Working with several different computer software systems.  Most associates are friendly and happy to be there. Management is busy with the business aspect of running the store and less personable with their associates. The hardest part can be remaining calm and composed while dealing with a rude and loud customer.
good,Home depot was a good place to work.  I feel they could do better on training their new employees.  Working with the other employees was great.  The store layouts were efficent and easy to find product's
good,"It's a really simple job, they take training and advancement seriously. Customers can be very rude and expect you to give unauthorized discounts because managers do so regularly. Lots of benefits and company takes really good care of your needs. However there were a lot of times where supervisors expect you to pick up the slack of other employees and it was understaffed. The hardest part was working somewhere where policies are overlooked due to favoritism. Communication is key and head cashiers and supervisors did not effectively execute scheduling, breaks, and problem solving."
good,"Learned a lot about daily housing projects or applicable solutions to life issues. Built a knowledge with hardware tools, the process of electrical work as well as plumbing work."
good,Relaxed work environment.  Enough training is given to ensure that employees are capable of performing that assignments without the need for constant supervision
good,"I was promoted from a MET Associate to MET Supervisor. The store I was given was disheveled from the previous Supervisor who worked there for 5 years. He was transferred to another store, however the team he had created consisted of 2 of his best friends who showed up to work whenever they wanted. The team does not follow any rules or safety guidelines, if you try to change their behavior they report you to HR. Store-side hates the MET Team, you can do them 1001 favors and they will complain that you didn't do something else for them. There is no accountability unless you are the person who works hard and then you are judged for everything you do. The vendors will yell at you, associates, supervisors and management all form into cliques of tenor-ship. If you want to get promoted you have to brown nose with the ASM's and SM as well as the District Manager. Doesn't matter how bad you work as long as you are in the clique.   They do hand out a lot of recognition to the store-side associates, however its typically only to the people who are in the ""popular"" group and are friends with the SM or ASM's. On a daily basis I walk about 7-8 miles in a store. I have to make sure I am on the aisle with my team, doing projects, helping managers, supervisors, department associates, customers, checking the quality of work of my associates, fixing problems that the previous supervisor created, hold people accountable, allow people to talk back to you, coach, teach and retrain associates. I even train new store associates because the majority of the time they cannot find their Supervisor or Manager."
good,"The Beaumont Home Depot is a challenging and rewarding place to work for.  If you show up on time and work diligently the entire time that you are there for your shift, then you will succeed"
good,Great company and a great environment to grow within the company. Always conducting department meetings and striving to continue fanatical customer service.
good,"Structured environment with a lot manager, great company but a lot politics to move up within the company. "
good,Had a good time. management was good. learned about mixing paint. hardest part was learning brands. enjoyed the people. enjoyed the customers. loved to mix and match colors
good,"They were good for me while I went to school and became a graduate, but they have no room for growth and I need to move on. I have great memories there and will miss people I work with."
good,"If you are looking for fast paced career in construction retail business, then Home Depot is the place to be.  Providing great customer service while helping people build their homes or make them better."
good,"As a Lumber Associate your typical day goes as follows (lets say opening, 5am)"
good,"Nice environment to work in, not to shabby when it comes to organizational structure. Needs more fulltime employees but they always tend to hire students so part time is EVERYTHING TO THEM. Some room for advancement but dont get your Hopes up unless you've been there for awhile or have outstanding knowledge of the area you choose to work in."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Home Depot.  The work was something I really liked in that I was able to really pay attention to detail. However, favouritism was often an issue where certain employees friendship with supervisors/managers often meant others more deserving were overlooked."
good,company has amply training programs and assist in training flexible hours staff are easy to work with and  available to assist when needed nice layout and conditions
good,"The Home Depot is a good company to work with. They have flexible scheduling, and management is typically open to work/life balance issues. The opportunity for advancement is available to good employees."
good,Opening and or closing the store. Cleaning and pulling down stock to make the shelves presentable for the customer and meeting customers needs. By walking and talking with customers and getting them the correct products they need.
good,The company itself isn’t bad. They offer a lot of good benefits for employees and they work with ur schedule but the management sucks and they act like teenagers no matter what store you’re at
good,Lack of quality help in the aisle.  Poor coverage .  Poor communciation.  They promote from within  and encourage diversity.   Great benefitsand success sharing.
good,I have been working for the company since 2002. As a department supervisor I do not receive a set schedule and don't really have time to see my family or do family events over the summer.  My typical day at work consists of going over sales numbers and making sure my associates stay productive. The management staff is fair and cares about the associates. The most difficult part of the job is the schedule. The most enjoyable part of my job is the relationships you build with the other associates in the building
good,The work is not difficult as long as you follow instructions. Management underwent a few changes while I was there and a lot of people were not happy but overall management was still good. Met a lot of cool people who worked there.
good,As with every retail store everything is dependant on your store manager things were good when you had a good one. You learn a lot the team works well together. And when you don’t have a good one things can be very stressful.
good,Home depot takes care of their employee from corporate side. Good store managers were hard to find but associates were great. Training is a big part of THD
good,Very low starting pay of $12.00 an hr. Must wait 1 year to have a performance review and then only maybe get a .35 cent raise. No pay raises or cost of living raise. Not possible for a parent to raise a child or live on these wages.
good,"Home Depot pledges to back its associates in all situations, yet when it comes to problem customers seeking irrational discounts or expecting things they don't deserve/shouldn't get, managers tend to always side with the customer. It's a little demeaning when you're constantly told to follow the rules and even getting reprimanded for not following policy when management doesn't back you up when you try to enforce it."
good,"Coworkers are willing to help, they’re nice. Management is okay. They scheduled me way to much and the hours are inconsistent. But if that’s your thing I say you’ll be Fine."
good,"We had a tight group of people handling unloading the truck, and our manager was a great guy. We all knew what we had to do, and how to do it. Then the higher-ups hired a second manager who completely threw out the status quo. The day he joined he started making changes like he knew what he was doing, despite most of them being subpar or even detrimental, but always confusing. I left barely a few months afterwards once I finally got tired of butting heads with him."
good,I left Home Depot because it was originally a pit stop before i found a better job. On top of that i was part time and the management had no plans of letting me become full time.
good,Cool place too works as part-time to work through school. Many ways to advance in the company and even ways to get into corporate. Great medical and retirement benefits. The best part is the people you get to meet
good,Management was not always fully aware of the heavy work loud. However it gave great opportunity to develop time management and problem solving. Work required high energy and efficiency
good,"While working there, they implemented a new scheduling system with took the part timers hours and cut them by 50-75%. This caused the morale in the store to drop drastically. I was one of the many that was affected and since I left (I left to attend college) most of the people that I worked with there are now gone. When this happened, this always caused them to constantly call you ahead of time and cancel your shift. Which meant you weren't working that shift which then meant you were not getting paid. :("
good,"While its a great place to work part time and feel like part of a team, it can be a very draining environment as they are frequently understaffed. "
good,Es uma empresa muy humana solo los lideres se contradiccen mucho
good,Working at THD can be challenging at times and very slow at others. Folks who work alongside me are great. Make everyday even better. Always like helping in other departments.
good,See below and don't let all the hoopla fool you . If you don't want to have a personal life go full-time. This is retail on a whole new level. No commissions.
good,"Fast paced work, not treated as a number, great people to work with, but can get very stressful at times. Very demanding work and can be easily overwhelmed"
good,Each shift was highly motivated by our supervisors and shift leads. Teams work compete in friendly work competitions for productivity.Plenty of room for career advancement if your willing to put the time and effort in.
good,had slow advance opportunities and very very low monetary advances. worked with numerous associates unloading trailers and distributing freight onto the sales floor. i was lucky enough to have certifications for all the machinery and made the day go by faster and was more widely valuable to this particular store.
good,they constantly have corporate walks. so usually that means managers are constantly on your back about everything. the funny thing is they are scheduled quality walks. so they know when the people are going to show up. if they really wanted to see how the store is running. they should show up unannounced. pay really is bad. so many different jobs but some are more physical or stressful than others but is the same for all positions.
good,Easy place to work have great benefits and perks. I think they need to do a little bit more background on the leaders that they hire. Keeping bad leaders hurt the culture of this place. Dont hire people off good work ethic if they have no people skills.
good,"I loved my job for over a year and everyone there was fantastic, until we got a new store manager. The new manager was very passive aggressive. If you think they care about your home life, think again. I would ask for time off months in advance for important doctor’s visits and a funeral, but they scheduled me anyways even after speaking with the manager. I had surgery to my pelvis and wasn’t allowed to sit when I went back to work, causing my stitches to pull and putting me in pain. Manager also started to hire a ton of friends near the end of my time there. Yes, they pay well, but it’s not worth it to be treated like garbage."
good,"- great people"
good,"Working at the customer service desk in Home Depot varies from store to store, I'm sure, but the one I work at is quite stressful and fast paced. Simultaneously the phones are always ringing, there's almost always a line of customers waiting, there is always special orders and deliveries that need to be worked on and on top of that-- the scheduling is never the best. Managers are usually there to support you and back you up if there is a customer problem, sometimes they're not available and that's when it becomes hard. Overall, working at the Home Depot is a good and secure job, they're pretty good with working with your own schedule, and serving you as an employee. Since it is so fast-paced, it's not for the faint of heart."
good,Hate this job buts its a job at least. My supervisor is unprofessional. But assistant managers and manager are very professional it's a good job just has a lot of rude customers.
good,"The first year was fine after the second-year management changed and things went downhill no one seem to care as much for the employees advancement and or Management training had to work 10 days do it the weekend off , only good thing was that they trained you and sometimes if you wasn't busy in your department you could work all over the store"
good,Training was very lacking - only a bunch of videos to watch and alot of little things you needed to know were not included in them.  New assistant manager was a crab.
good,It is busy and most times you low on coverage. So you need to work fast and multi task but still keep a good attitude and don’t take anything personal.
good,"I been here 5 years so you would like working at this company. You can learn about in this company, in reference to different departments and very hand on"
good,"Management is not the best, from what customers expect from the sale associates they need more training or lessons on the department that they are working on. I had a lot of customers complaining because I was not an electrician and i couldnt help them in some of their problems. Home depot did trained me the bascis in electrical work but not expert advice, like they say on the commercial."
good,"-Good hours for student (7:00PM-11:00PM)"
good,"A company with good work/life balance with okay compensation. "
good,Many days overworked and not appreciated. The management was not supportive at times. The associates helped to make the place enjoyable in order to get the work done.
good,would recommend to a kid starting in the work force liked it very much respectable company decent pay for what is expected for all the workers nice company.
good,All in all was good place to work managed good supervisor was really helpful to us and respectful and kept the stress level down easy and mellow was honestly a very nice company to work for
good,"Opportunity is there but its not what you know, its who you know.  Management from the top down practices nepotism which can be a bit deflating at times. he benefits are good they match on the 401K but the insurance has gotten to expensive for what they are paying."
good,"During my time with The Home Depot it was a decent work experience, as the days were long 10+ hour days, but you had 3 days off. Most days are busy with some slow and easy days mixed in based off freight and trucks coming into the building. Most coworkers and supervisors aren't much trouble but the ones that are difficult stand out and can basically get away with almost anything if you've been there over 4+ years."
good,See my review for Lowe's because the same is true for Home Depot. I sold everything in the store but took a hard time for not doing garden recovery for the first hour of the shift.
good,"Depending on what you are looking for in a job Home Depot can be a great place to work.  I have had the pleasure of working at several different stores, across several different states and The Home Depot has afforded me many things.  I have also been able to see snapshots of management styles across this same swath and can say the inconsistencies need to be addressed."
good,"Not a great place to work long term. Good for temporary work as a student and good for older people looking to make some extra money. My grandmother works here also and likes it fine but I never intended to stay here longer than a year."
good,"Management wasn't that nice, but the job itself was enjoyable. I enjoyed constantly learning as I was a cashier in different areas of the store such as lumber and garden center. Hardest part was standing for 9 hours"
good,Managers are awesome with their teams. Home Depot does promote community communication and commitment to their employees as well as to their customers
good,"had 5 departments to over see. had to work with mad customers. the last store manager was a jerk, the scheduled was one day open, next day closed, next day could open again."
good,Home Depot should give the employees a chance to advance instead already having a person picked out.  Advancement here is a long process.  The pay is average.
good,"When you are part time, you get vary hours.  Every department is a challenge because you need to learn a lot of all the products.  To have the opportunity to have full time, if you are lucky to be offer."
good,Home Depot is big on PT workers.  Don't expect to get a full time job.  There is a climate of good old boys when it comes to promotions.  Department managers often know nothing about their departments initially.
good,The Home Depot was a pretty fun and rewarding place to work.  The atmosphere and culture working there is very upbeat and fosters advancement well.  Unfortunately there are some bad apples in the world of mid to upper management which can cause unneeded stress and such.  otherwise it was a good and rewarding place to work.
good,You work Mon-Fri from 6-3. Strictly no. If you get close to overtime will be told to clock out early and go home. A lot of people will come off as nice then you later see that they will throw you under the bus.
good,"For me depending on when you are working you'll work with fantastic coworkers/ head cashiers or terrible coworkers/ head cashiers. If you work here, make it temporary."
good,"I learned to provide excellent customer service. Typical day at work included to guide my associates to perform daily tasks such as, customer service, stocking shelves, and shelf maintance. Also to work as a team."
good,A night in home depot freight team would start off in the receiving room with pallets off truck being seperated to be put up in different sections of the store.
good,"I really enjoy interacting with my customers every day.  That's the best part of this job.  I enjoy the family atmosphere.  Also, I like staying busy, which it is most of the time."
good,A typical day is going from department to department cleaning up product and making sure it is all available. I learned different uses for things as well as time management. The management is understanding and easily approachable. The hardest part of the job is keeping busy on a slow day. The most enjoyable part is the people you work with everyday.
good,"Employees on the floor are great; most of the management at this location has no concern for following THD procedures, safety standards, etc. They do not treat their employees well, unfortunately."
good,Fun place to work at because of coworkers and some managers but when I see my weekly checks I wonder why I even worked there. I’ve been working part time for almost a year and wasn’t offered a full time position so I’m leaving.
good,the main goal of home depot is that all floor associates are there to help any one that needs help getting their job done. People must be guided to help the customers  with their home projects as needed.
good,"its a fun place to work especially with the coworkers once you start to work with them. I had a great time working in the garden however, i know that even working in the garden i was also a cashier which helped the my other coworkers when lines would get backed up in the garden."
good,"Too much selling of referrals and credit cards. Good employees,supervisors and customers. Was a well stocked store."
good,"Working on the MET team was rather fun, because of the people that I worked with. The work itself is rather redundant. Not what was explained upon hiring. The rate of pay was explained, but no raises after 90/120 days."
good,"When you work at The Home Depot, you learn that fast paced is no joke here. Even though the physical job may be a little overwhelming, at the end it is worth it for the great Health, Dental insurance, stocks to invest in and of course 401k for retirement."
good,"Becoming a freight team associate at my home depot specific location, was an experience within itself. A work day of mine consists of : fast paced unloading of freight merchandise, stocking /restocking of all department products,continuous usage of pallet jack for heavy pallet shipments, and productive interactions with customers. Due to the days of some associate participation and high volume of orders; the hardest part of the job was restocking the shelves while customers ask continuous questions,even outside of my department."
good,"I work three departments and a raise is not considered at all, tried to work me across the store multiple departments with same pay and dry me out sadly."
good,When I first started at Home Depot it was a great job the associate where friendly and helpful. But then when I was hired permanently after 1-2 months the hours started to decrease
good,"Working with the public in a home improvement environment is hectic due to the demands of our customer's immediate needs that cannot be provided, we lack of proper training/on hands coaching of empowerment of how to handle public anger and the old 20% does 80% of the work goes unappreciated.  We have some great people working in our store but the culture of our store needs a big plug of leadership not just managers who push paper and not their associates to higher standards through proper mentoring and coaching. Lately, there's a atmosphere of underlying frustration"
good,The best part about this job was the people. They were extremely friendly and helpful. The job itself is not the best and the pay is a little low for overnight work.
good,"Good people to work with, always made the environment good working environment. Some days were better than others and never a dual moment within the workplace."
good,"Very busy work environment, great co-workers but the hours were hard for me.  They were necessary for the job I did, which I liked but it affected my health.  It's a good company and I was grateful for it"
good,"The job can be fine but between lazy supervisors overworking you, lack of hours, and employees. it can lead to angry customers and poor working conditions."
good,"It would be hard to survive at Home Depot as a fulltime employee  raising a family but okay for a retiree looking for a part time job."
good,The Home Depot was a very rewarding place to work. It has lots of opportunity for advancement and is normally a low stress and  friendly place to work.
good,"The amazing thing about working at The Home Depot is that you can always change whatever job you started with. There are always new spaces for people to occupy, new jobs being started, new management positions opening up. Although sometimes it takes dedicated employees years to gain a position they should have received a long time ago, most of the management positions are earned by those who understand the needs of the company. It really feels like a tiny community in each store you work at."
good,I would say that The Home Depot is a good place to work. Most of my shift consists of bringing carts inside from the parking lot and occasionally loading products into customer's cars. The management was productive and professional. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the weather while outside. It was very hot in the summer and I personally suffered a small heat stroke. My position was laid back and it was rather easy which was enjoyable in a way.
good,A busy environment with room for advancement.  Customers and co-workers are fun to work with. Management is supportive and willing to listen.  Hardest part of the job is learning where everything is in the store.
good,Some days could be easy going  others would get so stressful it was like I was losing my mind. Sometimes I would have multiple things to do at once.  Also it is sometimes hard to get help.
good,"Expect to be pulled in 10 different directions to help other departments out on top of loading and unloading customers that need help. If you are cloising you can look to having to sweep the parking lot of the store. The good thing about the job was that it was like having a gym membership, you are always moving and lifting."
good,"Start day with a meeting  stretch talk to associates  help customers, bring deliveries, restock ,clean up flat stack lumber help in receiving clean up in your area clock out."
good,"the benefits are great,and the employess are fun to work with. they offer great benefits and great bonus .the management team has poor communication with it associates"
good,Did not work here. It was one of my accounts I went to working for coca-cola. Sometimes a nice day at  park is good for you. Chicken soup is good for the soul. I'll send it into the endzone.
good,Home depot provides part time and full time hours depending on business you can get more hours. Around the holiday time it gets busy and you may get more hours.
good,"It was a fun work environment, with a team production, customer service culture."
good,Management isn't the best but what they lack in skills they make up for in workplace fun activities. Benefits are good even for part timers. Hitting ridiculous credit card quotas by weeks end in a place that has become over saturated with people that already own said cards is the hardest part. But the weekly bbqs and fun treats every two weeks make up for it.
good,This place is insane. Inconsistent management. Money hungry. Little to no compassion. I managed there for a while and was treated extremely poorly. the poeple you work wiht are what make it worth it
good,Overall very good work environment and fulfilling work. Lack of communication between day and night shifts could get problematic and was a big issue. Management could be better.
good,It's a decent job overall. If you keep problems off your boss's desk you won't be micromanaged. Ability to make my own decisions. Nearly impossible to bonus.
good,"Start time is extremely early (5 am ) I don't get a lot of support from my superiors, I love being mobile, and moving about. My desk time to floor time is good.  The salary is lacking,"
good,Not well organized and run for Supervisors. No control over dept. due to HR heavy involvement causing some bad seeds to remain an issue that you really can't correct.
good,"The beginning of employment was a challenge post computer training. Management tends to throw you on the floor pretty quickly due to lack of employees playing their rolls in their designated departments. As a specialist you learn very quickly on how to balance product knowledge, customer service, and keeping up with product orders/installs. Once you master those work ethics everything else becomes fairly easy. The best thing to do is to shadow a different person everyday from each shift if available."
good,The flexibility of the job is a definite plus but when it comes to salary and pay the job is somewhat limited. Home Depot seems like a place where you are just another employee number at times.
good,"Home Depot was a fun place to work but they really don't pay their employees an adequate wage for the labor involved.  Additionally, there are ""rules"" about two person lift, etc., but they don't schedule adequate help to ensure there are indeed two people in the area to actually help each other lift product."
good,"Working at the Home Depot is fun. The environment is diverse and the hours are flexible. However, they are not giving enough hours  for the part time associates."
good,"The Home depot is a great place to work for, but very competitive as far as career advancement. Is really who you know, not what you know. Hourly pay is very low for the type of work we deal with on a daily basis at the contact center. Overall peers are friendly, and leadership is understating."
good,"Was a job to hold me over during school. Very flexible with my class schedule. Some mangers were cool, some were not. Big emphasis on cross training in other departments. Easy to advance if you want to."
good,My dept head was understanding fair and easy to approach.safty is very important constant safety standards applied daily stretch and flex before starting work.
good,I would like to say the company overall is a good company.  The location that you work at may or may not be busy considering where the location your at.  I worked at a very busy location and it was one of the top locations in San Diego.  Overall if you like tools and home improvement then this is the place for you!
good,Home Depot is a great place to work part-time while going to school or while in between jobs. I would advise getting a full-time position if you enjoy working there asap because they are rather competitive.
good,"The Home Depot was very fair place to work. The daytime management was a gem, night shift supervisor was a little overbearing. The Home Depot helped to teach me how to operate various equipment such as tow motors, reach trucks, and order pickers. The job wasn't difficult to figure out, but was physically strenuous and could get dirty at times. All the people I worked with were pretty energetic and friendly. The most enjoyable part of the job was the process of learning new things but after a few months in, it became very repetitive."
good,Home Depot itself is a wonderful place for families to shop for all house needs. The employees are willing to help other employees and customers no matter the request.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the day was going home. The coworkers are cool and good people, the work load is worth more than the $12.00/hr they are paying."
good,"Very low hours weekly. You do learn about the many products sold there. Shifts were inconsistent, was always different. Everyone gets to know each other really well and easy."
good,"The job can change as managers move around. You have choices of half hour or a full hour for lunch.  You also have 401k, health insurance if your full time."
good,"Home Depot is a great company if you starting out. But it doesn’t allow you to cross train so you evolve or move up the to better opportunities. This job is a good job, but not for everyone if you are looking for something more."
good,Overall a good place to work.Just never enough help in the departments when needed.System was never accurate with the on hand counts in stock.Great co workers.
good,"Good co workers but, supervisors talk about people behind their back. I stocked the shelf and rotated stock. i loaded and unloaded the trucks, plus filling empty stock."
good,"Had a lot too learn from our manager."
good,"There were times when I really enjoyed working at the Home Depot. I worked in the Garden Department, so I got to spend a lot of time outdoors, being active and getting to talk with different people and customers. But eventually those days started to get outweighed by the overly mentally and physically exhausting days due to the store being so extremely busy and very understaffed."
good,Home depot is a good place to work if one is looking to pursue a career in the industrial market. It's a very fast pace environment and good benefits are in place for employees.
good,I met some really great folks and learned a ton about home improvement and tools.  My biggest qualm was that there were a lot of really lazy folks who held the same role and somehow would get promoted when they should really be fired.
good,"I have enjoyed my time at The Home Depot, and where I was in my life and family situation it was the perfect job. I have reached a point in my career where I would like a more challenging position with more responsibility. I have run 4 different departments over the last few years and I am very satisfied with what I have achieved."
good,"Very quick paced job is A good job for someone's first real job, low pay don't expect to live comfortable on a part time job. You can only go full time after working part time for awhile."
good,"Its a nice place to work."
good,"Day to day was normal, about as stressful as any other job.  However if you need any sort of help that doesn't fall within corporate's strict guidelines, you're on your own."
good,Lots of advancement at right store.Is a great company if u have good training you can get far.Knowing a little about the department they place you in will help you move farther along.
good,"Learned quite a few different skill sets while at home depot. The freight team was very comfortable to work with. Excellent supervisor, always looked out for everyone else on the team. Everyone was a team player."
good,Never thought I would be working retail but I must say I like it. After 20+ years as a mechanic. Its really not a bad place to work. The Pay could be be better...
good,Overall a good work place....lacked at times enough associates on the floor to help in all dept.  Constantly pulled out of my own department to help customers in other locations.
good,"There were really nice people. Although i really enjoyed everyone there, some people made it really stressful when it didn’t need to be. It was really easy and fun sometimes."
good,The big win for Home Depot is the diverse workplace. The company strives and preaches diversity as well as community involvement through various company initiatives.
good,"Everyday as soon as you entered work you already had something to do. And not only was there always work, depending if you were either in lot attendant or inside working, customers always needed some type of assistance."
good,"Working at the Home Depot can at times be very fast paced. It slows down during other periods such as time of day, weekday and season. Pay for a regular employee are at or below average ($12.00 minimum wage). Only ASM's get paid well, ie: $56,000 +, in addition to a bonus every six months.  Benefits are great. Company matching 4% on 401K, options for all-around health benefits. Career progression depends on hard work, 110% commitment to company and time spent at the company. Favoritism does play a role in some degree. "
good,"- I had to talk to customers everyday"
good,Home Depot was a good place to work.  The people are great and the environment is safe and lively.  I would suggest Home depot only if you are willing to work hard and do a lot for not a lot of money.
good,Great first job and place of opportunities for anyone to acquire skills of all kinds. If your willing to work hard then this could be the place for you
good,I woule love to go full time but that hasnt been brought up even tho i have applied a few times.i like mybjob and the people Nd am learning something new every day .it can be busy and other days slow but steady
good,My job was a set schedule.  You do have room to advance.  The pay was not a living wage which is why there is a big turnover rate.  Most anyone working there had another pay from somewhere.  Benefits were ok.  Bonuses were based off of sales in that store not on the amount of work you actually put in.   Raises are based on a review but it still was only a 2-4% which is only coins unless you've been there 10+ years.
good,necessity to multitask and help all customers coming in. dealing with truck rentals and validating id and insurance cards. a day at work looks like some strecthing in the morning since i will be lifting things all day
good,Great place to work if you are young. The benefits package is great there is no overtime available. The environment is fast paced and the pay could be better.
good,"I currently work at home depot and the hours were perfect, but the advancement opportunities are a bit flawed. Management is friendly. They say they have an open door policy but it doesn't support your anonymity."
good,A typical day of work consists of helping many customers find what they are looking for and loading heavy objects onto peoples trucks. You a rarely get the weekend off but if your cool with the store head manager he will give you those days off.
good,"I learned a lot about safety."
good,"I worked overnight freight at this location during the summer of my junior year of high school, and returned after my first year of college. The work environment was fun people were easy going and hard workers, it was an enjoyable experience."
good,Good environment and safe place to work and ok benefits easy location to find ; fair management ok employees nice break areas guard gate watch parking
good,"Home depot was a fun place to make life lasting friends, and I advanced quickly from lot associate to tool rental, learned to drive a reach truck and how to use construction tools. But the salary and the hours were not that great. Sometimes 4 hours per week in winter as Part-time."
good,"Making sure that all departments are up to standards. Taking care of customers and teach train and develop employees."
good,"Overall good place to work, can be very stressing at times because of needy customers. Didn't know much about home improvements and left the company with a lot of knowledge on easy fixes and do-it-yourself projects."
good,"To find qualified associates willing to work for the starting pay. When you find legitimate applicants, they only stay until they find another job that pays more."
good,"This is the kind of workplace that is more interested in people who know how to ""fake it 'til you make it"" than anyone offering actual hard work and dedication to their position. Basically, be the manager's pet and all of your Home Depot dreams will be realized..... In about 10 years."
good,"The Home Depot employed experts and amateurs alike. While I was not in a specialty department, I knew a lot of those who were to a personal level and can still say that some have continued to be my friends into today. The day for me started at 5:45 A.M, those who opened would attend the morning meeting, going over the goals the store had for the day and the week. Aside from a few instances, the rest of the day would be helping the customers. Whether that includes helping them find an item, giving them advice on a product, ringing them up or offering loading assistance. My day would end at 2:30 P.M, and most days were similar to this."
good,I believe this is a good job for college students who live at home. Very demanding as far as hours. Management is okay. The front is the best department in my opinion.
good,Driving a forklift is fun but anything can happen you have to keep your eye out for others and always beep your horn to tell others you are around so they can watch out
good,"The best part of coming to work is the associates I work with. They are always willing to teach me and i'm always willing to learn. The most difficult hurdle isn't the customers (funny right?), its the management as they sometimes set unrealistic standards for associates to meet. They have ZERO idea how certain things are done and are usually slow to reward associates who excel"
good,"As a corporation, their focus can be summed up in one word, profits. They will pay as little as possible to have employees. They keep as little coverage as possible which leads towards overworked and stressed employees, at least among the ones that care about taking care of people and the success of the company. They do offer great benefits but at the pay grade offered they become almost irrelevant, as copays and employee shares of those costs are not supported with a living wage. A great place to work if you love people and don't need to make your own living. They promote many great values which do exist on the micro level, such as customers first and taking care of each other. But there is a mismatch between the corporation wants for more profitability and the realities of how to grow customer satisfaction and loyalty and the needs of their employees. They encourage the idea of taking care of each other and though many of the employees strive to take care of the company by providing excellent customer service and growing the company, the company does not reciprocate that care with a living wage or a manageable work load. I would only recommend working there to someone who needs a stepping stone to something better or to someone who just wants to stay active without the need to provide money to live on."
good,"Overall, I had a good working experience with this company and was able to learn from my peers.  I had pride in my employment there and was able to assist my customers with confidence and pride.  I am confident in my skills and my ability to relate with customers."
good,overall was a good job to learn how the industry works and to get working experience for a student or young adult. could use more improvement with employment
good,Rewarding work good management safe work environment friendly employees good benefits fair wages room for advancement 401K Healthcare friendly customers ability to to learn daily.
good,"While I worked here it seemed as though the employees were not really important to the store. If you went to the hospital like I did for life threatening problems, expect to loose your job."
good,"Overworked and underpaid for my position with no room for growth and development. I was stuck at a low level management position with no support, guidance, or training."
good,I worked at Home Depot for 2 years.  I really enjoyed building relationships with the customer base.  The opportunity for advancement was one of the great things about this job due to the fact that there are Home Depots in every big city in America.
good,"At the home depot there are some decent benefits, and opportunities for growth, as well as much exposure to a variety handy tools and home and builders equipment which I find reliable to know going through life."
good,Good job. Pay wasn't exactly fair for the work required. I put on about 20 lbs of muscle before they changed the rules on how to do the job. The management would bend over backward for me though.
good,"Just mediocre, need it for paying your bills, hoping you'll move on from it soon. Mostly consists in standing on your feet all day long on a cement floor and walking up and down the aisles, up and down the ladder to get stock down and answering interminable questions."
good,it was a place that worked with the college kids on their schedules so they could work a decide shift. meet a bunch of contractors and people that were nice.
good,Not the best but ok for high schoolers. Wish it was better pay but oh well. Manager is okay. Associates AkwYs call off. Don’t give out any good hours.
good,"When busy this job can be very tough because of the amount of people that need help, the mess that needs to be cleaned up, and the safety regulations that need to be met when working with heavy equipment."
good,"I have been over 7 years with Home Depot and the experience at the store level was amazing, benefits are great and most managers are excellent, I started as an associate and made my way to supervisor, moved to the Head Office where I encountered an environment filled with politics and lack of support to supervisor level leadership specialy fro HR, they where focused on making the best for associates that had the potential to complaint, and the ones that where quiet and always ""took the beating"" where hold accountable much more, and this goes for the supervisor level as well, it definitely felt as mediocre People are being taken care of just to save some conflict."
good,I made the best of being able to learn the store and move up in the company. Not being able to have whole weekends off made it difficult to make it to many family events and outings.
good,"* A comfortable working environment with very friendly colleagues."
good,"I learned about management and about associates. Workplace culture is a low. It seems to me noone sit in training courses, but me. Beause of low recruiting experience. As it is receiving place is very dusty. That is bad for the health."
good,The Management at Home Depot especially the HR is very supportive of employees. The environment is a typical retail environment. People who work there are very helpful and friendly. But the varied shifts and hours can be tiring.
good,home depot was a great place to work for before the new management then it went downhill pay was ok for the age i was but needed more money after time
good,"there where shifts were i was sitting at a register for 30 minutes with no customers, other shifts where it was hard to get a break, it was never determined. my managers all seemed too busy, i sometimes had to call them multiple times to remind them on simple task, but they were friendly. the hardest part of the job was them throwing me out there with no tour of the store, it was hard for me to point customers in the right direction. i mostly learned from taking new routes to the break room every day. They seemed to not care as much about little things, but when i came to them about a serious situation in the work place, they showed more attention then I'm use to. walking me to my car for protection, adjusting my schedule and breaks to keep me away, and even try relocating me to a store closer to home."
good,Home Depot used to be one of the higher paying retailers. Not so much any more. Pay Scale the same as everywhere else. Expectations do not equal job requirements.
good,"Home Depot was a good job but at that point in life I needed more stability .  More hours better pay , overall the company is a great place to work . Some days it was very unorganized  One other days it was raining like a well oil machine ."
good,Working for The Home Depot has its good and bad just like most companies. The hours I was given for this company were horrible one can not live of this job
good,"Get to work around some great people and ability to move and learn new things. Opportunity to earn bonuses twice a year.Many learning opportunities. Really flexible hours For part timers. Vacation hours after first year & increases throughout the years. 401k and many other health benefits. Don’t necessarily have to know everything, you learn about every department every day."
good,"They can review you as an improvement needed category, do not schedule you for any category classes or person to person mentoring, and then turn around and terminate you for being no change in improvement needed"
good,Tengo disponibilidad de horarios rolar turnos completos y horas extras
good,The people who work their now are rude and disrespectful and the mangement is terrible and in my opinion I would never tell a friend to work at the Home Depot
good,"Working on this team is hard on the body.  Moving beams, lifting product and walking for five or more miles a night.  Also no benefits for 90 days also means no holiday pay."
good,Home Depot is a great place to shop but i honestly wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is looking for a long time work process or a chance to bump up to the next level. You would think if you work at Home Depot you would be able to get hours and a couple days with 2 days off out the wee to help the store and its customers. When i tried to bump my skills and show that I a responsible enough to be a department manager or something higher the managements and corporate would not even pay me or anyone no mind. The employees you worked with were rude and so were all the managers. I learned a lot from working the register and paint desk. I learn to mix paint and learned how to work the register. My favorite part of the job is mostly helping the customers.
good,"Management is basically non-existent. As long as nothing hits their inbox they don't seem to really care much what you do or how you're doing it. This might be great for some people but if you want to advance and be challenged in your role to further your career or make an impact, this might not be the right organization for you. The company is just too big and too segmented, expect endless worthless conference calls and even more worthless touch-points with whomever you happen to report to."
good,I really liked this job but i didn't have the right transportation access to make it to work. I enjoyed having nice co-workers and I also liked the environment.
good,"I have mixed feelings about Home Depot. I enjoyed the benefits they offered and 401k match. The management in the building really dictated how your job experience would be. In the 12 years I worked there, assistant managers changed often, meaning you start over with establishing your worth to the new supervisor. Often times, it would come right before your yearly review(only review and monetary), or you would get a newly promoted assistant manager or someone new in their position and could not understand their job, and then evaluate your performance on your job"
good,"This is not one of those companies you want to dedicate your entire life to. Management is constantly being moved arround therefor getting a promotion is very difficult. Although you will enjoy the work culture, the is a high spirit for the orange aprons."
good,"Management choose favorites, pay rate is garbage, the paid vacation and bonuses were ok i guess. The knowledge learned from the long timers was actually really awesome"
good,Every day was different because you constantly help different people throughout your normal day. The hardest part was keeping designated area clean. Also i wish the paid senior people who have worked with the company for a long time.
good,"Excellent  interaction with customers.  Coworkers always helping each other.  The company always takes care of their employees. , with various funds to help their plans."
good,"My overall view how you fit in with people and recognize their values. I went from a high paying position to an hourly support. My personal value was too see my fellow workers on the same playing field. "
good,Typical overnight freight work. bad management. hardest part of the job is watching coworks stand around and watch you work hard and get away with it.
good,"it was a good place to work, however the advancement to move up in the company was not there. You always did not get credit for the job and or sales that you brought to the company"
good,"friendly environment, the job is easy to learn many people willing to help, unfortunately there is poor pay. The benefits are not great either but overall it was a good experience."
good,"My typical workday included cashiering while rotating departments, greeting customers with most friendly attitude & helpful assisting their product needs. I enjoyed the atmosphere & meeting many folks!"
good,"This place is great for advancement! If you start out young, like I did, you feel like the store holds you to higher standards, which is an amazing experience. Although, the store doesn't hold up to their own rules with customers. "
good,"The Home Depot was honestly a nice place to work at. All the workers there are young which makes it enjoyable. The work is fast paced, you’re always helping people and you grow on knowledge of all sorts of things!"
good,Busy and fun place to work. Good teamwork makes things much nicer. Like most retailers a better wage and benefit package would help.There are many advancement  possibilities.
good,hours were good when the store did well. Benefits were ok if you could afford through the company.  The last manager I worked with did a better job than the previous two. I would reapply for part-time only.
good,"I worked the Graveyard shift for the freight team, and to be honest this was just not a good idea for me. I learned a lot about simply working through your shift, even if you are not feeling the best, and how a good manager can make even the most miserable of jobs that much better. Everyone was as nice as they could be for working in the middle of the night, but that was about it. The hardest part of the job was getting their in the evening and trying to stay motivated until 6 in the morning. The most enjoyable part of the job was the occasional night where everything just seemed to flow well."
good,Its fun for young people. You meet fun persons. Good schedules if you hustle. Management is good. Customer service is all in this store. Stay positive.
good,"The HOME DEPOT was a good job, for the most part. My hours were limited and the restrictions on part time employees are very stricked. It was obvious that managment (assistant manager and above) were getting paid a large majority of the money. It was very discouraging to realized the amount of time is needed to advance in the company."
good,Home depot a été une école pour apprendre à donner un bon service client.
good,"Home Depot is a company with rich culture and heritage.  They take pride in their work and have great employee development program.  However, salaries during my time there were not competitive with the surrounding market."
good,Decent place to work. If you are looking for a decent part time job I would highly recommend The Home Depot. Everyone was friendly at the location I worked and the job was fun overall.
good,"A typical day a work would include breaks, occasional awards, yet the day required energetic skills, board familiarization of mechanics skills, and a fair attitude. To me it was an enjoyable environment with occasional hurdles and I wouldn't mind working there again."
good,"Working here is fun and overall a good experience, but the higher ups usually aren't as interactive with the employees as I think they should be. But the employees were very close knit and spent plenty of time outside of work."
good,I really loved working with all the associates at The Home Depot. The problem was MGMT. reduced the Associates in each Department. And it was getting Increasingly Difficult to Help All The Customers being under staffed. I enjoyed Finding the right Products and Enabling The Customers To Start and Finish There DIY Projects.
good,"Helping the customers with all of there needs in all departments because they isn't enough help"
good,"My position was Lot Associate but within a week I was a wild card. My position was still in the lot but the manager asked to help on the inside. Before you know it I was working in the lot and helping the paint department. "
good,I liked my job but didn't like the overall management team. They expect you to go above and beyond but give u no support. Not enough people on the floor and no direction.
good,"Best of times, worst of times.  Employee lunches,summer picnic,and ,holiday party.  Enhanced break room with TV, games, ice machine,and charging station."
good,Hardest part of the job would be if you are unaware of the items sold in each department. Most customers expect employees to know everything in the store.
good,"excellent store level management team. employees are pleasant and engaged. good working conditions, and sufficient wages. would recommend this store for any position"
good,"The people you work WITH is what keeps you going, opposed to the people you work FOR who make the job all the more dreadful. As a latino american i experienced way too much racism from such a big corporation."
good,Poor management was hard to deal with. The company as a whole took great care of the employees. Advancement opportunities are available if you are willing to wait for it
good,"Helped customers with flooring and wall paint, colors, etc."
good,"You get to work with a great group of diverse people. Customers are the same, although there are always the difficult ones. Co-workers are friendly and usually help answer any questions."
good,"The company is always having some type of food gathering. They have a relaxation room, ping pong table, air hockey, and video arcade games as well as tvs to watch during your break and public wifi to use. There isn't enough access to personal leave when an emergency arises such as a sick child or something of that nature."
good,Sometimes the lack of management to properly assist and communicate was frustrating. Among our co workers we always worked as a team and that was the best part of the job. We were handed much knowledge and that was helpful. The pay lacked in our knowledge and skills as minimum wage went up. It was difficult to get full time and move forward.
good,The role of a Department Head at Home Depot required a total commitment with very little compensation.  The wage paid for a full time person was $13 per hour.
good,Culture Is Customer Oriented but never enough employees to make that happen. Part time employees are over worked and unable to help as needed. Friendly atmosphere during slow periods.
good,Home depot is a great company to for work for.they treats everyone with respect. and they also help you with almost anything if you needed help home depot is there for you.
good,"Home depot is a fast pace environment, you must provide great customer service and tackle on different problems. While working at home depot I learn different departments that help me excel in my everyday life. The culture at home depot is very family orientated  they care about the associates from food, events, and money back, its a great company to work for."
good,"A typical retail environment.  Inconsistent schedules, too few hours.  The schedules are all over the place:  open one day, close the next, then a mid shift or two. Its almost impossible to move out of part time and into full time."
good,"although many employees worked at the same location, the management team had implemented a great business model where life and work balance were handled perfectly, moreover, the team culture was really great."
good,"management was good"
good,most of you experience here depends on your supervisors and managers. if you have a good store the job is great if you don't good luck very mixed reviews from everyone i worked with.
good,Great atmosphere.  Awesome employees.  Good management.  My biggest problem was the inability to get enough hours.  Can't feed a family on 8-24 hours a week.
good,Have great overall focus to customer care but feel they have lost touch with employees satisfaction.  Since new ceo started no consistency in management to follow   Through the years benefit declined
good,Pays more then minimum wage and always worked around my school schedule. Management was always behind me and very supportive. Personal experience greatly depends on management.
good,You must be able to adjust to change. I would prefer not to leave a review. My goal is to look for employment opportunities with other companies. So it seems pointless to be forced to leave a review
good,"I was not happy at Home Dept. No recognition. "
good,I started as a cashier and ended up being full time in cash office.  There is room for advancement there.  Hardest  part with my job was you never knew when you could leave.  Any issue with equipment usually meant no leaving without it being resolved.  Best part was worked with some great people.
good,home depot is a very fast high maintains environment. you need to be up to date with policies and everything else involving customer order and vendors hours policies and companies rules.
good,"I am a part time worker at home depot but was will receive full time hours if management know you are a hard worker. the work is very simple. I've worked in Garden, flooring and now I'm on the freight team. I've learned each area to their specific needs. how to measure/cut carper and tile. How to drive and operate Hi Lo ."
good,"Working at The Home Depot at first was amazing. But as my stay progressed that initial feeling started to diminish. A multi billion dollar company should be paying employees way more, with free benefits, and actual discounts that truly help and aren't hidden to the point where  it discourages employees to even utilize them. I personally wouldn't mind the cancellation of monthly safety parties, stupid useless gifts, and my part time hours not being cut. If I could just see more money hourly and more hours I wouldn't need any of that. After all I am there to work not get pampered with stupid gifts and parties. I need money and hours. I have personal obligations and dreams that my time and that money could better be utilized for. Aside from that I couldn't be happier with my supervisor and my MET team."
good,Associates and Management works very hard to provide excellent customer service without the proper recognition and appreciation from the Corporate office in Atlanta.  Big box company at work here.
good,Fun co-workers to work with and very helpful and friendly. Worked with a store for more than 2 years and moved to a different store and worked for only 60 days (do to apartment issues and couldn't find another apartment in time and had to move back home) instead of the minimum of 90 days. Due to this I lost my 2 year working recognition and had to reapply and start from day 1 again instead of continuing to my 3rd year working at Home Depot.
good,The work is fast pace and draining on the body. But the company takes care of their employees. The only downer would be the constant change of the system and how they want us to work.
good,"i have spent two years there and survived seeing people just vanish because they cannot do one job."
good,"I like working there because I stay busy and the day goes by very quickly, also my hours are fixed and I start very early in the morning. My supervisor gives me a lot of responsibilities and Projects. They give awards to people who work hard. The bad part of the job is the salary, you start at the lowest rate possible, there is opportunity to go up the ladder but it takes time. If money is not important then it is a good place to learn many skills."
good,Would come to work and down stock both my departments. Had to get floors cleaned up and grand opening appearance before store opened. Had to manage anywhere from 5-20 associates depending on times of year. Wrote schedule for Team and Myself. Ensured team was performing outstanding customer service and adding on sales to get a higher average ticket. Took my last 2 departments and made a 20% increase in sales vs Last Year.
good,Did not allow creative solutions to problems.  Had to be a written policy or you could not do it.  Not flexible.  fair management.  decent product lines
good,"In my experience with the Home Depot, I learned duties and tasks within several different departments and was trained in each one of those areas.  Relaxed atmosphere; positive work culture and friendly people.  I got to know every employee by name in the store and formed working relationships with many people."
good,Aprendes mucho gracias a que te mueven de departamentos
good,Working at Home Depot made me want to fix my house I love working and I love working with the customers I love learning new things Home Depot is one of the best places to start off parking
good,"Hired as seasonal. Days were hectic and physically active.  You are on your feet the whole time you are scheduled except for your breaks or lunch. Probably the hardest part of the job.  I was kept on and made part-time and placed in a different department. Part-time comes with a couple more benefits which is nice.  My experience - the managers are pretty cool and understanding.  Store manager is fantastic.  If you need help - the support is there for you.  Learned about many products - layout of the store which helps immensely.  Culture is - always take care of the customer first.  Go above and beyond.  Helping people is probably the best part of the job.  Salary would be the disappointing part.   Going from seasonal to part-time to full-time - just more hours - same hourly rate.  Home depot has many benefits to offer which are very good, discounts that are great and has a good work environment."
good,"Loved the people but hours were all over the place. Could close store and then have to be back early in the morning. Sometimes 4 days off in a row. Crazy hours and no livable wage."
good,"Quick paced work place, but can be stressful. Management was a little bit lazy at times and would never really be on the floor helping associates. The pay was good though"
good,"A typical work day was 8 -10 hours. above the job customer service was a must. I learned how to install a water heater, how to mix paint, how to install a ceiling fan. Management was clear in there instruction for the foremost and inspiring. Work culture was clear and concise, customer comes first no matter what. The hardest part of the job was standing/ walking on pavement floors for hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was making new friends with co-workers and knowing i was able to provide for my self and family in all aspects."
good,"Fast pace environment or very slow depending on the location. The managers are hit and miss, some care more than others. The benefits are pretty good and paid vacation is nice."
good,"Home Depot started as the best job I ever wanted management was impressive, everyone was willing to help out. The hardest part was going through the changes where management was not about associates but about only sales. I enjoyed how much I learned and am ready to use it in my future jobs"
good,"I will clock in and see that our department is a mess, and the orders are not completed. Had to pick up other co-workers slack. Since I had been there the longest, I would get lectured. The only thing that made me go to work was the customer service staff."
good,"A typical day would be helping customers find products and make sure they were taken care of. I learned a lot as far as some of the things we sell. The culture is okay. I did make some good friends and most everyone was nice with the few exceptions of maybe 5 or 6 people I encountered on a daily basis. The hardest part was dealing with associates who don't want to do their jobs. Some people were so lazy and got mad when u called them to take care of customers. There is also a huge problem with products being in the wrong spots and an example of that is when customers get mad because they couldn't get a 50 dollar item for 20 dollars.Some of your co-workers also act like their managers and want to be in charge. The most enjoyable part was interacting with associates and some customers. On a good day people spoke when u spoke to them, you helped them with their need and they thanked you when leaving. It's not the worst job but not something long term unless you move up to management level."
good,"Low salary, play favorites, not everyone treated equally,most employees say what they will do or not do, so brunt of work gets pasted on. No room for advancement opportunities as much as you would think."
good,"customers yelling at you, getting upset cause you dont speak spanish. you try to help them but the always know best and there always right, even if we sell what there looking for."
good,"You work with a lot of fun people, and there is opportunity for career advancement. Pay is pretty good depending on your experience. Hours are really flexible for part time,"
good,Learned many things but learned more about customer relations more than anything there. They give you the chance to move around the store and they promote cross-training.
good,I  loved working for home depot for the first time I felt like I fit in a very good work place. loved the people they make you feel like family and very helpful.
good,HR takes care of employees but Management could care less. No room for error. Expect fast pace environment with an exceeded level of multi tasking. Don't work here if you can't work fast.
good,Schneider Trucking is contracted through Home Depot. Terrible Logistics. Bad management. I can't even begin to tell you how miserable the drivers are working for them. Everybody tells you a lie about having holidays off. You get two days off a year Christmas and Thanksgiving.
good,"A typical day at work was working in returns/customer service. I would assist them with returns or exchanges. I would try to resolve their complaints, greet customers, and offer my assistance. Working at the Home depot I learned alot about plumbing, flooring, electrical, and many other home project materials. The job was not quite challenging, it was repetitive which helped me better familiarize myself with the materials we sold. The best part of working in retail was getting to know different people and being able to see them leave our store pleased and with a smile on their face."
good,"my team works overnights from 8:00 p.m. until 6:30 a.m. we reset and merchandise new products.  "
good,"I saw this company change drastically over the years. It went from a fun place to work, almost to a slave to the dollar of some sorts. They preach Customer service but the number 1 customer should start with your associates. Major culture change when Bernie left."
good,Company was extremely high priced but still a good value. Large company to backup products and services. Must be dedicated and able to work 60+ hours minimum.
good,Fulfilling work orders at a quick-paced time. Learning how to drive different machines in the warehouse in order to better my skills in the work environment.
good,It was a much laid back job that required little skill. This particular job was the second job most employees had. Management could use some work but over all they were there to help you when you needed.
good,"I think this is a good place to work because no two days are alike.  You get to work with a great diversity of people.  The company does a pretty good job of giving recognition to its employees.  I wanted to leave though because of health concerns.  I have a lot of allergies and a totally clean environment was almost impossible to keep. Just think of all the pollen in the garden section, the lawn chemicals, the carpet filaments, the wood dust, etc."
good,"Home Depot can be a laid back workplace, especially for college students, they're very flexible and can be understanding, the pay isn't bad either, but it can be difficult to move up"
good,"As a merchandiser I feel is if the pay should be better. The career advancement isn't very good, they don't really care to choose to move people in the store and give them a chance."
good,Good Job Physically & somewhat mentally. I enjoyed the chances to improve and better myself as-well-as the company. It brings along good experience and pays well. Wonderful customer service & training courses.
good,"The Home Depot was a good job the time I was there. If I would have stayed longer I could have probably made it into a career. It was an overall good experience, I thought."
good,"•         My typical day at work:  Because I was flexible with the work schedules, my typical day started early from 6 a.m. to 12 p.m.   My flexible schedule included weekends and holidays.  I was trained for various responsibilities, and would be assigned to a specific location once I arrived at work."
good,"The Home Depot is a good company for a person starting out a new career. There is opportunity within the store to work in many different areas: sales, merchandising, and operations."
good,"I go in at 4 in the morning and break down pallets and then work the freight. I have become very knowledgeable about construction. I probably only see my manager once a week. people who work their are pretty easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job would be getting days off that you need and raises. expect 10 cents on your review raise, if you get lucky. the most enjoyable thing is the set schedule of Monday through Friday."
good,Easy work place you meet a lot of people physically not to demanding. Very  low pay No overtime. There is plenty of room for moving up or promotion. If you're set on retail life.
good,Great company to work for very stable. Not good unless you plan on becoming a manager. Raises can be slim if you aren't promoting yourself... job security is high
good,I enjoyed working with my customers and educating them on anything that may have needed and how to use a certain product. The staff for the most part worked as a team and would help other associates with customers needs.
good,My schedule is set everyday along with breaks and lunch.  The day starts with a group stretch and assigned duties.  The majority of my day is unsupervised and I am allowed to work at my own pace.  The most unsatisfying part of the job is the expectation to speed through a bay instead of properly servicing it and the best part of the job is servicing a bay completely and to my own satisfaction regardless of how long or difficult the job may be.
good,"The managers were very nice and understanding, they train you well before you get onto the floor and keep training you while on the job through out the day and time you are there."
good,Work with great people and management seems to care for employees. Offers benefits packages paid holidays and sick days. Schedule constantly changes making it difficult to maintain a routine lifestyle
good,"They both start with L. One fails and the entire institution is doomed for collapse. "
good,"A normal day would include clocking in and cleaning up the receiving area to prepare for unloading the truck, then unload a 1500 to 2000 piece truck then afterword stageing all the incoming freight  to the floor. Once all freight is on the floor my unload team then either packs out freight from the floor to assist the overnight team or packs down freight from the overhead bays to the floor. Lastly on occasion i assist customers in finding what they need on the store floor."
good,"A typical day on the job would be fast pace and making sure the customers were happy pleased with their service we provided. i learned how to provide great customer service. I also learned that i like working in a fast pace, being around people and making them smile. The management was great i really got to know them and know how they work on a typical day. When you work for home depot you live the orange life. when  you shop at home depot you are treated like family whether you are an associate or a customer. At home depot you work as a team to make sure very customer has a great shopping experience with finding what they need to work on a project or if you have any questions about a product. I did not find any hard parts of the job I loved learning new things everyday. Making the customers happy would be the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,I worked in many different departments as a sales associate to be very versatile and an asset to my store. We were often shorthanded and I was constantly running all over the store assisting customers. I proved myself to move up in the company but was overpassed due to favoritism.
good,"One of the better companies to work for. Some undesirable positions, but for the most part an enjoyable place to work. Management actually cares about your input and your opinion. Plenty of training provided and also many ways to keep busy when work is slow."
good,I work as a cashier. The day is very simple. I assist the customers with their items and I keep my space clean. The management could be improved but the culture is good.
good,"There was a very relaxed atmosphere, everyone got along, there wasn't ever any drama. "
good,"Very good customer service required"
good,This company has stability it does offer benefits and sometimes is family oriented. Definitely is a hard labor job. Does have the option for overtime and weekends off
good,"Good pay and schedule towards the end of my career, but it took almost 2 decades to get there. Little to no recognition. Two-faced supervisor and no management presence unless absolutely necessary. I loved my co-workers, they made it pleasant as much as possible. Most of the customers were mentally ill, impatient, prejudiced and/or assuming, as well as intrusive. Retail is not for the faint of heart, and Home Depot is definitely no exception. It's amazing how many people disrespect people for wearing an orange apron."
good,not bad can't complain too much.  good for a part-time or a temporary employment to get yourself on your feet.  used a transitionary employment until better opportunity
good,"I enjoyed my time working for Home Depot. The employees were awesome. Although I was only part time, my time was well spent learning something new everyday."
good,This is a great place to work if you are willing to play the political games it takes to advance. Great people and management use to be some of the best around.
good,"To go from part time to full time a vacancy must happen.  ! person covering 7 isles invites pilfering.  Phone system is good but complicated and no pre training for use, so it's OJT.  Printing a label by phone and walk half way across the store to get it and return.  Hechinger's 25 years ago had a small belt ridden printer so, print and use, no unnecessary travel."
good,The most hardest part working for Home Depot was closing because you be by yourself collected all the katrs from the parking lot because you be by yourself only one person always closed sometime the supervisors in the cashiers would have to come out and help you.
good,"no review,  The company is well stablished. great benefits for their worker , the pay is reasonable. and you get a store discount."
good,"HATED working here. I had the worst training and hours fluctuated to much. They would change your schedule and not tell you but you'd get an occurrence for being late all because they wouldn't call you to let you know they changed your schedule. And, the employee was responsible for proving that the schedule was changed."
good,"I like the company and what they stand. wish I could have retired with them. But like life you have some people who always give you a fight, break your back and save theirs"
good,It was nice for the time i worked. I learned building trades while there and was employee of the month over 5 times. the environment was very busy and unorganized but the people was great.
good,"For the most part it is a good job. Usually very understaffed for the amount of customers and the work you have to get done."
good,"Overall it was a pretty good company to work for, definitely takes care of its employees. I left because there was too much drama, nothing was resolved with a particular coworker, management just turned the other eye."
good,while working with this company I have seen how they treat their workers as well as some of their customers. Your number 1 priority should be the workers because if they are happy they will come to work and make the customers happy. My overall review about upper management sucks
good,"Providing consistent world-class customer service while offering product knowledge and Do-it-yourself projects. Also, operating equipment, using ladders, machines etc.. for merchandise pack down is essential for the job. Never a slow day at the Depot!"
good,"I enjoy working here and appreciate helping the employees. I feel I learn a lot about how to do maintenance work around the house (or office) in general and I get a strong sense of community. However, I feel that working for this company doesn't match up with what I've studied in school. As a cashier at The Home Depot, I doubt I will ever be faced with a challenge requiring my fields of study at the university I attended. It is a great company, the pay rate is considerably generous compared to other employers I've served, but I don't see The Home Depot being part of my long-term future."
good,"Generally Home Depot is a good company- Part time employees benefits. However, the problem is with management employees relationship. It is very poor."
good,A typical day of work would be packing and restocking inventory and helping customers by providing great customer service. I learned much information on the technicalities of electrical products. Management was nice and understanding. Workplace culture had the ability to expand your knowledge by roaming around. The hardest part of the job is not knowing a piece of information. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I get to roam around the store and not limit myself to one area.
good,"It was nice because they are very flexible with your hours. You don't need to know a lot to work there, just be physically abled to lift and place objects."
good,"It is a nice place to work, if you are a full-time student. Like other places, there is room for improvement. However, if you want to move up within the company this is the right choice. Yet, to move up there is a lot of hard work to be done, years!"
good,very up and down type of work.To many different hours and shifts. Worked every weekend. Didnt really care much for it. Being a Merchandiser is great for Me.
good,"the learning was around home improvement and how to build and create new projects with the customer"
good,"I had a rough time with the management and scheduling. It was still organized and the district I was at was the top 5 in the state of Georgia. It was difficult dealing with customers the first few month, but it is easy to learn from other workers. Overall I enjoyed and learned alot."
good,"Their emphasis is on credit card sales. There is a goal set by corporate each week. You are expected to ask 100% of the customers 100% of the time. Everyday it is posted how many cards have been attempted, approved and still needed. People get very feed up since the workers in the department are also asking. Plus announcements are suppose to be made over the intercom by Customer Service every 15 mins. about credit cards. The survey on the bottom is also suppose to be mentioned and circled 100% of the time. The very large doors in back get blocked open while trucks are getting unloaded and the very large doors in front often do not stay closed. So you are told to bring hats,coats and fingerless gloves. High turnover-no calls, no shows. Part time. No set schedule, unreliable. "
good,the best way to describe working for home depot is bring plenty of Advil because not only are the customers a headache but the depending on the staff aka the older staff members you will need it and at that point just run. im not saying all the staff are impossible to work with and that dont follow there own rules but expect everyone else to follow them but thats what im saying but luckily there are some gems who you can trust to have your back while working but u haft to find them and trust me its not management or for the cashiers anyone higher then you.
good,"The Home Depot is a great place for hard workers to be recognized to advance and be recognized with rewards.  I have worked here for 8 months now, I started out as a flooring hard side where I would stock product and advise customers.  After 6 months I was promoted to flooring specialist.  If you are looking to work for them be prepared for all kinds of customers.  Its a good feeling to make people happy, but there will be times where you will be yelled at for something that is most likely not your fault that is the downside of the job.  The other thing is that you will most likely be put into a department that you are inexperienced with and you will be expected to learn quickly without much teaching.  In other words you must teach yourself.  They're great to work with your schedule.  If you work hard it will be recognized.  They have benefits like tuition reimbursement if you're in school and success sharing every 6 months where you receive a portion of the stores profit if the store is over the goal."
good,I loved working at the Home Depot the people there are very nice and theres a lot of work in different departments that can make your day go by quicker. The Unfortunate thing is it's pretty much slave work now they pay you next to nothing and expect double the work out of you. If they paid more it wouldnt be a terrible job
good,This company isn't a bad place to work if you get a store with a good team and good managers in place. The pay is decent compared to other companies and the benefits aren't bad.
good,"I have spent over 25 years with this company. I worked from 1988 to 2001, and came back in 2004 til present, for the most part it was a good company who at one time really cared about it's associates."
good,"This was the retail store located in Peachtree City, GA.  I enjoyed working here because I enjoyed the customers.  No day here was the same always different challenges."
good,"These are the things that best describe my experience working at The Home Depot"
good,"My experience with Home Depot's is that it is entirely determined by managerial staff. It can be a great place to work with a lot of benefits and skills to learn, and it can also be frustrating working with certain ""long time"" staff, who have become complacent. Overall, if you're a hard worker, and put your head down, you can do quite well."
good,"A typical day at work consists of retrieving carts,and helping customers load their vehicles. You also can go inside to assist customers finding products."
good,I loved what I did and who I worked with. Everyday there was something going on so I was able to receive a good verity of things to accomplish. Because of all of the lifting I didn't have to go to the gym and got in shape fast. I didn't stay because in my opinion I thought that management was making some bad decisions.
good,The home depot is a good place for students to start out and work while going to school. The company also helps you out and build a career around their company.
good,"A typical day at work consists of leading and directing my Freight associates to work all inbound nightly deliveries to the store (often up to 6 trailers - freight, lumber, cement, dry wall, flowers, soil). A busy store in Calgary, AB, but with very little racking or storage space, the hardest part of the job each night is finding where to place any overstock pallets, or any pallet displays not yet ready to be merchandised on the sales floor (i.e. saving freight for an event). What I've learned with that respect is to plan ahead at the beginning of the night (what older overstock freight might I now be able to pack down into the home location so that I can now put new overstock up into the racking?). Other things I've learned is to make sure to be short and concise with my direction, and not elaborate too much. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a knowledgable and friendly group of associates. The culture is genuinely quite open and friendly amongst all associates on the different shifts. Management usually take the time to listen to any concerns, but at times, it feels like the pressure to perform and achieve the best results may not always produce positive recognition for efforts shown."
good,"Pretty good entry level job. With Home Depot being a fortune 50 company, you would think they would compensate their employees a fair share of the profit but that hasn't been the case in my experience working for the company."
good,"a typical day at work helping customers who have tons of questions about home improvement. you learn be patient, take your time and understand the problem that way you can effectively help the customer. management is present to help with issues with customer service, product issues, and employee problem solving, work place culture knowing your department, keep a smile on your face, being able to help out anywhere needed. the hardest part of the job not being able to be in more than one place at a time, meaning you know that customers need help in other departments but not being able to help them because your helping other customers.the most rewarding part of the job when customers return with great news of how their home improvement job turned out."
good,I received many compliments on my great work but despite the many empty promises it was very apparent I was going nowhere fast. I even had a promotion taken away.
good,"I did not have very many problems working here. When I did have problems, they seemed to go unnoticed. I worked in a department that required two employees on duty at all times. Often times I was working alone, which limited the amount of work I could do, therefore, I was not as productive and I felt like I was not reaching my full potential."
good,"The best part about working for Home Depot is the people. It feels like a family. If you work in the stores, the job is exciting. Every day your doing something different and you'll never be bored. Good place to work. I'd recommend it to anyone."
good,great fast paced environment learned great customer service skills and managerial skills. organized great sales execution  learned to handle customer complaints and much more
good,"Just like any other retail place. In my district advancement happens,  but there is a ceiling. High turnover rate especially for my department (freight), which led to unrealistic expectations from upper management. Great for people that are in school as well, willing to work around school schedule. I believe it's biggest draw is its benefits they offer employees. Hours for part-time employees are lacking, unfortunately."
good,"Decent Job, Decent pay. Doesn't work with my schedule anymore. The customers are the best part of the job. I will truly miss them, and the joy they brought to my job"
good,"Worked in Decor. Learned a lot about flooring and window covering. Liked coworkers. "
good,this is a good job if you like interacting with the general public every day is different nice people to work for they have a knowledgeable staff which comes from promoting from within and hiring people who used to work in the various fields home depot covers.
good,This was seasonal. Great environment to work at if working seasonal. Very friendly and outgoing people. The customers can be a bit much but that's retail.
good,"face to face customer interaction"
good,I walked in and clocked in 5 minuets before my shift. I always took care of necessities such as getting water or going to the bathroom in the extra 5 minuets I gave myself. Then you walk up to the front of the store to the head cashier and they tell you what register to go to.
good,Working at Home Depot I have found myself as an employee that can overcome all obstacles that may come my way. I am committed to achieving and issues good or bad that may come my way.
good,Worked multiple shifts.  Management was well balanced.  Fast paced but still was able to assist customers with issues.  Getting to know the different computer programs was the most difficult.
good,This job had flexibility of schedule which helped me during college. It was my first experience working with retail. Overall it was a great learning experience.
good,satisfactory work schedule environment is okay its a warehouse so sometimes its cold and its sometimes very hot. The job could pay more for what the position entails
good,"it was overall a good job to have. People were great and the atmosphere was fun.  Had to leave because I wanted to continue my education.  Otherwise, I would stay working there."
good,Great work environment!  The associates are wonderful and everyone works well together.  Management is also very good. They are very helpful and knowledgeable. Love dealing with the customers.  Hate working with computers that don't work and are very slow.
good,"Cashing out customers items Collecting returns"
good,"Big company that doesnt want to give their employees a great wage, instead gives meals and other things to make up for the weak wages. would be better to just give us the money"
good,"A typical day at work  consists of mostly bay service, merchandising product, checking on hands of the products, packing down, maintenaning the bays organize and set to the assigned planogram and working on projects. "
good,"The company is undergoing a lot of changes for the IT groups.  It is a hit or miss whether you will be in a group that will have you pigeon holed into doing the same things for x number of years."
good,The home depot I worked for had amazing employees. The employees is what made the customer service portion bearable. Decent pay and excellent benefits for part time and full time employees.
good,Hard work was not really acknowledged here but the employees were great people to work with. Training was decent but didn't really help when we were on the work floor.
good,"The company doesn't have the best pay, but it does have great benefits, a good atmosphere to work in as long as you don't mind the corporate structure. Company has great training and has safety as a top priority."
good,"The company is an okay place to work. Depending on what department you work in there is not a great opportunity for growth, the people who work there are nice but sometimes the management is questionable. The benefits are pretty good but expensive. The pay could be better in some departments."
good,I personally didnt like working there because i would constantly have shifts alone and would get yelled at when i would take too long helping other customers
good,good place to work If you want to live at work the company was great before it was acquired by the home depot now its a corporate mess
good,"I loved my job there ,but the management write people up instead of hearing what the employee is saying and try to fix it. A great place to work if you want to hide your head in the sand. Overall the people I worked with were great and the benefits great."
good,This place was ok. The management wasn't the best and the managers continued to change but that always made things a little more interesting. They people that work there are all super friendly.
good,"trabajo llevando buena relacion de trabajo con empleados y clientes"
good,Average corporate retail environment. understaffed at times which makes your job difficult to succeed. you make due with what you have
good,fun interacting with many different people an educating them on health needs to improve on schedules not a bad lace to start for your first job most enjoyable thing was the people
good,Home Depot was a great company to work for. It is very easy to move up in the company and the company also gave us quarterly bonuses.
good,"Very fast paced, especially on the weekends. Consistently moving and staying busy whether helping coworkers, customers or stocking shelfs."
good,its ok for a first job unless you happy in one position  without the chance to grow within company. over all its not to bad just wasn't a good fit for me
good,A typical day here normally consists of coming to work at 5 in the morning. You start your shift with a meeting with everyone on your shift. Once that's finished you head to your assigned department and start working
good,"management is very good at times whilst other times they could use a little reform, especially involving customer issues and conflicts,"
good,I worked in every department I managed several merchandising  departments and several operational departments. I was also a key carrier in Newhartford and Cammilius stores
good,"It was a fun friendly clean work environment, and would work there again. The management were very helpful in my training and overseeing my work. It was one supervisor there that always smiled and made me feel good about coming to work."
good,My first entry level to management. I grew professionally. I serviced customers and provided customer service. I maintained 3 departments.
good,nice environment treated you like family but too many transitions in 1 year loved it while I was there and wouldn't mind continuing or returning under different management
good,"The Home Depot gives you a feeling of family each and everyday. You work and you learn new and exciting things that has personally help me with my growth as a person and worker. The hardest part of the job is the physical to that the work puts on your body over time with the heavy lifting and the constant different tasked asked of you. My management were like family, really approachable and they made you want to work hard for them."
good,Overall The Home Depot is a good place to work. I usually enjoy working with most of my coworkers and the customers are usually very nice. I will admit that though the hardest things to deal with may also be those same customers previously mentioned.
good,"For almost two two yrs in cw home depot they are gave to me more knowledge, to enhance my personality in comes under pressure."
good,The opportunity for advancement is great and the culture is relaxed. The benefits are nothing to brag about and the PTO/holiday time could be better. You get 6 paid holidays and 10 vacation days for Corporate positions. they match 3.5% to your 5% on 401k. They dont match at all in your first year and you are not allowed to contribute for your first 90 days.
good,"I enjoyed most aspects of the job. The thing I hated was if you ran a register as customer service & you stepped away for any reason at all (ie: answer the phone) & a customer came up before you could step back someone else would jump on your register and ring them out. If they made a mistake or made a customer unhappy your name is the one on the receipt not the person who ran that transaction."
good,Home Depot's pay and hours given to workers seemed a bit unfair but the coworkers/managers were polite and easy to get along with. During my time working there I felt I was in a safe environment surrounded by lots of positive energy and enthusiastic people.
good,"Great fun place to work, compare to other retail stores job. I learned a lot about customer service and I liked the management a lot. Co-workers are friendly, and the hardest part of the job is to be on your foot for a long time."
good,"Could do better with career advancement, there is no advancement for associates due to the management not giving anyone a chance."
good,Company has some good things about it and some bad things about it just like all companies. I believe you they need to listen to their people more and step up their computer operations.
good,Full timers have the option of having a half hour lunch or full hour which affects how many hours you have to work which is nice. They have a lot of employee events such as cook offs and costume contests which make it fun. Management could dress a little more professional. Their computer system is old and outdated which makes for a hard transition when training.
good,"Just like most big companies the Micro-management became a burden.I thoroughly enjoyed working with my last store manager in Yonkers, NY. A good chance for advancement with the management staff in place."
good,"Strong Brand, quality installations, very strong customer service."
good,If you are a young employee trying to find a good place to work wegmans is a very nice first job. They provide a very unique but authentic workplace with employees who are often willing to help
good,i feel like i should of got paid more for the work i was doing. at the time i was on the job i never really got a raise even if i did all i was suppose to and more.
good,At the home depot there is lots of advancement opportunities.  Very thorough training is provided.  Staff are really friendly.
good,Some of my managers like making buddies and those people advanced. The job was fast pace and got me ready to work any where else that is the same.
good,"I honestly don't prefer to work at retail jobs, but if I had to work at one again, I would choose The Home Depot. The hardest part of the job was always being busy and being on your feet for majority of the shift."
good,"I enjoyed my 11 years experience there, I was cashier, sales in flooring & worked paint for most my 11 years... I also work shipping and reviving. Prodesk and service desj"
good,"There is room for moving up although The Home Depot is very organized in how they will give employees full time and higher pay which is fine , but it may take time for some people to get their desired pay and hours."
good,"co-workers are amazing and very friendly, management was ok. hours varied on basically nothing, sometimes you will good week full of hours and sometimes you will get littles hours, not too bad on making sure you get a break every 2 sometimes 4 hours"
good,"i was in sales for 6 years with this company.  I found it that I didnt have much of a life with the hours I had to work, other than that it was an ok place."
good,Worked the nightshift and only dealt with management and coworkers. Management had proffered employees that would get befits while others worked hard.
good,"working for Home Depot is not is easy, but it is fun sometimes. After working for 3 different stores , in some stores, the management sometimes is worse than the employees and they have a lot of privileges that they don't deserve."
good,"puntual"
good,I always got great reviews there.i learned alot from the customers.I was able to teach work in a fast paced environment and wish I worked there again.
good,"I was given the opportunity often to work outside of cashiering, working returns and as Greeter.  I enjoyed working with my coworkers."
good,"As a Head cashier I opened the registers and self check out stations, made sure to rotate cashiers for breaks and lunches. Made cash drops and fixed any issues with cash register equipment. Co-workers could be trying at times but friendly for the most part. The hardest part is holding your tongue with either a co-worker or a customer. The most enjoyable part was meeting all kinds of people while working along with the pot lucks and parties the fun committee would put together to raise money for the Christmas party."
good,good company to work for had many good years with them great company to move up the ranks with great benefits overall the scheduling worked for me and my family
good,I basically check the customers out with their products as quickly as possible and ask if they would like to apply for a credit card. I've learn a lot about the store system and how it works. The management there was really bad they pick favorite on who they are going to fire or keep. They don't keep up on what the employee at least more than half are doing and they don't handle important situations they kind of try to ignore it  the hardest part is asking the same customers we see every day in the small town if they want a credit card then the head cashiers start being rude to employees because of not getting credit they favoritism the cashiers and are rude to majority of them. Enjoyable part is being able to help the customers and meet some mew people as they come in or getting to know the loyal customers that come all the time.
good,"Working in MET is a fun job. Weekends off. Great team to work with. The job pay is below some fast food places and other big box retailers with no employee discounts. Management doesn't stay on top of their associates forcing MET to do their jobs as well as ours. Quite frustrating sometimes. But, hey, weekends off."
good,I enjoyed working at home depot and gaining knowledge of home repair and idea. I enjoyed working with most of the people there and helping customers. I did like being held over when other employees did not do there job. Usually we work as a good team.
good,A typical day at work was making every customer found what they were looking for. I learned how to properly lead customers to what they were searching for. Management was only satisfactory as far as completing their duties. Co-workers were always helpful and formed a good team. Hardest part of the job was making sure every single customer was heading in the right direction. The most enjoyable part was being able to successfully communicate with the customers.
good,"A great group of associates with a willingness to help each other. "
good,"Since it's a non- union facility, they use that against you in many ways. Their turn over rate is a a slow but steady pace when different seasons start."
good,I enjoyed working with both my team and my supervisor. I am a veteran and Home Depot worked very well with any Dr. appointments that I needed to attend.
good,"Good management, improves my customer interaction.Co-workers knowledgeable each associate has knowledge in certain areas and we continue on going training."
good,Not too much thrown at you one time. Really friendly environment to get work done. Store manager would give individual assignments during the month to change store display.
good,Great place to work. The are outstanding and the training you can apply to everyday life. The 8 core values is something a believe every company should apply to their business.
good,i would recommend this job for teens that are looking for cash during the summer and also for older individuals looking for a second job. nothing permanent.
good,"While employed at the Home Depot I worked in 3 different departments, each one a level up from the first. It is very easy and encouraged to move up within the company."
good,"This job i had with The Home Depot, wasn't as i thought. They over looked me for Supervisor Positions until i was put outside as a Pro Loader. I am not to fond of this job."
good,"- Help customers nonstop"
good,"Hires part time with schedule shifting, not steady. Not earning enough  pay or getting enough hours to pay my bills. Team based environment a plus. Very busy atmosphere."
good,Being able to walk into work and help people gives a good feeling. Time seems to move by fast by always being busy.  Having to attend to multiple people at once can be overwhelming at times. Not everyone is understanding under these circumstances. Overall socializing with co-workers and helping each other out makes the job much more doable.
good,I learned many things. My co workers were average.The hardest part of my job was standing in the heat. I enjoyed interacting with customers the most.
good,"Help customer with checking out with their products. Cashiering and running cashier machines and returns or self-checkout. Dealing with customers and making sure they are taken care of. I learned more skills of running cashier and doing returns. Management was nice, co-workers nice. Doing returns was the hardest part and the most enjoyable was dealing with customers."
good,"If you really want a first job (not perm) this is probably one of the best jobs you can get, just to get you off your feet and running."
good,"Customer service department, dealing with customer issues and problems. Can be a fast pace and stressful environment. Requires multi-tasking and answering phone calls."
good,"Home Depot is a large and vast store with many different areas of expertise you can familiarize yourself with for furthering a specific career or your general knowledge of that craft. Of the jobs I've had in the past, Home Depot is the best for recognizing hard work and advancing people to positions that fit their skills. This is a great company to start a career in or to gain experience in a field you wish to pursue."
good,"Its an okay place to work. pays not too bad. just watch out on your hours because they may try to ""cheat"" you..Other than that its not too bad. . relaxed dress code"
good,"The job experience is one of the best I've had. You can work hard and have fun doing it. I came in knowing nothing and now have a base knowledge of most things concerning trade work. However, there's next to no upward mobility, so your pay and raises are always on par with the revolving door entry level workers."
good,Home depot is a good entry level workplace that has good benefits and opportunities for advancement if you are motivated and competent.
good,"Hours are good , get a three week schedule. The people that work there are great! Training program is ok. It can be very hectic at certain times of the year, but you are always busy."
good,The people I worked with were great except for the managers. The managers would pick on a single person at times. The higher up managers would also not give people enough time off even if requested way in advance.
good,"Your day consists of operating your station for 12 hour shifts, doing either pallet building/ fluid load/ forklift operator/ or throwing freight on the line. interesting work, but does get on the repetitive side. pay is great with starting around $13 an hour"
good,"·  Set up floor displays for vendors"
good,"Great job to start out with, while going to school or looking for a career, though i do recommend it as a career choice if you cannot make it into a assistant manager position or higher. benefits are good, pay sucks. over all though not bad if you need a job."
good,Home Depot puts in the effort to recognize associates for their accomplishments more than anywhere else I have been employed.
good,"Great coworkers, very high expectations and accountability. High stress, long hours. They do some fun activities for the associates, at times forget the leadership team."
good,A typical day at work is dealing with stubborn and rude customers.  I learned that  equal opportunity is not true and favoritism is the name of the game.  Management is lousy and managers are lazy. Co workers are fine.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with insensitive managers and rude customers.  The most enjoyable part is when there's a long cue of customers waiting to be checked out.  I enjoy being busy.
good,"The place isn't great unless you're in love with every aspect of retail. It isn't entirely worthy of loathing either. Show up, do the job and try to place and you'll be alright. You might even end up having a good time every now and then."
good,"I have been working there a little over two years.  The job is definitely versatile. Management can do better with its approach toward hard working employees.  I had no customer relations experience, loading, stocking so I walk away with that knowledge. The hardest part of the job is coming in and knowing that I have to wait two weeks for my pay check and still struggle financially.  The hiring process I believe should be more scrutinized.  More intellect, professionalized workers,"
good,"Once The Home Depot Apron (orange) is worn, interaction to customers cannot be avoided. Each customer has a  definite purpose for visiting The Home Depot either he/she has a project to be completed or problems to be solved. Each THD employee must know the materials being sold and their locations and the services offered, so they can be served completely to their satisfaction. Teamwork is one THD culture why it succeeds."
good,"A typical day at Home Depot consisted of me waiting on customers, ringing up their purchases, suggesting that they open a credit card, as well as doing some returns. From working at Home Depot, I learned that I was a customer oriented person, which I had not known. As far as the management, I believe that some enjoyed being there, some just wanted and an advancement. As far as working with co-workers, I found that everyone did not have my best interest at heart. The hardest part of the job to me, was denying a customer's return and finding out that a customer was trying to steal out of the store and having to confront them. Overall I enjoyed working here. I met many people that did work on other people homes as well as people who worked on projects in their own home. I enjoyed helping to make suggestions for certain projects with the customers. I got to network with many people."
good,"Home Depot was always busy I learned a vast knowledge about "
good,"The company gives you the tools to sell. It gives you product knowledge, and teaches you to give open ended questions to help get the customer's needs. I've learned more things then I ever could due to other associates from being on the floor. Everyone is friendly, and helpful though some are distant. The hardest part of the job is lacking respect from the mangers. They only seem to care for those who are following them around daily. What keeps me there isn't just the pay but the people too. I've gained a lot of friends and when one quits or is let go, I shed a tear. There is a lot of down time and fun time too, but its not a career job, which I need."
good,"Home Depot is an interesting company. While the benefits for part timers are great and fellow associates are kind and helpful ( As far as cashiers. Floor associates are a much different story, not all but most can be difficult at times to work with. ). Retail is retail so except it to be such just add a lot more movement and if you are male expect to load the occasionally vehicle with any given materials in the store ( without proper training ). Management plays favorites often so don't be surprised if you take more heat for one mistake while that guy thats been there for a few months barely does his job, is often late, and does nothing but complain about how hard his job is never has a word said to him."
good,Great place to work. Work/Life balance is not good at all. Worked 16-18 hours days on more than a dozen occasions. This put a huge damper on my time spent with my family.
good,"The only disadvantage is at least twice a year, the Home Depot Company will drop your hours based just on seasonal sales."
good,"I was cashier and would come in and basically ring for the day. I always pushed and tried to get more hours but was never allowed to. Management was the best thing about Home Depot, very nice and approachable management. The best breaks and break room. The hardest part of my job was just trying to advance and get more hours and not being able to. The most enjoyable part of my job was management."
good,"As a Department Supervisor, throughout the day we are expected to finish pages of work lists that are continuously being added to. Equipment drivers (forklift, reach truck, order picker) are constantly being pulled in every direction possible. Management has a tendency to be inconsistent with their expectations, there is a lot of miscommunication between ASM's and the Store Manager. Overall, the best part of the day is the people you work with. Everyone gets along nicely, there are a few sticks in the mud but for the most part everyone is friendly."
good,"I usually help customers to load and unload  their marchandises, collect shopping cars and park them in the right place , keep the workplace clean. I learn to deal with many kind of custumer. the management is good and the co-workers are friendly.The  hardest part of the job is to work outside during the winter. The most enjoyable part of the job is to talk with many kind of peoples."
good,i really liked my job loved giving great costumer service being organizaed and clean being responsible and restpectful of others
good,Its a good place for beginners to start and move up. Just depends who and with you work with that the job can be good or may end up bad for you.
good,"Challenging place to be, store always need to be update.  We need to prepare working package for construction.  Home Depot is a big company, many departments.  Oher than work on the drawings, I also need to communicate with different people.  Emails, Phone calls, meetings.  I had a very professional team, we always finish work good and on time."
good,"Good place to work. Cashier, Cashier trainer, Head cashier, Pro-cashier, IMA. Some co-workers were great and some management were great. Met a lot of different people and created some good friends for life."
good,"Fun place to work for and learn new things while working.  You will meet new people of all races, age groups, and different personalities as well. Its a decent job to have and even better as a career if you advance."
good,"I started in Home depot as part time sales associate. I always will keep home depot in my heart, was my first experience here, Great people (coworkers and managers). Due to issues with schedule and conflict with my full time, I had to resign. Still keep contact with my friends there."
good,"In all honesty the only reason I work her is for the people, I find there are lots of games happening. If you are a student it is a good place to work, if you need hours look somewhere else"
good,"Driving the customer experience is the ultimate goal, driving sales with service obtains just that. Competitive with other retailers to be the #1 driven company with both service and sales."
good,"Good work environment, co-workers were awesome when it came to team work, easy to work your way up the ladder towards management."
good,stock shelves learned how to manage workers at a fast pace hardest part of job doing more than one truck a night.I enjoyed the co-workers they were hardworking and not lazy.
good,they have a great company great staff and great management plus they also have a 41k plan and medical benefits also the co-workers are very professional
good,"You can develop and grow here, good for part time job, it depends on the managers and the store is run, some may like it, some may not like it that much."
good,I learn how to use every type of power equipment.  After a few years I was promoted to train new employees on the power equipment.  Enjoyed going to work our team was the reason we all stuck around.  The Department Management was apart of the team.
good,If you've really got no experience or you're looking for an easy place to work home depot is fine. Where I worked my co workers were generally pleasant. Customers though...they can be something else.
good,I liked working in the Home Depot.  Was an amazing place to advance my career.  However as time went on I wanted to advance my career.  And in a big company like that its very hard to move up for some reason.
good,open the store make sure everything is looking good for customers. and as soon as we open the doors its all about customer service and making sure they are satisfied.
good,"Good company to work for, management not the greatest, good benefits. many options in regards to job opportunities. Flexibility is good and can be fun to work there at times."
good,Night shift is ok. its a good job but its really hard to balance life and work with these hours. however its the perfect shift to get your foot in the door with the company and learn how to use lift trucks and how the company works without worrying about customers. very supportive management and a great company to work for as a whole. the job is easy but can also be a work out.
good,worked in inbound as a material handler easy job but was and is very boring overall good job to have management was in and out the door so no job security unfortunately
good,"hardest part of the job is when SAP is down, we support over 180 stores across CANADA that creates backlogs and lots of unsatisfied customers."
good,"I'm working about a six months in a home depot, I like my job, I can visit a lot of people every day. during 6 month I can get the 7 rewards from my supervisor and my manager, actually I'm looking for a full time job."
good,"I greet the customers, ask if they have found everything, scan their items, total the cost, let them know the amount and ask how they will pay or it. If credit explain all the steps, I cash , take the money give back change and say have a good day and thank you for shopping at Home Depot."
good,"As a corporate entity Home Depot is a good company to work for. The ""Glory Days"" of high pay and advancement seem to be over with but the benefits minus the pay are top of the class.  Pay is in line with other retailers now unfortunately when in years past they paid for the knowledge.  The stores are their own entities though in how good or bad they are. totally up to management.  overall, work isn't too tough but often find a lack of support.  some days are monotonous while other days are fast spaced and strenuous which makes for a good balance. sometimes there is not enough help and that seems to be a company wide trend. The opportunity exists to learn a lot, but it is not rewarded with pay or promotions often. Some stores are very stagnant."
good,"Opening and Closing the store, counting down drawers and talking money back to the cash office.  Provided great customer service and learned about products to be more knowledgeable for the customer."
good,"My job wasn't easy all the time but overall, the work was good. I just didn't like the fact that it required third shift employees so I had to adjust and I had a hard time with that. Other than that, it was a decent workplace. Its not my type of job but I would recommend it to others."
good,"no mater how much you give you don't meet their expectations."
good,Good place to work. Got the training needed for position to do job. Management was never around to help. Hard time trying to get help from department for a customer.
good,Culture slowly deteriorating. Management has no idea what they are doing and puts it on DS who also cant do their own jobs and puts in on associates.
good,"Overall I enjoyed working there.  However, I think that people put more emphasis on who you know and look at physical and a lot of brown nosing to be able to move forward."
good,La gente que trabaja en Home Depot es muy entusiasta y con calidad en la atención a clientes
good,Supervise employees in lumber dept. Place orders for lumber and work products. Provide excellent customer service and good supervision
good,It was tough work making sure that all of the freight got put away everyday but I don't  run from hard work so I enjoyed it. I was well respected at the home depot.
good,"It was educational place to work,  learned about different types of power equipment, plumbing, paint.  I also got experience with driving forklifts."
good,"Handling orders for online shoppers, assembling them together before they get to the store. Making sure if I put the order together i would make sure to put it into the computer so it wouldn't get repeated."
good,Depending in which store you work in you will experience different environments with customers. 3 years of experience and there is still so much to learn.
good,Home Depot is a fun place to work. lots of good people there. working with the public. helping them plan and work on there do it yourself projects
good,Fun work place with supportive management not all about the number but how you personally grow and develop.But this is expected of a big company.
good,"The Home Depot is a great place to work. They have worked with me in helping me learn a department that I knew nothing about. I work in the plumbing department, and my fellow associates have made me more comfortable and knowledgeable about my department. I am able to assist customers with confidence. The hardest part of the job, is when I have a customer that I am not able to help, because of something that I am not sure of. Still I get the information that is needed and the customer is satisfied."
good,Working at Home Depot is overall good but it can be stressful at times. Stores are often understaffed and make the small amount of employees do as many things as possible. Also you have to be there many years to advance to a management position
good,"A typical day would include making myself available to our customers upon arrival, assessing the physical condition of the store and, more specifically, my department, and prioritizing tasks to make the most efficient use of time. A days work would include checking returns, down stocking, operating forklifts, maintaining an organized and clean department with the help and coordination of coworkers and management. We focused on keeping it as enjoyable as possible, getting the job done efficiently, and helping our customers complete their projects. My daily interaction with customers was certainly the most enjoyable part of my job. Many times customers wrote to the corporate offices, or the  store, stating they had achieved better than expected results with the help and advise that I had given. I found that to be very satisfying. "
good,"Working at the home depot has a very positive experience for me allowing me to learn and work with a great people. Management can not get any better, positive attitudes all around. The downside was that the amount of hours worked a week rarely met my needs. Job security is an issue."
good,"Extremely cliquish. You could do no wrong if management liked you. I was invited to many work meetings where awards were handed out to the same 6 to 8 people over and over again by the managerial team. Mulitple times lower managment awarded upper management for a job well done and people I felt were harder workers were overlooked because they weren't as social. Obvious safety and workplace violations were overlooked in favor of personal bias. My starting supervisor was terrible but well liked so he got promoted to a department where supervision was less crucial. I didn't even know who my manager was until a week before they fired me. Otherwise the job was great, consistent work and friendly coworkers; lots of opportunities to learn new things. Would work here again."
good,"•	Improved business results by developing and providing excellent customer service using marketing principles to resolve customer inquiries and complaint.  "
good,"Fast paced work environment, there is room for growth if your very aggressive with great job culture. (Birthday cakes, Holiday events, BBQ's)"
good,Good place to work but not much room for improvement.Would rate better if it was closer related to my field. Other than that people are great.
good,A typical day at work includes running around fixing customer problems. I enjoy my coworkers as most of them I have worked with for many years and we are like a family. The hardest part of my job is when I have to tell customers their special orders are delayed or damaged.
good,"Compensation = terrible. Benefits = great."
good,I found the pay very little for what i was expected to do.  Most of the employee's during the day don't do anything more than walk around and talk to customers.  All us freight workers at night are made to do all the hard work and heavy lifting and almost never get to leave on time.  All in all though it wasn't a bad job.
good,I am still friends with several of my coworkers.  The location was a little slow paced and sometimes supervision was missing.
good,"Place for advancement, customer service oriented.Very fast environment with alots of  departments to work for.  Management is good."
good,"Working for Home Depot in Lagrange has been an experience, some good and some not so good. sometimes there are not enough associates in each dept for customer needs. Some of management personnel clicks up with certain employees and let them get away with things that's against company's policy."
good,Busy day goes by fast.  Customers are normally the same people and you get to know who they are and what they are working on.
good,Always felt like everyday I worked could always be my last. Felt like I was always under the magnifying glass and that my job depended on my performance every day. Lived under the threat of be disciplined or fired almost every day. You can be fired at any time for anything.
good,"Pros:"
good,Retail is nothing glamorous but Home Depot is a good company to work for. Yes your hours may fluctuate but they will always try to work with you. It can be a family environment which is always nice. The staff is always helpful and knowledgeable as long as you go to the right person. Over all I would go back to work at Home Depot if I needed to.
good,"Excellent job loved it when I was part time but once I became full time, time management is horrible. never a set schedule and some days worked from 5am to 2 pm and the next from 3 to midnight. My sleeping schedule was so off."
good,"I don't really have much to say, if you are looking for a retail job this is a good company to work for. I've worked retail for 15 years and I'm ready to not have to work weekends and holidays."
good,"enjoy helping out customers, learn how to pull an pick orders, make sighs, labels, mix paint. enjoy working with other co-workers. I learn that if I like my job, the job gets easier."
good,"Typical day at work starts at 9am. I learn handling different customers, their inquiries, experience taking care of their different problems, requests. Interact with the management and submit daily reports."
good,"i love all my co-workers and a few managers, some are nice and some unfair. i love all my customers they are all loyal. i am a great peoples person, easy to deal with customers and a`ssociates"
good,"My boss was a great person to work for, knew his job well and trained and taught me on how to get promoted. Some co-workers were great to work with and definitely helped me at my job. I liked to apprehend suspects and prevent a loss in our store."
good,i didn't like some of the  way things were handled between employs problems seems to me like management just didn't want to handle any of it advancement never comes and the stores security polices were terrible .
good,"It was my first job ever, I worked as a lot associate, which was fun and I managed to make a lot of friends. They train you for everything, and every situation has its own way to be dealt with. Work-life balance was horrible, however, because schedules change very often and sometimes I was called in very early in the morning or very late at night. However, management instructions and task assignments were very clear, which made my job easy and manageable. Compensation was minimum wage with no extra benefits, which was something good for a guy like me (college student). However, If you are looking for a career at home depot, you will have to be VERY, VERY PATIENT, because it can take you a very long time to advance in job positions. Also, you can get laid off for practically any reason they could come up with. I've been told this a lot before I got hired, and I have seen a lot of employees get laid off for reasons such as arriving late to work, accepting tips, or being caught texting while on the clock. So you should be very careful on your job."
good,"always was learning something new weekly never had down time really, kept busy always something to do. Co workers and managers are hit and miss to being competent and willing to work."
good,"Great place to work, friendly staff, and huge corporate backing on your education and development as an employee!"
good,"fun place to work, co workers are fun to work with, pool table in the break room for all employees, supervisors are very helpful"
good,The management and the co workers are good and helpful. The only hardest part athome depot is that they provide part time positions. But the most enjoyable part at work is that you are never bored and the time passes very fast with busy days all the time. You meet new people every day.
good,i was so thankful once i finally get my first job. i learned a lot from the almost two years ive worked there. i did not like that i wasnt able to change positions after being told how good of a job i do.
good,"I loved the customer service that I did, I also enjoyed my customers. I enjoyed doing what I did and I also enjoyed helping others."
good,"I filled shelves and displays with material. Cleaned isles and displays. Assisted customers find the material they needed to find and helped them with experience to get exactly what they needed for their chore. I managed a kids workshop, teaching them how to construct toys and models out of wood for themselves to show people or play with. Taught the children to paint as well."
good,"Cashiers would have to wait extended amounts of time before they were given a break. Unlike their competitor, a cashier had to wait for an escort to move from one register to the other. Management seemed to have little appreciation for the cashiers. Loved interacting with the customers."
good,"Working at Home Depot Distribution i have learned so much about warehousing! I actually work full-time for a 3rd party logistics company called Crossroads Staffing. Being a member of this company requires major flexibility and hard work as we often do more work than Home Depot Employees haha. really though! Id like to think we are Marines, (front line infantry) we come in get the job done and do it all over again, unfortunately as a person first i felt their was no compromise in the schedule and we were indeed not treated with respect because we our ""outsiders"" other than that i enjoy my co-workers, i learned more than i expected, and got many praise from management as i am an excellent worker not that it really matters i just work for the money and knowledge. the hardest part of the job would be finding a product with no locations tied to it and getting it shipped before the cut off time. the work is fairly easy as long as you focus and don't let personal issues affect your doings."
good,very fast paced the way i would like any job i work at to be. I learned how to operate another companies register. I have learned to process transactions in a fast manner. I have gained professional relationships with contractors. Management needs a bit working on as far as ALL following the same company guidelines. I am all about creativity yet if i am confused on what policy I should follow because its not the same for all managers then I am being dishonest to a customer which does not sit well with me. Regular associates very driven to give GREAT customer service. I enjoy always being on my feet and learning about the many products that come into this company. I enjoy the benefits to this company as well.
good,Working for this company was a good experience for me.  My mentor was great help to me and was very knowledgeable. Management team was very helpful and co-worker felt like being at home with family. The hardest part of the job was having to bring my job home after working 8-10 hr. shifts. The most enjoyable part of working for the company is the Fundraising and Community involvement. Helping people in the community with problem they have with their home.
good,"its cool on a daily basis  ur task are assigned "
good,Ive been here 6 years and I really like it. I am now ready to expand and go to the next level with home depot.
good,"I have worked at The Home Depot for five years at present. I am still employed there. I have gone to college while working there, my hours are fixed morning hours. It is overall a good environment to work. However, based on my experience the compensation/benefits aren't as good as they should be with the rapidly increasing shareprice. The opportunities to move up within the company are relatively few and they are very hard to come about. For a part-time associate planning on working there as they attend school, The Home Depot is an excellent place to work, however, if you are planning on making a living rapidly The Home Depot is not a place to work."
good,Learned that they have great management. Lots of room for climbing the ladder in Home Depot. Everyone is very helpful and always willing to help customers and and each other.
good,"With all retail jobs nothing is set in stone. If your schedule was one way this week, it would change the next. This lead to an unrest-ed body, and discomfort. As far as the employees who worked for the company I did get along with all of them.So there is good and bad with this company."
good,"do safety checks on equipment and check list   how to rekey locks how to communicate with customers. All co-workers help each other with any problems or tasks.  "
good,Being productive  to the people and it sound like a good fun workplace to work at
good,"I don't know about how other home depot's work bt the one I worked at really didn't take into consideration I had 3 young kids at home and I couldn't make it in once in a while or I had to leave work early because the daycare worker couldnt handle the kids. But it didnt happen once a shift.. it happened maybe once or twice a month. That's still not that bad. But overall, good safety, good training, ok pay and good management skills."
good,Each day I would make sure all reports was ready for the managers.  I balanced the vault three times a day.  I made sure that each cashier had their funds to start each day.  I assisted the employees with their time sheets and leaves. I enjoyed working with the management and my co-workers.  The hardest part was trying to provide help to give change to the cashiers while trying to balance the vault at the same time.  The most enjoyable part is when we went out into the community and did volunteer work.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working as a store associate however I wanted to transfer my skills to a warehouse because of my military experience. I was told that I had to wait 120 days before I could qualify for sick time after I had already been with the company for 90 days. This leaves you with 3 days that you can use. If your on what they call your ""final"" then you may not apply to another position. You are also not allowed to apply for a new position until after you 90th day. The management here also seen to completely disregard the company's core values. I didn't feel as though I was a valued member of The Home Depot and instead was treated as a temp. Overall the store gets a 9/10 and the RDC gets a 3/10."
good,Only sees policies as black and white and does not consider underlying issues for reason a policy is violated such as sanitary and health concerns.
good,"Good work and people but the pay is to lo, takes to long to move to much is expected for the low pay"
good,"turno de noche. poco personal,buen ambiente entre compañeros,el trabajo es variable dias con poco trabajo y dias con muchisimo trabajo.lo mas dificil es el poco espacio que teniasmos para acomodar el producto."
good,home depot is a good start off job for training.they have a lack of guidance coming from upper management with a lot of favoritism but those with passion and drive can really go far in the business
good,"Co workers were great, however didn't always work, management was very high stress but kind most of the time, I didn't neccesarily learn a lot because i was given employment due to my past experiences and knowledge of Flooring and other various home improvement skills."
good,"Great environment to work for, not so good compensation or benefits"
good,"Home Depot is a good place, they have a good culture, and it teaches many skills to succeed. they promote from within and give lots of chances to advance to the next level."
good,it was hard and stressful but the benefits were so great that you paid $5 dollars every time you visit the doctor!
good,"garden department, not much else to say. Management is clueless sometimes but coworkers make it fun"
good,i enjoyed working at the home depot. very friendly enviroment get to meet new customers each day.
good,unload freight daily check in u.p.s and fed-x online orders
good,good benefits and job advancement as well as great team to work with. learned many things being employed here.
good,"Every employee is expected to start every day with outstanding services being extended to internal and external customers."
good,"Nice store, located in a good area, stayed busy and management was very good. I loved this store because of it's diversity co-workers were outstanding. Back End Operations,"
good,"•	Administrative Support for Merchant and Divisional Merchandise Manager; performs office administrative duties including scheduling meetings, travel and expenses."
good,"too much rotation of hours. They would schedule you to close tonight and open tomorrow,   By the time you got home and unwound you didn't even have 8 hours."
good,A new company that's still working on getting everything together.
good,"Productive, very enjoyable, high stress and customer account management."
good,"Good hours and they'll pay for your school!"
good,"everyday is the same you come in abd clean the mess your co-worker did not do, once that is finished you can continue on to the work you're intended to do, clean, put freight up, pack out all empty lumber."
good,"Helping customers"
good,"Management and associates are great, its the customers that ruin it for everybody."
good,"its home depot, what can i say? its a fun place to work most of the time. Holidays are a little hectic and a struggle on the family at home. management is respectable. the most enjoyable part is workin with customers. the hardest part is probably the heavy lifting that comes with the job."
good,"A typical day at Home Depot would consist of; helping a lot of customers and mainly contractors check out. I assist customers in singing up for credit cards. I make sure they found everything that they needed and if they didn't I inform them on where the items they couldn't find are located if we have them. If they are contractors I ask them if they would like to sign up for pro rewards which are points that build up and eventually give you discounts. "
good,"The customers are impatient, they expect you to be an expert in all departments. The coworkers are fantastic, except the department heads who have been working for X+ years and hang out in the break room their entire shift or lack any form of people skills."
good,"Worked at Distribution Center.  "
good,"Getting a advancement or promotion are slim to none "
good,"The home depot is an fun informative atmosphere to develop customer service skill as well as social and communication skills. My biggest responsibility at the Home Depot consisted of completing task in the department which included housekeeping, safety procedures, inventory management, and product ordering. As an associate at home depot you get the challenge by performing in a timely fashion in order to excel customer expectations.the biggest reward i had when i was employed at the home depot was the satisfaction that i was making a difference in the company as well as in the customers"
good,a lot of poor attitude in that place and they make a lot of things harder on people then have too.

good,your typical day is fun because of the customer's but the management could need a bit of help.
good,le travail dans le département saisonnier était très intéressant puisque le département change de produit a tout les saisons. La culture de home dépôt est très positive avec le but de constamment avancer. Les opportunité de développement son minime avec un salaire difficile a gérer. Management était très raisonnable et près a aider. Management était pas approprier pour la culture de la compagnie.
good,Poor communication through out the whole building. They have too many people who need drug tested who are causing accidents.
good,"We wrote our contracts for rental customers in the computer system. We fixed customer repairs, unless needed to be sent off to corporate levels. Management was lacking in knowledge of the department, so it was strenuous at times. Coworkers were always willing to help out."
good," Managed team of 17 to 40 agents to achieve high quality customer service and portray excellent Company values."
good,"The opportunity to learned alot hands on as far as interior decorating,repairs and maintance."
good,Never enough emplyees to do the job correctley . always having to apoligize to customers for lack of help.
good,Was not bad at first but still getting low pay after over a year of being there.  New hires make on average $2 more than me starting out.  I have recieved awards for my work but seems to be never enough since I got upgraded to being able to do ordering and change item counts.
good,The job is task-oriented working on a team to finish projects
good,work life balance is a concern.  Great bonus structure.  Tough to have a life outside of work.
good,"The job was okay, I was able to interact with a lot of customers and gain a lot of respect from my co-workers."
good,Good learning environment .  I have met some great people.  Able to cross train within other departments The hardest part about working at Home Depot is  standing for 6 hours. Lack of communication between management and employee.
good,Store went from one of the best places I ever worked to one of afraid that you could do nothing right.  Cutting floor help to the point that customers could not be taken care of in the proper manner.
good,"Enjoy the warehouse work. I learned all aspects of the warehouse from receiving to shipping. I met some good people. "
good,"Organize 20+ bays per day"
good,"llegar,checar, caminar hacia mi area revisar que estubiera limpio y comensar "
good,At times very stressful. Great schedule. Fun environment good customers
good,"The experience at Home Depot was..... decent. I enjoyed working there and greatly appreciated the opportunity they gave me. The co-workers there were extremely funny, hard-working, kind, patient, and downright some of the best people I have ever met and glad to have worked with. As a sales associate for the flooring department, I was able to garnish quite a lot of knowledge pertaining to flooring products such as tile, grout, hardwood floor, etc., As enjoyable the job was at times, my main problem was the management there. Some of the managers were pompous, pretentious, arrogant, rude, and misunderstanding. They were of no help and it was hard to go by their demands because each individual manager had a certain way of doing things, so if you did it one way you were gonna get in trouble by another. Another thing was that they played so much favoritism towards certain employees and that was something every one was aware of. Another problem was being under-staffed; there were days where I would have to cover home decor and flooring by myself which was just unbelievably ridiculous! I would have managers making remarks on why I was not attending to customers, but when they seen that I was by myself or explained to them that I am running both department by myself they just stayed quiet and did not even bother helping at all. Overall, I enjoyed the quality of work that Home Depot offers, but with proper management I would have loved it and possibly stayed longer."
good,"The Home Depot is a great employer with competitive pay and great benefits. You decide your altitude with this company. There is much opportunity for advancement with The Home Depot. Management is always timely and attentive, the plans are thought of ahead with clear directions for associates to follow. Very seldom did I have to stay past my scheduled shift."
good,"Coworkers are generally good-natured and fun to be around. Customers can make or break any given day."
good,"stocking and making signs"
good,A typical day at work was handling all HR duties for associates as well as scheduling all associates work schedules for the upcoming three weeks. As well as providing varies reports for management. That if you take the time and just talk to people you find out a lot about there needs. Management was always changing so there was a lot of various styles to adapt to. The co-workers were the best thing at Home Depot as I got to work very closely with all of the associates. The different hours of work was the hardest thing to adapt to. Most enjoyable was again working with everyone.
good,"I worked for HD for 23 years!!!!! 23...... I was handsomely payed and well looked after, it was my dream job..... until i blew the whistle then it was all good ol'e boy to save there collective aresses..... too bad, it could be a great company but I'm afraid that it will always continue to be what it was 30 years ago, an company full of uneducated people out for their best interest......  too bad...."
good,"management is very good to work with."
good,"I provided customer service to Home Depot customers and contractors, acted as internal resource supplying product knowledge and application expertise."
good,"I usually work an 8 hour shift with a nice hour long break which will give me time to study and do homework once I return to school this coming quarter. They also grant one 15 minute break 2 hours after clocking in and 2 hours prior clocking out. As a cashier, I help complete the customer's journey by making sure they have everything they need, making sure they have a Home Depot Account with us, and giving them a positive experience before they leave. The managers are helpful and friendly to those who seek and demonstrate abilities to succeed and progress. My co-workers have also been very helpful and friendly throughout my experience so far with all the tips and positive rapport. The hardest part of the job can be helping multiple customers out at self-check out when it becomes busy and I am stationed there by myself, but I know I can handle making sure each customer is properly served. What I enjoy the most about working here is the welcoming atmosphere created by the driven associates whom I'm lucky to work with."
good,"Every day is a different day at my Home Depot. It depends on whose the manager on duty, head cashier and season; because it's a home improvement store!"
good,"Overall, It is a good job, pay is okay and I love doing what I do! I have learned many different things and challenged myself daily to beat company records. I enjoy taking apart the units and rebuilding them."
good,"Home Depot was a great company to work for.  Daily routines would include; start off meetings, and group stretches before beginning our daily task.  Managers are normally walking the floor once work is started, so communication with them is very easy.  Once the day is finished everyone helps clean there sections before we all leave. In addition they have multiple areas for you to place your lunch while at work.  They always offer free coffees and hot chocolate in there break room.  Water stations are located throughout the warehouse for easy access."
good,A typical day....If you worked hard at it and loved getting the boot then this is the place for you.
good,"At that time when I started out my career for that company back in the late 90's, I had very good managers at the Pompano Beach HD store location. Managers were very caring and goal driven for employees. They helped retained employees and employee turnover rate was very low then. It was very good experience for me."
good,I've learned to take the time out and listen to customers needs and go above and beyond to help them complete their task/ projects. The hardest part about working in customer service would probably be is putting up with so many different people attitudes on a daily basis. Over all I really enjoy working for Home depots company because it helped me grow as a person and my patience have improved.
good,Its some what boring on slow days and i can most people dont really wanna be there
good,"Alot of operating machinery, learned how to operate heavy machinery such as forklifts, reach trucks,etc, hardest part of job was inventory, easy part of job was operating machinery because made the work easier and quicker to get done"
good,"The hardest thing to do is to work 2nd shift and balance my family. Especially during the busy season, working till 2 am is very hard with a little one."
good,"Making sure that everything in the store was set to planogram and that samples were fully stocked out on the floor. I learned that manual labor is very hard and that alot of people dont understand until they have done it. My co-workers were awesome, we would hit a little bumps in the road but we always came back together. Trying to deal with customers and get your job done in a timely manner. We would always have fun at what we do."
good,"a typical day: very fast pace"
good,"You would work for about 4-5 days a week depending on how many hours you work per work day. The scheduling is computer generated and is random. Sometimes you work from 6am-2pm or 6am-10am or 8am-12pm or 10am-6pm or 12pm-8pm but most commonly 2pm-10pm which is closing time and there's many more combinations. You're not going to like closing time. Aside from this you can also check online to see your schedule which and you can also see what schedule you have for the next two weeks. "
good,The most enjoyable aspect of this job is the fact that it is faced paced so the time goes quickly. Also there is a lot of room to breathe as supervisors aren't over your shoulder every second of the day.
good,"Very early morning"
good,A Home Depot work day is somewhat of a learning experience with every customer and question asked .The management is ok depending on the work load. the work load can be very high at time in my department. my co-workers are fun to be around and hard working. The most enjoyable part of the day is when the customer you just helped say thank you for the help and time you just gave them.
good,I've been there for 3 years and everything started great. management slowly changed so did some policies. easy to get in. hard to move up. good learning experience over all.
good,"As much as i would get lazy to come to work, it was always a good time. You're a woman working in a man-dominated company and field, it'll get degrading sometimes by comments contractors will make or the looks you get but, every Home Depot turns into a family. Management will ALWAYS say yes to a customer, no matter what it is. Its such a customer oriented company, their motto is ""YES! I AM EMPOWERED"". Temps. are hired on for 120 days and told two weeks before hand wether they're being kept or not. You will get a raise after a year and if you move up or into anther department, there is a raise opportunity. There is bonuses twice a year."
good,"Responsible for all aspects of Retail experience"
good,"Fun. Fast paced, learned alot, management was fair, co workers are nice, not hard, getting paid on time"
good,I have nothing to say about this company and wouldn't want a comment to effect my future employment.
good,if you want to learn about tools and different building materials is a nice experience
good,"Everyone at Home Depot was very nice, except HR. I was scheduled for hours that weren't in my availability repeatedly, and then never approved for shift changes. It was the reason I had to quit, which was sad because everything else about that job was great. If you have complete open availability at all times it's a great place to work, but if not they force you to quit."
good,"Hard to work with unhappy people..."
good,Engage with Customers on a daily bases. Management is always there with their doors open to attend you. Co-Workers are great! The hardest part of the job is the income aspect of it. The most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with different people on a daily bases. You never know who you are going to meet.
good,depending on what you want vs what you are looking for its an alright place to work.
good,Homedepot is a great company  to work for  not very friendly oriented management dose not always do what they are suppose to do worked here for 2 years  not easy to promote within the company . but after all a okay place to work .

I then gather all products and prep. them for shipping for the next day.  I load the delivery trucks and file all shipping paperwork.  I tag and locate all internet sale items.  Contact customers and coordinate delivery dates and times.  I complete all the above while assisting all instore customers with the items needed for their projects.
good,"setting up the front end, cash draws,schedules for coverage opening to close,training new produce,new ,promotion,make learning exciting   having contest  to make it fun.Hardest making sure the department heads under stood the credit card and promotions worked so when they were talking to customers they them self were on the same page as the head cashiers,cashiers"
good,was a great place just wished they cared more about me not feeling safe.
good,nice place to work and great leadership. Great benefits and descent pay
good,The pay isn't that much and there isn't much job security.  I was laid off after 2 months!
good,"The Home Depot is a good part time job. They do offer some descent benefits. The co-workers are friendly and welcoming. Management is kind and helpful. A typical day for me would be checking on orders, cleaning my work area, helping customers locate items in the store and answering any questions they might have. The hardest part of the job is when we get busy it can be difficult to find time to take a break. The most enjoyable part of this job is putting smiles on others faces."
good,"a typical day is taking care of customers no matter what it involves, you learn a lot by just listening to what others say, management depends on what store your at, some are great some are not. hardest part is sometimes you don't get rewarded for what you do. and the most enjoyable part is your co workers."
good,"I wouldn't mind working there again just not at the same level of pay and title. Management was not that organized when it came to advancing mvp employees, So when I left I wasn't to surprised that 4 people left within the same month because of pay advancement expectations."
good,"Wake up discuss the day and carry out all the jobs required. "
good,HomeDepot offers great benefits especially for those who only work part-time.

good,"Very busy loading mulch, stone and pavers."
good,"Needed improvement. The company's store manager was great though those under him was not so great, he needed a better team."
good,Home Depot pays well but there management and attendance policy sucks!
good,"A typical day at work consists of updating yourself as you walk in the door with new products, sales, and/or programs being used in the store. The Home Depot values their customers and aims to please them in anyway they can so policies constantly improve and/or change in order to benefit all parties. It is a very fast paced environment and you have to quickly learn about all departments which consist of learning where items are located and used for so it is easier to bond with the customer and help them find all they may need for a convenient and successful shopping experience."
good,This company is a Great company i learned alot from the customers and coworkers. i miss helping all the contractors. 
good,"typical day at work was quite calm, I didn't have an overall bad experience with the company. The only problem that I can see forming is in the management, there was an incredibly strong sense of favoritism. "
good,Its your normal home improvement store where the sales are based on customer.  One gets to know about the products and services rendered. 
good,Intense Retail Environment.  Extensive Travel.  Great Pay and good benefits.
good,"A typical day for me was pushing carts around the parking lot to their bins, and I helped people lift heavy objects into their vehicles. So I learned that this job can be quite the work out, and that the management is pretty good, everything is fairly organized fairly well. The co-workers are also very easy to get along with, every one is very sociable. The hardest part of the job is just maintaining a consistent work flow, because sometimes you can get pretty tired from pushing carts and lifting all day. The most enjoyable part is having a customer thank you from deep down inside for helping them lift something they wouldn't have ever been able to lift into their vehicle, people sometimes are very thankful and will be left with a gigantic smile on their faces."
good,I need a job that will keep me busy and gives me a challenge. I could not find that at Home Depot.
good,"Enjoyed the fast pace environment, helping people with their needs making their orders came in a timely matter. Management really did seem to care about what was going on in everyone's lives. It seem like there was a family environment in this company. This company was much focused in training people to be able to work in many different areas of the building. "
good,"Es una empresa donde diariamente se recibe capacitacion, sin embargo las posibilidades de crecimiento/promociones son muy pocas."
good,"Home Depot is a large company that caters to its customer. They try to take care of their employees.  Most days are typical, you help customers complete their home projects to best of your knowledge.  The people are friendly and always ready to help."
good,Great flexibility
good,"I loved my job. Great business, had a lot of fun, loved working with people but there was poor management and no advancement. I was employee of the month twice but treated badly so I left."
good,"A typical night was re-stocking, shipping/receiving and running the fork lift, etc. Worked with some good people."
good,"A typical work day started with getting the front end ready for opening. Scheduled cashier breaks and lunches and made sure they had change,approvals,ect."
good,"a fast multitasking job, where you need sharp listening skills with customers coming at you a mile a minute. a management team focused on customer service and co-workers helping you juggle the workload. hardest part of the job, when a customer walks out displeased unable to fix the situation. most enjoyable part of the job working with enthusiastic home depot associates."
good,Home Depot is a place where you can learn about all the aspects of the building supplies industry in an environment that is friendly and productive.

good,Stared out as a part-timer. After one year was made full-time six month later there was an opening for department manager I applied and was promoted.
good,I loved the other people I worked with. Faced paced at times hours were ok.
good,Home Depot was able to schedule work hours around my schedule being a full-time student. Performed cashier duties as well as customer service.
good,"I provide excellent customer service everyday.. I've learned many things such as to duplicate keys, ride and electric ladder and also an order picker. Management is not conscious of what their employees are doing as far as if they need assistance. Co-workers are like teammates. Flexible scheduling. The customers, only because I enjoy people."
good,"My day begins at five am, so I can get work done before we open at 6. My days at work are pretty consistent, I begin by scanning outs in three departments; garden, flooring and decor. After I scan outs, I go through each department that I mentioned above and change price labels, clean beams, down stock product and help customers. Once we hit eight am the the store is usually busy with customers and our main focus in on customers at this point."
good,"A typical day at work is pretty calm, collective and busy. Sometimes you can get that certain type of customer that wants to cause a scene but you just have to know how to handle the situation. Management is fair at times. Sometimes they play favoritism but depending on who's the manager on duty, it turns out to be a cool day."
good,"A lot of heavy lifting in most departments. Stocking, cleaning, and ordering special materials. Must aid in loading customers vehicles and trailers. Have to make cold calls."
good,"Home Depot was a great experience because they had a very strong team. I learned that when everyone pitches in and help out, you will get a great deal accomplished. My co-workers were very hard working and dependable. They would always go out of their way to help customers. The hardest part of my job was to get familiar with all of the home improvement products because there were hundreds but I soon learned. The most enjoyable part of my job was the management team and customers because they all were so friendly and made work so much fun."
good,"Kid friendly and very involved in community. Specialists are becoming rare since the company basically promotes cashiers to specialist roles, Much different philosophy than the company was founded off."
good,typical day go in to work say hello to co workers and chat with customers. help them out with there shopping needs.
good,Good employer. Good benefits. Provide trainings for all the associates.
good,A typical day at work would include ringing up and servicing over 100 customers in one shift. I learned a lot about certain DIY and contractor projects.

good,"I learned how to be more social, great customers, somewhat of a laid back environment"
good,"Shift begins at four a.m. Lunch from ten until ten thirty, shift ending at twelve thirty. Every day is a learning experience. Micro- managing is a seldom, but possible. Co-workers normally host positive attitudes. The most difficult factor is constant lifting of heavy merchandise without proper protective equipment. The most enjoyable factor is interaction with people in need."
good,"I provided excellent customer service via active listening, a positive attitude, and professional and personalized communication. I learned the value of good customer service."
good,It was one of my favorite jobs. Liked the people I worked with and got along with most of management. I worked in the garden department and helped customers with any needs such as lifting or a question about a product. Some other duties included operating forklifts and moving displays.
good,It was my first real job and they provided me with great experience that later helped me land a higher paying job.
good,"A typical day at work would be come into work say hi to everyone, clock in, look at the schedule book and see who needs lunches and breaks. Determine what to do for the call outs and no shows. Monitor the front end. I have learned that if you move up quickly even though you deserve it, you will lose friends. The hardest part about my job would be dealing with co-workers, having to work every weekend, and being blamed for cashiers calling out or not showing up. The most enjoyable would be learning new ""Do It Yourself Projects"" everyday. I love learning new things."
good,have problems with scheduling nice place to work management not all that great or helpful...
good,typical day includes packing sown merchandise and filling in holes from items that are empty on the shelf or peg.
good,"A normal day consists of making sure all shelves are full and properly merchandised. Work lists are delegated, and management, for the most part, works hand-in-hand with the associates. I learned sales floor retail along with retail management on a department level. This includes financials, inventory, and coaching. Most of the co-workers are extremely willing to help, and the training is outstanding. The hardest part of the job deals with staffing. All lift equipment work requires 2 bodies, and when staffing is low, it becomes difficult to get big projects completed. The most enjoyable part of the job consists of making new friends, and getting to talk to them everyday."
good,I didnt like it because it was third shift but pass that I enjoyed it alot
good,home depot always put customers first so you have to communicate. i learn to drive a lift truck and im also certified in the fork lift truck.

good,Great team atmosphere. Lots of room for advancement and the training to get there with the support to help.
good,Great customer service provided. Gaining knowledge. Friendly co-workers.
good,We always had work to get done with a fast pace..i learned alot of things about a how warehouse facilities work.. I enjoyed all my co-workers and customers..the hardest part about when u work on a crew is when u have someone consistenly calling in and then when have almost double the work to get done...i like to have my job completed at the end of shift...i loved everything about the job excep on freight team no one was full-time just part-time..only 25 hours a week.
good,Its a good place full of good people. Its 10 hour shifts. Only bad thing is poor communication between associates and managegers.

good,"Only worked there PT because of school. Everyone worked with my schedule, and was willing to help. Big plus for PT benefits."
good,"This was a difficult job to have becuase shortly after getting hired, we got a year notice that we would be closing down. It was great experience working in a center that was closing, but it was difficult work. When people left, we had to pick up the slack while maintaining our own solid performance."
good,The management is helpful with solving work related problems. The hardest part of the job is when I can't help someone with their issue. The most enjoyable part is when I help someone find a non traditional way to solve a problem.
good,"- Typical day at work involves helping customers make decisions, downstocking merchandise, ordering products for customers, attending meetings, operating lift equiptment, resolving any issues to the correct departments"
good,"Depending on the shift, although when working any eight hour shift, upon arriving there is a high paced and high expectation retail environment."
good,great people and fun to work for just need full time is why im looking for a job.
good,Great place to work that kept you busy counteracting with customer each day. You get to learn about new equipments and tools coming in the market and also how to do minor repairs.
good,"At The Home Depot, you work with a lot of great people. Customers and fellow associates. Although the company has a great reputation, they are unreliable with the staff's hours. The hardest part of the day is power hour, where there are more customers in the store. We strive for excellent customer service between 10am-2pm. The most enjoyable part of the day is dealing with great customers."
good,My typical day would be cashiering and watering the plants in the garden center. I learned how to handle situations about theft and returns. The hardest part of the job was finding where all the items in the store are. The most enjoyable part of the job was events they had for the employees and public.
good,Time goes by quickly. Task are given frequently. Easy to do but time consuming.
good,Home Depot is a great place to experience customer service skills directly in a calm but busy environment. It's a nice job for someone just getting out in the work field unless you're part of management. The staff there was amazingly friendly.
good,"Had good benifits, but not many apportunities for improvements. There were many employees working at Home Depot, and different departments. I enjoyed working in the gardens registers, and the lumber area."
good,The moneys not great but the job will always be there. Plus you are home every night.
good,"Putting customers first and having an emotional connection with customers gives a sense of compassion, letting them know that you are here for them."
good,The home depot provided a great work environment as well as great experience. I grew a lot during my time as an employee.
good,"I would tell everyone one to work there, because it is a learning experience but make sure you work in a high volume store there is more help when you need it."

good,"I enjoyed working there, Supervisors were great, security on grounds. Chiefs and they made fresh coffee every hour."
good,"I started working at Home Depot at around June of 2019. I started off as a cashier and later on; took an open position of lumber and building materials. First month of working was pretty fun. They got me certified for the forklift and I’m currently working on my reach license. The management is awesome at the location of Morgan Hill, CA and so are the coworkers. It is a lot of work, and you will be mostly walking around the department working on “go backs or “flat stacking lumber. I but be cautious, you will be breathing in concrete dust and and sawdust as well so please, wear a masks."
good,"I did enjoy working at the home depot. They always stressed good customer service, however, the seem to never have enough employees on a single day. It was frustrating to cover 1-3 departments"
good,"I have never had a great feeling shopping at The Home Depot. Almost every employee on the floor ignores customers that may need help. As in, they do not go up to and engage in conversation. They'd rather stand in the isles socializing with one another, or try to avoid customers all together. "
good,Home Depot had great benefits for the employees. The company had professionals and experienced employees in each field. This I recognized from there tedious training course that address each topic thoroughly.
good,Interesting internship in which you learn a lot and meet great people. Worked alongside pre-existing team. Great culture but did not work with a team that needed me. Projects did not seem extremely meaningful. Was only intern without intern partner and manager was negligent and refused to provide feedback over the work I was doing.
good,"Working at Home Depot is a good opportunity to develop your skills and  confidence with customer service."
good,"Working at Home Depot provide me a better way to do sales and establish a good customer service every day, helping employees and customer. Is good place to work and learn all about home improvement."
good,"People are great, supportive and hard working. Work life balance is difficult if not impossible. Impossible to get a consistent schedule as far as what shift or hours you will work. Makes it difficult to find additional work to compensate for the low pay rate. But, the Benefits (Healthcare, Vision, Dental, 401k etc) REALLY ARE GOOD!"
good,"Got promoted there started as a seasonal. Management constantly changed, they weren’t too helpful when it came to changing schedules for non military associates. Overall decent, but perhaps another location would or would’ve been better."
good,Worked here for the summer and although the schedule was very inconsistent the culture was inclusive and dynamic. You have an issue go to your manager or hr. They were more than willing to work with you on scheduling. Pay for the work I did was not sufficient. Overnight warehouse work for $13 an hour.
good,"The Derby Home Depot is a decent place to work, but the environment is very cliquish. Management  plays favorites and if you don't agree with their views then you're likely to get fired. if your looking for a place to make friends and work hard , by all means apply. If your looking for good hard work and respect, don't apply."
good,Some people work as a team and some don’t. I enjoy working alone most of the time. I get more done and no one bothers me. I also dont have to rely on anyone
good,Home Depot is a great company to start for students. I started in 2016 and took the initiative to learn more. I learned multiple departments and that propelled me to work at the corporate office in Smyrna
good,"The job was like any retail job, but I felt this company had too many employee turnovers. They were always short-staffed and management was either always busy picking up the slack or not around for help. A lot of the workers did not comply with standards and were not reprimanded. It often was chaos in the store and customers left unsatisfied because there was not an available employee to help meet their needs."
good,"Everyone who works there is very friendly and helpful to fellow employees and their customers. You can always count on someone to help you out."
good,"Usually a day at work starts with a morning meeting which lasts around 10 to 25 minutes depending on the season. In this job I learned about power tools and how they work, also use of the operation of a balleymore lift.Now while I never had issues waking up and getting there what I've learned was that most other stores started an hour or two later than what I we did (Monday,Tuesday,Thursday 0400-1230 while Wednesday, Friday 0300-1130 while the rest of the stores in the district starts around 5 or 4 in the morning)"
good,"pretty chill, honestly as long as you do your job and maintain attendance you'll be fine, some people do work and others just won't so like in any job"
good,Very relaxed place to work at on top of that all of the associates are pretty easy to get along with. The only problem would be associates that are license to operate all of the forklifts are paid the same as associates that or not license.
good,"There was no typical day at work. Situations varied from day to day, whether you were on a register or doing other tasks in the store. Some days every customer was nice, other days you had customers that complained to the Managers about something. Typical in Retail. Management was on top of things, for the most part. There were mandatory Store meetings where Management informed everyone of the latest changes and gave out employee awards. They did also give out bonus checks and had contests for various items. And they tried to make sure they did cook outs for the employees on holidays or we had potlucks."
good,I love the job and the customer. Some of the staff are grouchy and can have attitudes sometimes. The pay is good and management is very understanding.
good,"If you're lucky to luck to work with a good team, you will enjoy working here. The hours are not always the best, but the management team I had did make it bearable. The workplace culture is really good, birthdays are celebrated and the random pizza day or bbq get thrown in there too."
good,"A lot of annoying training you are going to be doing if you are hired on. The interview process was easy for me. Be prepared for hours that are all over the place, rude customers, and poor management. Other than that you should be fine, good pay and decent benefits. Ps: work overtime as much as possible and your checks will be over 1,000$."
good,The hardest part of the job at Home Depot was trying to sell the credit cards to each guest that came through your line during checkout.  You had to have at least 3 by the end of the day.
good,"If you like to work hard, you can and you will.  If you want to climb the ladder, the opportunities are there.  However, if you want to be lazy and just collect a paycheck, you can do that, too.  If you're lucky, you can have great managers and co-workers, but you can't count on it.  I worked freight for 3 1/2 years, and I was lucky enough to have awesome managers, and really great co-workers for the most part.  But I've seen enough of corporate stupidity and the bad side of retail that I've had enough.  Also, my back has had enough.  For the most part, I've enjoyed my time there, and as I said in the summary line, you get out of it what you put into it, so it's really up to you."
good,"Working for The Home Depot is great. The culture is amazing and most individuals who do work here strive to adapt to the values.  "
good,Management and co-workers are very friendly and willing to help when in need. Everyone is nice and friendly. Job is pretty easy and when/if you make a mistake; they show you how to correct it and how to prevent from the situation from re-occuring again. Great team!
good,"I felt as if management could have done a better job, instead of playing favorites. Typical day consisted of being berated by unruly customers and employers alike."
good,Great job with a great culture if you just looking to build experience. Not a recommended position if your looking to build a career and sustain a life.
good,"While I love working with the Home Depot Customers I cannot say the same for some of my coworkers and management. They were friendly initially but after a few weeks not so much. There is nearly Zero on the job training. You take classes on a computer then are thrown on the floor and expected to know how to work through many computer programs and if you ask a coworker to assist you, some get very frustrated and I don't blame them when its busy. A person needs to be trained on the job in real time and not by a person on a computer. The pay is very low and not worth the aggravation. I'm part time and work 4-6 hrs a day and sometimes am scheduled 6 days a week."
good,"Lots of running around just cleaning up and fixing aisle ways. Helping customers find products. Very nice back room and managers, but other employees were very weird."
good,"It's certainly one of the BEST big-box retailers work for. The health benefits are very good, although they are a bit costly compared to other plans with other companies. They have a VERY strong work culture, and everyone makes you feel like part of a team! My biggest con to working here is the pay. They pay their associates terribly and there is no employee discount at the stores."
good,This is a great opportunity for someone to get in to retail merchandising. This position provides great training and hours. The drawback is in the pay.
good,"Hard honest work. nice coworkers and good management. great hours, and negotiable at that, and great opportunities to learn new skills and meet great people."
good,"Flexible schedule, work and life balance. Paid holidays. 401k , vacation and sick time. No complaints. Good place to work. Management is good........."
good,"Home Depot was a great place to work with lots of collaboration, opportunity for advancement, and structured workflow. There are some problems with computer software, but overall great entry level position."
good,"I was looking for a job that kept me busy, while having me using my body. Truthfully I like hard labor kind of jobs and I feel that home depot gives me that in my department. But it's a job that has different departments for people that might be skilled in different areas. So in that case I find recommend the job mainly because of that."
good,My experience working at Home Depot was fairly good. Had issues with management but was resolved quickly. I enjoyed working with my peers and being a team leader.
good,Home Depot is busy from the time the door opens until close.  Management for the most part are pretty friendly. HD is a multi culture team. That makes it interesting as well. Hardest part of the day is just about every day you will get that one upset customer. The best part is customer satisfaction and seeing that customer leaving with a smile and appreciating my services.
good,Home Depot is a simple day to day job. But as a part timer hours are hard to come by depending on the season and who’s availability is more open than the other person.
good,"I was hired on the spot.  Not saying that speaks great for me but there are so many entry level jobs hiring in my area they wouldve taken anybody.  I was offered department manager positions several times almost immediately because they are so short staffed."
good,The department was very stressful. I would like to see leadership undergo   more training to become professional. I loved the culture that me and my peers had however.
good,"The management are extremely helpful to new employees, and most of your coworkers will be very friendly as well. You will encounter angry/rude customers, and sometimes irritable individuals both on staff and not, so just try to remain friendly and calm."
good,"- good if you're just looking for something casual and are not super committed"
good,"If Home Depot paid more, would definitely consider staying. Just trying to find something new. Options are open to variety of different jobs. Food, driving, etc."
good,it is a great job to start with or a retirement jib. It will keep you in shape . For the most part it is a great work environment. The employees are get they make the job. Management will work with you on most thing. And they are very understanding. When it comes to life matters.
good,"Fun place to work at meet many interesting people/make connections."
good,Home Depot was an ok place to work. Co workers were friendly. Management was ok. Everyone was very helpful. The hours and scheduling were inconsistent
good,"Overall, not a bad place to work. The people there really care about the work they do, which is nice. Everyone wants to do a good job. Unfortunately though, the lack of staffing and minimal training opportunities make things difficult for everyone. Home Depot focuses heavily on ""taking care of the customer"" which is a great priority to have, but that usually means associates get the poo end of the stick; i.e. no formal training, heavily under-staffing, missed breaks, lack of communication, etc."
good,"Perfect job for the persons that are self starters.  Highly motivated individuals can climb the ladder of success, within a short time period.  Activities are planned to promote unity and teamwork."
good,Good place to work. I feel they do not pay enough for supervisors. I overall enjoy working there but it is a tedious and boring position. All negative accounts is just how i feel do to being a server for so many years that at times not running around and constantly moving bothers me. The job is overall great and the work place is fun.
good,Working there I noticed management had favoritism for some employees. If they feel like they can't trust you..they will literally follow you around the store pestering you asking what you're doing or working on. Finally they cut down on your hours without notifying you at all.
good,"A fair place to work. The associate are great, the work is hard, scheduling and hours allowed needs major improvement. Corporate level managers are hard to deal with."
good,"Good team. Co-workers are generally kind and willing to help. Schedule is inconsistent, so its hard to balance another job if struggling to make ends meet. My department (deliveries) is stretched pretty thin between co-workers needing help, customers, and phone calls. Feel over worked most days, and the annual $0.33 raise is kinda pitiful."
good,cashiers and pro desk employees who do nothing and lumber and seasonal employees who work very hard and get paid the exact same amount as people who work very little
good,Contrasted to my previous review The Home Depot is actually an incredible place to work. They assess what you're good at and will work you into that department and you won't even realize that you're that good at one thing. With all sorts of benefits and raise opportunities I would recommend this job to anyone.
good,"Home Depot to me is a good starting for anyone who wants to learn the basic of a warehouse and get machine certified anyone that is going to school, really on handling you’re hours."
good,I meet the needs of the customers and provide the customer with professional as well as personable service. I relate to the customers with similar life experiences and make sure the customers are satisfied and happy.
good,"I worked at the Home Depot for several years while finishing school, and felt that the company was excellent to its associates overall. Upon completing my degree and putting in my two weeks notice however the management team at my Home Depot acted incredibly unprofessionally and began to treat me very poorly. There was a change in store manager a few months prior, and the new store manger did not seem to have the same care for his associates as the previous one."
good,typical work day was fairly easy and fun. There wasnt really a hard about about the job it was all fairly easy. managemnt was good. the culture of the work place was fun all the people where fun to work with.
good,My experience working at the Home Depot  has had its share of ups and downs the company is very stable and does offer up at some of these for growth but at the same time the company expects a lot from its associates without providing enough help to get the job done it’s almost a contradiction. They try to do more with less and sometimes that makes it almost impossible to get the job done. The Home Depot is an excellent opportunity for young associates around the age of 18 just getting out of high school it teaches them a lot about homeownership and things that they need to fix and repair their homes as well as customer service. I would recommend Home Depot for younger associates but as you start to age I would advise you even move up in the ranks go to corporate will find another company to work for because the physical demands will be great.
good,The store offers great benefits to employees and offers an amazing and flexible return policy to customers. Management could use more training in learning the functions of all departments.
good,"There is a focus on safety and teaching associates how to be better individuals at work and at home. "
good,"As a Flooring Department Associate i found this a Great place to work, but management wasted too much time on Computer training, even that i got already about 8 years experience working in Home remodeling. Customer service is not on your mind, its in your heart, then you add the knowledge of the trades, items and projects."
good,"Overall great people to work with and to work for, supervisors very helpful.  I did not like the added stress of having to push for credit card sales.  That was really my biggest beef."
good,Overall the workplace wasn't bad. The people were fun to work with and management was understanding if something were to happen in your personal life. the work was good and fun and the time I spent there was good.
good,The Home Depot is a great place to launch a career. The company gives a mile wide and inch deep approach to exposure to each field. I found the culture was not a good fit for me at the stage of life I was at. I still utilize the valuable lessons learned in my career. I would love to go back to The Home Depot in a leadership role to help positively transform its culture.
good,its a good place to start. the have good benefits and work well with your schedules. the only negative part is that if is a bit difficult to become a full time associate.
good,"Awesome job a little fast paced. Room for growth and going for different positions , with the company. Co workers were awesome and very helpful, met a lot of cool ppl along the way."
good,i think if People didn't like to work so it made the job harder than it is suppose to be.if everyone would come to work and want to work the job would get done.
good,Hey those who know more about specific trades a higher wage and they will stay for more faithful to the company rather than looking for work elsewhere like so many people I’ve met have worked or Home Depot and ended up leaving for Lowe’s
good,Fast pace fun place to work meet a lot of customers that become friends company parties when you bet sales goals quarterly and growthy opportunities within the company
good,There is favoritism and that is the only reason why I left. Management wasn't fair to their hardworking and didn't feel appreciated. There is drama as there is in retail but the leadership at the company really needs to improve.
good,"As a department specialist, my job was rewarding and challenging. The working relationship with other associates was diverse in age and culture which made it enlightening. Really liked that part of Home Depot. The best part of working is the 401k and stock options. I thought that some of the new employees didn’t understand how important it was to get started in these options, not much help with teaching this with little HR available."
good,"Home Depot has a great workplace culture, but does seem to give preference to men when positions open on the sales floor and keep women as cashiers.  There are no full-time cashier positions.  It is very difficult to get a full-time position and you are limited to 27 hours per week as part-time and when they hire more people the existing part-time lose hours sometimes down to 8-12 hours per week."
good,"Home depot is your typical retail place to work. Lots of standing, walking and customer needs, needing to be met. Fun if that's what you make it, overall nothing bad to say."
good,Nice customers. Great sales attitude. Hard work ethic made the floor a tad competative. The sales pitch and the closing of the sale was always some of the best things. Helping someone with their home improvement it one of the best jobs.
good,"load trucks in the morning, put orders together for deliveries and online orders before customers come into the store, help customers around the store."
good,Job can sometimes get hard but there is a lot of teamwork involved so even hard moments won't be spent alone. They emphasize a lot on customer service.
good,Fast paced and fun environment. Staff was friendly and very helpful with training. The pay could be a bit higher but still better than most retail companies.
good,This was my actual first legit job so I definitely enjoyed the experience. Learned a lot skills during the time being. Also expanded my way of thinking & being more creative.
good,"The job was fun however there was not much encouragement to strive to advance. The rules were set but there was not and equality on everyone following the rules. This was a part time job and I enjoyed it while I was there. I would not work there again, this was not a job for me."
good,"Hit the floor running. Start helping customers with their projects, find what they and explain how to do whatever the job is they need to do."
good,"seronda is a team player, works well with others ,knowledgeable,promotable come to work when schedule and  on time fast learner seronda is open minded"
good,handle cash transactions keep front store clean know where everything is or the general location of it is. Some customers will try to steal from the store keep an eye on em especially in the self check out and garden. very fast paced but at least you won't see the time pass.
good,"From my experience at home depot there are 3 types of people who work there; 1) those who need an easy job while in school. 2) the lifers who will retire from there because they are to comfortable to leave. 3) those who treat it as a pit stop before moving on to something better. #3 type people usually go on to better jobs and lives. type 2 people will essentially give their life to home depot. type 1 however they have a choice to turn into 2 or 3, i choose 3."
good,"fast paced ,bi-linguel product knowledge, learned cherry picking ,forklift experience, good management, standing and walking great retail work environment"
good,I enjoy working with the public.I was very good at taking care of my customers and helping to insure they found and purchased the items they needed.Enjoyed talking and helping.
good,"coworkers are nice and we help each others. talking with nice costumers make my day. Closing time always hard, because costumer do not want to leave. good place good people."
good,"The Home Depot was not a bad place to work if you don't mind standing around a lot. There are things to be done, but no incentive to to it. I personally worker in the hardest department in the company, Lumber. This is heavy work that few could do. I kept my department immaculate, despite the heavy workload. It's not in me to stand around, if I'm out of work I help someone else."
good,"Very fast paced and competative. Fun coworkers and management. Family type atmosphere. manual labor intensive. saftey orented company. most enjoyabled part is jocking with coworkers,"
good,"The Home Depot help promote growth and opportunity for their associates. Also, assist their staff member with education fundings accordingly. More importantly, create a safe environment to perform our job at all times."
good,"Working for the Home depot was all good the first 3 weeks. then I transferred stores and was put into a whole new department. My supervisor never showed up or helped train me, and when I brought it up with the manager she just shrugged her shoulders."
good,"clean shelves then restock the shelves. "
good,I began as a night MET associate completing major resets and other projects and then moved to the day team. The hours are good and the job is not bad for what it is provided you are assigned to a variety of tasks else it can get repetitive at times.
good,Management is mostly relaxed and just want you to do a good job. Other employees are friendly and helpful. The hardest part would be finding something to look productive after you've done everything. The best part was how easy it was and how we can mostly schedule ourselves.
good,"Over all, Home Depot is a good company. There are some flaws, however, it is relaxed but busy work environment. There are issues with working hours, part timers do not get much hours. in certain times, they will give extra hours when needed but eventually will cut hours. There are bonuses twice a year.  Also, there are vacation hours, not days."
good,"Home Depot as a company is a great place to work. As individual store however ever thing changes store to store, so if you change locations be prepared to learn the same thing a different way and be prepared to accept that you cannot do things the way you were taught."
good,I have enjoyed working for HomeDepot.Com but I felt the need to move on due to lack of pay and work life balance. The job is not hard but the systems and on the job duties do not match the pay. They are antiquated for being one of the largest retail giants in the United States.
good,"a typical day includes quickly unpacking orders giving key rec numbers to proper orders, unloading freight, lumber,and garden trailers. providing delivery drivers with proper paperwork."
good,"Great flexibility for part-timers and good money while in school."
good,I made a decent amount of money for my role there and it was a fun/ friendly environment. I did not feel fulfilled with my role but also had no desire to take on another so just decided to leave.
good,I've enjoyed working with this company. It is a fast-paced job and you often work with a team. Most people are friendly and caring and reviews are fair. Reviews are every six months with potential raises and bonuses.
good,"I would go to work at nine thirty at night. Sometimes help get freight to the floor. Worked several departments over the years."
good,"Working at the Home Depot was a great experience, however some of the co-workers were not. I typically get into a job to help people and solve problems. When working multiple areas it is hard to keep up with everything going on and with lack of support from co-workers in your department, the job gets stressful and depressing."
good,"CUSTOMER SERVICE #1 PRIORITY .Making sure the Sales( prospecting), store maintenance. Ensuring every customer was greeted and assisted based on their needs."
good,"Home depot is an okay first job for college students who are looking to make a quick paycheck. Extremely repetitive, and most people working at the home depot take their part time jobs way too seriously."
good,I really weren’t a big fan of home depot because I’m not a winter person. So when it were cold outside I didn’t like having to make sure everything were order & things like that but besides that it were a great first time job.
good,"Workplace culture is fairly relaxed at most stores I've worked in or visited. Landed in one very bad store, but I think this is the exception to the rule."
good,"While I was an employee at Home Depot, I was introduced to a lot of first-time experiences to help improve my working skills and experience. For example, I learned how to close and open the store as a lot loder. I also learned how to assist customers with finding items and loading/unloading items. Working at Home Depot was a good working experience for me."
good,"It was ok as far as warehouse type work goes. It was the RLC. Return, repair, recycle. We did a lot of moving equipment to be repaired, cleaning it with power washer where possible. taking it and staging it for the technicians to repair. Staging it tobe shipped out for possible re sale, or prepared for recycling."
good,It is a working environment with friendly people to work with at the Home Depot for people to shop and get what they need to do your housing project with the Home Depot.
good,i enjoyed this job it was slow paced and very easy to get the hang of after a few tries on my first day of work. we didnt always have work to do so we were sometimes sent home early and other times we had so much to do and not enough employess
good,"Customer service desk is busy place, very stressful with not a lot of management support.  Hours are long  and issues arise daily at this particular area of the store.  I learned how to keep calm and defuse  situations."
good,"This job is only difficult if your peers do not put in their part. Overall it is an easy job, at times it gets hard, but it is a job at the end of the day. Managers are very nice people, they listen to you if you need help. They do not always do a good job of noticing all the hard work you put in, but there's almost always at least 50 other associates, and just one manager."
good,"I set up a display table with my own home made signs and literature along with anything I can get from the store to market the products home services promotes. I tear them down each evening. I PK store associates on the products and the computer applications. Although my function is marketing and lead generation I follow the core value of the Home Depot motto and that is Customer service first. I great every customer with a cheerful smile and attempt to get leads throughout the day. Many times by walking the store or helping with other projects."
good,"Ok place to work. Summer bbqs for the holidays they make you work. Pay could be a lot better. Heavy lifting required. One weekend day is required, which sucks, but it could be worse."
good,"Employees are paid terribly. When I came in the door I was making more than employees that had been there for years because they raised their wages. Some people"
good,It pays well and management is great. But hours are only given to certain departments during specific seasons and for me where I’m just in Recieving hours aren’t really given to us.
good,"Throughout my experience in Home Depot, safety and customers are the main important two things. I had to make sure that what i’m wearing is safe and protect me. Also with customers, I had to serve them with a smile and a appropriate attitude."
good,The Home depot offers great opportunities for job advancements and also helps with school depending on your program. They participate in a tuition reimbursement which give great motivation to those who are still interested in following a career with The Home Depot.
good,"lots of work but low wages, the pay need to be better based. also stocks and benifits needs to be more benificial to employees. theres is lots of work but management cotrols the overtime"
good,"It would be a great place to work, just not for long. Great benefits, just not many hours available to work. They do supply food on holidays and events, As well as two bonuses a year."
good,"Es buena empresa pero no voltean a ver a personas que si saben ."
good,The work is usually slow and pretty relaxed. There is a sense of family between the managers and coworkers there. They can work with your hours and is enjoyable work.
good,highly productive fast paced.  New skill sets are developed depending on what department you are assigned to.  work place culture is always highly motivating
good,"Management was pretty flexible with part time scheduling. I get burnt out with customer relations, that would be one of my larger problems with the job. That is personal thing."
good,"It's like any other retail job. They don't always follow their values, but when they do they do so to the best of their ability. A quick to hire even quicker to fire kind of workplace,"
good,"Fun, fast paced environment."
good,"Home Depot isn’t really a bad job, but you have to be the right person for the fit, or just want a general job as a time killer.  It’s great for people who are more business oriented but others I’ve found feel negative towards the company more so if they aren’t from a business background."
good,"Assist customers with locating products,  management is very helpful and knowledgeable, there are employees who have years of experience there.  Best part of the job is to physically move a lot.  Even though carrying heavy stuff is straining."
good,"really good benefits."
good,"Must be people oriented, willing to work at a fast pace and must be able to multitask on a daily basis. Must be willing to deal with customer issues and willing to help find solutions that will satisfy the customer."
good,I enjoyed working at Home Depot and like my coworkers and management.  There is a great HR department which really looks out for the employees.  Home Depot fails as a great place to work because of the low compensation for  people that make their success possible.
good,"Face paced, very flexible hours, it is a place of employment where you can get alot of training, and experience in multiple areas. Pay rates are based on experience"
good,Days are very repetitive which makes planning your work week very manageable. Management was knowledgeable but could work on communicating with employees a little more professional.
good,"The job is ok, find myself being interested in the job dutites itself for job performance but mangement is key and improvement for a line of chain to bettrler improve the company and the employers around"
good,When i first started there i was working overnights one year later i was on days in the electrical department one year later i was in special services that was very rewarding helping peaple
good,"Great company to work for if you're already with another company. Unless you're full time, its not worth it. There is no reason why you have whole departments needing help but management refuses to switch willing people inernally"
good,"•Home Depot Rdc 5851"
good,"Was a great place to work and wouldn't mind working there again the only problem I had was the days per week they had me working, I was only working about 2-3 days per week instead barley scratching 20 hours a week"
good,My work day was busy from the moment I walked through the door.  You definitely have to be a person who can multi task.  Management is different from store to store and very diverse culture no matter what sstore you work in.  Hardest part is the turn over and having to find trained associates and to train them on the basics.  The most enjoyable part of the day is the associates and the returning customers.
good,"offers a lot of knowledge on the job experience, but lacks in actual teaching of the job.  Mostly hands on and computer training, not much training from actual people. Once you know the system, you can function easily, it's just getting there that is the hard part. They offer great incentives for good customer service."
good,love leaning different departments. great to learn problem solving skills for different types of projects. working as a team gave me great confidence in my job.
good,"Considerable bureaucracy and regulatory constraints reduce the pleasure of the job experience considerably.  If you come from a large Fortune 50 or above company then you'll be comfortable.  On the other hand, if you have spent a lot of working time in smaller companies then you'll, eventually, tire of the artificial challenges imposed on your day to day activities by the bureaucracy and the regulatory constraints you'll have to constantly maneuver around just to do your job."
good,The job is okay I’m just looking for something else in the meantime while I’m pregnant because i can’t do any heavy lifting at the moment and i just want time away
good,"Literally everytime I went to speak to a manager about anything, I had to find the one male manager. All the female managers (nothing against females just stating that they were female), and I mean all 9, we're in the conference room eating and laughing their butts off. Now you may think, ""Oh they were on lunch"" but you'd be mistaken. This happened on 7 different occasions at different times of the day."
good,Be ready to work hard if you want to advance. A lot of weekends and evenings. The schedule changes every three weeks. If you do all the above and be on time and don't call you will be fine.
good,decent place to work at would still be working there if only they would give more hour or had given me the full-time states other then that its a place where you can learn a lot
good,Fast pace environment that will require full engagement.  Culture is strong and built on shared core values.  Merchants drive the business with best in class support teams.
good,The management style varies greatly from one branch to another.  One store may thrive on comeraderie while another feels more military and impersonal.
good,it is a good job to start your career they will teach you alot of valuable skills and work with you on your next job. your hours may be cut later or if you don't get along
good,"Working at The Home Depot is really tough, especially as a lot associate. A lot of people tend to hide and disappear. It’s was really annoying working by yourself while others hide."
good,"The hours aren't consistent and neither is management. There's quite a lot of power play, at least in the store that I am in. Benefits for part time workers though, you don't find that everywhere. Relatively flexible with vacation and sick days."
good,"The company initially started out taking care of the employee as a valuable resource. Over the years the company seems to be doing what appears to be the hiring mainly of part time workers. Nearly all of the learning is now on the computer and almost none is done hands on as the company originally did. "
good,My typical day in the paint department was very busy and fun all in one. I learned how to mix paint and help customers pick a name brand.  The management know ther jobs well. The work place culture was very interesting they would hire college kids from different countries like Maylasia and England so you get to meet different people. The hardest thing about working there was trying to find enough time to get everything done. The most enjoyable part was helping customers get what they needed.
good,There's a lot to do and never. A dull moment when you surround yourself with co-workers. There is always work to be done and co-workers will help you and are willing to team up to get the job done
good,"Never expect to get weekends off, co-workers are hard to find, very physical and emotionally demanding. Business is often slow, scheduling is always messed up, and no training for anything!"
good,"customer abuse is worst for me, did enjoy keeping tools repaired and helping those customers that really need it. many became awesome customers for me"
good,"Friendly staff, and very nice work environment. Management is always changing, which can be both good and bad. Both part time and full time staff receive benefits. Students are able to apply for tuition reimbursement. Pretty lenient on taking time off. Overall, a good place to work."
good,Assist customers in any area of the store. Explain tools to customers if they are unsure how to operate a tool. Be able to assist with basic tool repairs. Make sure the store is clean.
good,"It's an all right job. Nothing particularly bad about it, but nothing particularly outstanding. For the occupation, they pay you well, but hours are inconsistent."
good,"I worked at The Home Depot for about 7 months. Everyone was really nice(my co-workers). For my 4 hour shifts I had a 15 minute break, which was nice. Sometimes the company would make breakfast or different lunches for certain holidays which I thought was cool! On the downside, working there was pretty tough on me. First of all, there were many times we were understaffed. This means that I would be at a register alone sometimes... which caused great stress when a line would form. Secondly, customers can really treat you like trash. Obviously, this is common in a retail environment, so it wasn't a surprise. Thirdly, a lot of people would mention how young I look for my age, and it really annoyed me. Because of this, I felt like I was treated like a child. Fourthly, we had to ask customers about signing up for credit cards. Of course, it's to be expected from a company like The Home Depot, but they really pushed us to get credit almost every shift. They kept saying ""We really need credit today""... like every time I came to work. Lastly, I didn't feel like I had any independence. I felt like almost as if I were in school and was the child and the head cashiers/managers were the teachers... if that makes sense. This is why I liked to work outside in garden a lot! Although my job had its downs, I made some friends and got to experience my first job. So, I would like to thank The Home Depot for letting me work there! It helped me learned what I want out of a job."
good,"Returns and check out cashier. Assisted customers on the floor when needed. Opened credit card accounts. Accepted cash, credit and debit card transactions,, performed data entry, answered multi line phone and directed calls."
good,"Home Depot is a comfortable place to work. They like to promote from within. Flexibility is the key to work scheduling, promotion. Good benefits for full-time associates, and even part-time employees. All receive vacation and sick time off."
good,Great place to work just not enough pay rate for all the work and stress levels you do. Shifts changes a lot. You learned a lot with the help of great management.
good,A typical work day provided great customer service. The job allowed me the opportunity to provide quality customer service. Management they were very professional.  The work place culture was very diverse.  The hardest part of the job was working weekends. The most enjoyable part of the job was reaching customer service goals.
good,A lot of times I felt like i was still in high school and there was this segregation between certain types of people. A lot of good people there but just as many can be racist and take a bit getting used to
good,"Depending if you know a lo about a certain field or not, you can learn a few things by interacting with other employees an the customers. Things can get a little hectic when it is comes to holidays or changing products."
good,"This particular Home Depot is alright to work for.  I found the interview to be a tad misleading though.  They made the workload sound much different than what it is.  For example, they mentioned that I'd be moving approximately 50lbs of wood, tops.  That just isn't the case.  I've had to move carts with over 1 ton of wood on them.  As well, some of the pieces can be 50+ lbs! as well, they made this particular position sound substantially more customer service oriented when it isn't very.  I seldom interact with people outside of telling where different lengths of wood are or suggestions on how to make things.  As well, I'm not too sure if it's because I'm 'young and strong' as they put it, but I am also often called out to do jobs outside of my department like working as a lot associate where I go collect carts and load peoples trucks with very heavy things."
good,"My day would be working in outbound, loading product that was stage from inbound trucks. that I would stage into outbound lanes. I learned how to work at a fast pace and not to overlook what steps had to do. the hardest part of my job was it was a new facility and had some problems with the design of the warehouse. The I did enjoyed the culture of being with all new people in a brand new site. I do thing the management had a lot of over head, we as employees  had to here a lot of the same thing from at lest four to five different people."
good,As a cashier there are is no chance of becoming a full time employee. The store gets reviewed by the company every 6 months and if excelling on goals set then the store gets a bonus which is then divided to the employees
good,I had a good time at home depot and made many friends in my time there however I need more hours and management has been driving some associates away.
good,they offer good insurance and other benefits they are very flexible on scheduling  the work atmosphere is good  but sometime you get to work realy hard  because there is not  enough employee.
good,I learned to stay focused and to worry about your own work and to also never give up on a project no matter what your supervisor says about you to employees
good,Although compensation is good the work/life balance is pretty terrible. At least for upper management. Bonuses and the direction of the company is great.
good,Good work environment. Lots of training. Room for advancement if you work hard. Open to a diverse group of employees. Has a strong benefit package. Management listens to your concerns.
good,"La empresa es muy noble ya que tiene culturas y valores muy buenos, siempre esta pensando en su personal de como cuidarlos, el ambiente laboral fue muy grato durante 5 años 1/2 ya que se vio lo que realmente fue The Home Depot el problema fue en los últimos 6 meses con la llegada  de una nueva adminstracion que solo  veía por si mismo y no le importa la gente  (es decir no vivía la cultura THD)"
good,"depending on the department you're assigned to, determines if you'll have a hard or casually busy day. Mostly everyone is friendly. It is fast-paced throughout your shift. I never ran into any issues with management."
good,This was an excellant company to work for except the chance for women to advance was minimal to none. The pay was excellant. Times have changed and hopefully so have their chances for advancement
good,It can be a great place to work if you have the right managers and department head.  Department Heads can make your work day long and rough. Some managers are great while others make you feel like you have no one to go to with real concerns.
good,Working at the home depot in my town made advancing to full time impossible because it was not available however when I worked in a larger city there was room for growth. I learned a lot and was truly able to help people solve their problem.
good,working at home depot is very challenging. I worked at the rdc warehouse and it was fun but also very hard. I had to leave the because of my pregnancy
good,Great people to work with.. all jobs have it's down sides of things I just had enough and decided to leave ..!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!@!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!@!!!!!!!!!!!!
good,"Home Depot is innovative and strives to be number one in Customer Service.  This it does well.  It allows employees opportunities to impress customers.  On the management side, most of the training is internal, so anything external pertaining to larger markets and those who are educated tend to be left on the sidelines.  Great people and each facility are different.  More complex business decisions are not designed for store managers to take on."
good,"Cannot really give a great review, was not employed here long enough to give full assesment of the job. But for the timme that i was there enjoyed working with and meeting new people"
good,The management at The Home Depot needed some improvement. Also the only way you could advance was if you were kissing peoples butts around the workplace. They didn't really go off of how good of a worker you were.
good,"My only problem is the schedule is extremely flexible and the home depot do not hire enough employees, which is unfair to the customer or the associate."
good,The company culture overall is good. Like most large corporations there exist communication challenges. There are a number of positions that on can grow into. The company is full of people that started as cashiers an dare now in six figure positions. So advancement is certainly attainable.
good,A typical day consist of 5 customers every hour. Allot of returns. Managers hounding you about getting credit cards and its the same people that come the store everyday.
good,"Moving up is challenging but once you network and seek mentorship you will learn what you have to do to advance. "
good,The work at the Home Depot RDC was good. Fast pace environment and the people you work with always help you out to reach new goals. The work was mostly make pallets for different store with needed merchandise. The hardest part of the job I say was management. Management was always on top of you even if you missed goal by 2 percent. I enjoyed the people employed there so helpful and nice. They always acknowledge you when you arrive at work and always motivated you to keep on doing your very best.
good,"You only got promoted if you were a part of THE clique. Otherwise, you had no chance of having every weekend off like the other departments. Typical 8hrs on the clock."
good,"- Home Depot Supply chain is a robust division within Home Depot. It is forefront in innovation and finding new ways to deliver products to customers in more efficient and cost effective way. "
good,"2nd Job and helped me grow quite a bit. home depot was one of the best experience of my life its just too monotone, and repetitive... if the pay was better it would be a whole different review"
good,"They do not show you any respect.  You are just another pawn and regardless of how much effort and work you put in, you get very little recognition..."
good,"A very fast paced environment and I've learned to keep a steady pace so that I make no mistakes. My manager was awesome in communicating to his team and building relationships and trust with each of us. "
good,"Fun workplace "
good,A very fast paced and sometimes very stressful location. The management was great. The pay for what is asked of you was fairly low compared to the amount of work that was required. Working in the flooring department- I was the only one working with no help.
good,"Home depot was a good place to work at, but I just couldn't deal with flexible scheduled shifts.  I didn't like the fact of me working on Sundays as well."
good,"I learned a lot from this company. I worked my way up over the years and I took every chance I could to learn not only from the staff, or training that was required, but from the customers. I loved working and building the relationships with the contractor base or the repeat diy customers. I was great to build the trust and rapport with vendors."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is gaining knowledge and experience from many other team members and applying those core set skills to everyday life as well as to assist the needs of others!
good,Most active and productive job I have had outside the VA Medical Center.  Duties vary daily and for the most part the work invironment was medium paced with much to learn and keep you busy
good,The home Homedepot didn't have good loyalty. The management there was horrible. Mangers lied to you everyday and got your hopes up. They would ask if you wanted full time but never offered it to you. We were behind in freight for about three months until corporate slowed down the freight.
good,The company is a good place to work for because you learn a lot of all the different department in the store with all of training. It's a good company to move up with good pay.
good,"Great place, great people. Just don't be pregnant if you're working there. They discriminate hard if you don't just quit working. I had a hard time because management didn't want me to do anything within the company because of my condition."
good,overall this job was a life learning experience that i learned from working there the leaders were all worth be leaders and i always wanted 2 be there
good,"unless you want to move up in the company there is no real money. doesn't matter how long you have been there, you have to move up into management to get any good money, but you have no social life outside of your work life"
good,"Not a real team driven organization as they would have you believe.  Part time associates drastically under paid and not given enough hours to survive on this type employment."
good,"My experience wasn't bad at all at Home Depot.  It's certainly not a career in my opinion.  Overall though, it's a good ""starter"" job to get into (or back into) gainful employment.  Not much down time (which I liked), the hours weren't that great, but there aren't a whole lot of options when it comes to re-stocking shelves with as much merchandise as needs to be done on a daily basis, so I can't complain too much."
good,"While working for The Home Depot, i was able to converse with customers and was able to direct them to what they needed. The job was quite rewarding and allowed you to focus on what you were doing such as, stocking inventory, assisting customers, and to ask questions when you were confused. Thank you Home Depot."
good,"The Home Depot is a good company to work for in my experience. Unfortunately, the hourly pay is really low compared to similar companies. "
good,"You are welcomed to the The Home Depot respectfully. Being a signed a job along with having a couch to help one learn a job correctly and most of all safely. The Home Depots main focus is safety and making sure employees are taken care of! Learning a new position is hard work, dedication is needed and being a quick learner makes it easier on you and the team you are on."
good,"As long you show up on time and perform your daily task, you'll enjoy this job. This is a company that focuses on customer service in day time, but at night, no matter what department you're in your main focus will be pack down and cleaning up the store so that it can be ready in the morning."
good,Unfortunately this particular RDC has poor management. The company has in place everything to make for a great working environment. This is probably the best feeling I've ever had about a company. I was so excited to begin. My experience is definitely isolated because of the coach and supervisor I was assigned to.
good,"Experience and colleagues at Home Depot were pleasant. Everyone was friendly polite and professional. The environment was respectful, the workplace culture was accommodating to new employees as well as for the permanent employees."
good,"Working for five years at home depot I learned how to merchandise every season of the year, and worked with a team. The hardest part of the job was having to live off the pay rate. The most enjoyable part was working as a team that became family."
good,"Fine to begin with, but the energy spent during shifts and the fact that it is overnight work makes you very tired. Scheduling of shifts completely ignored my availability and they made me work full time hours although they hired me based on my availability for a PART TIME opening."
good,It is a fun fast beat environment to work in. Everyone is very welcoming and fun to work with as well as the beat of the job is very fast and the pay is very good as well as incentives for reaching certain goals.
good,Wages are average. Work environment is good and everybody is friendly. Management is a hit or miss depending on the store your in. Benefits are also very good. Raises suck bad and advancement opportunity is so-so.
good,"A fast paced work place. Great people, easy tasks, supervisors and management may be difficult to deal with at times. Too many people get power hungry and overstep boundaries at times"
good,"They allowed me to get my Reach, O.P., Electric Pallet Jack, and Fork Lift License. Fast paced, sometimes slows. They Try to take care of their employees. Not very good with communication between department heads."
good,It's a good place to work if your looking to go to school and work. Their hours are very flexible and the managers are great. Their classes teach a lot about the department to have you ready for the customers throughout the day.
good,"I was employee of the month my first month so if you work hard then you can be rewarded, compensation isn't great but there is room for advancement, shifts aren't typical ""bank teller hours"""
good,"I recommend this job for anyone starting off but there aren't too many advancement opportunities and you only start receiving benefits after working for a year like college tuition ( I believe $1,000 per semester). Pay is near minimum wage and they make you watch a propaganda video about how unions are evil and Home Depot reserves the right to pay you slave wages. I worked as a lot associate and though the job could be tiring on your feet it was a nice job that gave me minimum human interaction. Hours aren't too bad so this is a good job if you plan to work and go to school although full time is available as well. Job security is fair, you won't get fired easily unless you really mess up, you also have an opportunity to get a forklift certificate if you choose to. The people I worked with were decent but the customers can be jerks some times. Overall good place for a teen or young adult to start off but not a good place to continue working. Get out once you find a better opportunity"
good,I loved the concept of my job. I bled orange as they say. The sky was the limit for opportunities of advancement. I took full advantage of all of the training and workshops. This is where most of my customer service experience came from. Home Depot was all about the customers needs and the satisfaction of those needs. I worked with an incredible group of hard working people at my location. Only downfall was one or two poor managers and the ever unset schedule. But that's retail.
good,Not bad working here. Overall great culture working just feel like advancing in the company is no where in the near future. But great company to work for.
good,Home depot is a great company. However most jobs are part time and are very good for High School students. Very hard to get a full time position at the company.
good,"The management is great and most of the employees are super friendly and helpful, however your personal life does not matter and you will work every single weekend. You do not get any preferences on your schedule, and days requested off are usually denied."
good,"working at Home Depot is a everyday challenge for helping people solve, fix, decorate, and redo projects and remodeling.Being able to maintain a non stop pace of customer service and ability to recognize the needs of customers is a must. Overall Home Depot will advance you into the direction you choose by expressing the desire to move up and working to the best of your ability.."
good,"Great values, bad pay long hours, overall good company flexible scheduling great part time job for those who are in school, you learn alot about the department you are in."
good,The Raises are terrible. The hours are 4/10's 3 shifts. Outbound is mfl( manual floor load )and cart building. Very physical job. I am a fork lift operator who unloads and loads trailers
good,"Company dedicated to training employees and recognizing individuals for advancement. "
good,Everyday at work the other employees are very kind to each other always willing to help the new people who just started working there. Management is also nice and very fun to be around they give good advice and are very understanding.
good,"So many employees, easy to make friends.  Makes the hard work a little easier.  Flexible hours to accommodate personal commitments. Opportunity to learn different trades."
good,"I worked in the flooring department at the Home Depot store. The Home Depot store it was a safe environment and it was full of great people . I worked as a sales associate. I cut carpet, so carpet and set of measurements for customers who came to the store. I had a great customer reviews from the customers. I sold carpet and set of measurements for customers who came to the store. I had great customer reviews Full of positive feedback. Mostly Home Depot was a positive environment, with a great staff, that were  always on your back and facilitating you no matter what. I was always willing to help any customer in any department no matter what even though I was a flooring associate.  I took my time to help anyone that needed it or didn't need it.  I always went out of my way.  That's why I had good reviews."
good,"A typical day at home depot is a busy productive day, I've learned a lot from working at home depot. the hardest part of the job is the work schedule and also its hard to get full time"
good,"Overall the company is great. There all about the people,?which is us as a employer . The great upper management and supervisors keeps the workers motivated to work"
good,"the job consisted of training and coaching your staff, while maintaining maximum level of customer service throughout the store. I was responsible for hiring, training, motivating, and accountability of a staff of 140+ associates."
good,There is never a slow day at any Home Depot.  Each day holds something different in store.  Learn the ins and outs of customer service and retail.  Hardest part of the job was not being able to finish most of your workload given to you by your superiors.
good,"Trained on forklift and order picker machines to complete daily unloading tasks to get product to the floor. Ever changing environment which made the job challenging and not repetitive.The Oklahoma weather was the most challenging part of the job, but the outside environment was also the best fresh air."
good,"After returning from my last hitch in Iraq, I took the job with Home Depot as a means to ""decompress"". I worked the Garden area...best therapy I could've imagined. Supervisor, at the Pensacola Garden department was great! I enjoyed the hands-on and customer culture of Home Depot. I would have stayed longer, but the pay sucked."
good,I don't like what I do because they expect you to clean the lot load cars and help out inside. You're contesting running. The employee are very nice and always want to help you.
good,"As a part time associate at the Home Depot I did learn a great deal about customer service as well as digging to find a customer objections,  This was definitely the beginning of my skill development in a seasonal position."
good,Didnt really stay here long enough to get a real feel for the job or its people. The lady over me was a real southern woman with hospitality on her mind constantly. She taught me to be genuine and keep a smile on me face
good,"it was a fun experience while i was on the traveling team. once i got store side it was all bad. the store manager was under the impression that the MET team worked for him and only him and once we fell behind on projects it was only our fault. the MEM for the district said nothing and didn't really help the situation."
good,fast paced friendly.how to multi task.switched often and they were some what removed at times from their employees .was a good environment friendly.comunication. customer were great
good,"Decent place to work, management can be helpful but expectations are sometimes unreasonable. Good environment, everyone is willing to help when they have the time.  Constantly moving, especially in deliveries."
good,The day in the life of a store manager is required to have extreme time management skills and the ability to adapt to current trends and initiatives at a moments notice.
good,"In my year with this company I had the opportunity to grow mentally. I have a whole new set of skills that now I can share with others in a new experience. Now I know how to work tools that I have never seen or heard of before, I know how to put together orders for contractors and how to lead a group of people. I will always appreciate what I learned from this place."
good,"I started from lot associate and made my way to supervisor in 5 years in the same store, and gone through 5 store managers and 12 assistant managers. This is the job for you if you love retail and that sort of environment."
good,I was an lot associate dealing with the parking lot pretty much making sure all customers were ok or If they needed any help with taking things to their cars etc.
good,"Educate customers about company product."
good,"The routine for work is the same everyday which is great. Every day going into work we have to unload 1 to 3 trucks, then we put the freight away where it should go, after that we make sure the store is clean then we leave. I Learned many things being in home depot such as knowing about tools and other things. management is great as long as you get the work done. Hardest thing about the job is making sure all the freight it packed out before i leave. Best thing about the job is the people and not really being pressured on the job."
good,I spent 1 years always try to find the next step to move up in the company but even through my hard work ethic and accuracy positions were given to those by favoritism.
good,"Great Place to work great benefits awesome management and associates. I would recommend anyone work here."
good,Good place to work if you like working at night. It is fast paced and high on organization. The work environment is relaxed and the people are cool to work with
good,"Home Depot, was a good place to work for. It was a very hard working and exciting working environment. Customers are great and learned so many especially in the customer service desk. They have ongoing knowledge about so many household and daily life situations. I've been very fortunate to learn so much while I was there only for a seasonal time. A lot of team work and management was very helpful. They are always willing to help with if you did not understand something."
good,"Best job I've ever had so far, hours are flexible for students, the company culture is very good, they take care of their employees, sometimes it's hard to work with other employees that are mediocre."
good,Friendly coworkers & management to work with. Usually busy the entire shift so workday goes by fast. Assisting customers daily is enjoyable. CON: Pay is far too low to live on...
good,Overall great place to work. Very hard work if you want to advance. Hours are the hardest part of the job with no consistent schedule. Both hours and days are changing constantly. Customers service is a must and on the job training is done through the computers now.
good,everyone is nice and you are well taken care of while working at the Home Depot. Every concern is addressed. It may not be answered or solved right away but in time it will be. There is an open door policy which is wonderful for the employees at The Home Depot. I have thoroughly enjoyed working here the past year.
good,"Sometimes the supervisors really care and want to help, and sometimes you just don't waste your breath.    Some are easily approachable, some not so much.  Same can be said for fellow employees.  You learn to know who will lend a hand, and who will come up with any excuse in the book not to.  Getting a raise was also practically impossible.  Even if  you worked 10 times as hard with 10 times the quality and accuracy as the person making a dollar more an hour working along side you."
good,"They have a very flexible work schedule so you are able to have another job, go to school, or take care of your kids. You also can transfer to other departments when there are opening and you learn a lot about different things from home improvement to gardening."
good,"It's a good company with great benefits. Some managers are more firm then other's, but make it easy to learn your job position."
good,Peers always great and Management not bad. Learn a great deal for the department you work in as well as minimum in other areas.
good,Ensure the store is clean and shoppable; respond to associate needs and issues. Make sure customers get world class service.Train associates on service and product knowledge so they can provide such service.
good,Typical cashier job nothing special . Meet nice people everyday and sometimes hateful one but its that's an everyday thing.
good,"everyday is a good day at work because of the people"
good,Employees didn't respond to customers as I was taught in intro class. Didn't get opportunity to be trained to potential. The part-time benefits were great. Of course part-time is nature of the business because it is seasonal sales. I wasn't impressed with my supervisor.
good,It is fun and everyone is like family. They have good benefits and management is great. Had a good time working with this company.
good,"I like working here because the benefits are good and my co-workers are great. "
good,Home depot is a great place to learn how to run a business.  They are a very tech savy company and put a lot of time into training leadership skill.  It can be a challenge to find a balance between the schedule requirements and family life.
good,Lots of customers to help and learned alot from the customers about construction and our products. The hardest part of the job is heavy lifting .
good,"the company is great to work for.. they have great benefits and perks.. and there always willing to promote you, if your work hard enough.. they also work with your schedule if you have other jobs."
good,"Home Depot was fun to work at they gave me regular hours because, I had small children. I worked while they were in school. My co-workers were good to work with they were always helpful.I had to drive a ways to work that wasn't something I enjoyed. They did have benefits so, that helped me since, I 'm a single mom.I really liked working in the flowers."
good,the company has potential for growth and expansion  and can potentially grow to one of the biggest hardware depot in the country if properly managed in these competitive time. Crucial decision should be made in order for the company to aggressively address the need for the company to other areas of the metropolis. Training new people and developing key people in the organization will be a key element in its expansion. It is with no doubt that in a few years more MC home depot will the second largest hardware depot in  the Philippines next to whoever will be the first.
good,"Great co-workers and a very unique type of retail. Customer satisfaction oriented. However, the management leaves some room for great improvement. Compensation is not great and hours are limited."
good,"training consistent also a close knit family place amoung coworkers must be customer friendly, alot of standing and lifting required. The hardest part of the job is maintaining smiles with hard customers and standing for long periods you gert a 15 min break but still hard on feet and back."
good,"The work is rewarding and the people there are awesome, however the management is severely lacking. A typical day is filled with helping customers and stocking the shelves. The people you work with are fun to work with and easy to like. However, the managers micromanage constantly as well as pick favorites and make life a living nightmare for the workers they don't like. The poor management is the main reason the store has such a high employee turnover rate."
good,"Se trabaja agusto hay buenos compañeros."
good,The Home Depot is a great place to work. My co-workers are great to work with and management is great as well. We can choose weather we want 30 min or an hour for lunch. my first day there was not as tough as most people say.
good,I have people that work directly beneath me and they are some of the most amazing people. I just wish the hours were a little more firm due to the fact that I am trying to grow my family.
good,"Very good company with excellent incentives for the associates."
good,The home depot is great for learning but doe not provide enough possibilities in advancement. I have learned very much during my time there but I have begun to stagnate and wish to continue in my career advancement and to learn much more.
good,"Its, not bad it just depends on what department you work because i feel like if you work garden or in the lumber area you do the most work. Certain departments your require to learn the machines others you don't but you still get paid the same. the coworkers are nice. the thing i hated most was they made you work other departments when they are lacking workers to do the job in there own area."
good,"A typical day at work is to retrieve carts and carriages back to the store so that customers have use for them. We also helped with customers by means of loading their purchased items into their vehicles on an as needed basis."
good,"Working at the Home Depot, I've learned much more about the company and myself. The managers and staff are very friendly and always willing to help if I ever needed something. I also was able to take on new challenges such as heavy workloads with short time periods and assembling products that I never assembled before."
good,"General Warehouse Associates have a short work week; it only lasts 3 days, but there's a lot of work to do in a 12-hour shift. Receiving associates start off with a morning meeting, stretch to loosen up your body, then you look at where you're assigned for the day (which part of the building, what dock door, who you'll be working with, etc). After you arrive at your dock door, review what you're supposed to receive off the trailer, scan the dock door with a radio-frequency (RF) device, and enter the amount of products you receive to a licence plate number (LPN). Products are stored on pallets, where they are shuttled away to other parts of the building to be put in storage overhead. If you finish your trailer, you inform your supervisor and they will give you your next assignment. It's very repetitive work, and during a 12-hour shift, it gets very exhausting. The hardest part of the job is all the lifting and bending you'll be doing throughout the day, regardless of whether you are on the docking bay or in a forklift; you will be worn out by the end of your shift. The most enjoyable part of the job is your two breaks and a lunch, which is the only time you'll have off your feet, and clocking out and going home. Overtime is possible, and sometimes mandatory (i.e. during holidays). It's a very friendly atmosphere to work in and the management is easy to get along with."
good,"Shipping and recieving.,, Forklifft operations, customer service..Stockting all product in and around the uint ..."
good,"i love the place, we meet different people everyday. "
good,Home depot is a fun place to work. The work environment is very hot and humid during the summer months. It is not a heated or cooled work place.
good,"My typical day at work would consist of meeting and greeting customers at the front door. Asking for any special needs they were looking for. Smile and answer any questions about any product that they were interested in. The management at the time in my department were awesome. Breaks on time, lunch on time, any time need off asked in a timely matter and you would get it off. Loved my co workers. The hardest part about my job would be at the end of the nigh trying to close up when customers were still in the store. but always no matter what customers come first. And last but not least the most enjoyable time was when the holidays were in. the workplace would be hectic and everyone was busy."
good,"Home Depot is a fun place to work. You get to meet many different people from many cultures. Everyone is treated like family no matter if they are an Employees or customer at The Home Depot. You learn how to speak to one another with a smile, respect, and great customer service. No customer leaves without a smile on their face. our goal as a Home Depot employee is to provide a clean safe environment, and provide all customers with great customer service."
good,"The Home Depot works to try to get the best workers from the home improvement industry and then give them a convoluted work schedule that has to reorganized everyday.  On top of this they verbally promote employees to move up in the company but make the schedule in such a way that you can get allowed to take the online class the company requires and provides access to only during your work hours.   If they would allow you to take the main classes any time then just take the test portion in store you could move up in the company.   Instead the insist that you only take the class in the store during your work hours while on the clock then make no time for you to do so,   The work itself is fairly easy so long as you can apply common sense and basic knowledge to any problem you come across.   the average co-worker is friendly and helpful and it is only a few that I have come across that seem to enjoy making work uncomfortable around them or even talking to them uneasy."
good,"The Home Depot has taught me diversity, time management, leadership, and independence. "
good,"5 days a week, 8 hours a night, I worked night shifts, every day of the week, including weekends. Co-workers were well informative, and very helpful. I learned it is very important to stay on task, and do your assigned job, as instructed to do so, without any complaints. It is important to keep a positive work attitude, and stay on track with your hours, if not, it could affect you in the long run."
good,"A typical day at The Home Depot includes walking the entire store to stock shelves and check on hands. I've learned how to use complicated in store programs, and how to manage time. My coworkers and managers weren't the closest to me but they've helped me when they were able. The most difficult part of my job was getting around the generation gaps between me and my coworkers. I enjoyed the ability to learn how to use hardware and tools that The Home Depot sells."
good,"Overall I like working at The Home Depot, but I feel as though I need to expand my knowledge to other career opportunities as I recently graduated and would like to find work in my field of study."
good,great place to work its taught me a lot things and has giving me the tools that I need to succeed. They have 401k benefits and stock purchase plans as well
good,"I enjoyed my time at Home Depot, however I found the management to be sub par.  I did enjoy the hour lunches and three week schedule."
good,The work-life balance is awful. But the people you work with are amazing. Plus management listens to what you have to say.
good,The work was very easy and relaxed for the most part.I learned to make keys with machinery and learned to talk to customers.I took the time look for things people needed.Also learned how machinery works for example the forklift.The coworkers i met were nice and friendly and were very passionate about what they do.I made a lot of new friends.The hardest part honestly is the pay because home depot does not pay a lot for associates unless they're managers for the store.The most enjoyable part of the job is the events they have for employee's.Also the good looking ladies that worked there.
good,"The hours of full time employees are hard to handle with a family of a single parent home. But the family environment and employees make it worth it. Learned about project at home and how to""s."
good,"- Room for growth"
good,Very hectic place to work but at the same time great for learning and growing. There is plenty of room to grow and obtain positions of bigger responsibilities.
good,I start my day by greeting all customers and associates.  I assist PRO's with growing their business by helping them find quality products and services.  I partner the PRO's with the necessary tools to become more successful through the Home Depot Pro Services.  I love the people that I work with.  Management in not so hands on as I hoped for but I have learned so much from my team.  The hardest part about my job is finding the time to prospect for more PRO's.  What I enjoy most would be the people.  I love helping people. Seeing a satisfied customer brings me joy.
good,A typical day at homedepot consist of serving the customers and make sure they are satisfied. I learn a lot about customer service while I was there. The management was excellent. The hardesr part of the job was loading heavy products ect.. The part that I enjoyed the most was that the customer were always satisfied with my service.
good,"Lot Associates to ensure the store is stocked and ready for business every day, as well as provide merchandise loading assistance to our customers. Approach customers to determine if they need help loading product into vehicles also gathering carts into the correct location to maintain a great shopping experience for the customers."
good,"pay isnt worth the trouble they put you through, stable job security unless your part time, might be off for whole week straight. unless your full time and been there a while it isnt worth it.."
good,"The job is fun & a lot can be gain from working there. BUT it's common that your Department Head will have little to no experience, you must rely on other entry level employees to teach you or you'll be overwhelm. BEWARE.. customers are always right & you are EXPECTED to accept  ALL verbal abuse. I am not a bitter employee, I am just stating facts, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!"
good,"It was a fun workplace because you become like family. Bad thing about Home Depot is that ""the customer is always right"" and management never has your back."
good,I love the customers they are very friendly and I love helping everyone and I do miss it very much I am a person that will go out of my way to help anyone.
good,Get to meet and work with new people constantly. Learn something new everyday and they tend to promote from within. Great career advancement.
good,I come in and scan all return items and either discard them ship them out ups or back to the RDC. The people are great and at times I do feel l9ike I am amonst family but the pay is horrible for the amount of work that gets done.
good,"You get rewarded because you feel like your an asset to the customers that visit the store."
good,Great place to work at. My experience with management has been hit and miss. Some have been straight forward  and others have been all smiles to your face then do the opposite. It all depends on the store you're at. The co workers you usually work with are generally okay. The most enjoyable part about working their is being able to come to work with a positive attitude and be ready t work.
good,"Staffing was a bit off, led to getting behind on work. Benefits were very solid, even for cashier/front end positions. Pay was a bit low for management positions."
good,This is a fun place to work and the people that work there are very nice. It is fun to help the customers with the projects they come in with.
good,"Typical day at work was setting bay to POG, cleaning, stocking, ordering damaged POP. "
good,"The working environment set up by the company is pretty amazing, inspirational and just over all uplifting. The management on the other hand seem to be more focused on sticking to what they know best instead of branching out and getting to know all the associates in depth making it a stronger team. I can back this up by saying that the performance of the store was not always to the standard of The Home Depot, and when talking to fellow co-worker I would hear the resentment they had for management. Over all I had the ambition to try and become a lead cashier so that I could assist these concerns since I have learned that I posses a high emotional IQ, meaning I have a tendency to put myself in other peoples shoes and be able to get along great while assisting them even better. But I received little feedback from management, and lost interest because I didn't want to follow the usual way people follow in order to get recognized in other words I want my efforts to speak for them self."
good,"Overall, Home Depot is a good place to work if you are people oriented, detail oriented and have a knack for home improvement. Often times, you are asked to cover multiple departments at one time and are pulled from your designated department. This can, as in my case, negatively affect your sales goals. Though commission is not available, Kitchen Designers are expected to meet weekly sales goals that can, sometimes, be skewed. Depending upon which vendor you work with, projects can be relatively easy or incredibly difficult. Having interpersonal skills is a MUST. You must also be willing to work weekends and do not generally have consecutive days off. It can be difficult to schedule your life around the job, as there are generally no set schedules."
good,"Have not worked for this company in 12 years.                            Unsure of changes in this company."
good,Management could have been a little less of a friend to certain people and more of a leadership for the store. Multiple associates were allowed to keep their job even with numerous complaints from department heads about their lack of work.
good,overall The Home Depot is a fun and energetic fast moving environment. Helping customers make important decisions with their home projects was the most enjoyable aspect of the job. Overnight shifts were the most difficult part for myself.
good,You usually start off part time and have to wait a pretty long time before you can be full time. Some people get away with more things than others depending on how much the people in charge like them. Too few sales associates and alot of customers. Can get pretty hard to get help from someone in a certain departments at times. The managers don't really take care of that either and sometimes you get angry customers for that reason. Overall a decent place to work for
good,"I have been an associate of The Home Depot for almost nine years. In that time I have watched this company go from a great paying, great place to work, to a stressful work environment that I dread going back to everyday. I have watched the workload greatly increase with the rise of this company and diminishing wages and staff to put the icing on the cake. Like an job something can always be found that is not liked. In this case I dislike just about everything except my hours and the people I work with."
good,Home Depot is a great place to learn the basics of home improvement. It served me well as an Home Improvement Appointment Setter.
good,"buena empresa para laborar"
good,"Worked the cash register every day.  Made sure money drawer was balanced before and after shift. Co-workers were easy to work with, and Managment was easy to work with also."
good,Great learning experience with management and other functions within the company.  Plenty of opportunity for growth.
good,"Work was consistently taxing, but the benefits make the environment worth the while. I learned more about how to update appliances and do more things for myself."
good,This was a good summer job where I could get a workout and make a little money. The hours were good but it isn't a place I would want to make a long term career.
good,"The Home Depot is a great company to work for and I enjoy dealing with customers on a regular basis. The company has taught me a lot about people, management skills and trained me to be a better me."
good,Overall Home Depot is a good place to work.  The constant changing in direction of my specific team made job security questionable at best.  Advancement is very limited. Pay and compensation are very good as well.
good,Home Depot was a very pleasant workplace. Our team was very strong and efficient and the only hard part about the jobs is climbing the ladders 20 to 30 feet . Me and all my co workers got along and have even kept In touch since my departure.
good,"This was my first job and for the two years I've worked there, it was an average experience overall."
good,It was always busy I learned alot about everythng including how to be a good manager management was ok co-workers were all different the hardest was keeping things clean and the. Many different hrs. When we had profit sharing.
good,"A typical day at work relied on my basic training skills which kept me adept in the workplace and focused. The hardest part of the job was dealing with insufficiency, the easiest was dealing with customers and learning new skills"
good,"I worked night shifts and the one thing I learned was I do not enjoy working night shifts. However it was a good company to work for, very friendly and overall good work environment. the work day/night was very straight forward, two small breaks throughout the shift. employees get to interact with each other and do work at the same time."
good,There are a few things that are hard about my job. One of the cons about my job is standing on my feet all day. Another con is standing in one spot all day. The last con is i can not leave my register unless i have someone to cover my spot.
good,"I really enjoyed working in the paint department. My supervisor was an awesome teacher and truly cared about the well being of his employees. As far as the higher up managers, I didn't feel that they cared and when I became sick from working with some of the different chemicals they had no compassion and I was let go for missing four days for which I had a doctors note for."
good,"Good place to work, advancement opportunities.  Local management provides training."
good,it was a very good paying job and i really enjoyed it. my school and work schedules were conflicting but other than that really good company
good,I was very close to my supervisor so we made work a very enjoyable place to work at.
good,Work environment very acceptable and enjoyable. Worked 11 1/2 years for Home depot
good,Good place to work just dosent pay enough for what you do. You can advance if you put up the work in doing what needs to be done. I learned that even thou it is a company with a lot of benefits it is ok just the pay sucks.
good,"Started as a part time flooring associate. then made full time. then flooring specialist. then AP. i pushed and bled and worked hard for those promotions. I can say that every store is a way different culture. some stores are great. some are horrible. if your not on your final <reprimand> then i highly suggest transferring to the store that has the best culture. tell em your driving situation has changed, they cant deny you that way <protip>"
good,Everyday at the Home Depot was different.  I enjoyed working with fellow associates and helping customers everyday.  It was rewarding to be known as a person that could get the job done.  The hardest part if the job was just being overwhelmed when obstacles occur that are being my control. I enjoyed making customers and my managers happy by meeting and exceeding their expectations.  I loved being an associate that other associates looked up to and could confide in on personal and on the job functions. In the job I was able to learn more about business and other functions that can help outside the job.
good,"Never a dull moment, with new stories and new needs with every customer. I have had plenty of room to advance with this company, I started out part time seasonal, was kept into a permanent part time position, and then moved up to a full time position. However, I enjoy new opportunities and would like to find something new that I may turn into a life long career. I just cant see myself at home depot for a great deal of time since this last promotion, my life is getting more and more demanding and my pay has only gone up a quarter since day one, even across the four positions I have sought training in. In my opinion someone with this much knowledge and time investment with a company should start to see some sort of compensation so I could afford to live. However it is not my place and thus I must seek something that fits me better."
good,Stock band and Un-package parcels from the receiving section of home depot.
good,"It's a great place to work, and my coworkers are fantastic. Management are there to lend a hand. Only downfall is that not enough hours are given."
good,Working at the appliance department had its fun time but most of the time you had nothing to do. Which can make your day a lot longer then usual but the workers are friendly and are willing to teach the things you need to get the job done. like most jobs they won't teach you everything so they can keep their job so you will learn somethings on your own. The management is good depending at what store you work at.
good,"work long hours and drove to longer days."
good,"The job was fulfilling in many ways, and I enjoyed working with the people there. This company has great benefits, and the salary was very competitive.  I really felt that management cared about their associates. I would recommend this company to friends."
good,Co-workers and mangers are all pretty nice. Standard retail job with some manual labor.
good,"Very flexible company, has great benefits if you are full-time, a very loyal company with tools to help you move up in the company."
good,"I will collect payments over the phone and help customers when needed. I also will help my mangers with duties that need to be done on a daily basics of work,"
good,The hardest part of the job is to keep costumers happy. the most enjoyable part of the job is working with friendly coworkers.
good,"There were very few bad days at Home Depot, but the customer service I gave was my best quality.   My co workers in the department were like a family to me and we continue to get together from time to time.  The hardest part of my job was having management say no to a customer and the most enjoyable was getting that smile from the customer when the job was completed"
good,Great training system and ethics. And always being on time counts and work hard.
good,"great bonus structure twice a year , work life balance is non existent"
good,"Our day consist of setting the bays into POG."
good,I worked there for 6 years. Hardest part was working with customers whom where upset about their special orders and there was nothing more we could do for them.
good,Management suck really bad but bessides that it was a really great place to work
good,"I enjoyed working here but honestly the managers were not reliable or dependable. A typical work day was filled with labor and construction, loading and unloading, stocking and cleaning."
good,"Co workers are great to work with, a typical day at work would be lots of merchandising and price tags to be printed. Step-up to manager giving her a hand on things she need help with. The hardest part of my job would be learning everything there is to be coming a manager and prioritizing what needs to be done first.  most enjoyable is meeting and seeing new customers come in and learning what's in the different departments.."
good,"I work at the Fairfield home depot, as a merchandizer/customer service rep. My main function is to make sure that all the bays and displays in the store is merchandized exactly how the vendors want it based on the planogram specifications. Another key role is to make sure that any customers that needs assistance is guided to the right products for based on their needs."
good,I pulled orders large and small and ask for forklift help when needed. I also made it a personal goal to have friendly customer service. I learned the area fast and accelerated where I could at the time. It was an easy job overall.
good,40 hours a week and management was always in arms length and always helpful. The only thing about the job that was horrible was the pay.
good,"-the pay is better than minimum wage, however, I feel like management does not truly care about their associates"
good,"I work in a very fast pace environment. every day I'm learning new thing about products and vendor policy. My co-workers are team player, which I like. the hardest part of the job is multitasking but enjoy it. the most enjoyable part of the job is resolving and executing my job task before my shift ends."
good,Its a very productive place. You will always be busy but I want something diferent for myself. Working on concrete floors all day can really irritate and hurt you physically if you are not prepared enough.
good,A typical day at work included working with customers one on one. I learned how to put the customers first and how to make them happy. Management was questionable at times but it all worked out. The coworkers were pretty great. The hardest part of the job was the hours.
good,"Customers come first, and that's everyone's goal, And a great goal it is."
good,"Good job for someone that's doesn't mind getting dirty, mostly outside working and work in all type of weather. Co-workers are most of the time cool, and the hardest part is working alone on a busy day when everyone is calling for your help. The most enjoyable part is your more free to move around in different areas and able to learn different experience alone the way."
good,"Building customer relations, learning new aspects of the job, etc"
good,"I learned how to help customers in every aspect of them building there home. Also learning that customers service is number one, and at the end of the day the customer has to leave happy. I also learned the different departments in the store."
good,"make sure my station is in proper order ,assist customers build quotes down stack  merchandise ,stock shelves  , ok management great co workers ,hardest part when u don't have the product on the shelves and u miss the sales enjoyable part is making the customer happy,"
good,I was required to dress down and act as a customer to watch and apprehend shoplifters at Home Depot stores in the tristate area. At the same time I was required to conduct Internal Investigations on employees while also training them in various security procedures and while also conducting operational based duties such as proper disposal of Hazardous waste. I was always busy but never could be everywhere at once which caused a feeling of never getting enough done. There was also the physical harm part in which i had very little in self defense i could do without a possible lawsuit and lost of my job.
good,Company became cutthroat and CEO ran off with millions. Distract managers should support there people not crush them every chance they get.
good,"good company to work for give you over time if needed. The only problem is management has favorites so doesn't give the actual people working hard a chance to advance. Either than that good benefits lots of fun coworkers. Great opportunity to learn new things that you can use on the daily bases i.e. (plumbing, building, painting, gardening)"
good,"Llegar y acomodar mercancia, y darle de alta, asi como dar de baja a la mercancia no apta para la venta, aprendi sobre como poder mercadear con una mercancia, en cuanto a la administracioon eran personas accesibles y siempre dispuestas a ayudar, casi siempre me ponian en departamentos pesados, eso me ayudaba  mantenerme en forma."
good,very physical place to work at also first time learning how to deal with customers
good,Overall a great company to work for but the management needs some improvement. Very demanding far as your time away from work.I learned how to read reports as well as order merchandise. Enjoyed making customers happy with my customer service skills.
good,Install beams.got to travel meat new  co -works.the payed for my gas Hotle rooms.
good,"My day started by driving the perimeter of the store to check on safety and security issues. I would then walk the inside of the building for the same reasons. I would also check merchandising on this walk to ensure everything was ready for opening. I then would check my emails and respond to any urgent issues. I generally would have an all store meeting to get associates pumped up for the day. After the meeting it was time to check on my individual departments to make sure they were running efficiently and that any problems were being resolved and all follow up was being completed. There really was no ""TYPICAL"" day when working retail. I enjoyed the associates very much and knew them all by name (even without their aprons on). The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting customers and vendors, they always had some interesting projects going on, and I liked to be a part of solving their issues."
good,Learned how to assist customers quickly and accurately.  Enjoyed my co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was being able to ring up large orders in a quick fashion.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with great people.
good,"co-workers are friendly, management needs assistance, fast paced environment, lots of job duties"
good,"Great place for advancement, if one is a hard worker, intelligent, and not a slacker.  Hard to get fired from since they are such a huge company, they are bound to follow all laws in fear of lawsuits.  Workloads are manageable when team consists of mostly hard workers, although many college slackers who bring down the moral of many of the full time workers.  If your goal is to move in to management, I would advise anyone to give it a try, but if you are content with low level employment, do not expect to be paid a livable wage."
good,"As a department manager I was responsable for ordering, making sure that all overstock was turning and making sales plan for the department. sales plan for the year $1,560,000. and had over $ 300,000. of inventory at any given moment. developing associaes and holding them accountable, as well as writing scheduals, and training my team in new procedures. "
good,"Great co-workers! I learned that I do not enjoy working on Sundays because it infringes on family time for me. There are many opportunities there, but I am not big box material."
good,"a lot of favoritism was involved employees working harder than others and not getting recognized. Other than that you get your breaks and lunch when it is time, management is very friendly and put the employees first most of the time. The hardest part of the job would be a cashier to just stand in one spot all day not allowed to wander off and help a customer when its so busy no one else can. The thing I liked most about working at Home Depot would be the variety of work you do on a daily there is always something new to learn and grow from."
good,"OK, but could be a little better pay for freight associates, but very interesting place to work."
good,"With hard work and long hours I was able to advance quickly.  Great place to work for the first years of my career, but recently has made changes that make it harder to do one's job.  Employees know how to play the system and there is no recourse for management team to take, resulting in low employee moral.  No schedule consistency so don't make any plans in your personal life.  Turnover rates have gotten worse because of it."
good,I had a great relationship with all of the core people that worked in the store on a daily basis.  Morale was improved and associates liked to help each other out.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with district management who had to have it their way and would not listen to anyone else.  Work life balance was a joke.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the relationships that I built with my associates and customers.
good,I believe that I am able to work more hours. It takes me 30-40 minutes to travel to work everyday. It is an inconvenience and but I would like to become a fulltime employee to appreciate it more.
good,me gusto por que aprendi muchas cosas diferentes ami antiguo trabajo
good,"For me a typical day at the Home Depot was seeing regular faces and new faces. I've been there for over a year and I'm pretty well at knowing where the products where, so most of the time I would be running around the store helping customers, look for product numbers and etc. I enjoyed working with my co workers I always tried to find a way to enjoy work."
good,"There is a lot of focus on leadership and entrepeneurship. It gives you   some freedom to really work with customers and help them with their projects. Downside is that the pressures of the economy plague the hours and floor support. The culture is there, the schedule flexibility is there, the support and financial stability could be better."
good,Expect hard work and lots of customer interaction. Managers are all well trained but supervisors are moved around to much to have expert knowledge of their departments.
good,"A typical day starts off with checking the till making sure i have enough money to start my shift. What i have learned on this job is to have a friendly attitude despite my situations outside of work. Management is wonderful so helpful with the employees and with the customers. They make themselves available when needed. My co-workers are absolutely respectable, dependable, and always have a good attitude dealing with the public. The hardest part of the job is standing up and enduring the long stretch of the hours and being able to withstand different situations. The most enjoyable part is when the customers are satisfied with the purchases and interested in coming back into our store with smiling faces."
good,"each day at work was a new experience for me. From laughing and "
good,"its really wasn't a great job for me, because we have to do 10 to 11 hours every week."
good,"My typical day consisted of walking with my assistant manager to establish a worklist. Then, I delegated my list to my associates to complete at the end of their shift. I was constantly inudated with mutiple tasks at once and juggling my priorities to appease upper management. I learn how to efficiently delegate and grow my associates to enhance their knowledge."
good,"I worked at the Brampton north location, and the job itself wasn't bad, 6am - 3pm monday to friday (PT). However, the moment I got hired I noticed how much gossip and talking behind peoples backs there was. The boss negatively projected on the whole team (for what ever reasons I don't know) and the employees would respond with gossiping and rude comments. "
good,Home depot is a overall good company to work for. I think Home depot could be a little more loyal to there short and long term employees to give them the best chance to be successful. Home Depot overall have great benefits as well as bonuses to compensate each and every employee.
good,"Every work day starts early. Our work can be split into two categories: general servicing or projects. General servicing involves correcting any discrepancies on the sales floor. Projects can involve dealing with more in-depth problems or preparing the store for any upcoming events."
good,"As I have been working at the home depot as of A year and a half now I can see that Home Depot as I work the third shift, They mean and say one thing but truly they mean another, course mind you i do work the third shift.The morning openers and closer run around and push all the work on top of the Third shift party there are some members of the Department such as Department Heads that they whine and complain about how things are not getting down correctly. "
good,"didnt like shift work, long hours on your feet great people to work with "
good,"Typical work day - I usually worked a day shift starting at 5a or 6a, depending on whether if I was cashier or bookkeeper. I learned some home improvement techniques and a lot more about bookkeeping. Management was iffy. I put my trust more into the department heads more than anyone else. My co-workers were easy to get along with. Like most places, you have to earn people's respect, so I just showed and proved. Hardest part was the pay, even though i could get close to 40hrs. Still wasn't a lot to live off of. Most enjoyable were the friendships I still have from that job."
good,"I manage all aspects of the Asset Protection side of the business for nine stores, which include mitigating both shrink and safety.  Each store runs an average of 24 million in volume. I have learned to manage both remotely as well as being a global thinker. Each day there is something new to tackle and with such a fast pace business I have to be able to execute at a high level. My peers have become a great source to bounce ideas as well as develop new ways to mitigate both shrink and safety. "
good,A typical day at work would be assisting customers with their purchases. My main duties are on the front end of the store. I am sometimes the first and the last person that customers see when entering and exiting the store. My greeting is key in ensuring customers have a enjoyable experience while shopping at The Home Depot.
good,"I have learned a great deal about the retail business and construction products. A typical day would include being a cashier, project estimater, order picker, prospecting for new business, order follow up, and provide excellent customer service during all of this. I really enjoyed my co-workers there just is not enough of them. The hardest part of the job is doing all that I do in a day in a store that is very short staffed. The best part of the job is taking care of my customers."
good,Enjoyed working for HD. Co workers were great and it was a blast to help customers complete their projects.
good,typical day was greeting customers and pushing on with work
good,Unload freight from trucks
good,"no work life balance, long hours and not a great place to work, hated it"
good,"Came to work, helped in multiple departments including: lumber, hardware, blinds, flooring, and garden center. Learned much about the home improvement industry, and how to be flexible for any department or situation. Management was good to work with although at times could be bureaucratic in nature. Hardest part of the job was the manual labor, the most enjoyable part was the other associates that worked along side of me."
good,Great Place to work. Management is flexible and understandable. Most enjoyable part is helping the customers
good,They need to be more flexible with their fulltime associates as far as availability. If someone is willing to give a company 40 hours a week of their lives why not give them the small ability of a flexible schedule that fits their need?. If this can be done for the part-timers it can be done for the fulltimers
good,"A normal day at The Home Depot consisted of arriving at the paint desk where I worked with 5 other associates, all of whom were friendly. I would assist customers first and when they were all taken care of I would continue into the 3 aisles of our department and downstock, organize and order items. I had the closing shift most of the time where I would front face everything, clean behind the desk and organize it very neatly, make sure all hazards were taken care of and make it look presentable for the opener the next day.The hardest part of the job was taking on everything by myself when there is a line of customers, but I always managed to handle it well. The most enjoyable part was working with my fellow friendly associates. It made my job a bit easier and more fun."
good,"Very stable company plenty of room for promotion, however with the mandatory flexible scheduling for most depts. it makes family life tough."
good,"I worked for Home Depot for almost six years in two separate locations and in the beginning found I found great satisfaction in my daily work and responsibilities. My first year at Home Depot I received employee of the year and many other accolades and kudos and homer awards. After 5 1/2 years and transferring to Florida and acquiring new managers at our store, I found that Home Depot was unwilling to understand and meet my needs as a disabled person. Even after providing required physician's documentation for my disability, I was often asked to go beyond my physical capabilities. When I referenced my disability I was told I was not a valued employee and was treated very poorly on many occasions. Increased work load and physical responsibilities beyond my capabilities were placed in my care. I was no longer able to fulfill my position. It was apparent that the managers at my store did not like me as a person. However I continued to received customer service appreciation awards and letters. I was written up several times for duties I could not physically perform. I was not going to give up! In the end the managers who did not like me wrote me up for the three times I was late and one absence(over a period of 6 years), and they fired me. Story over, I still enjoyed Home Depot as a corporation for the first 5 1/2 years but did not appreciate the poor management in the last six months of my employment."
good,People were easy to work with. They were friendly and we got the job done.
good,"The company provides an opportunity to succeed, it is open"
good,My job at Home Depot is to distribute incoming freight around the store over night and then stock shelving and displays with this freight. I also had to make sure that all displays were fully stocked by packing down products from overhead storage.
good,I would get to work check in and then move the carts and stay by the cashiers until a custmer needed help taking something to their car. We would always have radio to communicate with each other so if they needed me somewhere else I could be there.
good,set schedule when the opportunity rises and learn how to control inventory and driving machines
good,"A typical day at work for me consists of coming in an hour before the store opens and make sure the store opens on time. I have to prove the change drawer, bring up the change drawer to the proper amount, put money in self checkouts that need it for the current day, send tills up for the current day, and open self check outs. After the store opens i prove the tills from the previous day and make any cash and check deposits needed. I then count the vault and get a manager to verify the deposits and recount the vault. What i learned from this job is that if you try your hardest you will get rewarded. I get along with all the people i work with. The majority of them are some of the kindest people i have ever worked with and been around. The hardest part of the job would have to be making sure the accounts are balanced. The most enjoyable part of the job is the responsibility that comes with it."
good,"El trato con diferentes tipos de clientes , buen trabajo en equipo , aprendi mucho respecto a ventas y la mercancia ."
good,This was a very task oriented and procedure based position. Consisting of repetitive procedures daily.
good,We have task for the day.
good,"Depending on which department you work in, it can be fun or tiresome. Forklifts are a plus."
good,Interacted with hundreds of customers on a daily basis to help them find products that they need.
good,The Home Depot can be a very fun and exciting place to work. All of my co-workers are friendly and the customers are just as pleasant. If it wasn't for my fellow associates and daily shoppers i couldn't survive working for this company. Our managers are laughable at best. They do not care about the well being of our customers or even our associates. I have personally seen managers ignore customers yet punish associates for not making a sale. We have more people quit in the last month because of our new management then the four years prior that i have been with this company. If the managers would follow the procedures they laid out for the associates it would be a wonderful place to work.
good,"No set hours as full time employee day to day was basic customer service skills and making sure the store was in shoppable status. I learned how to do basic book keeping skills,how to do inventory control,and teamwork skills. Most of the managers were fair and willing to get out and help where needed when things needed to get done. The chance for advancement was great for some people and not so great for those of us that could be moved around to diffrent departments, because they did not want to tie you down to one spot. They hire some of the best people for the job therefore the empolyees meshed well for the most part. the hardest part of the job is being able to help a customer in a deptment you do not know much about but in most cases there is always someone in the store that either help you answer questions, or come and help the customer themselves at the touch of a button. I enjoyed the people and the extra insentive of having cookouts for holidays and christmas parties it really kept the moral up."
good,my co-worker are great people to work with they are very friendly so is the management. the hardest part is standing in one spot for eight hours. the most enjoyable part is my co-worker
good,"have fun with co workers and the job is a easy task to finish, we learn retail skills, merchandising the hardest part of the job is nothing"
good,This Company has a full Heath Care package for full time employees
good,"Come in at 6am, change around the stock for seasonal resets or change from management resets."
good,"A typical day at The Home Depot required me to clock in, work, lunch, and back to work. I really didnt enjoy working there because they made me feel out of place and not like one of the employees. In other words they were discriminative towards me."
good,Consistently executing the merchandising strategies
good,I like this job because it was a great position and i loved the people but had personal problems at the time and missed work and i regret losing this job.
good,Allowed to excel as a Flooring Professional and was provided with the training and certifications required to do a superlative job. My peers were helpful and always supportive as was my immediate supervisor.
good,It's ok to work there but never expect to pay all your bills on time. All my coworkers management and non-management complain about the low pay.
good,"I really enjoyed this job, loved the people that i worked with and it didn't feel like i was going to work it just felt like i was going to have fun and make money when doing it."
good,"fun and fast paced, great employees, and great customers. It gives you an overwheliming sense of pride by doing your best to go above and beyond while trying to help a customer."
good,The company tries to be a family oriented company. It is a great place to work but there could be some adjustments.
good,"The health benefits available at the Home Depot when I started in 2002 was amazing, it continued relatively good until I left in 2007, although some perks were removed. Home Depot also did tuition reimburstment, encouraging personal advancement. They had a merit badge system which was an incentive for hardwork and dedication to customer service."
good,Home Depot has been my job of 4 years while attending college they have been flexible with my school schedule and has been a positive workplace.
good,"Home Depot is Very diverse, have several program in tact to help The employees and the community. Employees can invest in the company as well as be an active member in helping in the community. Home Depot offers, investment within the company or allow associates to go to school to continue their education."
good,"It was a good job, but they didn’t work with my school schedule so I had to put in my 2 weeks and find another job who can work with my schedule and I did"
good,"A temoprary job, not very organized and if your a student they don't really respect your school schedule. The coworkers are nice, however the younger ones tend to be very nosy and clique like."
good,"Great company to work for, they care about employees, you just need to get lucky with your store management cause thats the main downfall of any job. had a racist manager at my store that would only care about his paid vacations and was nasty to all the employees."
good,"Home depot is Good for young adult first jobs, or a 2nd part time job for alittle extra spending money, or for a retired  adult looking for a part time job."
good,"I was hired in December of 2018, worked all the way to August of 2019 where i put my 2 week notice in."
good,Sales program changed to much for me to make a living. Later we didn’t have a written schedule to work with. Our previous customer list was removed from our computers. I did like my job and Home Depot workers and customers
good,"It has vending machines, a microwave, lots of tables and chairs, toaster oven, and toaster. Also they order pizza at least once a month and there is a food cupboard in there if you forgot your lunch."
good,load truck flatbed and box leadership ok manger could be better great work culture dealing with manger was the hardest part of the job meeting good customer make schedule best part of job
good,I worked there as a seasonal job it was great just needs better leadership but overall great atmosphere my city workers are very nice and great coaching
good,"It's a decent company, but poor training on new employees cause issues with process. But generally great people work there. Just don't know what to do sometimes."
good,Home Depot is an interesting place to work. My coworkers were diverse and different throughout the store. The workplace environment allowed me to learn several new skills like driving a forklift. I was able to do my job easily.
good,"My work experience at Home Depot has kept me on my toes, as management pushes me to expand my skill set (not pay rate) to improve the store and appease customers. I am grateful though, as I know this experience has given me the ability to excel in any working environment."
good,"Great employees, there was always someone to help when help is needed. Training they need to work on that more. They just put you on the floor with no training or no shadow buddy. Pay is not that great but benefits are great."
good,"The Home Depot is a great place to learn about certain trades such as carpentry, electrical, and plumbing. It challenges salesmanship skills and critical thinking each day. Being a receiving manager helps hone supervising skills and requires properly delegating to achieve a successful work day."
good,"Some of the management is near impossible to please with work alone. Otherwise it was an enjoyable experience, before health issues placed a target on my back."
good,As a cashier the job wasnt bad at all i made the mistake of going to service desk. after a years worth of complaints and nothing being done about the problems and trying to unsuccessfully put in my notice i finally decided to quit due to my mental health
good,Majority of my co workers were great people. Store manager was a great guy. My supervisor and two others always had it out for me. MAKE ALLIES FAST. There is often in-fighting that is unavoidable.
good,Its a good place to work and the benefits are nice but the pay is really poor. work is really easy and the management stuff is really understanding. it is really hard to save with the pay being so poor.
good,The people that work there are nice. The customers that went there are interesting. You gain new experience and new friendships. Overall it’s not bad but it’s not the best.
good,In a honestly I loved working at Home Depot but I had other plans. They do work with your hours and everyone there is very kind. If you like to work then you’ll enjoy working there. It is very busy on weekdays but if your a fast paste worker you’d get the hang of it.
good,"The Home Depot is a good job for employees that have a steady income as a part time associate. The amount of hrs you can be scheduled for can range from 20-30 hrs one week to 8 or none the next week. Full-time associates do not have this problem. I need a steady income and after working here going from position to position just to get enough hrs. Worked extra hrs when they needed it. Even the days before and after hurricanes when i had my family and home to tend to. I put the mission before my own needs but it does not seem to be mutual from the company. I go above and beyond my job for my company, I just wish to be apart of a team. The Home Depot Assistant store managers are a great group of guys and they do have an open door policy which is good to have."
good,"The Home Depot has an excellent workplace culture. Especially if you have the right leadership team. However, corporate does not want to allow anyone under the ASM level to make enough money to live in or around the stores' locations. So while they do have a plethora of benefits, they rarely apply to most of the employees. Pay is low, especially compared to competitors and the national average for each respective job title. Advancement opportunities are very available. However, the higher you clime the ladder the worse the work/life balance becomes."
good,i enjoyed the environment . looking for better apporutinites for more growth and benefits. i want to work in the medical field i have alot of experienced working with people
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job are the co workers and supervisors. They have been very positive and very supportive. Most days this is an easy job, once you have learned and have most of the information stuffed in your head.  The most stressful part of the job are the systems. You will be trying to place an order quickly for the customer and the information needs to be entered multiple times. The customer is usually in a hurry and growing impatient. Also, the customers situations can be very challenging and some customers are gracious and some are not. As an employee you enjoy helping and solving issues within policy. Surveys can be brutal and customers hold your overall performance in their opinion of past and present experience. This will affect your pay rate and advancement in the company. Even though you are doing the right thing, showing respect, or giving excellent customer service on your part. I feel I have gained a lot of experience and knowledge and have grown a lot from this job."
good,I enjoyed the job and co workers.  I loved the hours. It was a fast pace.  Love helping customers  get their products or helping with returns. Love to show people where things are located in the store.
good,"Throughout my time at TheHomeDepot I felt the pay for the amount of work required on a daily basis was sub par at best. I really enjoyed the management Team who were fair, understanding, and supportive. A lot of good people work at TheHomeDepot."
good,"The Home depot offers an excellence opportunity for learning and honing one's skills in retail. The lack of coverage and dedicated help, causes hard-working associates to be overwhelmed and frustrated."
good,"The Home Depot is a great company to work for. They have great benefits. Management can be a disaster at times, but when they have it together it is an amazing environment to work in."
good,"It's okay place to work if you're retired military and just out of high school or college."
good,Even though my sales are more than 100% over the average in the district for 2 years I still don't make what the average millwork specialist makes at home depot. I have talked to other associates that have been in my position and have been told that it is the most difficult of the specialist positions. People don't last in the position more than a couple of months because it is very hard to learn and the training is minimal. I used to receive praise and homer awards but in the last year not much. It is nice that I am left alone. However when I am asked what I can do to improve myself and earn more I'm just told that I'm doing great and keep it up.
good,"Only person on sales floor for more that five hours at a time. Then being MOD, completing my duties for the day. Also, providing great customer service. And, problem solving for customers and associates. I enjoy the problem solving as I like making a difference in someone's day. I love completing a project and moving on to the next challenge. I also enjoy knowing at the end of my day, I have completing most of my duties for the day."
good,"Provided computer systems"
good,The Home Depot is a great place to work for the right person. They work to help there employees on and off the job. Also 85 to 90% of upper management started out as hourly employees.
good,"I loved my job at home depot i havealways been in one way pr another a leader.  So being a manager there, although i struggled once in a while, I found it a very rewarding position as well as a great learning experience."
good,"fast paced and people were great to work with, you could train and change departments for further advancement. A good profit sharing bonus plan"
good,"I excelled at my position as sales in the Flooring/home decor department."
good,Scheduling was horrendous. Only one person per department so there were always waves of customers upset. Team work is nonexistent as the only times that it was shown was when the higher ups arrived.
good,"As a merchindiser, I would restock any items missing on the shelves, as a team of about 12-15 we would move together in different aisles of the store to ensure that section was completed. The managers were kind to give us two 15 minute breaks which would give the team more time to energize ourselves for early morning shifts which started at 5 am. The customers and coworkers were all diverse. The hardest part of the job as a female would be moving the heavy equipment such as long wood pieces, gallons of liquid components, large metal pieces, and more all alone, I would always need help when it came to those items. The enjoyable part of the job was working as a team and getting the job done."
good,"fast paced, sometimes stressful, good schedule for merchandisers. Tuition assistance up to 3k per year. Insurance goes up every year which eliminates the sorry raise you get which is also just once per year."
good,"Home Depot can be a great place to work depending on the culture of the store and how strict management is. There are a lot of demands on employees to sell, help customers, and keep shelves stocked. It can be very stressful as the help scheduled does not meet the demand of the customers. Training is on the floor basically. You have classes to complete, but these classes dont help very much with real life on the floor experience."
good,"The Home Depot focused on Customer Service. Having product knowledge in your department was a great plus, and you usually had someone to train you. It was rewarding to help Do-it -yourself customers to complete projects."
good,"apron on, clock in, get to sales floor, have opening shift meeting, stock shelves, assist customers clean isles. over all job is easy but it can be very slow."
good,Fast paced and no job security for senior management. Great benefits. Compensation could be better. No discounts given to employees. Management can be inconsistent.
good,If you listen and learn its a great place to move around. Like most fields you have people who will care and some who do not. I worked hard and had previous experience and was no considered for a supervisor role which was given to someone with no experience.
good,great place to make retail a career. opportunity for growth since most promotions are done from within. potential for financial growth over time but requires time in the company
good,"I say It was a fairly easy job, but the night manager was not all that reliable. Other than that the job was pretty simple although it was quite stressful."
good,"Nice chill work environment, not to much to say it was back breaking but a great part time job. Management was okay very helpful but when asked about a raise or a a different role in the company no one could get back to me for over a course of a few weeks. After approaching them multiple times taking note of the conversation and then forgotten."
good,"The employees of the Home Depot are all great and share a mission to take care of the customer. It is a very friend and united place to work. "
good,Good job overall just needs new management. Worked ten plus years and not appreciated. Co workers are friendly well maintained stores. Good benefits and hours.
good,this job is great for individuals needing benefits and protection within a company. also they are accommodating and understanding towards schedule adjustments.
good,"My hour at work was Monday and Friday .Also flexible  time and handling garden department ,change price in different location of the store .objecting to change among the store ."
good,Surprisingly a great place to work. Very easy job and if you want to advance upper management takes notice as long as you broadcast your interest. Nothing overly stressful and management depends on each individual store.
good,Greeting all customers asking customers for any assistance they may need giving out answers on product of various departments love the diversity and different cultural backgrounds in the workplace. I wouldn't say anything was hard-working there I always go above and beyond until the matter is solved. I value  every customer individually.
good,"Working at Home Depot made me realize not everyone is meant to work retail. Some of my managers were good to work for and were generally understanding of personal issues. Others, however, were very condescending as if they had made it in life because they were an assistant manager at a Home Depot. The pay leaves a lot to be desired even though I am qualified on two pieces of equipment and have to operate the saws."
good,It fun working in the paint department. Like the people the environment. Like helping customers and delivering great customer service. Like the responsibilities.
good,A typical day at Home depot would consist of checking customers out and providing excellent customer service while doing so. I learned to always be nice to every customer because you never know how there day is also how to drive credit cards. The management team at Home depot is great. The work place culture is good also. I don't find that any part of this job is hard. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to enter act with different people
good,"When I worked at Home Depot. It was very fast-paced and your work was expected to be fast and efficient. The other cashiers were very competitive, though it was a friendly work environment,"
good,I didn't feel like I met the requirements of working at The Home Depot. It wasn't my type of job so I left looking for another to fulfill my potential dreams.
good,"Daily work was manageable. I learned a great deal about appliance, kitchen and bath products. The management team was very motivated and had compassion for its employees. The workplace culture was teamwork oriented with employees who continuously helped co-workers when needed. The hardest part of the job was the balance between servicing customers and maintaining inventory on the showroom floor. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was the opportunity to learn so much about home improvement and repair products."
good,Must show up to work no matter what the weather. breaks where good. it is a boring but fast paced environments. Training was good but sparse. I rather work put doors
good,"Home Depot was a fun workplace, great atmosphere and team environment! They offered flexible schedules and worked with people who were single parents, had second jobs, or people who have bus schedules.  However, the pay was very low and no benefits for part time employees.  Great place to work for students, single parents, a second job, and/or elderly people.  My manager and all the management staff were very friendly and loved helping their employees as well as their customers, same with all my co-workers.  I love the fact that Home Depot has a program to help people who are less fortunate, although I feel they should offer discounts for their employees. I enjoyed helping the kids when they offered their workshops for children."
good,"A typical day would be front facing stock, cleaning bays, helping customers, helping load customers. I learned a lot about different kinds of equipment and their uses. Management was fun and generally easy to work with. Workplace culture was informal but entertaining. The hardest part of the job would be working the department alone when someone would call of and having help from people that dont understand the department. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co workers were always willing to help."
good,Good company to start off with all depends if you see your self working for home depot for 20+ years but if you want something better you'll use it has a stepping stool to get you ahead in life
good,"I had a great experience working for Home Depot if only they were able to pay more,  I may be still working there.  I believe advancement was there but may take a little longer than I was willing to wait."
good,"I worked there for 10 years having excellent sales, performance reviews, and winning honors.  Sadly, in my last few months I spotted numerous safety issues that were not really addressed and some of the employees became negative toward me without any real reason for being so.  The issue was addressed with management but nothing was done.  If they wanted it to go that way, I was not going to spend my time upset and conflicted about working situations that should not occur in a mature environment..so I simply resigned with the attitude of gratitude toward the employees and management that had been so great during the majority of my time there and wish the overall company the best."
good,"The biggest challenge is the weather. With summer being the worst with the heat depending on where you live with a normal day consisting of helping costumers left heavy objects in their car, tying it to their car, and basic clean up and heavy lifting.  As hard as it can be, meeting customers and free time you can have is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"A typical day at work, hard work, fast paste, making sure we keep our customers satisfied, restocking, keeping a clean environment, helping customers."
good,It’s a good first job if you have no work experience . Friendly people and easy to get along with everyone . Great working place . Not to bad for full time
good,A typical day will be helping out customers with any questions that they have. Making sure that the customers get what they want. Advising customers to get the entire project.
good,Management put a lot of responsibility on it's worker for little pay.The company has great health care also it seam the your are secure in your job.I bee try to move up in the company with no luck.
good,Home Depot was a good company to work for it had a good benefits.I worked there for a year after I got out of HighSchool. I made $10 an hour. they gave me an hour for lunch and good benefits.
good,The work scheduling is horrible and some of the young females can not be trusted . The Managers are okay but do not check on the associates working in the Tool Rental department .
good,"It was a good experience, learned a lot from working the Customer Service Desk. Many daily interactions with all sorts of customers. Dealing with any mistakes and resolving any issues."
good,"Home depot is trying to save money by cutting shifts, asking you to get rid of your overtime, even if it is 15 minutes by leaving early or taking a longer lunch"
good,"I enjoyed working for Home Depot. The management was nice and fair but would not have wanted to stay longer, it was a temporary job for me at the time. Friendly environment, fast paced and coworkers were amazing."
good,"I've been working at the home depot for almost three years now; it has its pros and cons, that's for sure. There were some good days and some bad days. Retail is not for everyone and once you get into retail, everyone thinks it's the only job in the whole entire world and after a while, you get kind of stuck. There are some great benefits and overall it can be a fun job depending on who your coworkers are but long-term it's kind of draining can become tedious and boring."
good,"Home Depot is a good place to work. Order pickers are probably the most demanding position to work in seeing as you are needed by mostly the entire store to help with problems. For the more involved pickers it is more than just picking orders, management looks to you to solve problems since they know you can handle it. So you have to deal with more than the job demand."
good,"Ok if you need the money not a place for life. easy work lots of good things like free food at least once a month, profit sharing. too many people work for life."
good,I work in HR Sevices primarily composed of hourly Associates and they are more catered to than salaried Associates who are no management. Career development within my specific organization is limited as well.
good,"Basically you supervise yourself, you know what you have to do and you do it.  Times goes by faster when you're busy.  So you keep busy.  As long as you do your job management doesn't bother you."
good,Really used to love going to work there but through the years things changed a lot. I always worked above and beyond but the raises stopped reflecting that. they do and round table so the people sitting at the table are in control of your raise if weren't in their favor then your raise showed it.
good,"I worked at Home Depot for two years as a garden/lot associate. Everyone who works here is very friendly and cooperative. Structure of this company is stable. For a part time job, I did enjoy working here only because of the awesome coworkers. The actual job itself is okay, nothing to rave about but not disappointing or unsatisfied either."
good,when I started I was not told until after hired that I had to have one day on the weekend for open availability ended up having to work around scheduling with my husband.  Originally thought that I could work days all through out the week. They told me if I didn't have one day open that they couldn't keep me after already he in me on. Applied for full time got part time instead at only 15 hrs a week.
good,"home depot is a great company they strive to give to the community and they take care of their employees.  however, when it comes to management the compensation is great if you negotiate your salary, but you will work many hours way above 50 hours and its all year round not when holiday season is around.  if you looking to be a work dog in management this is the place but there is no work life balance i never saw my family."
good,"Working at The Home Depot allowed me to develop so many skills and learn so much about the company, products, and customer service. The job consisted of stocking, informing, keeping your department clean, watering, able to drive machinery, and a lot of customer service. A warehouse style store required associates to be familiar with as much product as possible. The Home Depot did have so many tools and training for us associates to provide the best customer service. The management was the most helpful. Ultimately, I felt that the work I provided for the company was not compensated for accurately."
good,"Going to work was like getting ready to doing close to nothing. You have to make a credit page about every 15 minutes and push credit but when it isn't rush hour, it was incredible slow and boring."
good,"I worked the morning shift, a lot of merchandise left behind by previous shift, always had to pick up the slack, but I like to stay busy, so it wasn't to bad"
good,"customer service, cash handling, signage change, inventory, preparing area for next business day according to company standards, display set up and display break down, set up deliveries"
good,it was a great job for me in my stage of life.  i was able to earn a livable wage as well as have time to complete my degree through a flexible work schedule and an understanding management team
good,Working at home depot has helped me greatly with communication skills between myself and customers. It has helped me with understanding the work value of a work place. I learned to drive the forklift.
good,through out my time here i at times it felt like it was a fun environment but at other times it felt like i was being used in situations i did'nt need to be in.
good,"Management refuses to hire full time employees, preferring to expand their part time force instead of attempting to keep and develop talent."
good,"Home Depot is a good job however it has its pros and cons, you don’t always get to chose your schuble, sometimes it can get in the way of your school or other job that you have."
good,I always tried to stay busy when I completed my job tasks and would help anyone in need. There wasn't much of a hassle with any of the managers or supervisors
good,There are several benefits to working with the Home Depot. A few bad managers along with every one thinking they are your mamager but overall it was a good experience.
good,"The job was fun and perfect for what i needed school wise etc. management was decent, most managers were great some of the ASM's were okay to work with."
good,Great Benefits and Friendly Environment . learned great skills at the place want to be a manager but defiantly did not happen for personal reasons i guess.
good,"Awesome benefits and employee resources, especially tuition reimbursement. Awesome opportunities for career growth, education support, and health and personal benefits."
good,you will be placed in a position you did not apply for. pay is high and a lot of sacrifice to give. company incentives are great. some managers are fair.
good,Home depot tries to accommodate each individual. It's not set in stone but they try to be fair... Every job has good and bad... Anyone working there can make it what you want it to be. I loved my job but the pay was bad.
good,"The people I worked for and with at the HD were wonderful.  Kind, caring like being with family.  I met and helped so many people and thoroughly enjoyed that part of my job. "
good,"Supervisors and management were more than willing to place cashiers at their desired positions (garden, self-checkout, returns, etc.). Also genuinely wanted employees to do well and be happy with their jobs."
good,"To check customers merchandise out, take inbound calls, do refunds & exchanges tell customers where to find the merchandise in the store, To be able to listen & clear up customers complaints.  The management was very understanding and helpful in the training process.  To satisfy customers complaints & always giving 100 % to customers & coworkers."
good,You will meet a diversity of people in order to work in this environment you must like people.  You will find yourself helping other with there job and customers with good and bad attitudes.
good,"Don’t judge by what am saying go see for yourself, honestly.i always wanted to work for this company and was let down by people who came to work to be lazy upset or look for gossip or trouble, Job is like every man or woman for self."
good,"It depends on the location, Many managers don't have the people and management skills to  provide a good work environment. In todays retail market numbers are what counts. And that makes for a difficult situation for all concerned."
good,My average workday would usually consist of me packing out an aisle and assisting my fellow associates with any tasks they had to accomplish as well customers.
good,"Decent place to work, easy work and easy ways to deal with rude customers, job is fun and co workers help and make i better throughout the day, good place"
good,"Depending on who are your coworkers or manager the job environment is good but if someone don't like the management you are under or one of your coworkers you are a walking target, some of the management their will point the finger at you even when you do your job right, but its still is a great company its just some of the management are competitive and some are cut throat it depends on your location and the management team that you are around."
good,"I can agree w other reviews stating managers pick favorites, but it is normally those few associates who out-perform others who become favorites. You see a lot of associates who believe they should earn more but don't understand you get paid what you are worth. Opportunity to move lateral/up within the company. Pro desk was fast-paced, stressful but rewarding in helping your customers build their businesses. Managers staffed departments extremely thin which led to upset customers constantly. Short staffing never really allowed for us to get ahead of the days work. I most enjoyed building relationships with my customers and helping them grow their successful businesses. I worked my tail off to give my managers a return on their investment (ME) and enjoyed my time there overall."
good,"It's a great place to work unfortunately the balance between work and salary compensation is dissatisfactory. Accomplishing all task and drive business only to feel inadequate because of a lack of recognition. A typical day begins with a morning meeting discussing new projects, business goals also our metrics ends with a stretch routine that will able associated to perform task safely. Emphises is placed on safety practices to protect everyone's well being. Working along vendors and store managers we influence the stores appearance. Projects also upload daily and time is allotted to execute along with our scheduled store service. We service the whole store twice a month, allotted 20-30 minutes per section. I instruct associated to decontaminate, set to planogram, fill merchandise, fix/update displays and order/replace signage if need to. While this gets done I conduct quality walks along with coaching and cross training. Included in my daily task I respond to numerous emails regarding vendors and district merchandising needs"
good,Advancement is not easy and overall work conditions are ok. Company does provide insurance and perks. Unfortunately I like my job just not a lot of the people that I work with
good,"Work environment was typical retail environment. Weekends, most holidays were work days. The business involved taking acre of the customers. This involved heavy lifting form DIY advice."
good,"the overall atmosphere is fast paced.  Cashiers don't get full time hours, it is extremely hard to move up and get full time unless you work in a department."
good,great training. work can be fast paced at times and sometimes it can be slow. I worked as a cashier. always kept busy. great benefits. not enough hours to work. time and days to come in constantly changing.
good,"Nice place to work if you don't need a lot of money. Customers are easy to help, managers assist when needed, needs for departments are met. Breaks and lunches are mandatory so you are replenished on the floor."
good,"at the store you are an able body , pay should be higher. If you want a clear cut job you can be happy with the doable tasks of your position.There is an independence between store team members."
good,"exelente empresa,exelente ambiente de trabajo y estabilidad laboral"
good,"Employees  are awesome, shame that the company doesn't do much to keep them. People in and out too fast at my store. I have survived 4 managers and countless amount of associates for just 2.5 years."
good,"I get to work at 5am, my starts off with cleaning and stocking the bay, making sure that i have all the proper product where they should be at. Then I get to find product if it is not where it was said to be then place it where it belongs, clean up our pop area, put out the pop that needs to be replaced."
good,"It's a fast paced environment, very friendly and helpful associates.  Typical day at work is unloading a truck in a timely fashion, and replenishing the shelves with products."
good,"The store I was hired at is one of the top stores in the district, sp a lot of eyes would be on us because people from corporate would always come in and see what we would be up to."
good,For the past 8 years I have experienced my ups and downs at my job. I have made many friends and worked with some great managers. I truly do enjoy What i do and the people I work with.
good,quick fast paced environment. management very laid back and upbeat as long as your keeping up  during the fast pace days ahead of you.made room for upward mobility
good,The hardest part of the job its that its a fast paced job so you habe to adapt quickly. The most enjoable part of the job is the basketball hoops and ping pong table and also the other employee are nice.
good,Home depot store retailers are ran at the same standard of their corporate offices. So although it is a retail store that doesn't diminish the amount of expectations placed on its employees.
good,"Being at the home depot is a okay job "
good,"Depends on when they have me scheduled to come in. Morning, I arrive at 5 to clean the paint machines and do a safety walk through the aisles of my department. collect my returns an properly put them away. Make sure that holes are filled with right merchandise.. I have learned the differences in paints, stains an other things. Management  has been great as in answering questions and making sure you have fun. It is fast paces as in working there for you want to make sure that you completely take care if the customers needs. moving the 5 gallons of paints and also having to bring something that is heavy from the over head bins. Making sure you have given your best to each customer that you have come in contact with.    ."
good,"If you are relaible and a hard worker, and want things to be done right, everyone in the store that doesn't share your menatlity will ask you to do thier jobs no matter how big or small they are. Once you are marked as efficient and reliable it would be a smart time to leave because they will overwork you instead of getting some of the people who hide in the breakroom to help out. "
good,i was a merchandiser for home depot and the company didnt help us much the associates were rude some were nice and we didnt work as a team everybody did there own thing
good,"Best experience I've had working within a retail environment.  Good people and good benefits.   "
good,"Short handed most of the time which makes the job a little tough. Scheduling is fairly easy, if you need a day off you can get it most of the time. Other than that a nice place to work."
good,"Home Depot is very good to their employees.  They offer a benefit package for their part-time workers, but they fail to offer full-time employment for part-time employment. They rarely offer extra hours."
good,"It is a good entry level job, and there is always chances to move up or to another department. It will also greatly increase your knowledge of tools and home improvement."
good,Management has always been an issue at The Home Depot. They fire and replace like no tomorrow. Be a regular associate and you will have job security. As a specialist there is a quota to meet that is very capable of happening if you stay out of your department. Specialist position contradicts itself in a way that they expect you to stay within a department that makes lack of sales and also meet a measurement quota. ( You can't force customer's to install things in their house) This is my opinion.
good,"Overall a good job, always felixable with work hours, very understanding, fun people to work with always excited, great opportunity to grow in the company."
good,lots of opportunities for staff who show that they are motivated and invested in the companies values. The company promotes based on skills and develops their people
good,Good place to work friend environment but if you give you a lot of your time they will take it the young group of ppl do the majority of the work wth no real reward
good,I have been there since 2011 its a very respectful and place. Since I have been there they have improved dramatically. They have got new break room and etc.
good,"Most days on the job are very same-y, and that is to be expected while working in customer service. Most of the employees are easy to get along with, which definitely makes each day feel a bit better. It's hard to maintain enthusiasm for the job since there is little incentive to go the extra mile. I still do my job well out of my own sense of pride though. The management treats everyone well and encourages us all to consider ourselves a family of sorts. It's better than your average customer service job overall but not a stimulating environment by any means."
good,"they do not utilize employees for the the right things "
good,Company lives by its core values. Large opportunity for growth. Good pay structure with bonuses both in cash and stock options. Company provides opportunities to volunteer in the community.
good,"Home Depot is a great place to work, but not a good place to make a career. You're kind of overworked if you're in middle or lower management, but if you're a store associate you'll enjoy it. I worked in the paint department and naturally I love colors and design. It was a great fit for me and helped a ton of people with their paint projects."
good,It's great workplace for people who are into home building/home improvement/repairs and designers. Everything you need for your house you can find there.
good,"If you do what you are supposed to do, you pretty much have no pressure from management. "
good,"""Smoke and Mirrors"".. this company will make you think you have it good by all the free lunches, prize drawings, ect ect... while the pay is mediocre and the benefits are absolutely terrible. While management is usually very helpful they sit in their climate controlled offices and play on their phones alot of the time, the only good thing about this building is that theres never a shortage of work, your guaranteed 40 hours a week all year long with plenty of overtime available as well. I would recommend Home Depot if you need something to get you by in the meantime, or unless you are pursuing a leadership role. Leaders have it made with the home depot, while associates suffer."
good,Overall good job with a fun work environment and good opportunities for advancement or promotion to other departments if you are a good employee. Low pay does tend to cause good employees to not stay with the company long term though.
good,Great customer interaction on a daily basis. I enjoy my job helping fellow coworkers and having different duties from time to time. Nothing is repetitive.
good,"Fast paced environment, lots of work to be done, no real overtime possibilities and can be hard to hold onto a 40 hour a week schedule when times get slow."
good,"A typical work day consisted of daly meetings, hard working, labor job assisting customers as best as I could. "
good,"Good place to work.  Good health benefits for part-timers.  Open door management,  Career goals, job training.  Home Depot is hands down the best home improvement company, employing experienced professionals in their stores to help you get a project completed.   Huge company.  DO well here and you can go anywhere."
good,Home Depot is a well structured company with great benefits and a chance for a Hourly Associate to grow with the company. It also provides the chance to be impowered to take care of customers.
good,Loading and unloading lumber truck for customers and delivery drivers. I learned a lot about lumber and concrete. I enjoyed driving the fork lift to put purchases in a customers truck.
good,"this is a good job if you are looking to move up in a career and or acquire a job with amazing benefits. the only problem with this company is the hiring of too many part time employees that just work for a pay check. this company is all about customer satisfaction, when you hire a bunch of youngsters that have absolutely no idea what their left from right is, it makes you look bad as a whole. more hands on training needs to be done to show the public (their customers) we are competent and highly knowledgeable of what we offer in the store."
good,"home depot is always busy with customers wanting to get out and get to work. despite the pressure of high call volume, customers and sales it is fun to work there. its a great first job because if you ever work some where else it'll never seem as busy as HD."
good,"Typical day depends on the team. Some teams work longer hours while others do not. I learned a little bit about my industry, but you have to change teams to continue to learn, which can sometimes be challenging. Management depends on which type of manager you run into when you join the team (managers that manage versus managers that lead). Co-workers are great and collaborative. The hardest part of my job is a growing team with new folks in place having zero background in our department. The most enjoyable part is the amount of team activities that are done and community involvement."
good,I've been employed at the Home Depot for a little over 5 months and its been great. They offer benefits such as 401k and health insurance to part time associates. This is the only place that pays 10 an hour and is very easy work. Overall great place.
good,I love working for this company.  It's sometimes easy to get advancements if you show them that you work hard..  They let you transfer departments.  You have great benefits if you are full time..
good,"always had something to do clean up work area or restock items that are low"
good,A typical day as a deliveries associate at Home Depot is running around helping customers while trying to do your own job. Frequently people in charge of the departments are never there when you need them so you end up doing their jobs. The job is very time consuming and strenuous and when you get home it makes you want to pop an advil and go to bed.
good,Working in home depot I was able to help customers on a daily base and finding reasons to why the company was the better retailer. The only downfall were the managers at the store #6501.
good,"Typical work day is pretty easy going, my job is very straight forward; move boxes and put product on shelves. It can be very fast paced, but overall a fun place to work. All the employees that have been there for a good while are very knowledgeable. MGMT is caring and know what it is like to start from the bottom. they know the day to day of all the positions and know how to best get you to the position you will fit best in. Hardest part of the job is the lack of change in what you do when you are on freight. Most enjoyable part is being able to be apart of the customers projects and helping them find the absolute best product for their project. If you like helping people with projects and don't find getting you hands dirty and working until the job is done. This is a great place for you to start a career. benefits are good for the people that stick around. they are also good for the part timers that don't need FULL benefits."
good,I think it is a good place to learn how to be in a work environment and maybe out of school.  Decent starting out maybe could offer more pay but good benefits.
good,"Great place to work and grow.  It's a company that you can grow with, it's all up to you.  "
good,The home depot has a friendly environment. Many ways and opportunities to move up in the company. Was able to learn many differant department throughout the store. Coworkers and managment always were helpful whenever I encountered and problems or difficult customers. Was able to enjoy working in the tool rental department because it was a more hands on type of job.
good,"Very Interesting, you can get pretty much all kinds of questions, about customer's home projects, and even businesses projects, it kind of depends on what the customer is working on"
good,"Being a transfer from another Home Depot location. I can proudly say that this is a great company, but some of the stores can ruin The Home Depots name and store 1246 is one of them. This is a great company to work from, but when the store and district manager do not care about the well-being of associates....It all goes downhill from there."
good,"The management is great, but the job is sort of boring and feels long. It will help me in the future because of communication skills and retail experience."
good,a typical work day is slow great employees management was pretty good job was not hard at all and I loved the people that worked there it made it a great working environment.
good,"Building Material/Lumber Associate my job duties was Greeting Customers,Cutting Wood,Stocking merchandise. Which i learned a lot about Roofing supplies, Interior & Exterior, Solid &Hollow Core Door Frames, fun helping out the customers"
good,"My over all view of the Home Depot is that I have learn a lot more than what I taught I had already knew. A typical day at work for me is going over my follow co-workers orders and make any corrections that might be needed, teacher the new worker and supervise the department whenever the supervisor ask me too, me and management has a really good relationship including my co-workers . My hardest part of my job is whenever we are short staff when there is a lot to get done. The most enjoyable part is that I have job to go to every day"
good,"Management would micro-manage every situation. Great co-workers, but we were not appreciated. The more you knew, the more they used you."
good,"Management was at most very good, and having to deal with customers was probably the hardest thing to this job because hey always want things asap. Co-workers very friendly but some just lazy."
good,It was a fun place to work it had a sence of a family atmospher all the emplyees helped each other and went above and beyond homedepot was consitant on the daily activitys that were aspected of there employees there number one concern was customer support and services it was a great place to work
good,I work at Home Depot in the mornings enjoy helping customers.  I then work in afternoon with Sykes from home I receive calls and resolve problems with consumers credit card issues.  Really good the team atompshere at Home Depot.  The most enjoyable part of my current jobs is the dealing with people.
good,"I learned a lot in my almost 12 years of service. I started from the ground level and worked my way up. Training was great, but you need to be self motivated to achieve anything. Customer Service is job one for the Home Depot."
good,"If you want to work here, by god you better be sweeter than apple pie. It's probably the most stressful place I've worked at. Don't get me wrong, I loved my co-workers, but the customers are where you get the problems. I worked at the Service Desk for most of my time, and if you don't know what you're doing, good luck. Nobody will help you. They'll take away all your people, and expect you to do 100 things at once. Management is okay, if you know what you're doing. Other than that, don't count on it. Moving departments and pay are the things you should worry about. Don't get your hopes up too much, because they don't seem to give you slack."
good,Pay really sucks with the amount of work you do plus work environment is hard for a girl with so many perverted contractors.
good,"Well, I was there for 8 years the company really changed in the years I was there. They use to take care of their people, now not as much. Lots of benefits, but management does favor some people."
good,"The Home Depot is one of the better among other large corporate retail companies. There is a general feeling of security and a good family atmosphere among co-workers. There is good respect from management but the company refuses to pay Night shift Merchandising Execution Associates more than ten dollars an hour for all of the work they do, which they can more than afford. it doesn't make me feel valued and contributes to the lack of gusto and inspiration many of the associates have. I feel like cattle, or just the lowest form of labor to them, getting payed hardly enough to live on. There is opportunity to move up, but this is not an interest to many of us with higher aspirations in life."
good,"I started and ended my day stocking shelves all day. The people I work with was a good group to work with. I loved the customer contact. I was very good with the electrical department, most of the home depot employees would bring customer to me, I could solve most questions customer had. I always worked hard and felt good about what I did."
good,Working for Home Depot has given me the opportunity to maintain great customer service attributes. I remain updated on products within and outside my department as the company gives us the access to expand our knowledge base. Associates are given the resources to learn and grow not just as employees but Home Depot also assists in uplifting associates as people
good,"review my department products that must be on the shelf completed and no merchandise on top of the shelf, place order in procucts that are low and running out. Customer service all day long. Procccesing customer orders and pulling out orders."
good,This Home Depot was a great place to work. I stayed very busy and got to learn a great deal about the products sold there. The customers were very nice. The coworkers were very helpful. It is a great company to progressively better yourself and reach your goals.
good,very nice people great job but on call too much wanted better hours overall amazing staff great location just could of had better hours
good,Everyday is a hit or miss. Could be very busy or really slow. Fun place to work most of the time. Stocking could be a challenge or cleaning after a lunch rush. Lean lots of interesting ways to fix things.
good,"The favorite part of my last job included the ability to work independently with my co-workers. its a great to work with people that cared about the company and doing a good job, the hardest part of my job is most people are unhappy around me. the most enjoyable part of the job was to satisfied the customers."
good,"I feel that when your at work you should always look for ways to help employees if your caught up on things. As a manager engage in your employees and execute cleaning task with them. Multi-tasking can become tricky but as long as u stay focused and deliver 100% customer service, you will receive positive feedback from crew and customers. You should also display a positive role to your co-workers to set examples and expectations from them. I enjoy talking and getting to know customers and making sure they know their presence is always welcome within the company. Inventory counts are a challenge but challenges help you grown and expand knowledge."
good,Home depot has changed since the days of Bernie Marcus and Author Blank. The CEO that replaced them did a good job of almost running Home Depot into the ground. Employee morale was almost non existent under Bob Nardelli.  Has been on an upswing though.
good,"Prepares for customer inquiries by studying products, services, and customer service processes."
good,Work as a greeter and cashier. On the weekends I am a greeter and provide customers with necessary information about the store as well as tell them about our sales and promotions. During weekdays I am a cashier and provide excellence customer service.
good,"I enjoy working here but with any company, some management need to be more respectful to there employees.  Most of the employees are willing to help when help is needed."
good,Although there are great opportunities for those that deserve them they don't provide help with any of those depts they send you to.
good,"I learned a lot about home improvement and ideas and ways to economize in my home.  My co-workers were very  nice and friendly, we pretty much had a family based setting."
good,A great place to work and actually one of the few places that you can advance without a formal education.  Hard work really pays off at The Home Depot.
good,Learn how to deal with diverse of people. i enjoy meeting new customers and my everyday customers. everyday i learn something new. i look forward to going to work.justthe pay is not all well. need smething more challenging
good,"Assist customers with location of products, process customers purchase transactions at registers, maintain clean workspace, maintenance of stock in immediate work area, assist in any departments that needed help."
good,"a typical day at work was working and interacting with fellow associates and customers, learning from both on the different projects they ""the customers""  were working on and the different solutions that the seasoned associates came up with. Management gave us tools to help improve my job skills, as well as training. The hardest part of the job was trying to please everyone all the time i found out very quickly that you couldn't do that. The most enjoyable part was seeing a smile on their faces when i could put their troubles at ease with the project they were working on."
good,the environment was different from what i was use to working but i got use to it very fast. the only thing i didn't like to do was lift large things but i did it because i loved working no matter what i was doing.
good,I appreciated the opportunity to be able to learn thing about wood that I didn't know. Everyone worked with great professionalism that will serve me a great purpose later in life.
good,"I worked and cross trained in many departments and enjoyed"
good,"A typical day at work for me starts in the center of the store in the appliances department. Each day I work I stock the shelves with missing product and front face everything. Then I stand out in the aisles and scout customers to sell them their dream kitchen! I'm usually teamed up with two other associates who help hold down the fort. My job is pretty much simple and easy. I enjoy talking to the people and educating them about our products. So, I wouldn't say anything abut my job is hard."
good,"Great place to work at, and great people, you almost become a family with your coworkers. If you work on in a department, on the sales floor you have a lot more opportunity to move up in the company, and gain full time if that is what you are looking for. However, if you are working on the front end you have less space to move up in the company and more likely than not you will not receive a full time position."
good,"working 6am to 230pm was good ,it allowed me to do some other things,management was good,pay was low and turnover was very hi."
good,"A typical day is filled largely with customer service applications. You will be moving merchandise consistently throughout the day in the form of stocking shelves, setting displays and demonstrations of in store merchandise, and the assistance of customers in terms of loading. You earn valuable knowledge in products throughout the store which can than be used to advance in depth into fields such as electrical and plumbing."
good,"Home Depot where you can enter knowing nothing about your Department, and come out knowing almost everything. I learned so much in my department, and found out what customers are usually looking for and help them right away. My co-workers are very friendly and easy to talk to, and they always try to lend a hand if you need it. The hardest part of the job is not being able to attend each customer at once, sometimes you get 3 people at once who need help and it could get overwhelming, but if you calm down and tell them to be patient it becomes an easy job."
good,"The freight team makes sure the all new freight is put out every night, floor is free of excess new freight, put remaining freight in overhead, stage the floor for opening. My team of co-workers are great to work, we all lend a helping hand to each other in oreder to make sure the job gets done."
good,"Excellent Customer service is the 1st thing"
good,"It all depends on the position you work, but that is what I love about the home depot they have several different positions that easily accomdate every kind of worker from 18 to ages 40"
good,It is not a bad place to work. Little issues become big ones. Everyone wants to be in power. I learned inventory skills as well as people skills. The co workers were decent to work with and i made new friends. The job was not hard at all. The hardest part was the constant power trips. I enjoyed being with my friends and working side by side on tasks.
good,The Home Depot is a great place to work and expand in a company. They are every reasonable with school and other jobs . They also pay pretty well.
good,Great place to work. enjoyed staff and management team pushed us in a positive direciton.
good,"I worked in the garden area. I learned the names of a lot of plants, when to plant them, how to plant them and how to take care of your lawn and garden. There are alot of managers, a lot of co workers. The best part of the job was being able to help people."
good,Home Depot has taught me how to work under pressure and under time constraints.
good,"Freight hours were during prime business hours, annoying the customers trying to shop. Freight team is not trained in any departments, so constantly looks stupid when asked a question by a customer."
good,"Would walk the floor looking for suspicious people doing frauds or theft. There is many different ways to commit theft or fraud. Also many different types of people you meet doing this job staff and people you arrest. "
good,"I have to start my day at 5am, i have learned how to read planograms and maintain the bay integrity. Management is firm but fair and my co-workers are fun to be around. The hardest part of the job is getting up at 3:45 am. The most enjoyable part of my day is interacting with new and exciting customers each day."
good,"A very good company to work for. Management is primarily type A personalities which can be good and bad. Overall, I was very happy with my time here."
good,I left this company because of the lack of advancement.  Human Resource positions were being eliminated at each of the stores and handled from a central location
good,The management overnight expects you to do everything without them lifting a finger. Would be alot better if it was actually teamwork.
good,"Great working environment and facilities."
good,"customer service, problem solving, down stocking, Merchandising.  I have learned to fix plumbing problems and how to better understand people. Management is okay. My co workers are awesome. I love being part of the team! Hardest part of the job would be the hours scheduled. The most enjoyable part is seeing smiles on the faces of the customers when a problem is solved."
good,Home Depot was an exciting place to work. Everyday brought new challenges that made you grow as an employee. Coworkers were great as well as the management.
good,Work hours and coworkers are the highlight of my day.  The hardest part of my job consists of problem resets to ensure set integrity.  Management needs to communicate better with associates.
good,This is a good place for a part time college student. Only employees that  benefit here are employees who have dedicated there life to Home Depot. Unless you are part of the ORANGE Family they don't really consider or look at past experience. There is not many skilled pros that work there like they use to have in the past it is ran like a true corporate retailer.
good,"I LOVED the store I worked at in Kent, Washington. The management was superb and very understanding when I moved. Work was always eventful and on slow days they always encouraged going to other departments and expanding your knowledge. However, I did a store transfer when I moved to Odessa, Texas and that store was deplorable. They had MANY issues with getting and keeping staff so they eagerly accepted my transfer. I started working and lasted 3 days before I just couldn't do it. I was a cashier and had 3 head cashiers on ONE shift. One in a register, one working on the schedule and another standing in front of me who told me I couldn't stand a certain way. "
good,Cashier- rang customer's up and had knowledge of product to help the customer's choose there product easier and what would go with there product. Learning about the product. Management had a high turnover so it wasn't so great with them. Co-worker's were helpful with extra knowledge. The hardest part was not enough coverage at times. And not enough communication with management. Working and helping the contractor's when they came in. Knew some by name.
good,"I would typically do anything and everything from internal to external customer service. I would manage associate training, writing schedules for 180 plus associate, make changes and find additional coverage, cut hours when needed, explain health care/401k benefits daily to those whom had questions or just didn't understand it quite enough to make decisions about it. I would also at time have to settle disagreements between associates, as well as management to ensure a positive working environment on a daily basis. "
good,"muy agradable ambiente, aprendi a trabajar mas en equipo, los gerenres personas muy bien capacitados, lo mas dificil es que se cuenta con muy poco personal lo que hace mas dificil el trabajo, se te asignan resposabilidades de otros departametos y los asociados se desesperan por la presion a consecuencia de la falta de personal y por eso optan por buscar otro trabajo, me gusto el ambiente que se formo de armonia al yo entrar ya que se les daba la confianza a las cajeras de exponer inquietudes e ideas y se trabajo mas sanamente."
good,Responsible for for my assigned areas of store and overall operation of store while the only Manager present.
good,Worked as sales associate.  Learned about flooring products.  Enjoyed meeting new people.
good,"Easy Job where all that was required was to stock freight, but sort of felt taken advantage of."
good,love that job only thing is you have to stand in one spot if you do not have customers
good,"they have great values. "
good,"Being a cashier basically help greeting customers, customer service, stock, clean, let customers know to sign up with the credit cards."
good,"Great Company to work for, with excellent pay and benefits."
good,I worked within several different store within this position. It was a fulfilling job and continually challenging. Working within deadlines and often difficult customers but rewarding.
good,"Home Depot had a great approach to taking care of their staff. ""Take care of you people, and they will take care of your people"". Often times it was a fun working environment."
good,"Typical day at Home Depot is usually very relaxed."
good,I only worked there for about 3 months while on summer break. I don't have any real complaints about the place. They teach you what you need to know about the different positions in the store and there is room to move around as well.
good,"I was an outside salesman, selling installed roofing and fencing. most days found me on roofs and in  homes. Measuring roofs, creating an estimate, presenting proposal, answering questions, writing up contract and filling out credit applications. I was responsible for 5 Home Depot stores here in Olympia, south Tacoma and the Puyallup Store. Trained employees in all stores regarding program and marketing, created store displays and worked with Managers in all stores to provide leads. Was successful enough to become Team leader of sales for SW Washington and had 5 salesmen on my team. Won numerous local sales awards and a large national contest which sent me cross country. We were a very expensive roof installer and getting past that objection at times was extremely tough."
good,Cashier job was my job and loved it they help there employees out in needy times.
good,Management has become less involved with employees. Fun job working with people. Still have some good employees left.
good,Very high pressure environment for very little pay. Management works you very hard and is very detached from their employees 
good,"You cant have sensitive ears to work here cuz it can be noisy at times, fast paced and you learn lots of things from this company about construction, plumbing, gardening and tools."
good,"As a cashier, THD makes it so that your first (and depending on the time of day, only) priority is taking care of customers and running their transactions through and keeping you focused on that. It's a refreshing change from jobs that not only want you to wait on customers but also to clean and do this and that and the next thing. It's nice to be able to focus on people and not have to worry about everything else going on in the store. This is a very busy location and the job is very fast paced. Working mid-morning through early afternoon is the busiest time. These shifts go by pretty quickly, especially on weekends but, when it is slow, because your duties are limited as a cashier, the time can really drag and it can be very boring just standing around waiting for someone to check out. Evening shifts are generally slower, customer-wise, and they require you to do a bit of light cleaning but nothing too demanding - mostly sweeping floors, changing garbages, dusting and general tidying up. The staff and management are very helpful and friendly. Almost everyone is willing to help you if you have a question or if you don't know how to do something without making you feel bad for not knowing. I have a lot of cashier experience so I didn't necessarily learn any new skills and adjusting to THD's way of doing things and how their tills work was very easy. They have touch screen POS and they have nice large, clear screens and are very easy to use, even if you've never used a register before. Management was okay, as an associate on the front end most of the higher up managers stay out"
good,"Was hired as a seasonal garden worker whose primary duty was to water the outdoor nursury stock, stock shelves, help customers, and clean up big messes that other associates made. After I was hired that manager that hired me quit after a month, from day one I was totally on my own - no instructions ever- in fact, there was noone else in my department until it was almost time for me to leave. I have never worked for a retail company that didn't offer employee discounts. I never knew who the manger was for my department until the last two weeks I worked there and even then I rarely saw them. A few times I had to clean up the messes the fortlift drivers would make ( knocking over racks ) and twice breaking sprinkler heads thus flooding a particular department. I met a couple of nice associates but for the most part management wasn't friendly at all."
good,almost six years since i've been there learned a lot and i actually work and help out in multiple departments daily
good,A typical day at work consists of helping customers all the time.
good,"I typical day at Home Depot requires morning meetings to discuss a game plan for the day to drive sales. Ensure associates are tasking and down stocking to ensure the customers get a great experience shopping during Power Hour ( no tasking during this time). Performing observation on the sales floor and given feedback to the associate daily. Work to create an inviting shopping environment for the customers. Analyze trends, solve problems, along with self development to maximize the stores success."
good,- Great place to build a career
good,"The Company overall is great. Offered great products, services and options to advance, but details were often left out about job sites. And there was also miss-communication involving my issues with the manager and assistant manager. Meaning when I approached one, the opposite would have a different answer or not know altogether."
good,Great place to work and plenty of opportunities to advance.
good,A typical day at work for me would be coming into work cleaning up my till area. Wait for customers to come to my till with there merchandise. greeting them with a warm welcoming smile asking if they had found everything they were looking for. capable of using debit/credit card transactions as well as cheques and cash. stacking and organizing all the 2x4 not far from my till. setting up bags at my till. This job has made my knowledge about tools and eqiupment. That i wasnt aware of before. The managment and co workers were always a joy to work with!! The enjoyable part about my job
good,"Overall good place, better people and good company goal. I love to help people with there projects. Like to help the associate's grow and do more. My co-workers and good and have there own strengths things bring us together as a team."
good,I loved going to work to be with the overall staff and customers.
good,Great place to work if you want part time work. Hours can be flexible. Advancement can be easily achieved if you are willing to work. Working here can be difficult at times because a lot of employees are doing whatever they can to avoid customers.
good,I would perform customer service on a daily basis as well as ring customers out accept cash debit credit and check payments. I would also process special orders and returns/exchanges. I learned to multitask while working at Home Depot and to get my job done efficiently and professionally. My co-workers were fun to be around and made work more enjoyable. I enjoyed providing customer service to my customers. Management would have barbeques during the summer and christmas parties at the store for the employees. The only hard part was trying to make the disgruntled customers happy when they made up their mind to be disgruntled.
good,"I ran a tight crew between 9:30p to 6:00a We had multiple shipments arrive on a nightly basis and it was my job to ensure all merchandise was put away properly and the look of the store was to the managers expectations. The biggest thing i learned with Home Depot was how to do many different things at once. I have gained a lot of patience due to this job and have found many ways to overcome stressful and time sensitive tasks. The people who worked for me knew what they needed to do. Yes, there were times i needed to enforce a few rules and motivate them but i would say when it came down to it, everything went very well."
good,I really enjoyed my time at The Home Depot. The political bs associated with job advancement was unbelievable. I loved working with the customers and the associates. I loved what I did.
good,a typical day as a cashier for me would be regular good on busy days boring on slow days. i have learned that i am responsible for myself and no one else . managment in my opinion was not very great or enthusiastic. some of my co-workers were very pleasant and helpful when needed. the hardest part of my job was doing other peoples jobs and trying to be my best at my own position. the most enjoyable part of my job was helping and providing customers with excelent service
good,"The company has changed they stress customers first, but that has change in the last 6 years. They like to hire young inexperance kids that can't help the customers that need help with basic home projects."
good,Cashier
good,Availability must be 24/7. You must be willing to work any shift. Easy work for good pay.
good,"custmer services, team player, on time person ,have experience inall phases o msds materials, IOS2002"
good,I found working at The Home Depot rewarding and fun. Many of the associates I work with either another job and or working toward their goals in achieving a higher education. All of which The Home Depot encourages.
good,"Working at the Home Depot was very enjoyable because everyone there including customers were very helpful to make the day go great! Working there i learned many new cultures & different ways to make things possible as to what the customer may need for a project. The management was very nice & easy to get along with, never any problems. The only hard parts were when the store didnt have a certain product for the customer & you have no way in helping them there other than sending then to another store, lastly my most enjoyable part of working for the company was when you made the customer smile & helped them within their project or the product they needed."
good,"I spent most of my days selling appliances, kitchen, bath, plumbing and paint items. This included interfacing with several different computer systems, aisle maintenance, and a focus on customer service."
good,"There was just a miscommunication one day that I was sent to the garden when I had a big transaction to do, void it out and at the moment that I had called a head cashier or a manager for it, my line there in the garden was packing up and not to have them waiting longer, I started cashing them out. My dismisal time was arriving and I turned in my till with out voind ing it, it was at closing time that I left. I was a hard worker, I really enjoyed working there and would like to work there again if this incident gets to be resolved. Seriouslly, it was not my fault no one was able to show up at the moment. I just had a dream going back and working there. Please, make it come true."
good,"Enjoys getting paid every week, It is a good place to work but I am ready to pursue a job where I can utilize my education."
good,"Lots of standing, great co-workers, not a lot of pay. Cashier has most responsibility, with little pay. Good starter job for someone in high school or during college."
good,"Home depot was a great place to work,they really care about customers and their staff."
good,when the corperate people call you to offer you a postion they will say the postion is going to be xxxxxxxxxx but when you get to the store to go to work it is nothing like what the people on the phone said because they have never worked in the store.Plus home depot usually hires people on a seasonal basis so they wont have to offer you insurance so if you get hired there be prepared to work for about 80 to 85 days.
good,"Its a good job for time being, but not a career job if you love doing family things on weekends"
good,The company was very good for someone who likes to drive a truck and trailer and deliver lumber to home and deliver to contractor and deliver to home owners.
good,I have enjoyed roughly every moment of the job. Since I know about every department there is not much room for me to grow as a individual and as a employee.
good,The company has a great work environment and your always learning something  new. With there being so many home improvement products you gain alot of useful knowledge
good,"company in general is great plenty of benefits, always willing to learn new things. downside is the pay. it’s truly sad at what they expect you to do for the amount of pay, or how they expect some ppl to live off of that. they also lack communication with associates being told one thing and never following through is just frustrating. good place to start but probably not stay."
good,"It was an ok place to work but whatever you do, don’t become a cashier there are long hot summers, very cold winters and sometimes rainy days or nights and they only close the garden when it’s below 30 degrees or there is a threat of a storm. You can be robbed, kidnapped and nobody will ever know. They don’t check on you out there and they don’t care if you are 16 or 100 yro they want you to load or stand at the registers"
good,"Opportunity is there but starting pay could be better . More teamwork "
good,"If you are new to the working world the best starter job is HomeDepot."
good,"The advancement opportunities are just not what I am looking for. I have decided to move on to bigger, and better things with a company than I experience now"
good,To be honest my experience at Home Depot was tiring they will provide you with a lot of hours if needed the one thing I like most about Home Depot if you stay after closing then you get an extra 100 to $300 on your check I forgot what that plan was called but it helped me out a lot.
good,Excelente ambiente laboral. Una empresa donde te hay oportunidad de crecimiento. El sueldo es lo único que no es muy atractivo.
good,The job and company its self isa great play work work at. management depends on stores. But the job is very fulfilling when you start to learn everything in your department.
good,"Very friendly with a wholesome sense of community, cares for coworkers however like all retail stores there are slow moments where hours can seems scarce."
good,"Home Depot provides really great benefits for their associates, but they are behind on the pay scale. The take care of tier employees and the needs of the associates and their families."
good,"Home depot is okay , just not giving enough hours . Even when you ask for more hours they say they will give it to you && don’t. Not enough training to cover what you will be doing."
good,Home depot has an amazing work environment lots of fun and happy people eager and ready to serve customers with a smile on their faces. But the unfortunate thing about home depot is they don't really pay well. It's as if they smother you with benefits both benificial and non-benificial depending on personal circumstances.
good,Organized and run fairly well.  The team concept is good. Opportunity for promotion good. It offers good benefits and treats people good overall. Nice
good,"I was i would have went to work at another job since i wasted my time working part time twenty hours a week but, i enjoyed the experience overall i just gotta better myself and find a career"
good,"Has a big room where associates eat and there is also a ping pong table. I learned a lot working there and developed a lot of skills including forklift certification. Hardest part of the job was throwing away the damaged bags of concrete that were pretty heavy. The lumber department is the toughest department and most respected by associates. Reason for leaving was the pay, I'm looking for an opportunity to make a little more."
good,"Typical work weeks consisting of 45 hours on average. Always busy with little down time. Reaching vendor expectations in a timely manor and good quality can be proven to be difficult task but i have yet to fail to meet deadlines. I've learned and have been trained on multiple different types of equipment to include driving fork lifts, electric ladders and various tools sold within the franchise."
good,"As a merchandiser you service the aisles, clean items and move items to correct locations as well as introduce new items to the floor and provide some customer service as well."
good,"Although a relative stress free environment, Home Depot typically has 10-15 floor associates with a few cashiers at a time. This causes strain on all floor associates who have to cover breaks and lunches in a store that typically sees up to 800+ customers arrive each day. There is never enough coverage scheduled. "
good,Home Depot is a steady job...with good pay...but I would not recommend  this job for 10 years or more...you could get really burnt out on this job...much work on this job.
good,"This review will be short and simple. "
good,I was lucky to be able to work with friends.  The people who worked there were a big family.  Not until the management changed that the store went down hill
good,"Not a bad gig. Everything depends on your regional manager. The job is tougher the less experience you have. There are no opportunities to learn. Almost no training, learn as you go."
good,"Overall, working as an associate, the job was easy and enjoyable. There were people that you would work with that would make the job awesome and others that made you keep looking at the clock but that is most retail jobs. Some of the supervisors/managers were horrible at their job which made working there more stressful than necessary."
good,"The Home Depot is a great place to gain new knowledge. There are many opportunities to advance to new departments and positions. Management is very helpful in solving problems and encouraging team work, as well as safety."
good,"salarios competitivos, prestaciones superiores a la de la ley, cultura siempre promoviendo los valores, crecimiento y estabilidad laborar."
good,The Home Depot is always changing initiatives and goals of the business. This provides associates with a low level of security as the company will bring in new associates to accomplish new initiatives.
good,"Home Depot is a retail position. Obviously there will be ups and downs, but for the most part the environment is nice. Manages are usually relatively understanding and co-workers are usually adequate for the job. Hardest part of the job is pleasing unhappy customers who do not understand what they want."
good,Its not a bad starter job or retirement job. When part times things can be a struggle due to the wide variation in hours. They do try pretty hard to adhere to your availability. Full time is a little better but still a very wide variation in shifts.
good,"This job was a great place to work. Various types of department's, and something new to learn each and every day. It gave me excellent knowledge in communication, as well as learning about different products for customer satisfaction."
good,"very flexible type of environment, family oriented,many opportunities to learn in different departments, gain product and project knowledge through customers and or training offered"
good,"Overall it is a good job, the people I work with are friendly, the job is fun and flexible, the customers are nice and the management is helpful, but I'm still only making poverty wages."
good,There were multiple times I have felt I was not scheduled the best minimum hours attending the place of business for eight hours out of one entire seven day week.
good,"its an alright place to work, theres a lot of down time so it can get a bit boring. Sort staffed store so it gets little frantic. Advancement does happen but full time advancement doesn't happen very often"
good,"The company is a good company to work for. The customers can sometimes be ridiculous. My job was to take customer complaints and resolve their issues. I would have to call the store and resolve customer issue with store manager to the best of my ability. I loved my job and was very good at it, but this is definitely not for everyone."
good,"Great resume building company, the culture of leadership and advancement are positives. Bay Area stores are just simply challenged with competing with companies that are paying $18-$20 starting"
good,at typical day at work i just doing the usual. most important is customer service and store appearance. i think its very important to take care of customer and associates.
good,"Very good training facilities, Good coordination among various disciplines. Independence of work welcomed for designers. A good thing is not worrying for the clientele, as customers walk in - many times without appointments"
good,"Love the specialty job, have to meet quotas. Though it is a specialty job, do expect to do the job of a tasker. Sometimes even more than what taskers do on daily basis."
good,"I was a Customer Service Rep, Then a Department Manager for Tools, stepped down and became a customer rep. overall good place worked at too work. if good management good employees. I went back to school is why i stepped down. I would of stayed but better opportunities as i thought at time ."
good,Everyone at the Home Depot has a great personality and makes work fun.  But most day managers really get on you if they don’t like something they see.
good,It was a great place to work the employees were great to work with the management was great anx I lokes how they trained u real good before putting u on any kind of hydraulic equipment.
good,"Its a good company with benefits, they hire from within, an they are not shy about rewarding hard work. However their new labor model makes it impossible for part timers to get any hours, hence my departure."
good,"At The Home Depot, I sold appliances.  It was my second real job and it was definitely relaxing at times but also stressful at others.  After being trained in, you get to go on the sales floor for real-time experience with customers and helping them pick their special kitchen set for example.  There is always someone around that can help you if you do not have an answer to a question for a customer which is amazing and there is always opportunity to learn about different departments if you so choose to do so. I loved how involved the managers were.  In my area the customers were a little difficult to work with at times."
good,"It is a good place to work because The Home Depot will teach you new things in its constants workshops. That means that you always will be improving your interpersonal skills which is very important in any working environment. Also, workers are very friendly and good people."
good,"Have to be fast paced, always answer customers questions, always have something to do even when it’s slow. Most associates will help you out if you have any questions."
good,"I only worked there through college. It was good enough for a college student, but would be hard to support a family on that pay. The concrete floors are very hard on the ankles and back. Overall the people were very nice to work with."
good,"All in all, I really enjoyed working here.  I am a people person and like to interact with customers. I only worked P/T, however, the hardest part about my position was standing on cement floors."
good,I was a cashier. Some of the employees were hard to work with as well. I really enjoyed working in the garden area and being outside. In the job description I was not informed that we had to promote and sell the Home Depot card.
good,Home Depot (HD) does not always promote the most qualified for the position. HD does give all employees opportunity to promote. HD does not have enough associates assigned  to adaquately cover customer needs each and every day. A typical day at work begins completing the closers tasks before beginning my daily assigned tasks. Busy days serving customers and stocking. I've work with both contientious  and lacsidaisical management. The hardest part of the job is being spread to thin to meet customer needs. The most enjoyable part of the job is gratification solving customers problems and needs.
good,"•	Provided leadership coaching and consulting on development planning for RDC."
good,"I enjoyed working there but something is wrong with the management like I don't like the when they cut hours and I'm the only one to close down my department "
good,I have enjoyed my time at home Depot. Lot's of experience I have received. Can be stressful . I wish they gave new employees more training. I wish they were more about customers. I do enjoy my job just feel I need a chsnge
good,Buena empresa que aun debe segir mejorando para crear mejores expectativas a sus empleados .
good,"I am excited working in this company because I've learned so much on it. Everyday I've learned something new and different problem should be face and I need to find solution for it. I learned to multi-task on the job I had to perform daily. I manage to make my workplace environment to be fun and conducive such as arrange my area to be lively and to have sense of humor with my co-office worker. I also, make myself to be productive everyday and need to be result oriented to be able to fulfill my duty."
good,"Easy work, reasonable hours,  not challenging, excellent management, I was impressed with benefits and incentives. Excellent fun raising ideas. I felt it wasa good and fair starter job or for someone retired, Personally I look for a more professional, higher skilled career."
good,"The people who work here are wonderful people very dedicated to fulfilling the expectation of quality customer service that The Home Depot advertises. The main issue that caused the most conflict between customer and employee was most often due to understaffing especially in the Service Desk area, the Wood/Lumber area, and sometimes the Garden section. I think if there was at least one more person in each of these departments, it would serve to benefit future customers."
good,"Daily yard check to ensure product accountability"
good,I enjoyed parts of the job. Learned alot of customer service. The hardest part was making exchanges. I really enjoyed showing up. I was a very fast paced job
good,It's a good place to work out if you are looking for a temporary job or somewhere that would be good when you retire. There is opportunities to grow in the company
good,"Home Depot has a GREAT work culture as long as you work in a store, otherwise, you are treated as an outsider by all levels on the ""Core"" side."
good,"A typical work day is if theres a truck, unload and separate freight to   the sales floor. I learned if you have a small store you have to manage your inventory with diligence to have all that merchandise in it. Management are ok. the work culture is different from other places I've worked, theres good and bad."
good,"This was my first job and as a first it was great. If you work hard there are advancement options. Like any other retail job the pay is not great and the hours are terrible but that is not HD's issue, that is just retail."
good,"Great place to work and interact with fellow associates and customers.   Wonderful vision, dental, and medical benefits including 401k , sick and personal time"
good,Was a good experience with great people. I learned how to communicate with customers and guide them towards the items they were looking for. It was a valued experience
good,"It is fast paced very customer oriented, hard manual working type of place to work for , constant customer action continuously moving , placing orders,taking orders and following through."
good,Easy to move around pending on location. If one is looting relocate good control work with to get one into area or city may want to live in until a more favorable job can be obtained
good,"I worked as a lot attendant at a home depot in San Ramon, CA. I'd say that management isn't very good in terms of training, i'd give it a 2 out of 5. I was stuck trying to figure a lot of little parts of my job on my own. I think there should be more than one person working the lot until closing time, especially in a big lot. The employees were definitely nice and friendly, but there are always those bad apples that linger around (Customer Service Desk.)"
good,A typical day at home depot would be pretty busy the customers there are regulars and you get to know them pretty well. You get your slow day after the holidays.
good,This is a good place to work if you're still in high school or in college with no major bills to pay just yet. They don't start off paying you a lot unless you're in management or higher up. I started there during spring break of my senior year but once I started paying bills that job became unbearable being that I was not in management.
good,"Home Depot has an amazing culture with incredible opportunity to grow your career.  You will need to be open to relocation if you want to progress at a quicker pace, but definitely are focused on growing internal talent."
good,I had the job of loading and unloading trucks also used the tugger and scrubber to clean building i really lik the job but new management came in and fired a whole crew and i was one in the crew members tjat had gotten fired
good,"A typical day at The Home Depot could be very tiring. As a sales associate, if you don't wear comfortable shoes you'll be in a load of trouble especially in my department. Speaking to different people throughout the day is the most enjoyable part."
good,I like working at Home Depot. Management was understanding to your needs and there is growth in the company. enjoyed working for this company. So I would tell anyone if they asked that a great place to work for.
good,Great place to work. I learned how to drive a forklift and learned how to work as team to accomplish are work goals. Learned how to receive delivery trucks and how to load and unload delivery trucks.
good,"Through my experience from working at Home Depot, I've learned to really take pride in what I do. I feel that it is important to stay up to date and knowledgeable on how things work in in your department to make the customers life easier."
good,Great environment to work in and good benefits. People are great and customers are a joy. Simple work and no gym membership is needed while working there because the amount of walking and lifting that’s done very well makes up for it!
good,The Home Depot warehouse is a great opportunity to work. The days are long and the work is competitive but the job is easy. You can learn to use many gadgets and learn to operate heavy machinery.
good,Love working at The Home Depot. It's a fun and joyful place to work and meet new people. They have good benefits. Management is very to work for. Great place to work.
good,The  company was a good place to work but the raises were very small once a year and the health benefits were very high. I'm a people person so I loved helping customers and some times customers wanted to talk and we were only aloud so much time per customer because my job was to make sure all the merchandise was perfect and priced.
good,loader and under loader of trucks on a daily bases ..worked with people helped the people in the store i like the job but did not like the hours the pay was not great.
good,"I am just a sales associate, but everyone seems nice in my store. I don't know much about the higher ups, but my Store manager as well as department manager are really nice people."
good,"My day starts proof reading product information, sizing images and contrast. Entering all data on thousands of products and vendors. I was in charge of the largest department, plumbing. All data was to be proofread before and after uploading,"
good,"A great place to work and to move up the ladder of success.  Any person who wants to make a career of a job this company is for you.  Working for Home Depot was the highlight of my career path,"
good,"Working at the Home Depot I really enjoy my time I have made great friends and I also feel that my opinion is valued, with the change of management. Prior to the change of management I did not really valued. Now I feel like my opinions are heard and my ideas are valued."
good,It was a good job but my old boss had called me to come back and make double the pay and to work 40 hours so it wasn’t to hard of a decision. I was trying to save up for a car and stuff
good,"One of my 1st cashier job, and I loved it there. The culture was nice and friendly, the training wasn't that well. I never learned other departments. Over all it was a good place to work at"
good,if you show promis you will rise quickly. but there is obvious favoritism and if certain people decide they don't like you then your life there will be uncomfortable. if they don't succeed in getting rid of you
good,Working at The Home Depot is a good experience to get your feet wet in the aspect of working its great working for the company just after a while management start to get really political that's when my work experienced took a turn for the worst because now they expected me to suck up to them and cater to the supervisors and management as well customers and employees loved me its jus started to exhaust and affect me.
good,Great place to work while in school or in tradition to another job. The overall cultural is okay. It's a retail environment so majority of the positions are customer facing.
good,"i would try an work there again,....but it will be alot of changes....i really loved the customers they made me smile and made my dayPlayed an instrumental role in increasing customer satisfaction ratings index from 50% to 100% within 3 years as"
good,It's a good company a few things wrong with it but other than that they test you right never really had an issue with them. They were always their for their employees and really looked out for them.
good,"There's nothing really difficult to do, as long as you know what you're doing this job could be the easiest job. Training and learning can be done in less than a week, after that you're good on your own."
good,"Overall experience is well, except the customers themselves; you need a high level of patience to deal with them. The staff are friendly and working here has really opened me up."
good,"Typical work day is fairly interesting, you get to learn from customers. If you have a busy store, makes it more enjoyable yet challenging in my opinion. A lot of good people within Home Depot. Friendly environment. Overall good sense of customer-employee engagement."
good,customers are great and enjoy helping them. Learning about products and remodeling is very exciting. Learning all the departments and helping other associates are the best.
good,"job is easy and time goes by fast, fun to work with a small team everyone seems to like the position minus the pay being very little and almost no raises, also no employee discount at home depot which would be nice"
good,"what can i say great place to work with the customers contracters are great everybody is like family, great envirement to work for always a blast you get their and leave their happy."
good,"Better production requirements. PTS supervisor shoes favoritism to certain females. The females basically tell him what they want to do, and he lets them."
good,Remove the existing merchandise from the bay. Tear down or reset the bay. Setup the bay beams.  Setup displays and reset the merchandise into the bay.
good,"Enjoyed working here. Hours varied from week to week.I would have stayed if I was full time and health insurance was available. Associates start 25 hours a week, $10.00 and hour. Full time openings are limited. i worked in the Tool Rental dept."
good,Great place to work. The co workers and environment was idea. 401 k plan optional as well as health benefits plans. Paid time off as well as sick time.
good,My second job was here. I loved working here. Being able to help people everyday. The work sometimes was hard but worth it. The manger was also nice which made me want to work harder
good,"There is no typical day at work, every day varies depending on whether it is in the middle of winter or the first day of summer. I learned patience and how to more outgoing. As well as the layout of the store, and a deeper knowledge of tools. The management was fairly decent, but recently a lot of new people have been hired as managers, and they are not running the store up to par. The environment is fairly relaxed, as long as you do what you are supposed to. The most difficult part of the job is being able to understand what people want, and ringing up items with no barcode. The most enjoyable would be the coworkers and the people you meet."
good,a very good place to learn the basics of excellent customer service and basis of construction materials. if you have a school and want to excel in a construction related career this is the best place to start.
good,i wish that the people who work at The home depot were smarter about the items in the store and i wish they were more knowledge able about products.if i were to work at the home depot again i would need a management position due the lack of knowledge by the employees.
good,I worked at a cashier and I really loved the management and how helpful everyone was. I received in depth training and felt very confident once on my own! Great first place to work !
good,The events was fun. Enjoy to see the kids come in and do their works like paint on the wood and everything. Love to see kids' smile while they made thing
good,Very good place for a part time job. A lot of opportunity to go further. Can learn a lot. So much interaction with different level of people. Nice multi cultural place.
good,"Home Depot isn't a bad place to work. You may start off small, but there is a lot of opportunity for growth and a future if you really want it. They are always hiring."
good,ITS  A OKAY COMPANY TO WORK FOR IF YOU HAVE NO KIDS. Home depot doesbf give you the opportunity to really have a life outside of the company if you have kids unless you can work part time and only survive off of 12-24 hours per week
good,Working here I learned allot and was able to advance rather quickly. If given the option I would work here again. Some of the supervisors here are good others are not so good. There's a great culture here and a good plethora of people
good,Es una. Muy buena empresa par laborar que permite adquirir conocimientos y familiarizarse en campos de negociacion y  campos tecnicos diversos
good,"home depot is a great place to work for any part time students."
good,"The work is easy and fun if you like to socialize and talk to different people. Anyone can work here theirs people of all ages and backgrounds. The hours are okay, I'm looking for something full time."
good,"Basically what the description says. Management isn't fantastic, but the pay is good. My co workers are pretty great but they seem to be shrinking in number for one reason or another."
good,Some of the tasks were too tough for women to try to provide services for. Slow paced environment. Needed more fast pace and people friendly.  I worked as a merchandiser.
good,This job was great but after about a year everything changed and management went from great to not so good. Some workers are careless everywhere but all in all not a horrible place to work.
good,"Great benefits for full and part time associates. Easy to manage schedule, benefits, pay and attendance through the Home Depot website. Easy relocation and easy to move up."
good,"It's a great way to learn all about ""teamwork"". The company emphasizes safety as I am a safety captain for MET( Merchandising Execution Team). Plenty of opportunity to advance. We always begin our early morning shift with warm-up stretching. The hardest part of our job is moving and lifting very heavy product over 60 lbs. even with a partner."
good,"I learned how to give better customer service. my co workers were very helpful , great team to work with. the hardest part of the job was being in my department by myself, a staff member with a forklifting license was required , and I didn't have one so I would waste time walking around looking for management but the most enjoyable part of my job was satisfying the customers needs, and learning new things that would come in handy during the job and outside."
good,Working at home depot was a great hands on job experience. I'm great with communication skills. I've learned that working hard and helping customers can improve your character and experience in the future.
good,As soon as i get to the work floor a customer would call for help because the lack of accociates. I would help them the best way i can. Most of the times the customer would speak in spanish so its hard to understand. The one thing i would enjoy the most at work is using the Forklift to bring down the Merch. for the customer.
good,"Despite the lack of communication between management, my fellow coworkers made my time at the Home Depot an enjoyable learning experience"
good,"very productive days"
good,I really enjoyed my time working there. We always had great managers throughout my tenure there which made life a lot easier.
good,My job at home depot was a lot so i would just get the shopping carts and ill help people load their things on to their cars. If co works need help with trying to get some things from top shelf i would have to help. The hours were okay.
good,"Take care of customers, replenish missing products, drive forklifts. Learned a lot about windows, doors, home products. Management was management, co-workers were co-workers, hardest part of job was that every week you were on a different schedule."
good,Good company to work for if you do everything management says to a T but if not you get chewed out for the littlest thing. Also if you make good money there in any hourly position your jobs always seems to be on the line.
good,enjoyed helping customers learned about doing the extra things customer did not expect management at store were good above that no support co workers great to work with a good TEAM Hardest part of Job was keeping up with the metrics of credit and pro  extra sign up but the most enjoyable was taking care of customers
good,"Nice job for a some income.  Straight forward path if interested in advancement.  I worked nights so our workload very obvious as soon as we hit the door.  Didn't have to deal with any customers, just freight."
good,"Management and co-workers are great, excellent hours and opportunities  for advancement on a regular basis .The Home Depot asks for ideas to improve customer service on a regular basis. Great training on a regular basis."
good,Working at Home depot was such a fun job but also a learning experience in all types of aspects. I learned how to do every home improvements and learned about working in the garden but also grew as a person. I was able to meet all kinds of new people but also be put in the toughest situations. The companies overall moral started going in a downward spiral as management was up in the air .
good,"The overall environment is truly great at Home Depot. It's very diverse and fellow employees are fun to work with."
good,"Working at Home Depot has been nice. The people are nice. The management overall are good. My typical day of work requires helping numerous customers whether they are in my department or not.. I answer questions regarding painting issues. I mix, on average, around 70 gallons a day on a typical work day. My coworkers are awesome. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I helped someone with their project and it turned out great.. The hardest part of my job is definitely lifting repeated 5 gallon buckets of paint."
good,Everyday you walk into home depot its a new experience. You interact with all types of customers from all different ethic backgrounds.  Coworkers are all nice thy want you to succeed no one really putting down the next worker its really a teamwork makes dream work environment.
good,"Coming into work I would first look at the schedule to figure out what team I am working with. Then I jump right into checking the Priority Bin for calls and the Customer call list. In between getting through all of the calls (calling the people in regards to online orders, will calls, and repair orders) I would be checking people out, and releasing both online, repair, and will call orders."
good,"I usually was scheduled to complete First Shift which is opening. I worked in the Seasonal Department. I stock merchandise such as soil , plants and flower, and etc. I water the plants as I attended Customers . I answered questions and assisted in helping the customers located the products they needed. I also recommend certain items and merchandise that fit customers' budget. I helped customers with generating ideas for their garden projects as well as called other stores for merchandise the store did not have in  stock."
good,"Personally it was a good experience, the only downside was waking up at 3 to be at work at 4 in the morning. never the less it was a fun experience but not a long term job"
good,my job at The Home Depot is to take care of customers in the hardware dept. and through out the day make sure the area in cleaned and stock. i also cashier and ring out customers with a smile to make sure they want to come back.
good,"Working for home depot was good, everyone was really friendly and were willing to help you.  They have everything you need when it comes to home improvement.  If you have questions everyone is willing to help."
good,"The store overall is a great place to work. The people are friendly with the occasional not-so-friendly people but they're nothing to worry about. The set up in the store could be a bit more efficient. We've been getting many complaints regarding location of pickup items, and I can't say I blame them."
good,"A typical day at Home Depot involved maintaining an accurate cash register balance, assisting customers and providing them with a great shopping experience. I learned so many different things at Home Depot, but my favorite had to be all the DIY workshops. Home Depot associates were like family!!!"
good,When going into work its best to expect the unexpected because the company is always making changes. Somedays are the same and then some are completely different. As part of 2nd shift a typical work day can either be very entertaining or very stressful. When its entertaining is when the company is ahead on the workload and it keeps every one busy and productive. When its stressful is when its behind and everyone is in a hurry to finish the days work.
good,Always busy high paced atmosphere. Benefits are exceptional. You need to be thick skinned to be a leader in this building as you are critiqued often. You meet lost of people
good,"HomeDepot was awesome to me!!!! Good benefits, great coworkers and an excellent organization. Had nothing but a blast working there and learned many home improvement tricks as well."
good,"Unloaded trucks and stocked shelves, I learn how to drive an order picker, managers were great very helpful, hardest part of the job was the late hours,"
good,i am currently work at home depot as a sales associate but started off as a lot associate. There are a lot of other things you need to do that are not in you job description as taking out the garbage from the lot as well as lunchroom etc.( varies from store to store) Removing tarp off lumber lifts when they are received which is fine in the summer time but in the white it hard. A lot of times your under staff and have to run around like crazy going peoples dirty work. although it is a great place to work if you move to any other position out of that.
good,"wake up early to get to work at 5 from that time on it was finding the area assigned for the day and stock, straighten up, and help customers with anything they need or refer them to a associate that does. management had a lot of issues the boss was unfair and sarcastic. did not know how to approach he's employees and constantly put down certain employees. co-works were great and helped motivate employees. best part was the co-workers and  atmosphere of the job. hardest was staying how early it was."
good,Learned a lot of customer service and working with the general public.  I also learned and aquired skills to micro-manage project details and time lines.
good,"not enough space for growth, no for night crew appreciation. not enough payment. people are wonderful fun to work there not always busy but when its busy we work hard."
good,I didn't mind my job at home depot  I worked part time got to see that side of the building trades. people in general were nice I liked helping customers with my knowledge especially the older folks.
good,Great people and a great place to work.  always room for advancement and new training.
good,"The job is great. However, I am in need of a full time job, with higher wages."
good,"The Store Manager had too many favorites that she would let them get away with not taking care of their departments.  The Store Manager is rude.  She picks on employees who are well mannered and considerate.  I liked working there though because of the cool home projects and because of the nice people behind these projects.  I like helping people and the days I worked I made sure my customers got what they needed for their home project.  I didn't just sell them something they would not need or use.  I learned a little bit more about tools, and how to make a cart car.  My co-workers were awesome, it was really fun to work them.  The hardest part of my job was, dealing with the Store Manager, she knew her job.  But her people skills need work.  The best part of my job was dealing with the customers, and helping my associates.  Learning the different areas in the store."
good,"Well, I've opened and closed but opening is the hardest thing. Being at work at 5:30am isnt easy but I get there and get the morning checklist completed but 6:30. Then power hours start from 10am-2pm. That's when work gets rushed and there is a rush of contractors and customers who are do-it-yourself. There are some customers who yell and have tempers but I've never lost my temper or felt upset or angry. I'm always cool as a cucumber. I've worked with other nationalities and religions and I've gotten along with them. The most enjoyable part of working at this establishment is that there is never a dull moment and always something to do."
good,"It worked in a location with wonderful people. The customers could be hard to handle at times. The management changed frequently, sometimes for the good and sometimes bad. There is room for advancement."
good,My review was very good and outstanding while at the home depot....
good,"Home Depot is a promising place for students , since it is seasonal"
good,"My last review was rated I (for improvement). I did my best to complete the tasks that I was to improve on. I Improved on my Pack Down task 100% my other request was to complete Cashier Training."
good,"As Operations Manager, a typical day at work would be to open the store and do a safety and security check of the building. Get the store prepped and 'grand-opening' ready for our guests (customers). In this posiiton I learned how to be organized, professional and I learned how to manage a team of diverse social cultures. The hardest part of the job was the hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was the opportunity to work with the public and to make a positive impact on the lives of my operations team and customers."
good,being a merchandise execution associate was interesting. it allowed me to use my physical abilities to help get projects done or simply helping a customer with everyday assistance. it gave us the opportunity to work as a whole team and/or an individual depending on the task(s) needed done. i would not mind working there again.
good,I learn something about my job and anybody else job when there was a person call in i was the one to call on and learn
good,"Handled money more times then not, I loved interacting with customers on a daily basis. Management did well with the store but didn't care much for the workers."
good,"My time at the Home Depot was a very good experience for me and my career. I had many different jobs and different positions with them. The last position I had with them, I was a department supervisor, which was challenging and a lot of fun at the same time."
good,"fun coworkers and very friendly management who made the day much better, and of course our shoppers were very patient when we had not enough stock. I enjoyed helping and assisting our guests with anything they needed as in cable wires light bulbs and anything electrical"
good,Daily your job depends on what you get accomplished from the day before. Training is done on a daily bases and you always learn something from customers. Most mangers are very helpful when needed. Some of my co-workers are very helpful and some are not. I never had really a hard part of my job. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to make sure the customers leave with everything needed for there projects and that I gave them great customer service.
good,"I would take the pallets from the back pad and organize them by department, then take product to isles and put product on the shelf. At the end of the night put the product that didn't fit in the overhead and clean up my department and push any product to the back pad that we could not do."
good,"A typical day at work with The Home Depot consisted of 100% customer interface and interaction. My number one goal every day was to make sure every customer walked away satisfied. I learned a lot about flooring installation and how the company works with subcontractors and 3rd party installs. The management with The Home Depot were outstanding! Anytime you had something going on at home, or in the workplace, they were always there to help you. They made your schedule depending on your needs and your life outside of work. The hardest part of the job was making the unsatisfied customers happy. I loved every part of my position with the company. "
good,Enjoyed learning the reatial enviroment as well as learning how to manage 10-20 people a day.
good,"A typical day at home depot is dealing with customer in person, or by incoming and out going phone calls.Complete weekly reports as assigned. We deal with every department in store regarding special order, complete loan and credit card application.My co-workers are fun, the hardest part of the the job is trying to please all of the customer all the time.the most enjoyable part of the job is when the customer leave with a smile on there face."
good,They are a good company to work for but management its very bad.
good,"The working life at The Home Depot, first I walk the aisles to insure that they are safe and free of product. I then check to see if we have any missing product on the shelves, if so I order more. I have learned to manage my time and work on different task at the same time. Management works really well with the associates. As for the co-workers, there is a very motivated working environment. I feel that there is really nothing hard about working at The Home Depot. The most enjoyable part of the job is giving excellent customer service."
good,"on a typical day you are working with people you enjoy working with, ive learned patience here as well, management was GREAT, my coworkers were for the most part all team players, the hardest part about this job was being alone on one end while everyone else was on the other, the most enjoyable part was meeting new people"
good,"I learned garden center, cashiering, front end supervisor, and bookeeping. Very busy day of work. The hardest parrt is the monthly reviews. The most enjoyable is the benefits and customer service."
good,"A typical day at home depot is all about customer service and having fun at the same time. Meeting new people and learning new things is what this job is all about! I love working there, but I am looking for new opportunities and challenges. The people are great and fun to be around and it really makes your day go by easier when you work with great people. The hardest part of this job is all the standing that is required but with the right pair of shoes, it makes it a little easier."
good,Very stressful job with a lot of interaction with customers. Management does not support fairly enough. Great employees with great knowledge that work for the company.
good,"No benefits, all associates are hired on as temp help for 4 months at which point you may or may not still have a job. They tend to overschedule weekends and then send people home if its not busy. Most of my hours are scheduled on weekends and I have only worked about 20% of them since starting, very disapointing."
good,The Home Depot is a good company to work for. I worked there while I was in college and during the summer.
good,It is a nice place to work. You learn alot of skills that you can use everyday. And in some cases you get to help the customer
good,this job was cool. its just boring when it gets slow. your just standing around waiting for customers. but it goes but ast when its busy aand you learn alot about tools and diffrent types of wood
good,"I would of work longer at Home Depot, but I went back to school full-time and also I did not like working outside in the cold and in the heat. Also I got alone with all my co-workers."
good,The employees that's there are loving family they good people once you get to know them. Connecting with the customer that been come there for years..
good,"If you stay off your phone and just be swift in a smart organized manner you'll be alright. Depending on the management, you'll have a better experience than others."
good,If you can work in a high stress environment and have thick skin than you will do fine at any Home Depot. Product knowledge is a must and will make the job a lot more easier to navigate.
good,"As a part-time associate I received, sick, vacation and success share benefits. "
good,"great place to work just salary is an issue they should pay more for this position "
good,"a typical day in home depot for a lot associate is mostly pushing carts back too there designations and responding too people needing assistance and bought goods in there cars, working here taught me too be more self reliant and too be fast. workplace culture while friendly however I never felt like I belonged. while  management would help improve working conditions I only felt safe outside from 3-6 when the sun was up, often the hardest part of the job was the thief's they made me paranoid about being injured. however the most enjoyable part of the job was helping contractors and customers hearing what projects they were planning"
good,"The Home Depot has great benefits and an excellent culture but the company itself expects too much out of its workers. I have worked at one of the warehouses for about six months and I am about to leave because the job is too physical. The shifts are ten hours long and they put me in the hardest department, PTS (put-to-store). I sort and lift boxes all day, many of them extremely awkward and heavy. I came straight out of high school and they thought that I would be able to handle that kind of labor for over three months. They advanced me to an easier department and then dragged me back to the hard department because they thought that my performance would be better working in the harder department. The turnover rate is pretty big and they will not pay attention if you tell them that you need to be moved to an easier department. The performance system they use is controlled by a computer and my numbers are always awful even when I work so hard that I collapse when I get home. Would not recommend unless you are extremely fit. Even the most fit people can't attain 100% performance and you will probably lift water heaters all day."
good,The HomeDepot.com call center is generally a high volume call center with large emphasis on the customer's overall effort. They make it a point to make sure every employee understands the fundamentals of call flows and computer navigation in order to minimize the customer's effort. Supervisors are generally supportive of employee's concerns and receptive to feedback.
good,"A friendly atmosphere that can thrive with teamwork. It can get really stressful at times, but by communicating, things go smoothly and accurately. It's a good idea to get acquainted with coworkers in different departments to not only better understand the uses of products, but to help out customers with questions and lead them in the right direction. The job can be very physical; from going up and down ladders to lifting heavy materials and items, so keep that in mind."
good,"Mistreated , unfair , unethical in resolution dept. don’t trust the leadership. They will lie and cover up for each other. Don’t trust them. It’s a colt in that particular dept"
good,"A typical day at the Home Depot could be crazy and slow at the same time. There would be times where lines were ten people long and then all of a sudden, there would be no one. I learned the people would return items simply because they were done with it."
good,I would not reccomend the order puller job they want you to do alot of work for little pay and want you to do it all while helping customers at the same time and pull certain orders under 30 min all the while will rarely have some one working with you while that it self requires 2 people min
good,Pay is way to low for the work you do. Not a lot Opportunities in merchandising. Store doesn’t give you the right stuff to do your job management only cares about the numbers that they need to reach every week or month or year that they need to reach
good,"I worked there for two years and three months as aan opening Lumber, building materials, millworks associate. Mind you I was covering all three departments at the same time. I was alone for the first 4 hours of every day. Plus being a heavy equipment operator, unloading flatbed trailers, loading customer with a forklift, doing equpiment safety check lists answering the phone for three deparments, cutting building materials for cusomes and being a sales associate."
good,I like working with the people there they were funny it’s just the hours wasn’t what I was looking for I needed 40+ Hours and when I asked for a promotion they told they could afford to pay me for it but then they hired like 6 more people
good,"having worked across two stores for 5 years I can effectively say that each store has its ups and downs. personally, I find that when each store is up it is one of the best places to work for however when it is down you almost feel as though you are punished for working hard as you gain a reputation for trustworthiness which is rewarding to a degree, however, the load of others who do not do their job can be passed off onto you. That being said many of the people that I worked with I consider great friends and enjoy many of my co-workers immensely!"
good,"working for Home depot was a fun and learning time for me I got to travel and help do community work, also I got to travel outside of the store to deliver merchandise to customers."
good,"I did not enjoy working here towards the end.  They would block off the summer for part timers so, that you could not have weekends or any time off through the summer."
good,"At first everything was going very well, but soon after management went down the drain. Hours got cut down heavily from the high 20s every week to 8-15 hours a week. It was very unfair, new associates who had higher position than others had no idea what to do or how to lead."
good,"very hard work but good hours, 4 10 hour days per week with optional 8 or 10 hour days for overtime. very tedious manual labor in hot conditions but overall not bad at all"
good,"You will feel like you are in a second home. At least at the Home Depot I was in, everybody cared for one another. Everybody looked out and help. I basically felt at home when I was st work."
good,"I enjoy the work place because of my co workers you have fun it like my second family when you in trouble with anything they willing to help with anything  plus they will do fund raiser when it possible, the hours is great for me but for I know and can do I think I should get pay more compare to what  I get"
good,"Home Depot is a nice place to work, they are very understanding and will work with you for scheduling. During the slow seasons you are scheduled 10 hours from time to time if you are part time."
good,"I loved what I did at the Home Depot, but it was really my co workers that made my job so enjoyable. if you came into work in a not so great mood, your co workers would always change that. everyone got along really well and helped one another out."
good,The Home depot is a place that alternate between being mildly fast paced and mildly slow paced. your days are never boring because there's always something to do. except for winter time because the store is not very busy in that season. current work environment. is great to work in. people are generally good natured where I work.
good,Great place to work but bad pay. Management is ok and job security is pretty good. The work is balanced and they really care for your safety. I would recommend working here.
good,"A typical day at work, management could be 100 percent better, work experience is up to you. You have your pros and cons. The most enjoyable part of the job is Meeting all the New People from around the world."
good,they make you work so hard but pay so little you are busting your butt for nothing i learned to work how much you get paid and nothing more the management was ok good people
good,fun experience aside from the occasional normal work conflicts. things could have been more organized but overall i have fond memories of working there
good,The benefits are great but management needs to be to be able to  do all specialty departments before being advanced.  Most of the time the home depot becomes a part of your family.  They do care about the community and yourself.  I learned a host of jobs their and the ceiling cap was unlimited for myself.
good,"The management is nice to me, but they only look at me as a lot person. My resume shows so much more I can do for them, but they are happy having me stay in the lot position. For any job I do, my mind has to grow gaining better work experience. At Home Depot growth isn't happening. My overall rating of them is they are a wonderful company to work for to get by, but not good for career growth though."
good,"had a great compensation package. Management was very diverse. There's advancement in the different departments. Many different people to work with, which was my favorite."
good,everyone was work orient in there designed section. However worked as a group to get the work done. Everyone was well acquaint and it left a warm and comfy working environment.
good,"very strenuous work... lifting 50,60,70 pounds for ten hours a day... not a lot of team work involve... the break is extremely short compared to the long hours.."
good,"I loved home depot! all day customer service, not one dull moment, loved the atmosphere and my daily customers. not for anyone who has a bad attitude."
good,"Every day is something different at my department. I work in the Special/Customer service desk which deals with order pick ups, confirmations, credit card/billing questions, product knowledge, overall service for a customer. Being an employee at The Home Depot for almost four years has taught me a lot in regards to my customer service. Every day my limit is pushed but without a push, i would not know where I lack/gain experience and/or knowledge. The only hard part about learning the Special Services Desk is that its hard to move out from. Your knowledge with the system is highly appreciated and acknowledged. Due to the wide range of questions and products that you gain knowledge on helps you move up to a big position. You just have to be very patient. Overall great company and awesome workers!"
good,a good day is when we have a lot of orders to process and getting trucks stocking our inventory. a bad day will be cold day (snowing) and a fire drill compelling people to go out into the cold till its all over
good,Home depot has good benefits. They never gave me any issues with my school schedule. Hardest part about the job is lifting heavy boxes and being by yourself in your department. Overall its not a hard job to do.
good,"The Home Depot is a nice place to work. Everyone is very friendly and helpful.The working environment is great.The only thing is, there is hours problem for part time associate. Part time associate gets good hours during the summer when its busy, but in winter its slow, where part time associates get less hours."
good,My typical work day starts with customer service on the work floor and making sure my supervisor is on top of things. My learning experience was learning all about plants and household products to sell for the right job the customer is working on. My managers have been very nice to me and have been very supportive with my schedule. My co-workers are nice to work with and we make sure we get the job done. The hardest part of the job was closing down the store when I first started. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to learn from other people's experience in this job.
good,"safe place to work, i really dont want to go into much details about this place it was a job."
good,"pay wasn't that great, felt i was working very hard for 8.95 an hr. ended up leaving the state and found a job elsewhere for more money. the good thing is that they offer health benefits for part time employees"
good,"Un lugar muy bueno de trabajo, capacitacion constante, gran compañerismo."
good,i enjoy working in people filled enviorments with cumminication and interacting.
good,"You start work when you leave the break room. Each goes to assigned department (usually permanently). If you have morning shift, you will go to morning meeting everyday. A typical associate will do the following:"
good,"My job was to operate a fork lift shipping and receiving freight to and from trailors. My overall learning experience was learning how to actually operate heavy equipment, work at an dextremely fast pace how to be more timely and productive. With this company you actualy have some supervisors that work just as hard as the employees and some just sit around and do nothing. The bright side of my dsy was when I was with my team as a whole we did what was needed to get the job done and we did it together! I would say the most hardest part odf the job was leaving for the day I really enjoyed my job, my supervisors and my former co workers. My joy was coming in and seeing the faces of not only my co workers but my family! We were a team!!"
good,"•	Responsible for the Profit & Loss of a $40 million Home Depot operation. "
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,not a fan of the way the individuals carry themselves. the front end supervisor likes to demean and belittle disabled workers.
good,"Not a bad place to work besides the pay. Employees get along well, managers are your boss and friend. Lots of work to be done to include down stocking. Go home tired but overall good place."
good,worked everyday and had jobs to do not a bad job just gets cold and hot inside
good,"A typical day of work at Home Depot is very hectic, busy and slow. A busy work day will move slow because of a few number of workers. I learned the value of teamwork, how to work at a fast but steady pace, learned techniques on stocking/packing and how to organize neatly at a fast speed. With the few workers that the company had we still had a tough and strong management team. My co-workers wasn't the best but they where pretty fair, no matter how fast or slow they move we all got the job done. My job title was a cashier, i would say the hardest part about my job was dealing with various attitudes daily from customers but I always made sure that my job was done correctly to avoid any issues. The most enjoyable part about the cashier job was seeing a happy and satisfied customer."
good,I got to learn more about a little bit of everyting pertaining to construction. I thrive on being able to help customers and actually knowing what they need instead of pretending. Just seeing the customers faces after I helped them made me feel really good.
good,"Aprendi a manejar efectivo y a tratar con el cliente, a trabajar bajo presion, habilidad numerica, a vocear."
good,"Clock in, go to the war board and check in with the other head cashiers to see what needs to be done that day then do those things"
good,Great atmosphere. Very kind customers and employers. Employees care about their customers providing them with answers to any question they might have.
good,Very learned experience working there. Got to help alot of customers
good,"At the Home Depot I had some very good customer service engagements. I spent a lot of time working on my product knowledge because being in a workplace with over 40,000 products was sort of different for me to get used to. As far as the management goes, the location I worked at was very polite and lenient, I appreciated that. Breaks were timed accordingly. As far as doing everything I was supposed to and getting to work on time I maintained that but there were times I went through some personal struggles, so I behaved in ways that weren't always appropriate and I got reprimanded for it."
good,Great company to work for. Always opportunity to learn new things and have the ability to develop your associates into something amazing. Culture here is above and beyond other companies I’ve worked for in the past.
good,great place to work lots of opertundy lots of great people lots of work good binafits very good place clean and a safe work place very easy work and layed back
good,I do truthfully enjoy was tout us that I do and working with and helping customers remodel their homes. I am a very experienced home reselling Tile installer.
good,Worked there for 5 years. Easy to learn new things. Very friendly people and managers. People constantly leaving though because it’s more a of a high school environment since they hire 16 year olds.
good,It was a good workplace but full time positions are rare to get in there. If you get full time than id feel like you have it made. Only hard part of the job is when supervisors didn't help like others from different departments.
good,"If you need a way to help with schooling, gain some business and retail experience, as well as advance when its available, then Home Depot is a great place to start."
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at home depot were some of my co workers, they helped me get around the store and the department I was working in. The hardest part of my job was waking up at 5am but eventually I got used to it."
good,"* Typical day is chatting with Customers about their projects "
good,"A typical day at the Home Depot (Tool Rental) consists of walking your specific department to ensure that it is ready for customers to easily search and purchase the items they are shopping for. Once the department is walked and all necessary maintenance requirements are met, then we are able to assist customers with any questions.comments.or concerns they may have regarding a specific  product.Our goal is to ensure that our customers are receiving excellent customer service."
good,"You learn things you never knew before, as to where even after you leave you still remember them.  Even though can be stressful at times they have there perks"
good,"everyone works together to give the customer a great experience. the management can vary depending on which manager is working that day, some work with you and some just boss you around."
good,"I enjoyed being a cashier because I felt good seeing customers leave with smiles on their face. One time I had a customer having a terrible day and they asked me why I smile so much, I replied that life makes me happy and it feel good to see them smile after just saying that."
good,Everyday is a different day. The typical day will consist of making sure the customer goes home happy and gets what they need. It may become stressful during power hours when there aren't many associates on the floor.
good,"Working at Home Depot was very laid back, there was a balance between work and home life. Overall with being of a different race I did deal with other things some would not have from customer. But not from the employees themselves."
good,Home Depot is really a big family that’ works together . When I obtained the job I was the youngest one there . So I figured I was an “ outcast “ by they made me feel as an equal
good,"As a merchandiser we find out every morning what projects or displays have to be built.You have to be some what good with tools on some of the displays but not all. Some days we just straighten out the bays so it is easier for people to shop.The culture is very adverse with many different people working there.I have learned to balance merchandising with trying to help customers fix their problems.The management is great at the Home Depot.The hardest part of the job is meeting the deadline for some of the projects, while the most enjoyable part is seeing and meeting different people every day. Over all it is a good place to work with a chance for advancement.The merchandising team hours are Monday to Friday with weekends off, while if not on merchandising team you will have weekend hours."
good,"Fun place to work. No stress or harassing managers. They trust you to do your job & help your other team mates. Also, have an awareness as to what’s going on in different dept.  show initiative!!!"
good,Home depot is a company who stands by their values especially when it comes to taking care of their employees. The environment is more like family and there is great room for growth and advancement.
good,Its a good first job for anyone. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and customers are usually pretty friendly. Most of the departments are decent to work in and department supervisors are easy to talk to.
good,a very wonderful company to work in with very flexible job hours and also very friendly staff to work with as well . they are always willing to help and teach you new things .
good,"Third shift has unbalanced life to work"
good,"I love my work family, but the customers and some supervisors work a lot of work to deal with. I still stay in contact with most of my employee family and most of them are not working there because of lack in their part as well as the job was not one most people stayed at."
good,I love the feeling of  being In big family but the is a lot of favorites going around the managers really don't know how to talk to you as people they don't help you out that much
good,"HD is a Great Company with Great Core Values,  I worked  at multiple HD locations in addition  to working in multiple Departments. I worked on the retail side as well as the merchandising side of the business."
good,"my typical day at work included credit card payments, will call and special order set ups. Returns and online ordering and online returns, as well as answer the store phone calls. Every Tuesday i had meetings with the employee committee and help raise more for the store."
good,"My work shifts here consists of assisting clients with potential purchases, finding items at the LIC store and others within the area.  I also distributing online orders placed at the LIC location."
good,I would highly recommend working here if you are into the building trades and home improvement. Very Busy expect to take on multiple job roles at one time. For example sales associate and stock person.
good,"Freight team is easy, it's just a matter of putting boxes in the right place and knowing how to use a step ladder. Co-workers are all friendly and helpful"
good,"Worked with great co workers and learned a lot from them."
good,"a typical day at work, as a sales associate , when you don't have any customers it is pretty chill, packing down is cool Fratenizing with your co workers. The hardest part of the job is the physical work you have to do, but truly the customers they suck lol. Most enjoyable part of the job is having the freedom to walk around and converse when you feel."
good,steady pace all through work. all the employees were great and very personable. everyone worked extremely hard and were very productive. In said environment was one of my best experiences
good,"A typical day at work consist of a lot of paper work , I have to make sure our on hands report is correct, as far as where special order's are located and if customer has been contacted recently with in the week. This goes for all order's , bopis (.com order's), will calls (customer paid for product and placed on hold to pick up another day/time) and special order's. Next is file and answer phones as well as any questions a customer may have."
good,"was avery nice place to work,grest benifts  best job ever had was there 3 years started out part time and was promised full time company changed managers"
good,"My job  as a Freight(Packdown)associate with Homedepot gave me good knowledge.I met a lots of new fellow associates to work with and they are very nice people to work with.The hardest part of the job is when one of the teammember not show or call in to work,the work will hard to be done.And the most enjoyable part I like from the Job Homedepot is,I met a lot of friends.They also thought me plenty new techniques of the job that I never had before.."
good,very ecclectic position with having to learn different aspects of the products and services offered
good,"a typical day does not exist every day is a adventure something to be learned, i learned customer service and the management wwas excellent. My coworkers were like a family many i retain friendship even now. The hardest art of the job was the hours early morning to late nights. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people,."
good,Lots of diversity going and and improvement for the company. Technology is helping associates deliver great customer service which will in turn maximize profit.
good,"A typical day is pretty hectic, its like a factory with customers. Be aware help customers, keep smiling and its not a stressful job. Employees help each other out don't be afraid to say you need help its encouraged you do so."
good,Hard working with many possibilities for advancement.  Always looking out for the customer. Willing to do whatever needed to get the customer what they needed.
good,It is a  Great work environment management couldn’t be better there is not a high pay rate and annual raises are not hi almost no chance to grow but it is a secured job
good,"The people at The Home Depot are fantastic to work with. Unfortunately hours distribution is done on the success level, meaning that there aren't enough hours to get the sales to get more hours."
good,I recommend all home owners work with home depot for a time.  The knowledge I received there allows me to work on my home without assistance.  Of course I won't do the roof without a professional but I'm confident when it comes to flooring and plumbing.
good,"It seemed there was a lot of turn over in this company, really don't have much to say about Home Depot, the hours were changing, expected to know all departments with lack of training."
good,"The manager and job culture was excellent. The pay however was not so good. The work was very hard, and I believe Home Depot can afford to pay their people more."
good,"The pay is very fair and the people are usually very nice and good to work with. They are pretty flexible on hours for a cashier. For the most part it is a safe environment to work in, but as with all companies accidents can happen. They do strive to make the environment clean and clear of problems."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the customers happy and satisfied with the service I provided. The only part of the job I did not enjoy was having to push credit because the store was located in a senior based community.
good,"Working with Home Depot was a good experience . I learned a lot of new things in terms of handling tools and my coworkers were more than helpful. The hardest part of the job was leaving to be honest. My customers always brought the most to my day , i came across a lot of pleasant people."
good,"I liked  working in a team, by me being young it was a thrill getting to know different trades throughout the store. Management did their part by keeping everything up and running. Working with my co-workers was a good experience, it taught me how to rely on a team to get the job done instead of by self and it was a great learning opportunity. The hardest part was loading the customers cars when it was a straight 90 degree week ooutside, but the easiest part we just coming to work period."
good,A lot of micro management and tasking. No interpersonal relationships with employees. Cross trained in various departments. Lack of recognition of other employees who doe equal amount of work.
good,"it was ok easy job and people to work for, learned how to packdown and use a op. you help people with their needs and thats about it"
good,"I enjoy meeting new people, in learning new things, I have experienced a lot working there I make people day , I put a lot of smiles on people face, just by helping them get what they needed."
good,"Worked on recieving and returns"
good,Home Depot was absolutely a family work enviroment. Most of my relationshisp where cultivted at the Home Depot. it is easy to come in and work beacuase of the teqam atnosphere. They truly live this style. Was ver collaboritive.
good,ok place to work but new labor model does not benefit all. The people you work with are awesome and that is one of the main reasons for a lot of tenure with Home Depot
good,home depot had its moments of being fast paced especially during the holidays. its also had its lax moments as well. overall I enjoyed working at home depot
good,Having the best co workers you can have and drinks the best coffe in the morning also have a very good understanding management team I love my job. Being a cashier is very experiencing.
good,"Fast paced, great people and room for advancement.I enjoyed learning from my coworkers."
good,"It was a fun and exciting place to work. It allowed me to grow and become a better person,and the Company focus on building your skills and character."
good,Typical day at work slow.
good,"The best managers I have had in a long time, very nice people that are willing to teach you things and keep a steady flow for their work. Although some of the employees are extremely lazy and will lay down the mule work for me constantly. Would work like a dog for only 11.50, but customers and most co-workers are always friendly."
good,perfect work for a student looking to make it on his own. they pay great and room for advancement is there. the homer awards make you feel great as a employee
good,"Very relaxed work environment and great, supportive management. It can get hectic at times but it's very played back depending on the position you have."
good,salaire trop bas chez home depot j'aimerais avoir un meilleur salaire
good,"Management does not care about people. There are no associates. And when there are associates, there's no training. Work/life balance, bare minimum. Hours are all over the place. Supervisors have no power. Benefits are actually really good. Used to be available for part timers, but now just full time. Constant changes in policies. Hard to keep up with. "
good,The work is not difficult as long as you have good customer service skills. But the management at this particular store doesn't know what they are doing. There is no training provided  and the scheduling is all over the place.
good,"a day of working for home depot, is very upbeat. I learned many things about home modeling, and re-modeling. The management is very abstract, not to employee friendly. my co-workers were awesome. the hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with the unfair treatment. the most enjoyable part of the job had to have been te customers."
good,every day was somehing new and the learned lot working at home depot. the management was horrible and often the mangers always sited with customers at any issues. My co-workers were ok they just come to work and do there jobs.The pay was awful i had been there for almost 4 yrs and i was barely making it.
good,"Management was sneaky and manipulative. They would do anything it took to achieve their own personal goals , even at the cost of hurting the employee's. Everyone was so fake  and cut throat."
good,The Home Depot is very easy to work for on the MET team. Its very repetitive but never enough hours. Loved the fact that I never had to work on the weekends.
good,they get you there with promises of full time or advancement in the company. that is not the truth. they get you in then use you where they want in management roles but never promote you to that position that they promise even tho i was awarded 7 awards in 7 months
good,"Had to compete for your underpaid job with undocumented workers, rather dangerous in some cases. Lots of manual labor and heavy lifting for such low wage. Great way to get a young kid to wake up."
good,They don't hire full time and during winter part time gets little to no hours. You can have 20 hours one week then end up with 6 hours the next they're not consistent in anything they do. Supervisors and training tell you to work one way but managers do what they want telling you to work a different way. Managers always take the customer side not yours but then scold you for not following returns policies
good,"a typical day at work is a general mapping out of tasks and what needs to be accomplished, what you learn as you go will eventualy make your job easier, you cant always rely on management and co workers are friendly as long as you choose the right ones teamwork is necessary the hardest part of the job is dealing with ignorant customers the most enjoyable part of the job is just making the best of the day"
good,Helping customers
good,I really can not say much about this company. i loved working there because i like helping people solve their problems with nice and calming manner. I have always provided a great customer service attitude
good,"At the time, I was working another part time job as well and therefore didn't have job work/life balance.  Also, customers would come in and ask to have 25 keys  to be made 5 minutes before closing.  Really inconsiderate.  Over all, the management was nice and the customers were also nice too."
good,"Horrible Management, was always very unorganized. Place was good work at but sadly the management and it affected the work place. Always very busy no matte what time"
good,"Good part-time for students, retirees and 2nd jobs."
good,"it's a nice place to work , but its just the really good hardworking associates aren't recognized and acknowledged enough..also they are over worked and underpaid"
good,"This is my first job and unfortunately I set my expectations too high."
good,"I would arrive at the home Depot at 6 am with a positive attitude,clock in wait for customers while drinking a cup of free coffee sometimes free donuts meanwhile I would help other associates restock shelves also helping customers with their needs helping customers load their items in their vehicles,we would take our first break after 2 hrs half hr lunch after when appropriate, no over time only approved by manager"
good,It is okay but not what I am looking for and it feels as if some ignorant the managers pick upon the employees. It is not a bad job but I need something that pays more for the hours I receive.
good,Worked for Home Depot during the time I was in school. Some amazing people work in the stores of Home Depot. Some managers are excellent but unfortunately most are overworked and underappreciated.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. The garden center was a great learning experience for me. Wanted to continue employment and work my way up to a supervisor role.
good,I enjoyed my time at the JcPenny Styling Salon. It is a great place for growth for beginner stylist. I would recommend this as a starting point for new cosmetologist.
good,"A typical place to work, Management fun at sometimes, strict at other times. Worked there for almost 8 years, I was in the process of changing careers."
good,"very boring job didn't do much just sat on a crate pressing two buttons all day, pay was low, very slow paced boring work environment."
good,"I used to love my job, had a great schedule, close to home. Co-workers were wonderful like a second family. Management recently changed and it was the worst thing that happened to the store, untrustworthy and out to get people fired, by recruiting people from previous store. Caused many people lots of stress, and many have quit already."
good,"good place to work, just management show favortism you have alot of freedom and plenty of room to learn"
good,I really liked working at home depot except for the 5am -9am shift  to early not enough hours. on my team we had a lot of fun
good,"On a typical day I answer phones a million times, I get happy and very angry customers but the difference is how you approach each customer and how the situation is handled. No one situation will be the exact same so there is a big learning curve. Associates for the most part are very fun and very helpful to myself and to the customers. The hardest part of my job is being alone at the desk and juggling the phone, creating orders for the customer in front of me, having 5 people in line that want to cash out, return, or make a credit card payment, and in the mean time I can find no help in the store. The most enjoyable part of my day is when I can make that one really really upset customer that is ready to just walk out and go to a competitor and turn them around sell them a product they love or help get them a solution for their current product and they leave with a smile and want to tell a manager about my service."
good,"The culture of being run down and working to the bare minimum is what they want, because if you proform and make money for the company they look to get rid of you. As both a Sales associate and a repair technician, i have seen this company belittled by the managers that are suppose to help you are actually trying to derail your progress."
good,"clock in "
good,A typical day at work will be stocking my area and helping customers and making sure my area was clean.
good,"Home Depot is a overall good job, but the managers were horrible at doing their jobs"
good,"Home depot  is a fast turnover because they don't give hours, sixteen and twenty hours per week can't pay rent. They hire more wartime workers and the full time workers that they have are very lazy."
good,"It has been an oka job pay isn't what I expected. Benefits are awesome. Customers are respectful at times. Hours are "
good,I enjoyed working at the home Depot in the beginning.  Then management changed and I no longer wanted to be there. I was a cashier and we were required to ask each customer over 5  questions.  1 manager was standing at my register making sure we were asking these questions. Very intimidating. I think the customers were no to impressed with all the questions.  Underpayed
good,"I enjoyed my time working at this store, but it was time to move on as the management team changed. When I started in 2015, teamwork was exciting and encouraging. It only takes one bad apple to mess up the entire batch."
good,"At the time I worked at Home Depot upper management was not supporting their lower management and supervisors.  It made my job as a supervisor a lot harder.  It did teach me to come up with creative ways to keep moral as high as I could and get those I supervised wanting to come back to work.  The most enjoyable part of the job was having satisfied customers that kept coming back and having those I supervised glad I worked there.  When I left after I got married and moved, a lot of the managers and associates left too.  They have new upper management and the associate that took over my position told me the new manager makes her job a little easier. It taught me workplace culture is important to the success of a business and its employees.  Attitude is everything.  A typical day at work is very simple and easy.  You go through training on computers and on the job throughout your employment there.  They teach you a lot of the skills you need to work there.  As long as everyone does their part on the job every day, Home Depot is a great place to work.  The pay is lower than other jobs but the benefits are better."
good,In need of insurance but being part-time I'm not offer it. I have a family but being part-time full-time is only offered to those that have open availability. Things I've been told after I had my first child and requested full-time.
good,would work there part time only for some sort of income but not for career advancement. I would show up to work and get to stocking and customer assistance.
good,A typical day at work is stressing.  You are pulled to all departments. All kinds of customers.  Workplace culture is lacking. Management doesn't always have your back.  The most enjoyable part is selling the kitchen you've been working on for weeks.
good,There was no study management and they do not inform their Associates of New Management that we're happening they do not for me of a measurement change for my department until somebody from outside my department told me
good,I've worked here for a long time and I really enjoyed working here recently we had a new system change and I think that it is way too hard on the associates.
good,Home Depot is a good place to work. There is a lot of product knowledge to learn if you really want to learn something new. I enjoy tools and so working in the tool department was rewarding.
good,At the Home Depot in Bridgeport WV everything was fine except for management. With the management in that store if you do not suck up and bend over backwards do please them you will not survive. Favoritism and politics are strong is that establishment and if you are not willing to bite your tongue than that is not the place for you to work. The company itself is an amazing company to work for. They do offer many amenities.
good,"but I was hired on a Temporary basis, assigned to hardware but due to labor reduction I had to work covering all departments. No time allowed for the on-line training, therefore, sessions were reduced, so I was the advancing in the completion of the training. I was warned that it would cause action from the HR Department. Finally, I completed the training with a100% rate, letter from HQ. Two days later, I was called by one of the AM staff and was notified that he had received a notice from HR to terminate my services because I had been too slow, the Store Mgr. was absent and I had to accept the Asst. Mgr., decision. Although he stated at that time that he would rehire me ""on-the-spot"" , when I re-applied I was notified that Company rule was "" Not to rehire terminated employees"". I kept my account with Home Depot for more than 6 years, but...….NO STARS."
good,"You have to be close to management to move up, and the moment you show a lack of interest in progressing your career with the company, they will terminate you"
good,Coworkers are great it is 3 managers in specifc that make going to work hard. The pay is really good. Part time workers get max of 30 hours while full time get 40. you get to save sick hours to call in and still get paid this was a good benfit
good,While the atmosphere is very relaxed and the schedule is very flexible there is little to no room for advancement. It is very hard to get promoted or move departments. Raises are given yearly but may only be a few cents especially for people who have been working for the company for years. Newer hires will make more money than older employees.
good,"The job is continuously change with no consistency. Its very high stress due to the system issue that happen on a daily bases. Between system issue, upset customer, orders being placed by customer even though we can't fulfill it, its upsetting. Then we are graded on seamless customer service. Like can it ever be seamless when we are not equipped. The store agents aren't knowledgeable so call center takes the beating."
good,"I would go in at 7 am every morning and unloading trucks, getting only two breaks and then going home. I think the mangers are nice and polite and they work with you a lot of the time. Putting paint on the assembly lines."
good,"The first thing the store manager tells you when you get hired is don't get too friendly with people. why? Because everyone is envious of you if you one-up them. Home Depot offers paid 15 minute breaks to its associates. Therefore people take advantage ( except the cashiers because were always understaffed) and live in the break room. Therefore the cashiers get yelled at by customers because there are never associates on the floor. Plus, those amazing benefits everyone talks about? GOOD LUCK."
good,Transportation was hard because I didn't know how to drive or have a car. Manager were hard to talk to and had high expectation. Worker there was nice but never really say hi.
good,Home Depot is cheep on paying new employees. Managers were job scared. Managers did not try to use the new hires skills. You worked in the department that they wanted you to cover. Always kept a minimum crew to run the store.
good,"I worked here a year and within that year I had been constantly busting my butt to make it easier for anyone else to do their job, I was constantly taken advantage of with no recognition for my hard work other than small rewards such as stickers or badges. I tried to climb in this company and the management having known this constantly would lead me on to a dead end. I volunteered a lot of my free time and days off to help with little projects."
good,"I've worked in every department in the store from freight team associate all the way up to management. Home Depot use to be a great company who actually cared for the employees. Now starting wages have gone while company profit has gone up. Call me crazy but if a company is doing well and profits are thru the room it would be good to show your employees some gratitude with better raises. Come on .25 -.45 raises a year, really? Unless you're management treat working here as a job just to get by until something good comes along."
good,Good company they say room for advancement but never follow though and have unrealistic goals as a manual floor loader supervision are young and cool but don't get on ones bad side because they choose favorite and will fire you. I was there for 9 months and never had a problem and they hired our 3rd op manager and he fired me for not knowing what its like to be broke
good,You work for the Navy repairing Navy ships its is a good job if you don't mind hard work I did it for 16 years but they do layoffs and you can pay your bills when your laidoff
good,"a daily over view, for my department......"
good,"Pay is sub-par, and expectations regarding commutes and time off are incredibly ridiculous. Expect to have your hours cut excessively and corporate politics are a constant in the workplace.  Women are not treated fairly for promotions."
good,"After working more than a decade with Home Depot, a poor management team came in a started a complete dismantling of a smooth operating work force.  Once letting go for one reason or another the majority of the supervisors, the management team was let go also."
good,"The job itself was great as well as the co workers, but the management was sub par. Several instances where certain members of management were very disrespectful to employees and you got the feel that there was an inner circle and if you were not in it you did not really fit in or feel comfortable around them."
good,"The management there was not well put together, and anyone under their job title were considered incompetent. No room for advancement and didn't fully complete my job training."
good,"I loved working for home depot, they were friendly and they make sure you are ready to be out on the sales floor when you are done with your training."
good,"tending to the customer "
good,"In all three departments worked, customer service was the first priority, whether making sure inventory was stocked and accounted for or addressing any needs as asked. Both the receiving department and customer service department included telecommunications with vendors, customers, trucking companies, and other stores."
good,Had an ok time here for 5 years. Many tasks are given and failure to complete even one task will result in a write up. Taking care of customers is a must but you also have a job list. There is no excuse to not finish. Lack of communication and help is this company's main down fall.
good,"Great job, sometimes crazy hours. Learned that I can do anything if I try hard enough. Work at it and you can succeed at what you set your goals to be. Loved my co-workers, great enthusiasm and hard working men an women. The hardest part of the day was trying to make sure that who ever I can encounter with got 5 star customer service. The best part of my job was knowing that I helped so many people over the years with all their home projects and got to see them come in a show me pictures of what I helped them create."
good,"My experience at Home Depot was great, It was a perfect first job. I started as a cashier and got promoted into the Lumber Department."
good,the job was ok.  Too many managers and a person don't know which one he or she should follow.
good,Your work is not rewarded.. You work hard and someone else gets rewarded.
good,"Fast pass, surportive management, friendly co-workers,"
good,"Home Depot is fun but alot of work. You have to have thorough knowledge of the store. even though home depot ensures they are ""one big family"", if you were to make a mistake due to lack of knowledge, it would be your fault, and your fault alone. Nobody will pick up slack, nor will they speak up for you if you were to get into trouble."
good,good company to work for except they dont realy care about the employyes only the profits
good,Retail store that management could have been a better team to help with associates.
good,"Was the best time of my life, work-wise. Made many friends that I still contact. Most Co-workers were great, so were the majority of direct managers."
good,The politics of the store are awful. Management is poorly trained and don't care how many people they hire or fire. The decision making process from the store management is laughable. The decision making process from corporate is mostly out of touch.
good,"night shift was easy, stacking and restocking the lumber dept. completed the list and got on stocking the rest of my dept, making it very easy to complete the night."
good,Trabajo muy fuerte para la paga. Lo minimo que debe pagar para esa posición es $20 por hr . La posición de “Material Handler” es muy pesada y extresante lo que ellos exigen para ganar insectivos es ridiculo
good,Working at the home Depot was very good and I am a very hard worker will love to be able to get hired with home Depot again in the paint department or garden just loves to mix paint or to sell plants those are my two favorite place in home Depot overall home Depot is the best place I have ever work
good,"The employees are really nice people. You have the ability to learn a lot and meet great people. Some of the coworkers taught me life skills. Sadly, the management team can’t be fair or held responsible about anything they say or do. They tend to not communicate with each other and then try to blame stuff on associates instead of owning up to their mistakes. It is possible to move up with the company but I personally would not advise it at this location."
good,"You can do your job and go home pretty easy. South Philly location tries to make it fun for you to work there with little things to do on calendar days,"
good,"Was a very active environment with many contractors coming in and out daily. Hardest part was making sure contractors orders were met with all required products needed."
good,"I usually worked 8-12 hours depending on who was working that day. My department was understaffed so a lot of the times I was closing or opening by myself. My store opened at 6 am most days and closed at 10. But the employees had to get there at 5 for the morning shift and stay till at least 12 for closing. I stayed late a lot of the times. Many of our sales end on holidays and you will probably have to work at least a couple holidays a year including Christmas, New Year, July 4th, and Thanksgiving. I did enjoy the people that worked there, we really we a family. But management was kind of rude and were very demanding regarding hours. Many of the people that were hired with me ended up quitting within a month because of the hours or management. My department manager worked 60 - 70 hours a week because of how much work management was giving him. Keep in mind this is just one particular store. I did enjoy helping the customers and they were generally really nice and understanding. I learned a lot from working there but if you aren't used to doing more hands on jobs and being on your feet for 8+ hours then I wouldn't recommend it. Also buy insoles because walking on concrete floors for extended periods of time will really kill your feet."
good,"Great place to work at but I wouldn't give it a five stars. I do understand business is business but being unprofessional doing business its not the same as doing good business."
good,I worked there for about 3 months and It was great. The people working there were so nice and understanding. I loved working there and I learned so much about plants and customer service.
good,The job was an interesting  experience. If you do not know how to put up with people this job probably isn't for you. You will get yelled at and treated nicely and get asked repetitive questions.
good,Home depot was fair. No Major Complaints. When I first started working for home depot I really loved how organized  it was. They  were very welcomed and gave me a opportunity for growth.
good,horrible job people were not compassionate or caring. Management was harsh. Pay was low for the job required. But the workers where hard working and loved there job.
good,"Due to the fact they are a retail industry its good if you need a part time job to supplement your full time job. However, there is not flexibility for the weekends, you must have a fully flex schedule which for some is not agreeable with worship on Sundays which should be considered."
good,"First of all, anyone who works retail will know what I am talking about. There is always something to do and sometimes not in the good way. At this job and in my department they expected way more out of each employee than they should have. If you get trained on lifting equipment such as a forklift, expect to be way busier than anyone untrained in this field but get paid the same. Meaning you get asked to doing countless amount of tasks involving some sort of lift equipment but get paid the same as the cashier twiddling their thumbs. The best part about this job was meeting all of your co-workers. The pay was good but not enough for the amount put on your plate. I also tried to transfer locations with this company and the recieving store was nothing short of rude."
good,"Really liked my coworkers, minus a few people, however it's hard to really move up and sometimes the hours aren't able to change when they need to. The managers are nice and all but they don't really manage well sometimes. Pays well but unfortunately not enough to really live on your own but that's because it's so expensive where I am. It's retail so obviously you are going to have good customers but you're also going to have the bad ones too. So in conclusion it has it's perks but most times it's stressful."
good,Very nice atmosphere to work with great people around you. Work is definitely enjoyable. Very low level of stress to deal with and would definitely recommend this company
good,"they don't stand behind their people. the communication is poor. No follow up with associates , and to much favoritism. they don't promote the right people (most qualify). you pay too much for your benefits."
good,"Home Depot doesn't pay well, until you make it to ASM but to get there is not an easy road.  They hardly ever hire full time, you start part time and if you lucky someday you may be asked to go full time.  Good luck!"
good,The company itself was ok but the lack of staff at the particular store I was working at made it difficult for people to have the motivation to stay. We were doing the work of 2 - 3 people and only making minimum wage.
good,"Low wages like most companies today, fair opportunities for advancement. With full-time status not viable to have a work life balance while employed there."
good,"The Home Depot is in the home improvement business and our goal is to provide the highest level of service, the broadest selection of products and the most competitive prices."
good,Bad leadership .  It confident in the leadership . Mislead in advancement. Disenfranchised . Promised but not delivered. Disappointed. Not promotional from with in.
good,"lack of management and not enough training, you were just thrown and learn as you go you had no benefits since it was commission only and they did not generate enough business for you"
good,typical day would be good. learned how to navigate the system. Enjoyed helping customers and staff with challenges. appreciated the diversity of employees. The least enjoying part of this job was being silent while being harassed by a supervisor.
good,"A typical day at work is easy enough, not too difficult but this particular redistribution facility has too many employees and we run out of work to do by the end of the week.  I need more hours.  I was implemented into the Coach/Mentor program for training purposes and career development, of which I have essentially been left out of.  After having three interviews for management positions, each of which the interviewer was shocked at my expertise and experience, I was told it was ""all about the people and people development.""  Meanwhile, not one member of management or the interviewers have asked me a single question about myself aside from the interview and have not had one conversation with me on the floor.  I would prefer not to be lied to by management in a place where I work.  "
good,"Extremely stressful and intense working in a retail management environment"
good,The store had too much favoritism. While some would work their hardest others got away with just clocking in to work. Managers did not treat everything fairly.
good,I started part time and my hours increased once the spring came along due to the high influx of summer visitors to the area. Season is almost up and hours where changed to what is convenient for Home Depot. Communication is terrible department heads make decisions with out ever consulting you. New store manager and he's barely there I've seen him twice since the spring and that's about it. A lot of demands for the night shift and very poor compensation. You have to work like an animal to get a full time spot. The manager exceeds more from a a crew of 5 at night than during the day. A crew of five is what puts away all the products at night and are demanded to do more with very little help or appreciation from the store manager.
good,I worked at Home Depot in the duration of my pregnancy. I felt that the management there is NOT fair. They do not support or try to work with you or your schedule. I was into a rough car accident while I was pregnant and I had to quit my job because they were going to fire if I didn't show up.
good,I loved helping customers with thier problems most of the time. the bad part was the upper managers with exception of a couple of assistant managers were liars and said they never were rude to any customers.
good,"I enjoy the extreme flow of variable people,  and the challenge of resolving there changing  issues.  In my opinion,  this is one of the best ways,  to keep you on your feet."
good,The managers never took responsibility... And they would leave trainees alone for hours at a time. Horrible hours.. and they always threatened to fire you even when you did something right.. not A good environment.
good,Its a great part time position. It has helped me get back in the work cycle. There are some definite flaws in this work place when it comes to advancement.
good,Work hard for $10.00/hr under watchful eye of supervisor constantly pacing around seeing what is going on. Lunch and brakes closely monitored. On feet all day. Sitting down is frowned upon.
good,work environment was hard on feet and too much heavy lifting for Sr. citizens.  position was better suited for younger people and very tough on older employees!
good,"Home Depot was a good place to work, but I needed full time hours and they just couldn't give it to me. My son was born and I really needed more than 20 hours per week to help out financially."
good,"fast pass work , good people ,short hours  good company to work for. Clean work place and will help you learn more about people needs and wants. great place to work"
good,Home Depot have a caring side for their employees and their personal encounters. They offer help during troubling times. They also try to support the holidays by supplying meals for the associates that are working the day before a holiday.
good,"they cherrypick which veteran they help, and is usually someone the manager is friends with. They also take advantage of veterans they hire and are verbally abusive."
good,"Works above and beyond attending to customers questions and product knowledge."
good,"I enjoy working at Home Depot for the most part, although a lot of the department heads leave a lot to be desired when it comes to work ethic and task assignment."
good,"You get what you give to it, if you go in with a sour attitude your going to have a bad day. People do ask about the entire store and where to locate goods so come armed with the knowledge that your going to be answering questions on one side of the store about products on the opposite side of the store."
good,"answer phones, write orders for contractors and also ringing customers up. i have learned to multi task which was a hard part for me at first but now im great at it. i loved coming to work to see my regular customer whom i known by name."
good,"It is very private and fast-pace environment. "
good,"Long hours, underpaid. A simple phone call to corporate and everyone in senior management panics.  GM no knowledge of logistic he was in right place and right time."
good,"Bad company no tools to really perform job duties, One benefit is the scheduling and pay is competitive and less stress."
good,didn't last long and they didn't want to work with my son moving here and needing more hours
good,A typical day at the Home Depot would start out slow. Depending on the time of year though. It usually picked up around 10 am. During my time we would always be understaffed so we would have to keep on our toes. Other times not so much. I learned that it really is key to provide a positive attitude NO MATTER WHAT. When you are in a good mood you can turn someones day around. There are going to be the few customers who need just that. The hardest part of the job at times would be getting the lines down. Not everyone would answer the page. So you would have to try to keep as calm as you could while trying to go as fast as possible but be careful when ringing a customer out. A lot of the items would look the same there for you have to keep a good eye on the appearance. Always make sure to check everything! Most of my co workers were amazing. They are also very helpful if you need it. Over all I enjoyed learning new things. There had always been something new.
good,"What an unorganized place, to start off. But a typical day would consist of me arriving, and handling daily duties, then clocking out when it was time. I learned how to up sell which was very important. Management was hardly ever seen, had very little to say. Co-workers were from all walks of life, most were nice, some were reserved. The hardest part of the job was the manual labor when dealing with heavy building materials. The most enjoyable part was dealing with nice customers."
good,"The company was very hard on the cashiers (my position), demanding that they sold credit cards to every customer and where hard on the cashiers if they did not follow all the rules, such as where and how to stand, where of not you smiled, etc, etc.  If you did not follow these rules you where criticized and ridiculed and threatened with being hired."
good,"I have been trapped in the same department for over ten years, with little hope of escaping since I am rated number 1 in the district in Millworks sales. being the most qualified won't get you the job, dong it for peanuts is the ticket. I enjoy exceeding my customers expectations, and seeing there faces light up when I solve their problem and save them money is the best."
good,your hours change from day to day. they don't care about you. over worked
good,"The Ga, Vinings building that shelter 8000 employees is clean and many amenities (Gym roo, cafeteria with an appointed chef."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Home Depot.I would typical be very busy as I worked in the Paint Dept., people are always looking to upgrade and remodel. I enjoyed working very close with with my co-workers. The only thing I did not like as well as many others that work there,they are trying to work with minimum amount of people. Sales is the number 1 concern but never would there be enough employees to give perfect customer service,which in turn would reflect in low numbers...You have to have bodies there in order for the business to run smoothly and quickly!!!!"
good,a normal day for me was unloading 2-3 trucks of lumber and building materials and packing them out alone. I learned to keep track of inventory and manage my time. Hardest part of the job is the work load. most enjoyable part of the job was helping people solve problems.
good,Company became obsessed with Credit Applications and gave amount to get daily and weekly. Co-workers were the best and always willing to help each other. Meeting new customers and helping them was the most enjoyable part of the job
good,getting on a register or in returns
good,its a active warehouse busy 24/7 . it has its ups and downs .. lots of seniority work ethic not so great
good,"Learned parts of the trade involved with home gardening and do it yourself projects. Weekly tests we given to assure new material learned had been memorized and could be used to assist customers. I was also trained on the tracking system for Home Depot products. I was licensed to operate: slip-sheet machine, four-way forklift, forklift, pallet jack, electric pallet jack, electric ladder, and an order-picker."
good,In my experience with the home depot they love to dangle carrots and what I mean by that is they promise a lot and they have no intention of following through
good,Fun and creative work environment.Enjoyed meeting new customers and heping them with their needs
good,"It was allright, but for overnight pay it was nothing. You can find a better oportunities during regular day hours!"
good,"Not sure what it take to move up, but never work for the Merchandising Team. There is no room for advancement. Also some have no idea what others do and are taking for granted"
good,"Cashier and trained other individuals. "
good,Unfortunately the co-workers were not so friendly to new employees and most of the supervisors not so helpful. I liked helping customers and interact with them.
good,"You will be paid fairly for what you do. Don't expects a lot of advancement if you are semi new. Most of the time the managers are pretty cool,but the attendance policy you have to stick to can be brutal."
good,i will commend the work at home depot but it was actually stressful and management was so biased. people just said that they are not biased but in fact they criticise by giving priorities as age group.
good,"So as all Retailers Business noting special."
good,They don’t care if you have a family just want you to work all the time no overtime allowed it depend on what store you work at not willing to give you the weekends off
good,You work in all departments.  Friendly atmosphere.  Available to learn as much as you want.  Working conditions are as outdoors...when it's hot and cold it usually is close to the same inside.
good,"Home depot is not a bad place to work but hours suck, and days off are not good for family life. but you can learn new skills and gain knowledge that can pave a new path. but good company to work for."
good,"Very fast paced, high expectation from customers and management. low wages and sometimes not enough hours scheduled. Great benefits and culture. Can be hard to move up unless you are close to management."
good,Most employees were team players. I was there for a seasonal position. I had to take some time off for personal reasons. Upper management were really not understanding. Was not offered a permanent position because of that.
good,"typical days are very stressful, management is very poor, hardest part of the job is multitasking, the most enjoyable part of the day is getting to see the regular customers"
good,"Management was horrible, they were always gossiping and in groups talking about other employees especially if you are younger than them. The other departments hated cashiers and always seemed like they had a stick up their butts. **Could be different for every store** "
good,"Miss working there ..just couldn't deal with the asms'. One constantly on her phone,another was a creep,and another i caught stealing money out the register. Bad energy."
good,"It was never planned that I would remain an Associate at The Home Depot for an extended period of time.  I had always worked in an office atmosphere, but needed flexibility when I began to care for my elderly parents four years ago.  Home Depot has been very good to me, working with my time schedule, finding a new position when I moved, and helping me when my Dad passed away last year.  I will forever be grateful."
good,Home Depot has a strong commitment to helping and improving the community. However that commitment does not always carry over from the day to day management to the employees. We understand Home Depot is fast paced but management has to go the extra mile to ensure the employees are properly trained for the job they are hired. Doing scenarios on a computer on familiarizes the employee to the subject matter it does not give them the hands on application or expertise to assist customers with their specific needs and/or questions.
good,"on a typical day, I come into work and check the schedule because I never know what department is in until I get there.  Management is alright they Micro-manage sometime but they are okay. The hardest part of the job is the constant rule changes one day it's we are doing this the way the boss says. Next day we are doing it a totally different way."
good,"friendly people, customers where great to speak with, help to keep clean the cashier area. was able to work different areas as a cashier, garden, lumber"
good,"The management at Home Depot was great except for the store general manager. He had his favorites and as such, they received all promotions, higher raises and best schedules."
good,"When I got to this location, I knew my job and have been a mentor to several new employees. The hours I work is a mid shift which leaves little time for an outside life."
good,"Its a good temporary job but if you're there longer than a few months you will slowly start hating your job. Mostly high school kids or old people who are idiots. The new FES is a absolute joke and theyre really strict about policies even though theyre terrible at training. I was always working and could never call off. You would only like this job if youre part time, old or just have a one-track mind and dont care much about what you're doing."
good,I left Home Depot on my own terms to open my own business. My business was not a success. I was offered a job at Riddle Village and took it. I was laid off by Riddle Village because they brought in sub contractors.
good,"The job is great but management makes you not want to be there. The customer is always right, never forget that! The people you work with becomes family and that’s what keep several people there."
good,"Management was under-qualified and unprofessional. My interview process at one store (4 interviews) was stopped in the middle with no notification, only because another manager from another store wanted me. I got hired within 15 minutes at the other store."
good,Everybody becomes friends when working here.  They always have contest going on between the cashiers to become cashier of the month.  Good Christmas bonuses.
good,"Many opportunities afforded me, but work/life balance was non-existent.  Spend many days working 24 hours to ensure my store had perfect scores on HR audits (which I always did)."
good,"Great place with great people. However, the particular store I went to lost track of their values, particularly, when it came to applying them to management."
good,It was a nice place to work. But some of the management was not so helpful. The company should have more mangers on the sales floor. I have anything else to say.
good,"It is a great place to work at, I called it my happy place. Flexible hours and part time and full time available. Diversity of departments  to learn from."
good,"The company as a whole is phenomenal. There are strong leaders that work for them, however, they are few and typically don't stay around that long. There is no room to have a personal life."
good,when you had work for 1 year 3 month the most thing  that you want its the opportunity to have a full time job.when you have a supervisor that ignores you for that full time and they need employees to cover those hours  and they hired new employees  and no response for my petition how would it fill.
good,"At first, working at home depot was great. Then as time went on and I had asked to be trained in other areas of the store, they refuse to try me out and see what potential I may have. That's when I decided to go back to school to peruse a more fulfilling career in healthcare."
good,Working at home depot is a blast with a great crew but the hardest part of the job is dealing with the management not knowing what they wont. The best part about the job is the relationships i have made with my co workers.
good,"Great people but coming from an office environment to a warehouse was an adjustment. Hot, humid and sweaty in the summer and freezing cold in the winter. Flys, mosquitos, mice and possums lived where you work."
good,Im glad I joined the team when I did. Very high role over rate and a very evolving company so much that it doesn't go with long term employees. But it definitely depends on the location that you seek because management matters in these cases and everything falls down from below.
good,the store i worked at was good at first then after one managers left they couldn't keep nobody in charge bosses where coming and going as much as regular employes.they hired the wrong people and i got canned for nothing
good,"Lots of energy, plenty of bumping into one another, room for growth when exhibiting the potential, many resources to perform at your best nothing to complain"
good,Raises are determined by years of service not work duties. If you excel and learn new duties you will receive the same raise as someone who refuses to take on additional duties.
good,I spend most of my day getting yelled at by customers and not getting backed by management.  Rarely get weekends off.  I like running workshops.  Wish the pay was better.
good,"This place was amazing to work at when I first started but since then its gotten progressively worse, many disagreements occur between associates and management over how situations should be handled."
good,"good place to work, it is fast paced and customer friendly. home depot will teach you alot with customer service and the retail environment. home depot teaches you values as well"
good,"Home depot is a great place to work if it's your first job. Or if you want a casual job. "
good,"Great people to work with learned a lot of household and practical skills."
good,My position provided a great sense of accomplishment but was overly demanding and had no opportunity for advancement or lateral movement. Good team culture.
good,"Overall a good place to work. The atmosphere can be dictated by the sitting store manager. If you do not put too much emotion in the the company the job can be tolerable. It is a good job and can be a good job if you do not expect it to do anything other than pay you a pay check, and benefits, and vacations. It is difficult to have work family balance or fulfillment in a career."
good,decent place to work just to much work drama im sure its different at different stores but most managers have a im the boss mentality so idc if im wrong get it done
good,"overall I liked working for The Home Depot. Everything was pretty nice as far as insentives like sick/vacation time, 401k, medical benefits, but management is hit or miss. Some managers should not be in their position and really make everything more difficult but thankfully they don't typically last long. They get better or get terminated usually, but not always. the other issue is pay. They do not offer reasonable wages for what they ask of an associate, and the annual monetary increase is a joke."
good,"Opening"
good,"To many people telling you what to do, not enough employees, not enough hours terrible schedules making, no personal schedule on busy days, over schedule on slow days, lazy people been under managed, hiding in the inside of the isles, dancing and using snap shot, how this people working there for over a year it’s just mind blowing, regular thefts on a day to day, told management nothing happened there’s no control, older employees like to disappear when there’s new employees start working,"
good,I really enjoyed working at home depot while i was there. the only reason i left was due to the one night supervisor who was consistently micro managing.
good,I didn’t have a set schedule so that interfered with sleep and home life. I became ill due to the lack of rest. My health plummeted. The job culture was misogynistic and inappropriate.
good,Empresa con cuidado al asociado que no se da por los gerentes de tienda
good,good work environment and productive work the company has good management and does good work would recommend to anyone serious about learning about business as this is a vary large company and there is room for growth
good,The company as a whole is am amazing company to work for.
good,"Lots of fast paced hard work.  I feel like they treat employees like high school students sometimes."
good,I had a ball working for this company. I love the bargain area I loved the helping customer that came to the tool center. helping the woman doing there dyi projects
good,Good part time job  looking for a job to get off my feet. Heard about this company from a customer in Homedepot. I would like to work part time for this company
good,I really enjoyed working for them but the pay was terrible. I started at less than nine dollars an hour and it took over two years to get to a lousy ten bucks.
good,"Was an ok job, the stores however are not run by the company vision but by the way the single store manager sees fit. If they were run the way corporate wants them to be then it would be a better place to work and shop"
good,I work at the Service Desk and at returns. It can be busing process orders and working returns. Management will help out whenever needed. The associates all work together.
good,"Not happy with the enviro,ent looking for something new  I need a change of paste at the level I’m going I feel I will not achieve anything here I need more"
good,"5employes to 2-5x40=200work hours, done by 5employes, 3 employes left, all work to b done by 2x40 full time employes and a couple part time employes, was time to go!"
good,It was a call center.  Very loud environment and not enough work to be productive.  My Supervisor was very nice however she didn't provide a lot of training directly to me.  My trainer wasn't that great and she didn't want to continue to train me.
good,"this is an okay place to work. My co-workers were fun and polite/"
good,Needs more advancement and the supervisors need to be more attentive to associates needs. Most of the associates are good but a lot of them are not so nice
good,"love the idea of what home depot is as a company, however as the store goes they were short staffed stressful over working temp employees constant danger not following osha standards management made the job much harder by lack of doing there job lack of listening lack of addressing dangerous working environment (in garden) lack of supervision"
good,"good culture, great people, not very fair and consistent when promoting people, seem to care more about how it looks than actually who is more qualified."
good,"you cant get 40 - hours a week ,hr and managment are useless , may only work 3-5 hours  pay is good thats about it .!! the hammond store is doing poorly"
good,"The Home Depot is a great company that does a lot of great things for its Associates.  That being said, there is a definite lack of coordination between management and employees.  The pay doesn't reflect the level of work and not everyone does their jobs."
good,the management has a tendency to show favoritism to certain individuals based off how long you have been there and how often the workers kiss up. Do your job and stay focused and you will be just fine
good,"sometimes don't put the right people in the right position. "
good,Good company bad manger great people one company that really do what they say they're going to do a company that have a great foundation and take care of their people
good,"Nice place to work.  Problem with maintaining consistent scheduled hours for part time workers.  As with other companies in the area, the new procedure is to cut hours of current employees while hiring new employees. It is very difficult for part-timers to survive on the rate of pay and hours available."
good,Management I felt didn't do a good job  our manager is never really on sight an favor other employees more than others perple are not well trained while on hands
good,"Work for 6 months on the night freight team.  Supervisor was inefficient and could not prioritize resulting in unwanted overtime."
good,"The Home Depot is a great company to work for, but the Hillsboro location is currently under tight management from people who have no trust in their associates. The manager and one of the assistant store managers have been known to walk around listening to associates talk to each other and taking pictures of said associates on their personal phones. Managers will often talk to their associates with a condescending tone and some will even go as far as yelling at you in front of other associates.From what I understand management is not as bad in the other stores."
good,It was a experience for me to work as merchandiser which I had to do  this . I learned a lot there but it was not related to my career which i did before and some of supervisor do know how to run the job.
good,"From my experience in the store, this is a great starting job. Unless you are dead serious about building a career in this company I would recommend that you keep your eyes on the career path you desire."
good,"I feel as though the home depot in Reynoldsburg played favoritism when it came to making the schedules. The management was okay, depending on the day. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the management as far as flexibility and departments."
good,Great managment. Really good and honest people. Only issue was long term advacement opportunity. Wasn't the employment that exactly fit my degree so I went on to what fitted my degree.
good,Great experience with some colleagues.   Poor management does not recognize hard working employees.  Lacks professionalism.
good,despite the many years and my dedication and loyalty to the company when it came down to it the company was not there for me. Despite putting the company first they hung me out to dry.
good,"I worked the Commercial dept. We treated our customers like gods. Sadly Corporate would take care of customer, then severely reprimand or terminate the employee who made mistake, as well as the dept. head in some cases"
good,it was hard during the winter when they had us in garden in freezing tempatures. the employees were awesome. it was a great experience to have. the hours helped me when I had a second full time job
good,"Don't let my personal opinion on my experience with this company turn you around. Its a decent company, just depends on management at that certain store."
good,I am not wanting to share any details at this time.  I dont want to review the Home Depot.  This is a good company if you are working at the store level.  The corporate office is a circus.
good,Cashier.  We were never allowed to leave the front of the cash register.  Always just standing.  Never given anything to do but stand or dust our immediate area.  Too hard to stand for eight hours on your feet and not be able to move around or sit down.
good,"Maintained inventory in-stocks"
good,"Home depot is one of the few jobs that pay weekly, which, is a plus. Unfortunately, the management team as a whole is unprofessional and does not care about their associates. The hours are not promising."
good,"Was not allowed to discuss customers projects in detail. "
good,Was looking for more job advancement options. Hourly pay was not enough to live off of. Along with being asked to provided services that I was not being paid for.
good,"A typical day was busy and steady. I learned how to communicate effectively and satisfy customers, even in stressful situations. Management was poor, they did not actively engage with employees until corporate visits. Most co-workers were fun and easy to work with. The hardest part was dealing with irate customers. The most enjoyable part was satisfying customers and meeting their needs."
good,The home depot has many pros and cons. the work environment can be loud and dusty. the management needs to work together as a team.
good,"Coworkers created a team environment."
good,"Job satisfaction is dependent on location, but teamwork can be a plus here.  Enjoyed the opportunity to learn a multitude of areas in home renovation."
good,"Love working with my hands, and enjoy helping people. Not a bad first job for someone who likes the home improvement environment. Also it is like they pay you to work out if you are an outdoor associate!"
good,"I had a serious issue with safety when I was at home depot they drilled safety into my head during training and when I started on the floor it was no longer a concern. I tryed many times to have my concerns heard, when they were truly heard from management the problem was not rectified! the most enjoyable part of my job was working with happy costumers as well as the confused and cranky! my co-workers were awesome when we had nothing to do we would scare eachother and have fun as well as worked great together! the hardest part of my job was working with couples because there was two diffrent personalities and two opinions!"
good,The Home Depot is a good place to work for with some advancement opportunities at corporate. The company has good benefits.  There more opportunities for advancement at the store level.
good,"Sometimes the day is slow and sometimes very busy and busy I liked. I loved working there, but the managers can be overwhelming sometimes as well as the department heads  and will make you think you are in grade school. I got along with my co workers well and the ones that didn't want to be friendly, I spoke and let them be. I did learn how to drive fork lifts and the hard part was going on a truck  driving a fork lift. The part I really liked was talking to people and putting a smile on their faces."
good,"I work there for 7 years had one slip up and they tossed all my experience out the window.  They really don't care about their employs like they say.  The people i worked with were great, and the friends i made and the associates i had were very easy to work with."
good,"You learn a great deal about customer service."
good,"The customers kept the job interesting, there was something new everyday. There are also plenty of other things to keep you busy. Stocking shelves, filling out paper work, and taking computer classes to learn more about sales events, special offers and stuff like that. Biggest drawback is the management. They really do not care about anything but looking good in front of their bosses. They have no real power to help you and really don't want to be bothered with anything. "
good,"Home Depot is a excellent company to work for especially if you plan on considering the company as your career choice. The hardest part of my job was balancing my school life and work life. The most enjoyable part of the job was feeling empowered to take care of the customers to satisfy. While there my management team stressed the importance of customer service and customer satisfaction. Being young and thinking that being a nurse had little to do with customer satisfaction I was absolutely wrong. Being a Nurse and working in the health care field has every bit of customer satisfaction involved. Any place you work rather its a fast food restaurant, retail and even in the medical field you have to take care of and value your patients and customers. Its all about satisfaction the people and ensuring that they speak highly of your service and the company that you work for."
good,I work for the YoW division of HMD. I take calls for Wholesalers and for HMD's needing pricing and availability. Some times I have to build customer showers for customers
good,great company fantastic benefits but management sucks when it comes to schedules and if you know your stuff in the department they will use you heavily and you wont get the greatest pay. they do watch the clock to the minute otherwise its a great company to work for. they promote within before hiring outside people
good,"Good employees and managers, but they always cut hours. Even after the schedule has been posted. "
good,"-A typical day for an ASM is 11+ hours of almost constant movement."
good,Too many managers on the floor. Management expects too many things from part-time workers.
good,This job was fun and productive because how much the company did things with you and it was a nice work enviroment.
good,"A typical day at works start off with a bang most mornings, or at the start of most shifts.  This has taught me to adapt and overcome to most situations, and always be prepared to learn something new every day.  Every day is a new day, on some aspect, and to be able to adapt is key in making it a good day. "
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed learning all aspects of the Garden area of the store - generally busy and plenty to do and learn - both required and otherwise"
good,great corporate office with all amenities right on site. Everything is conveniently located at Corporate office.
good,"not enough hours and no recognition what so ever."
good,"Cashier duties icluded checking out customers, greeting customers. Making sure area was clean"
good,"When I first started working for the company, I knew there would be much to learn there. I learned everything from hanging drywall, plumbing fixtures, and quick fix its for electrical. I flourished in the garden department, as gardening is my hobby. However, now it seems like I am just needing to move on. I am at that point in which I know too much about retail, and its getting to me. I would much rather leave with a happy note, than one that is jaded."
good,"Took care of and sold live goods, lawn equipment, and landscaping materials. Assisted store guests in locating items in the lawn and garden department.  Provided information and suggestions on the use of materials offered in the lawn and garden department.  Maintained clean and clear aisles for customer and forklift traffic throughout the store.  A lot of outdoor work in this department.  Very difficult to get any assistance with ""experienced"" department coworkers."
good,a typical day at work involves Managers/supervisors getting on to the people on the floor for not doing classes that no one has time or an incentive to do while talking about how great and strong the company overall is doing I learned a lot about dealing with buearacracy that is only enforced when it benefits the managers to do so and just how quickly peoples personal vendettas can ruin a good company. Despite my issues with management I actually enjoyed my time working here I learned more about home improvement and made good friends while I was there. my coworkers fell into two catagories retirees that know everything about home improvement and actually like to help people and lazy highschoolers who had no idea what they were getting into. some of the best advice I can give to anyone wanting to work here learn the layout of the aisles and NEVER get your forklift certification or you will never get any of your work done.
good,Clocked into work. Hopped on a register. Managers always having attitudes and telling you to do something is rude ways. Always had a problem when certain associates asked for something or had simple questions. Learned how to drive a forklift and how to manage some systems for certain customers. Also some safety tips in online classes to follow while at work to be safe as possible. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the management. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting up with some of my co workers and venting about how frustrating it was to work there.
good,"Learned how to pull orders, stock orders, and work with a hardworking crew."
good,Very busy and hectic at times because there isn't enough employees to take care of customer and the freight received.
good,"It depends on which store you work at.  My store has its ups and downs..., Up's: my coworkers and most of the managers and supervisors pretty cool... Downs: pay and work schedule.  it is a hassle to get more hours and they are terrible if you have another job and and want to arange your shedule."
good,"fun work"
good,enjoyed the people i worked with and customers i worked with
good,"Managers have poor values concerning family, one is quoted as saying ""family is important but there are things more important, like work"""
good,"Your schedule was not set. You might start at 6 AM or 10 AM or 1 PM and work for 8 hours. This was the hardest part of the job. If I started at 6 AM I would start my day answering phone and doing sales and returns. I would see to it that any special orders would be pulled for incoming customers or made at the request of customers. About 8 AM I would start to call customers and let them know if their special orders had come in or if we owed them a refund or if there was a balance due on their special order that needed to be paid. I would also be working with customers over the counter with any problems they might be having with their order or anywhere in the store. I would do my best to try and help them solve any problems or complaints they might have. I would also work on special order reports that needed to be done. I learned how to work on computers and how to develop patience when working with the stores customers, especially with difficult customers who were having a problem. I really enjoyed most of my co-workers. Many members of management I liked, a few I didn't. But I always tried to do what the asked of me. In the end, when they terminated me I thought they were very unfair and cold hearted. I worked for The Home Depot for 19 and 1/2 years when they terminated me. And I believe they terminated me for other reasons than their stated ones. I had an excellent record with The Home Depot from my first day in 1994 to my last day in 2013. Obviously I disagreed with the reasons they gave for terminating me."
good,"Loved working as a cashier, many different people came in and out of the store."
good,"The home depot I had the prevliage of working for was, in better words. O.K. I enjoyed every part about it expect the pay. not to mention I was promised certain things upon employment and those promises were never upheld, which drove me to quit the company."
good,"Ensure that each customer receives outstanding service by providing a friendly environment, maintained solid product knowledge. Helped drive sales of atleast 200,000 dollars a day."
good,"Home Depot offered me the opportunity to work in the evenings and weekends while my children were small, so they could be home with my husband while I worked. It was a busy and demanding environment, but rewarding on many levels."
good,work with customer in a friendly manner and fun to work with co worker
good,"My work day consisted of stocking and above all else Customer Service. I learned that in customer service, for the most part, you get out what you put in. Hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers and the most enjoyable part is making the customers smile."
good,Home Depot has hired me 3 times = Each time a different store and not overly consistant in management styles. Hours and schedule days vary as do start and end times. I enjoy working with the group. Customers are great.
good,"Fun,busy,heavy workload,I put everything I have into a day for co. and customers. By willingness to try new things Iearn everyday,even"
good,"Assemble different bbq's, wheel barrows, out door tables, chairs and other equipment."
good,"Was okay when I started, new management took over the store and managers got switched in Departments. I was terminated due to a back back from 2 car accidents and my department head lied on all my reviews causing me to get terminated. Was shocked how I could have gone from one of the best associates to one of the worst?"
good,Alot of cleaning and planogram integrity that is often changed by department heads that do not understand what merchandisers do
good,"help customers with product and keep a clean register, stay at the front of your register so you can assist any customers in need oh help with any product."
good,great place to wok on your customer communication and sales skills
good,"Good company to work for, energetic team players, Community based projects make it feel like your helping out others in need"
good,"This company has alot of trun around employees, from managers to asociates."
good,"The management is overly consumed with the sales goals. The Policies and Protocols will be Cherry Picked. ASMs will not help you and will expect you to do what they would do regardless if you can read their mind. The associates sporadically respond to pages and phone calls. Be prepared for irate customers in person and via telephone. Only a good place for lucrative income between jobs, leave with 2 week notification and mind your scheduling."
good,Most major retail companies don't worry about their associates but home depot definitely takes care of their associates. I would ask that each manager really get to know their associates and have a little more respect for them.
good,"My job at Home Depot would have been better if management treated me with more respect and encouraged me, instead of discouraging me. I did my best, worked hard, and timely, and only got negative criticism from management."
good,"Life of an ASM with Home Depot means no personal life. You become a slave of work, you get sucked in with the pressure and responsibility that comes along with the title. Compensation does not match the commitment you do. its like signing your life away."
good,"Good training.  Offers vacation pay, stock purchase, 401k, and bonuses.  Mostly part-time jobs, very few opportunities for full-time employment.  Few opportunities for job advancement."
good,I had an okay experience working at this store but it was a very hard job for me at times and I would not recommend this to be a permanent place of employment.
good,"home depot is a fair company to work for, their compensation package is very good. Company training is not good and turn over in management is high..."
good,"The Home Depot is a good place to work. They have a really good employee incentive program, where associates are given awards for various reasons, such as, great customer service, meeting or exceeding department sales plan, and time and tenure on the job. Company routinely has special events where associates are provided lunch, snacks, and the opportunity to volunteer for events outside the store."
good,"The company doesn't pay well enough to survive, or pay bills . and a typical day at work you have a lot of unnecessary competition with your own co-workers, very inconsistent with no extra added hours , even if you request"
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was helping a customer finally solve a problem they've been struggling with. It could be stressful sometimes especially without manager support and lack of staffing but i've always managed to complete tasks.
good,Great job for someone needing a part-time job. schedule flexibility is available. easy job training. you have to be a people's  person to enjoy your job.
good,"It's a great company, they have great benefits and do a lot of fun things. The people are nice but there is a downfall in management. It's hit and miss."
good,"The specific location I was in felt almost like it was set for failure. Other than that I enjoyed the time I had with my employees. If you are in a high position at a Home Depot you really do have lots of responsibilities, and if you have great positive people around, you will love it."
good,The hardest part of job at home depot is the little pay for amount of work I do and not recognized for work I do. There are good benefits but they are costly for a family. Customers that are regular get to know you and like to interact with just you specifically.
good,I started working there on a nice summer day and i saw these dirty Mexican steeling so I wrestled a Minnie mouse one of the Mexicans in disguise then I stole their tacos and got crabs from one of there pieces of wood at least thats what I think it was.
good,"Nice workplace, everything was fine management could have been better. Working in the garden section without AC on the register during the summer was outrageous"
good,". Not a very pleasant place to work. There are too many negatives to write about but if your looking for a career this would not be my first choice. Generally, you tend to feel insecure with your job. Very little to no on the job training. You either possess the knowledge already or learn by chance. Learning by chance can and does lead to poor customer service. HomeDepot needs a more concerned mgt"
good,"I'd clock in and get and right to finding myself something to work on or clean up or someone to help out. It was a fun job but it was too easy and boring. Not enough pay, not enough hours and too far away for it not being enough."
good,I was not compensated monentarily for my efforts. The store was understaffed my promotion was not honored.and ended up leaving due to these issue's otherwise happy with my position
good,"As for me, I was very good in the job training and executing my role as cashier but the issue of standing for a long time affected my physical begin due to me back pain issues."
good,"Hours were cut significantly after the busy season is over. "
good,"I love working at HD and I love the workplace environment. But there are very big draw backs to working here, especially management. This was my first job and I was very eager to learn and work so I was very open minded to everything. I was doing great and enjoyed my associates in my department, it was my supervisor who I didn't quiet get along with. He's always seemed to single me out, out of everyone in the department and it was very frustrating and it made me really uncomfortable. This had been an ongoing situation ever since I was hired and I worked there for 2 years. The area I live around, you could say people feel very entitled when they come in, so whenever a customer would ask for a manager after we couldn't comply with something they asked of us the manager would just give into the customer and it made me as an associate and other associates look stupid and that's been an ongoing situation in my department specifically. Me personally I didn't always feel like management had my back as an employee and it had always bothered me. I did enjoy management as people but as far as actual managers/supervisors I didn't really care too much for them. The hardest part about working here is just coverage because there would never be enough people in the department while in season and customers would always get upset at us for not helping them right away. We always asked for backup but not a lot of people knew paint and it was hard to get help. The most enjoyable part about working here is just your associates and your few customers and contractors that came in to brighten up your"
good,"My Immediate boss was absolutely amazing. Would do anything for that guy."
good,"Days are typically very busy. Working at The Home Depot has taught me to better my customer service skills and be able to multi-task in any situation.  The management at my store is great, but there has been a lot of turn around in upper management.  The hard part is the customers that are hard to keep happy, but when you do succeed, it feels great."
good,Great job for those who are not paying bills and are not in school. Hours are not super flexible and very few positions are fixed schedule. The people who work there are very friendly though
good,"I had many great opportunities to learn new skills and about business, many of which I would not have had elsewhere. The home depot has an open door policy which creates strong relationships between associates and management. I am however disgusted with the home depot's recent labor model, which leaves their associates stressed and overworked and frustrates their customer. The home depot often cuts corners with their pay scale. for example  a person from outside the company coming into a leadership/management role will almost always be paid more than someone who has been promoted from within."
good,"If it wasn’t for this manager on duty I’d still be working there at a wonderful base. However, he made life at work unbelievably stressful  made my schedule unworkable and I eventually had to quit both the job and school."
good,I enjoy my coworkers. Management is okay. I need something a little faster paced. Some days are face paced some days are very slow and there’s not much for me to accomplish which those days tend to drag.
good,"Working as a Home Depot cashier I am responsible for insuring every customer has a satisfactory shopping experience. Answering the telephone and helping customers or routing the calls to the appropriate staff member.  I also insured that a customer takes away a positive experience. During the course of my job I maintained a clean and safe work environment. When working as flooring associate I create and maintain customer files in the HD database as well as hard copy files. Create and process quotes for customers. Order special order flooring and window coverings. Assist in restocking shelves as needed. Call vendors to update customers’ orders.  "
good,"Issues can fall through the cracks or never seem to be addressed. Room for growth if you prove yourself."
good,This was a fun place to work. Great people. I worked there while I was in school and they were very flexible with my hours so I could be successful in school.
good,"I loved my job at Home Depot, but the Manager was a competitive woman who didn't want anyone to step in her place. I was fired for missing too many days, but I only missed them because my child had his appendix taken out. So to say the least I was a little bitter."
good,I enjoyed working at Home Depot till the great managers got promoted and new management took over. The culture and morale of the store went downhill afterwards.
good,It's a fun job but most of the time the employees aren't doing their job. Security sucks and nothing is ever organized. But overall it's a nice fun environment to learn new things and meet new people.
good,Love working with the customers and being very busy.  It is a great place to work if you are there for a part time job. Not a great money maker for the work that is done.
good,"They set a Goal, we achieved it. With recent updates to our goals, it is ultimately impossible. The MATH does not add up. See, I do not want to write any more but i can not move forward. Never enough..."
good,The Home Depot would be amazing if it’s management truly valued its employees it’s a constant battle for getting full time no respect for religion at all and overworks their employees
good,For a temporary place to work it was good.  They had a great training program.  Back then you could only work for 6 months then take a month off and get rehired.
good,great place to grow in company and learn more about the everyday things we as people need. being were on the filed and seeing these things when they shipped in we got chances to read and study about product and thats always helpful in making the job more worth while.
good,"Attained heavy equipment certifications. Learned about do it yourself projects. Learned about products sold and how to correctly apply these tools to customer needs. Management was very strict about PTO or sick days. Not flexible with asking off for days even if asked up to 90 days in advance. Very high turnover rate with new employees. Very low annual raises. Great benefits. Not consistent with ""rules"" or ""policies"" throughout management. Did not compensate according to work ethic and knowledge of products etc."
good,"I was an outside sales rep, 100% commission corporate employee that wasn't bound to the mundane in-store day to day activities that typically suck the life out of the in-store employess"
good,For part time workers it never really seemed like you were going to move threw the ranks. The pay was decent but never really something you could make a real living off of. Co-workers were nice and easy to get along with.
good,"The company was great Everyone worked as a team ,management cared about their associates until corporate came in and walked the store manager out, worked 2 assistants out of a job. Most people who had tenure were disappearing."
good,"Very low pay and everyone is paid the same to start.  Pay should be position specific.  Management expects you to care about the customer but when a 16 yr old is making the same as someone with far more experience (30+ years), it's hard to care."
good,"Overall it's positive. I have worked with some great people."
good,Always looked forward  to work!  Work a fixed schedule. You can choose hr or half hr lunch depends on ur hours. You are never just a cashier u work in different areas if needed
good,"Unloading trucks in the Receiving Dock."
good,"Although a good company to work for, the demands of a person to work as a manger are too much for those looking to have a good work/life balance.  The company has given me a lot of opportunity but currently there is no proper game plan or knowledge as to what my local management team is unable to communicate as to what is needed to climb the corporate ladder."
good,Taking returns as well as purchases. Run credit cards. Release on-line orders when customer arrives. Check orders pulled and waiting pick up for over 30 days. Order follow up with venders or homedepot.com.
good,can be a fun place to work however some managers have a poor attitude while others are fair. Hr is rather Ditzy and cant remember half the time what  was said to you or others . Attendance is very strict and has no room for  things that happen in life such as illness.. Late 9 min you get a point.
good,Enjoyed working there but was unaware of the cutting or hours to almost nothing when its not a holiday. The employees seem to come and go a lot so you should be prepared to see a new face everyday.
good,Working at the Home Depot is either hot or cold for people. The associates either care too much or not at all. I am one that cares way too much and gave everything to the company sacrificing personal time with the girlfriend and my family only to get turned down for jobs that I was offered. However the managers have looked out for me and have also taken me under their wing to learn different aspects of the business.
good,"Typical day at work was helping customers find the right product needed. I would work with them till they found exactly what they wanted. Also, suggested items needed to help complete their project. I learned a lot about all flooring types and could explain everything they needed from start to finish. Also, did the same working in the window treatment department as well as doing special orders."
good,"Although the co workers were polite, they all wouldn't do much. and the supervisor would just stand and talk to associates. not a good experience but at least I learned some stuff."
good,I know my area could be a lot better because the overall company is an awesome company to work for. This area just have people in place that do not know how to lead.
good,"Constantly helping customers."
good,"Équipe de travail agréable, gestion instable, respect des pauses."
good,"I loved my time at home depot , but their are clicks and if your not in them it can be tuff. some people were allowed to do nothing all day and get away with it take multiple smoke breaks and hang out in the lunchroom."
good,They don't appreciate your work and pay too less for the work that you do. It's a stressful job and not enough help to get the job done. Some of the workers lack responsibility.
good,"my supervisor was cool and some of the workers were as well , so thats why i stayed there as long as i could. "
good,"When I first started working at the Home Depot, the management was great. All the departments worked together seamlessly without managers egos getting in the way of helping customers and getting departments looking nice. Once the management style changed then everyone was fighting with each other over what task took priority over other tasks. Current management does not know how to lead effectively."
good,Great people and atmosphere but only 16-24 hours a week until a full time position opens up. Very flexible with hours and schedule. Lots of stocking to do
good,"Huge Company, huge opportunity and steadily growing! The Career Development and tuition reimbursement are a great benefit of the company. Benefits and perks make the Home Depot a great place to work."
good,Home Depot can be a great place to work but...They are lacking true leadership. For the most part supervisors don't really care about there employees and are mainly focused on themselves
good,"Management is fair, most employees will disappear in their departments. Practically no breaks if you are a Lot Attendant/Pro Loaders. Even if you are scheduled to clock out at 9 the head cashier always will not allow you to clock out with more tasks to complete. Lot attendants are understaffed with only one on shift which can be overwhelming. Management are more concerned with attendance even when you call off with sufficient amount of time because of health issues and still write you up. Senior employees tend to blow off new hires when help is needed or a question is asked"
good,"Was a good place to work but needed better managers who are willing to work with others. vacation package was good, some employees didn't seem like they wanted to be there."
good,"It's a mediocre job, pays 12 an hour. There is little to no room for advancement. In my experience management plays favorites quite often, but in general it is not that bad of a job."
good,"Despite part time status job expects you to be readily available to cover sick calls with minimal notice. Coverage on the floor is typically poor leaving you to scramble to help customers. HR in this company is typically very unhelpful - in my dealings with them no resolution was ever met and they seemed preoccupied with silencing any issues brought up to them. No matter how many skills you acquire, ex machinery operating licenses, knowledge of multiple departments or store systems, your pay WILL NOT increase. Pay raise is restricted to a few cents per year, unless your job title is changed. The workers at this store and 95% of the time amazing people who have many interesting insights into their areas of expertise or even just life in general. It is a shame the management and employee care is so poor"
good,For me this seemed like a more temporary job. The pay was decent but everyone worked part-time and wasn't allowed to be full-time.  So therefore there wasn't any benefits to receive.
good,Good company to work for. They don't pay well and you can't get overtime. Opportunity to learn about some interesting things if you're in a department.
good,"home depot is a very productive place , there is  a lack of communication with customers though , there are a bunch of customers that employees fail to approach the only person the customer talks to are the cashiers . i have learned a lot working with home depot , i have came across a lot of customers and they have taught me so much , i know how to handle every situation that comes my way."
good,"Good people, decent pay, not enough advancement opportunity. Over all, i had a good experience there, I learned a lot about stuff I wouldn't need to know about."
good,Cool place to work. Align yourself  with  people that are looking to advance up in the business. Express your desires to management that you want to up with the company.
good,In a small market you have very little advancement and inconsistent hours. Management is with you and not with you. THD values the customers and helping you help them. No fixed schedules at most locations. Lots of learning opportunities and moving around just not up. Easy transfer from store to store.
good,Home Depot was fine but the  management  is not always fair to the workers . They are not understanding at all no no ones situation only they own situations
good,"The pay scale was very low considering my experience and there wasn't any advancement. However, the benefits were better than I had thought and I enjoyed assisting customers."
good,I loved designing but the constant push to sell was stressful and the flex schedule is very hard on finding adequate family time. There was alot of pressure to meet all customers needs and still get designs done quickly and attend to other depts as well.
good,I rang customers up. Helped train new employees. Fixed technical problems. It was a total boys club. The most enjoyable part of the job were the regular customers. the worst part of the job was doing three different jobs but only getting paid for one.
good,"The Home Depot as a Corporation, does not care about employees taking front line phone calls within any department or location of customer care. The only thing that matters is the “numbers”. Trainers need more training, at least ensure they’re knowledgeable. The Home Depot is Great, however be wise and avoid any branch of customer care, expectially resolutions as this is the only department required to do their job, the other departments will contact resolutions before partnering with their supervisor and if resolutions give “push back” the associate may receive a write up or coaching. The CEO should ensure customer care is run better, instead customer care was removed from corporate. What a slap in the face, corporate is beautiful by the way, the upgrades are amazing."
good,"Great company, if you have a good mentor and the support of your store manager its a better place to work. At times can be very stressful and work long hours."
good,"I enjoyed working here. It gave me many opportunities to balance work and family life. More often than not, Management is the reason some people would leave their position with the company."
good,"when I was there I didn't like the manager, but that manager has since left and the new manager seems to have created a better relationship with the local staff"
good,"Home depot is a mix of major positives and negatives.  It is great at development and training,  but has poor pay for the work demanded and can be very high stress depending on the level and management."
good,"Good place to work if you are flexible on the work hours. The pay is not commensurate with ones experience & talents, i.e. very subjective."
good,"Working at The Home Depot and helping customers meet their needs is the most enjoyable part of the job. When customers are happy with the service provided, I know that I did my best. Putting a smile on the customers face gives me a feeling of satisfaction. The customer will return to the store and refer their family and friends. Providing exceptional customer service is an integral part of my job. As a Department Supervisor, I need to guide my team with the same values that have been taught to me. This leads to happy customers, happy employees and increased sales growth."
good,"As long as you did the best of your ability,you can't go wrong.The work is rewarding yet challenging.I would recommend this opprotunity as a great place to work to any motivated individual"
good,"Management is rough on employees, often find the management team barking orders rather than carrying out tasks. Workflow is steady with a large pickup on weekends. Expect to be called around a lot."
good,"The home depot has a lot to offer in regards of training, good customer service and expectations of their employees."
good,"Managers are demanding, and don't seem to have a good understanding about what the daily tasks are for my job.  The day goes by quickly, dealing with a variety of customer issues and situations.  The hardest part of the job is completing essential tasks due to nationally mandated rules surrounding power hours, where no tasking can be completed."
good,"Not enough help on busy times, management was not very supportive, when supervisor positions open up always told not enough experience,but then not given experience so that you are ready for next promotion opening,"
good,"The Home Depot takes care of their people and our veterans. It is fast paced, and a lot of fun. Tends to be stressful when you first start. I was put on the floor with limited knowledge and only 4 hours of 'training' by a new associate. I learned so much while I worked there."
good,The hardest part of the job was sometimes the customers. Our job is to do the best for our customers and do whatever we can to make them happy. Sometimes we would get really mean customers. I had one make fun of me because of my speech impediment. Sometimes its just really hard.
good,For a part time job home depot is a decent place to work. If you are scheduled with enough hours to work to make it a worth while part time job. that would be my only real complaint. You don't get scheduled enough hours to keep the part time employees happy to stay working for Home Depot.
good,"Good culture, little room for advancement, but a fun place to work.  I really have nothing other to say except that I really wish there were benefits and that they would hire full time."
good,home depot is unfair and you need to watch your back. If you work your but off they don't care they are a cold hearted company. They have favorites and will set you up for failure.
good,"Shift Prep, Planning meeting, shift to shift handoff, walk dock, start shift meeting with associates, every day was different, shifting resorced all the time, huddles, end of shift, close out the shift (reports), shift to shift hand off."
good,Management played a lot of favoritism. You would not see any advancement unless you were included in their inside circle of employees. Did not follow standards and were unethical when it came to treating everyone equally according to the procedures that were mandatory to follow.
good,"You are stuck all day in one spot till you get your break. But overall they pay fair and have some fun events for the employee's.try to get a job on the sales floor, where you can move around, it definitely will help you feel less sore after along shift."
good,The store it self is a wonderful place to work for. You learn a lot about how to DIY st home or how to help other people with these projects. Everyone is very welcoming and friendly.
good,"I would go back if had nothing else to do. I loved the job. However, they lack in paying all of their employees what they deserve. Management never listened. The original founders had it right, pay people who swing hammers well, and they'll sell people hammers well. Now it's all about selling credit. Reguardless if you helped the customer at all."
good,Home depot showed me a lot of things during the time I spent there. Overall the experience I had there was unexpectedly fun. I got to meet lots of new people and learn new things.
good,"Overall, it is good. I was working with a great teamwork, in a great environment providing great customer service.  good benefits, flexible hours, fixed schedule for full time."
good,typical day at work was the same. I learned a lot of things. management was ok. the culture was stressed becasue of morale issues. the hardest part was trying to stay organized. the most enjoyable part was that I was able to get work done.
good,it was an amazing job as a lot associate but once i was moved to freight team i thought i would have advanced more but i was sadly mistaken. i worked there for 3 years and nothing came of it. i decided to seek higher oppertunities.
good,"Great place to work. In my department, I don't feel I was valued, but I am learning that lack of hours are due to the slowness of this location.  This location is under new management which are awesome and is already making a difference!"
good,"Work was pleasant. The team there is a group of good people, I have nothing to say about them. You build a good relationship with customers and fellow employees. The work is hard but rewarding. After a while, you do become a bit more of a money making machine than a person. Does leave little room for a personal time."
good,I am a great asset in that I take on additional tasks without hesitation and new challenges are always desired.I enjoy working with customers and assisting those customers with finding and ordering the items needed to complete projects.
good,"i loved my job, but management made me loathe coming into work most days. you basically do everyone else's job but your own for the same pay as your job. while supervisors and management avoid confrontations."
good,Home Depot  is ok for some one  who has no bills our need extra  funds other then that you do not make any money unless you are full time.part time employed people  work any where from 15-25 house a week
good,"The Home Depot as an organization is fantastic! The culture is very much driven by the company's values. However, your experience is very dependent on the leadership of your team and department."
good,"Only 6 month of experience with the Home Depot. I met some amazing people who really know a lot about their specific job title. Great company to work for with a great idea in the ""Homer Fund."""
good,"Good job   decent pay  but too many miles  for no reason some times   because  phone calls weren't made  to people."
good,"Loved the people, customers were good. Not too much opportunity for advancement, unless hired in as management. Compensation was not up for discussion from upper management. Had regular meetings that provided breakfast and discussions. A lot of leg work around the store, must be in shape to run from one end to the other."
good,"great company to work for with right management. "
good,"Position was on a multi-functional team of supply chain engineers, operations managers, technical writers and senior supply chain leaders. Position required 90% travel."
good,"Solid retail work, customer service driven, interesting work concept. Unusual  structure, growth ability, hard work is a must, training is and highlight."
good,"The Home Depot has good customer service values/expectations, but poor pay and work schedule. This company has poor benefits. I loved working with plants and educating customers about horticulture- related topics."
good,"i get to work clock in, then go to the floor. help the customer out with the products. If the is no customer, start to clean up until i see the next customer."
good,"Other than finding a full time position and the hours, it is a fun environment to be in. Management is fair and usually will work with your wants and needs."
good,"A lot going on on bust days, but if it is slow it just seems like the day lags on. Not enough tasks to keep busy. Learned a lot about cashiering and working the systems. Time management  and customer service is a big thing."
good,"the hardest part was coming to work and dealing with the rodents, the most enjoyable was competing to see who sold more warranties. my co workers was cool"
good,Home Depot is a great company to work for and meeting new people also helping customers daily with what they need and doing so by working together as a team with co-workers
good,"The Home Depot is like a university where you can learn so much in different fields. However, the pay could be more knowing how difficult the job can be. The benefits for a full time employee is excellent."
good,"Es una tienda con productos inovadores, con alta gama de articulos de interes personal"
good,"The realities of working retail can be very trying for a full time employee.  I have seen many good people destroyed by egotistical management who only look out for themselves, and not their employees."
good,"It was an good company to work for. Management just could have been a little better. I really loved the employees, well some of them. I just disliked how certain problems and people work ethics were overlooked when it was brought to management attention."
good,"I really loved the job itself. I was very good at it, Fantastic with customers, learned a lot and liked the challenge, However Management had lots of problems, They expected too much, Their philosophy would be to expect too much and see if people could rise to the occasion and when they couldn't they still would get more done even though the employee felt like they were failing all the time. I am all for working as hard as I can but people also need to be realistic. There were also 3 managers and none of them agreed on anything, So one manager would say to do something one way while the other would then get upset with you and tell you to do it another way and a lot of confusion came because of that. Before all of that had happened it was a wonderful job that I truly excelled at. I would stock shelves, build displays, interact with customers, do RTV's, put on price tags, reset large areas, do seasonal resets, Travel store to store which meant working with the stores themselves and also I would order brochures and pretty much anything else in the Point of Purchase area. I also focused on safety and some light cleaning. Kind of a jack of all trades and I managed myself well until there were 3 managers so everything got out of control."
good,"Great place for a part time job with flexible hours. Lumber/ Building materials maybe one of the most demanding departments, everything is twice as long and 20 times heavier. Overall a good place if you enjoy helping customers"
good,I learned that my abilities were valued and I enjoyed learning new things everyday. My co-workers were kind and caring. They were a second family.
good,confirming and scheduling appointments. Nice co workers. Hardest part is doing the same thing for 8 hours sitting in one place is boredom. I need to be active.
good,"If the day was going slow, people would be cut.  But whenever we needed more people, management wouldn't help out.  During ""Power Hours"" it was difficult to keep up with the customers because there were only 2 people working in a department"
good,"Overall a good experience,but was just a temp job.Not enough hours or pay.One great supervisor,the other not so much.I did learn a lot,it was very interesting.They had very good equipment.Again hours were not enough to survive on."
good,i liked my job because i had more experience as a cashier and how to do good in  customer service and i'm friendly with my co workers!
good,nice place to work hours were great management overall was horrible they never communicated with anyone other wise it was ok
good,"When I first got hired by the then store manager, everything was great. Full time, good payment, weekends off, good co-workers and great supervisor. "
good,"A lot of promises were made by various levels of management that were later forgotten, twisted, set aside or somehow excused.  Set schedules are super hard to come by and heaven forbid u want to change your availability because something in your live changed.  There is little to no accountability for employees that take advantage of the system, but it does appear that if you have a work ethic, you are held accountable for things that co workers with lower standards are not.  Some in the lower levels of management are very unprofessional and inappropriate, but are tolerated and even allowed to run little rackets for no apparent reason other than its the status quo. Management can be difficult to trust at best and don't bother at worst. District and corporate levels seem to be far better managed and receptive.  That being said, time off requests are generally honored and can be generous. Of most places I have worked over the years, they have treated me better and more like a human than most employers. Just keep your expectations low and try not to care over much and you won't be too badly disappointed."
good,"Excellent corporate company to work for, each store has similar opportunities for advancement. Present store has severe staffing issues leading to unnecessary stress levels for all employees, as well as highly favored employees by management. Hardest part of the job is completing all the tasks assigned while providing excellent customer service and meeting company metrics when not provided the staffing to do so. The most enjoyable parts are the interactions with customers providing guidance on home repairs and having them leave the store confident and happy knowing you did your job right."
good,Productive sales force and customer satisfaction. Worked independently much of the time. P/T position with low pay. I worked both as a lead generator then as a flooring associate.
good,lack of support from management.  no constancy in direction.  pay was not inline with amount of work expected from some employees while others skated by doing minimal work and getting higher pay.
good,"company helps you grow, also management team supports their employees. great customer service team. great guidelines within the company, great HR reps."
good,"Not the worst place to work, you learn a lot from your own house work very supportive workers, management tends to have extremely high standards"
good,The second time I worked there was worse than the first. You'd think that working even harder and having previous experience would have made them see me as something other than a number.. but nope!
good,It's an easy job but it's not stable. Instead of a 90 probation period you have 120 days. I feel as though management does always have your back. I enjoy working there only because I love customer service and not once have I received a bad report form management or any customers but I do not feel like my position is safe. Oh and there is no in store discount
good,"The Home Depot doesn't know how to train their employees, which causes the customers to be angry.the managers are ill-equipped in the departments they are placed in."
good,I enjoyed my time with Home Depot. It is a fast growing business and they are very friendly. Work schedules could be a little more set.
good,A typical day at the job is opening at 6 am. I have learned how to run home depot front end (cashiers). My co workers are easy to get along with. The hardest part of my job is standing on the concrete floors all day with just one 15 minute break (if you work 6 hours or less. If you work 6 hours or more you get one 30 min to an hour lunch break and one 15 minute break. The most enjoyable part of my job is to help the customers.
good,"Filling orders for customers with the least amount of Info."
good,very friendly community orientated job. corporation based job. they pay isn't that great. fulltime is rarely given. management isn't the best
good,I really enjoyed taking care of the nursery plants and helping people find exactly what they were looking for in flowers and plants. Along with assisting with problems in taking care of pest and weeds.
good,"i enjoyed the fact that when allowed, could go out on the floor and help out in lumber and in paint, also loved being a lot loader, it was exercise with out having to pay for a gym membership."
good,"Hardest part of job is teaching new cashiers how to do their job, shoplifters stealing and not being able to anything about it. constant reminders to cashiers to do what told to do. I usually work closing shifts. Arrive and review tasks like breaks/lunches, supervising, scheduling, come up with a game plan for the day. Answer phone anytime a cashier calls, respond to lines by speeding up check out, being a great team leader."
good,"This is a job for a road warrior. How ever, THD can never fully staff the territory correctly and support is woeful. Pass on this job if it comes your way."
good,"Merchandise and maintain various product sets in a retail environment to enhance the customer experience; increase sales, and maximize inventory turns.  Stocked, cleaned and labeled bays for retail customers to have a better shopping experience."
good,"This is great for college students with the possibility of tuition reimbursement and other benefits for part-time workers. It is an okay company. Like all retail companies there is a lot of micro-managing. You will have many opportunities to speak your mind if any issues should arrive. However, don't hold your breath waiting for anything to change. As a cashier, of course you will stand for hours on end. You will work with a team of cashiers and be responsible for helping customers when you're not busy. Unfortunately, you are at the bottom of the totem pole as far as respect."
good,"A typical day at Dollar General include unloading the trucks at about 5 in the morning. Next, I would stock the shelf's and organize them. Then, I would run the cash register up front. Finally, I would help close up the store and follow the managers to drop off money at the bank."
good,"My opinion as a lover in career building is wonderful, tremendous school for anyone who wants to learn, but concerning the Administration and companionship is very poor."
good,"A typical work day involved stocking, answering phones, checking customers and setting up displays as needed."
good,"My fellow employees and managers very nice, but they wasnt allowing me to advance up in the company even though could do the duties."
good,the best thing is the other employees and customers. I was able to build store displays and that was fantastic fun.
good,"Personal assistant work, wasn't too hard or draining. Pleasurable and lax. Worked one on one for about a year. Worked with pets/animals and plants and landscaping."
good,"Help customers find item enplane different items and how they work."
good,"The average day at Home Depot ... there really is no average day. Each day is different due to the amount of work that needs to be completed, the high traffic of customers in and out of the store and there are always different employees every day. When you clock in you have no idea what to expect each day. One day it could be slow and you have plenty of time to stock shelves, clean your department, create product displays and more. However, the next day could be non stop customer flow in your department, you are on your feet for 10 hours with no time to take a break and when you leave that night you can barely keep your eyes open. The environment is not for the shy of heart. You must be willing to work hard and break a sweat. Those who give 100% are noticed and I was one of those people. I was employee of the month, with 9 awards for excellence and I was the 2013 employee of the year. Due to management promoting people outside of the store I was never promoted to several different management positions that I earned. Part of my resignation was to seek out a job that would put me in a place of leadership where I would be respected for all I have to offer. Home Depot will teach anyone how to work with people, how to multi-task (possibly quadrupal-task) and it teaches you patience. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was helping others and making friends with those I worked with."
good,"Everyday was challenging at work i would learn, and gain experience scanning items ,how to wrapped merchandise,also working with my co-workers excellent feedback enough to get my daily activites done. The difficult thing at work would be working in a effective fast accurate way.The most enjoyable part of my job would be friendly environment with customers and co-workers."
good,"Its an ok job that barely pays the bills. Working in this fast paced retail store you have to be on your toes. High anxiety and stress, that comes with ordering and customer service."
good,Working at Home Depot can be fun and eventful.  Lots of wonderful co-workers and managers who actually listen to employees.  I love to help customers and enjoy working with nice people.
good,"Answered customers' questions, addressed problems and complaints in person and via phone. Helped customers select products that best fit their personal needs. Maintained visually appealing and effective displays for the entire store. Offered exceptional customer service to differentiate and promote the company brand. Consulted with customers on the latest styles and trends. Collaborated with customer service team members to give exceptional service throughout the entire shopping and purchasing experience."
good,"working with customers in garden center, I loved it"
good,"I worked with many types of customers and their projects. Designing on computer using 20/20 and helping find products that work and fit. I pay attention to details and offer knowledge on products and services that can make the difference."
good,"I really did like my job. I enjoyed the customer satisfaction that I provided and since I changed positions in there about 3 times, it never got boring. I always had something to do even if it seemed like there was nothing to do. On an 8 hour shift, it would feel like a 4 hour shift because there time would go by so fast with all the work. I loved it for that reason."
good,"its ok for a college student, or some one with pension"
good,The job starts out great. Enthusiasm fades with time at this job I believe that it is just this location though.
good,I loved being a safety control officer. This was a great job and I felt needed in the workplace.
good,Home Depot is a very fast moving place and it is what you make of it. There is constant changes and you have to be ready to do the changes. Overall a great place to work. Coworkers that you will keep as friends forever.
good,"It's a cool place to work. "
good,experience working with line breaks and manufacturing very good people and a very nice place to work
good,"A typical day at work consists of greeting and helping customers in anything they need assistance in.  Furthermore, I am given several different tasks; such as mixing paints, collecting outdoor carts, making keys and working the floor.  Through the Home Depot position I have gained a lot of knowledge, but the most valuable thing I have learned is that the customer always comes first and their satisfaction with our product is my priority.  The management at Home Depot has been very helpful to me in teaching me the knowledge required for me to do a good job and my co-workers are all so kind and helpful as well.  The hardest part of my job is being able to try and help several customers all at once; however, the most enjoyable part of my job is when a customer truly appreciates all the effort you have put in to assist them."
good,"The typical say at work for me was to interact with customers, calculate items being bought and participate in meeting. I learned how to maintain my pleasant demeanor during difficult time. The hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting and my not so friendly co-workers"
good,I have worked for the home depot for 2 years and it has been a great place to work. But if you work full time you cannot have a set schedule and your schedule will be all over the place.
good,If your focus is completely customer service and the need to help in any way possible this is the job for you. They are focused on becoming the number one customer service retailer in the world. Unfortunately the focus isn't always focused on nurturing their associates at the same time. The success of the associate is solely dependent on the management and supervisor team at the store. If your management doesn't care about you or the people working for them its a horrible place to be. I was there long enough to see both bad and great management teams and have seen what they can do for the store atmosphere. I loved my job and i loved working for them the 8 years i was there but in the end what i will miss most was the family i had in the associates of that store.
good,"A typical day at Home Depot requires a smart phone, safety checks, hard work and a fast pace. I've learned much about home improvement and how to deal with the public. I respect and get along with my coworkers who make working at Home Depot more fun. I feel like management is lacking because they are not as involved with the job as they should be and sometimes cannot relate to a problem at hand. The best part of a this job  is the friendly environment where I can be professional and outgoing at the same time. The worst is the scheduling. I never have a set schedule, nor a set amount of hours. I could be at work at 10PM and the have to be back at 6AM the next morning. I don't get enough hours."
good,Up early and working with clients and installers on product purchased from the store for install.  Relations between home depot and the client.  Fixing install issues and making the client feel taken care of.
good,"associates have a great team spirit, but management sends conflicting messages and does not judge an associate according to their performance. Age discrimination is rampant and management does not shy away from intimidation and ridicule."
good,"When I started with The Home Depot, it was a fun and interesting place to work. When they changed hands on the top. The company turned on itself and began with letting go the contractors. The people of knowledge that related to the general public. The ""do it yourselfers"". They hurt themselves by doing that. This is my opinion, but they recoverd somewhat."
good,"Build and maintain store relationships through store walks, calls and emails. Handle charge backs, re-measures with customers as well as with measure techs. Complete daily routing of tech measures. Frequent long distance travel with little notice for a week or more at a time. Promptly resolve customer issues. Open availability for technician problems. Accurately complete jobs that measure techs can not complete, ie. Large commercial buildings and bid meetings. Interview, hire, and train new techs."
good,"Stocking merchandise until closing time then ran forklift, reach truck and order picker   for overstock. learned about products and and how they work, Costumer service and some sales when not stocking. Great co-workers very friendly. hardest part of the job was the inconvenient hours. the most enjoyable part was the people and the job itself was fun."
good,"As a regular at the Home Depot I give fast, pleasant service by energetically seeking out customers to respond to their inquiry and assist them with their home enhancement plans.. Giving information on product specification and knowing related items to sell the entire project. I enjoy giving superior customer service and sharing your information with others in a fast paced, team driven environment. As a cashier provided exceptional and speedy checkout service to clientele at our registers."
good,"I enjoyed working in the operations and sales departments. I learned a lot about retail sales and home project improvements. Product knowledge and how to be customer-focused by qualifying and educating customers about products was rewarding. The hardest part of the job was seeking managers that were competent to foster front line staff investment in quality time and effort. The most enjoyable aspect at the time was facilitating fun product demonstrations and helping customers ""do-it-yourself"" projects."
good,"+Regular work day was good, would either be busy or dead"
good,great place to learn but horrible in employee growth rate unless you're willing to deny you are a human
good,"Constantly changing hours week by week, leaving little time for family or free time."
good,"A typical day at Home Depot consist of qualifying what our customer needs are to complete the projects they have come in for guidance on .When not dealing with our customers , our focus is on merchandising, down stocking, price changes, and shelf maintennce."
good,"this was a good position for me, however I experienced a layoff after one year"
good,As a big box retailer its the best. The only down side is that just like any other retailer sales promotes payroll. If you don't have the sales you have to cut payroll. If you get a full time job your set but as a part-time employee counting on a steady paycheck its never the same week to week.
good,"The Home Depot stores can get a bit hectic at different times of the days with the large numbers of customers going in and out. Everything there is very easy to understand and to explain. The work expected from the company is straight forward, but the scheduling is my only complaint. The hours there are really all across the board & gives no chance to make any personal plans. I would like more steady hours."
good,"a work day at home depot consists of getting carts being vary busy while working, being the only lot attendant for an 8 hour shift and having to run back and forth with no help. the job should pay more for all the want you to do and put you through."
good,"I loved helping people on the daily basis with completing there home flooring and wall needs such as setting up measurements,pricing promotional events, and customer service."
good,"i unloaded trucks each and every day i worked, i also assisted customers each day , the hardest part about working here at home depot was not being able to advance in there"
good,"My job consisted in making sure I put what had to be stocked in order and keeping the place neat, helping customers to the best of my knowledge,we have some coworkers that we worked as a team work not all of them the most enjoyable part was when I knew that my job was complete and everything was the way it should had been."
good,"With hard work and applying what you learn, you can move forward in this company."
good,work with a lot of customers
good,"I loved my job at Home Depot. However, no matter how much you did, it was never enough. I ended up working from 5;30 AM to 8 - 10 pm six days a week. When my compensation was too high, they try to get rid of you. However, the job was fast paced and challenging, which is what I loved.."
good,"They had alot of immature young cashiers who where looking for boy friends in either department heads or managers and they did not want to work. When they went on breaks they thought nothing of taking longer then they where suppose to. Several times I had to write them up and then they would call out when we worked together, I would then call in someone I knew need hours and wanted to work."
good,it was a good company however no lexibility between other lie duties good pay low benefits
good,"I worked all over the store. I started as a cashier, service desk than i got promoted to millwork sales specialist. I generated sales in Millwork, Appliances and Flooring. I also helped out in Lumber, Plumbing, Electrical, Kitchen and Bath, Paint and even Garden. I learned how to drive the forklift, reach truck an O.P."
good,Home Depot was a once in a lifetime opportunity. The Head Cashier was awesome
good,"I meet and great customers, special order doors and windows, sketch construction solutions for peoples millwork problems, etc. Help them solve their problems with a project they are doing or help them find products in the store. I like to be creative in solving problems that they have not been able to find a solution."
good,The most enjoyable part of working for Home Depot is the Customer Service. The least enjoyable was never having the same schedule getting off at midnight and having to be back at 6am and going eleven days before having a day off. Difficult to balance family life.
good,"its okay but not a career, my co worker are fun to work with. The hardest thing about it is satisfying all the customers needs"
good,"I work inventory for the entire store. I process price changes, product merchandising and location, inventory count verification. I deal a great deal with the public. I also cover other departments in the store; hardware, paint, electrical, appliances, garden and cashier. I truly enjoy my job and the people I work with."
good,"My typical day started at 3p.m. Get into work and start closing down the dept. As well as customer service, pro sales, answer phones, pack down and anything else thrown my way in a day. What I learned best was how to MULTI TASK, and patience. Management is a toss up. They were great and then some left. The new ones not as great but tended to come around. As far as my co-workers, I LOVED THEM! It's not often you can be around 100 different people (give or take) in a week and get along with every one of them. The hardest part of my job was being held accountable for the entire departments appearance every morning, as I was the closer. With customers in the store 1/2 hour past closing sometimes, things got a little hectic. I had to without fail have my dept. grand opening ready 7 days a week. The most enjoyable part of my job was how things would get a little hectic. I seemed to actually work somewhat better under pressure. I was eager to help everyone and end the day with a big total sale amount along with a big customer count in the dept. The people were also a big plus of my job."
good,"As I worked IN Home Depots, but not directly FOR Home Depot, I have chosen to respond to ONLY SOME of the points above."
good,Responsible for mantaining the front end of store.
good,"The work environment was enjoyable. Coworkers and management was very friendly. Although management was not always completely honest. I was promised a chance to advance, but was never really delivered. Moved around to prevent that advancement. Shifting was CRAZY, but I guess that that's the life in retail."
good,"A typical day at work is standing at your registar ringing up customers with the occasional problem of customers not getting help from floor associates and telling them to fill out the survey to express their satisfied or dissatisfied customer service. I've learned a few thing while working there, like how to properly paint a room, how to differentiate between a pre-cut stud and your standard stud for building walls, and how to install a bathroom sink. Management for the most part is ok individually, but as a whole they need to learn to work together better and stick to the rules they implement, not bend the rules for some associates but penalize others who have done the same wrong doing. I would have to say the hardest part of the job is the complaints from customers about floor associates or compalints about yourself by the customer if you're not fast enough or don't attend to them when they want you to when they see you're already helping a another customer, the most enjoyable part is being able to make new friends everyday."
good,A tyoical way work is from Four o'clock a.m. until 7 o'clock p.m. five to six days a week. i have learned that a strong management time is key to a strong work force. the hardest part of my job is making up for week leaders. the most enjoyable part is seeing other get better.
good,Great people and management. Works with your schedule if you have school or anything very flexible. Overall good company to work for good pay for retail.
good,clocking in keeping lines open will keep the flow of the customer. Management was few and far between not always able to get to you when you needed help with at customer and normally co workers would be the associates that would help if you had a question. The hardest part would be with the extremely long line of customers it would be challenging to get them out in a timely fashion. But all the smiling faces leaving the store once you game them the last impression would always be a good feeling.
good,"I am looking for better opportunity an better future for myself, my wife and my son. Right now I work as a temp"
good,"I was able to learn many new things such as doorknob and deadbolt rekeying. Also driving equipment such as a forklift, reach, and orderpicker."
good,"Great place to work, need to know the right people to get ahead otherwise you have no shot. No communication between DH's and ASM's, everyone seems to want things done differently. Had the chance to meet some funny yet interesting customers who made my day, and they would always come to my register to check out because we would have fun talking and laughing. Benefits could have been better for PTers, hours too. I was in the Garden section most of the time and I always learned something about gardening from one of the associates. If you want to learn more, take the time to learn stuff in your area."
good,ok place to work if you just want a paycheck. Hours are sooo random. Time off is ok to get but schedualing is a pain. cement floors kill your feet.
good,"Its a good place to work, just needed to hand out more work hours"
good,"Although most retail jobs are all the same, working for home depot could have some awsome benifits, They may take quite a long time but its worth it if thats the feild you want to stay in."
good,"Pros:"
good,"It’s a good job, and it pays fairly just a matter of some of the management. Not all of them are good. You will be fine if you can just mind your own and just work"
good,"A typical day at work at The Home Depot would be using point of sale transaction, and customer care. I learned how to better handle customer complaints, and how to handle the problems they may have."
good,A good company to work for. It has benefits for part timers and will work with staff on their schedules. Hire process is slow at times and getting hired on took awhile.
good,"Fast-pace, quality environment, customer-focused. Opportunity for career advancement. Great dedicated people who work hard to meet and exceed customer's expectations."
good,"Always short handed , high turn over, the hiring sign stays out always but still better treatment than lowes for warehouse work."
good,"En mi caso como Protección  de activos fue un Poco difícil por el tema de tener un jefe controlador,compañeros apáticos y poca capacitación, pero en lo que toca por sueldo  ,prestaciones, motivación  esta muy bien,aunque trabajamos los días festivos  la empresa se encarga de que no pasé desapercibido  y realza convivios, así como también  por los cumpleaños ,cada miércoles  se dan reconocimientos  a la gente sobresaliente"
good,The work in Garden is physically demanding while working in all conditions. It is also the biggest department which makes it even more difficult. Garden associates should be paid more.
good,it was fun working there but the pay was terrible and they expected more from you then what the pay was worth. benefits were somewhat ok and the 2 times a year bonuses were not good
good,"I've been working at Home Depot for about a year 1/2, it's a good place to start when it comes to it being your first retail job or getting through school , but I personally wouldn't make a career out of it. Some of the managers there are ""some timing"" or can be ""wishy washy"" and they definitely show favoritism and if they dont like you, or if you're not in their clique, it's hard to get anything fair out of them."
good,The co-workers were nice and the management is decent enough.. it's a retail job which means everything you'd imagine. The main trick is that the chances of getting full time after you get hired on is a bit slim.
good,Very nice place to work as you are going through college. Home depot was very knowledgeable but at time Management makes you feel like you dont matter. In addition there is not much room to grow.
good,Es un buen empleo donde se puede crecer y hacer carrera
good,It's not a bad place to work. hard to have a work life balance. good benefits. Can be tough on your body when working on freight. Management has a tendency to change fairly often. There is room for internal advancement.
good,The main part about working at the home depot was team building  this aspect of the job was crucial to the success of getting the job done  time Management was also a crucial part and making sure your moving forward with your work in a efficient matter
good,"THD is an interesting place to work, although certain work tasks can be tedious and repetitive, such as stocking. What makes it pleasant is the people and customers. If you like people, it's a great place to work because interactions are rich and fulfilling most of the time. You are expected to help solve customer problems and leave them with a great experience, not just to do tasking and keep to yourself in your job."
good,Low salary with little benefits but  there were colleagues that were lazy not willing to work as team players. Management could have done more to make the working environment pleasant.
good,"they can help you succed, but sometimes they will accept transfers instead of giving you a chance to advance, i have been there for 2 years and well it took me that long to get full time, If you do over 27 hours they put you on the list"
good,"Working at Home Depot for almost 2 years, I can easily say they pick favourites in the store. Certain managers favour some over others. Not enough pay for the cost of living. I wouldn’t recommend working here unless only for a short period of time."
good,"Been there a while. Love the customers and working with them. However, not a good balance of work and family time. Always there not enough time to spend with family. Do not pay you what your worth."
good,Home Depot was a good place to work at but when I started school they cut a lot of my hours I went from 40 plus hours a week to barely 15 so I had to look elsewhere
good,"The pay is very low.  If HD wants people to stay, the pay should be adjusted to a more realistic level.  Training is available but it's difficult to fit in to the schedule."
good,"Good place to work...fellow associates are friendly and supportive, however, for all of the work that I do, I am vastly underpaid. Some days I say to myself that I don't get paid enough for all of the things I am expected to accomplish in a timely manner. Quite frequently, I am left on the floor in my department alone all day with no breaks. Communication is extremely poor as we are not told most of the necessary information that is relevant to our daily responsibilities. I think the managers are intelligent and caring, but they are overworked also. It, I believe, is just the way it is with such a fast paced environment where most employees are overworked to the extreme. One person can only do so much. Department managers are sometimes at wits end, and simply cannot cope with everything."
good,"Started out part time July 2016, hired as a pro loader / lot attendant. Began to cross train into Electrical & Lumber in Sept 2018, where I was working ""split shifts""( 1/2 in the parking lot, then 1/2 inside). Lack of career advancement"
good,In a typical day at the Poulsbo Home Depot - there will be no one scheduled in departments causing a select few to cover multiple departments at once. You may call for backup assistance and you will have someone help you about 25% of the time.
good,"I dont realy have that much to say about this job. Do t miss more than 2 doys for any reason, they have an immediate  termination  for call ins.Good job.. 12 hour shifts 4 days a week"
good,"It’s a job , hard work fast paced . Retail environment so dealing with the general public is always different. You can definitely move up in the company if you work hard"
good,"Was with Home Depot for four years, starting part time and becoming full time after one year. I specialised as was experienced upon hiring and it is the way to increase income. Management was slow to make necessary changes but did note strengths and rewarded."
good,"I liked working there it was a learning experience. It was a fun but at the same time it could be a very serios atmosphere. The peak times off the day were difficult because you rarely had time to catch your "
good,"A typical day at work would include customer service, store maintenance, and loading customer purchases into vehicles. I learned basic workplace skills to complete daily tasks. The management was slightly unhelpful in daily tasks but understood what had to be done. The culture of Home Depot is very much alike to almost all retail jobs, in that the main focus is the customers while also maintaining the stores appearance and sales opportunities. The hardest part of the job was acquiring assistance from machinery licensed associates for daily tasks. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with a wide variety of customers and creating relationships with the customers."
good,"Working at Home Depot was alright, nothing extremely difficult. Hours and pay aren't the best though so I wasn't motivated to stay with the company for very long."
good,"Good company and people, a few terrible managers ruined my experience."
good,"The first thing about working there is that management thinks it’s trying hard. From the start of your shift you are expected to move as fast as you can and work as hard as you can, given the level of strenuous activity this is difficult even for people who are fit, and only the most physically fit should apply. The pay is base with little movement and moving into management or even supervisor is difficult. There is high turnover due in equal part to poor management and employees not following attendance. This is not a long term job and there is really no incintive for additional performance. You can learn heavy machinery and when I asked about what addition compensation would be for learning any I was told that it was to support the team and make me more valuable, in other words slightly less likely to be fired. The atmosphere was not if you don’t do your job or do something terrible you could be terminated, but rather when you make a mistake that is when you will be fired. The stress was through the roof and less than 10 percent made it over a year. I managed to stay 5 years until a new up and coming manager trying to play the game would make up reasons to write me up so I could be fired and she could draw the line in her sand. I say this because in 5 years I learned every department, learned every marching, helped across the store and was extremely proficient in customer service and maintenance. I developed new systems that saved time, worked on special assignments that saved tens or thousands of dollars and earned accolades from staff and customers alike at a much higher"
good,"It was an OK place to work at, paid the bills while I worked my way through school. I never intended for it to be a career, but the possibility is there if you like the job."
good,It is a good company to work for. Typical day is dealing with customers.  Product knowledge is key they have great  training classes to help you achieve the knowledge you need. Lots of people/contractors to meet. Hardest part of the job is being in A building with swamp coolers.
good,"Typical work day at The Home Depot, was honestly stressful and exhausting. People called off the time, had to cover departments I had no knowledge of. People expected you to do more than you knew. They did a lot of shady stuff."
good,This home depot was definitely a learning experience. I was trained in one department but ive learned so much more all over the store. They give you chances for promotion and they only want to see you succeed.
good,"Your coworkers are some of the greatest people, you’ll make friends quite quickly, but management is not very  efficient, you’ll be doing the job of a manger while getting paid your regular salary"
good,"It’s a good part-time job. You have to be diligent. No tarries or absences. It’s an easy job.  The management can be a little strict, but some are very easy to get along with. You just have to be dedicated."
good,Working with a forklift most of the crew left me alone. Crew was great to work around. The his was layed out every night and everyone knew what needed to be accomplished before the store opened
good,"sales associate to sell and help customers in whatever area of home building, redecorating, landscaping and ordering items online. Help order online and instore sales for appliances, to lawnmowers"
good,"most everyone is great team player. I feel that management makes promises they dont follow through with, I feel that some more person to person training vs computer training is needed"
good,Good job to work at very easy going sometimes. Most of the time you have to deal with customers that are sometimes very rude. All you have to is do your job and help customers. Pretty decent pay and benefits.
good,"Used to be a decent place to work.   As I worked near the exit doors, often the temperature could be uncomfortably hot or cold."
good,"I learned a lot in the year i worked there.  I have recommended to many people to work there two of which still do.  I was at the time working there and at Americas Best Value  Inn, then, received a promotion at the Motel and could not work both anymore due to availability.  Good Company to work for, hard to get full time with Benefits."
good,great good people good coworkers but not the best management team that part needs a lot of improvement overall its a company with lots of opportunitys for all
good,"Fast paced position, night shift, stocking the store.  Use of heavy machinery and demands are high for volume type work.  Constant replacement of new supervisors caused a lot of new starts about procedures and processes."
good,"The point of the most enjoyable part of the job is that you can enjoy communicating with customers by answering their questions in regards to their projects. If you can satisfy other peoples' concerns and questions, I am sure you can enjoy satisfying yourself.!!"
good,Good job for someone that is ok with their hours being all over and not have a steady work schedule. This job will teach you to be patient along with great problem solving tools.
good,not enough time to get done what needs to bee done over night. over night manager would not help at all. pay was not enough for amount of work. not fun people to work with.
good,"The pay is above minimum wage and better than other retailers but still very low.  There is no employee discount.  The scheduling can be very whack.  "
good,"The Home Depot is a diverse company to work for; however, there isn’t much position advancement at some of the locations. Things as such should be looked into by those in higher positions with the company."
good,Training is always available and some advancements depending on the location. My last roles were equipment trainer and coach. My next step was to get into management but that was not possible due to management being diverted into a different direction. I learned both sides of the warehouse inbound and outbound but with all of my knowledge and experience my pay wasn't matching my performance. Overall my time at home depot was worth it and I would till this day recommend anyone to apply.
good,"Don't get paid enough, but it is a fun place to work. Meet lots of great and not so great customers."
good,"In my time at Home Depot I have been moved to different departments 5 times, without me applying for the positions or requesting a transfer. This includes Engineering, specific division support, L3 support tech."
good,"It was a fun place to work you got to meet a lot of people and pets."
good,There are too many cons.   They were basically good to their employees but did expect them to stay over if they needed them and sometimes people could not and that did not sit well with the management.
good,"A typical day depends upon the position held. A sales associate might be given weekly sales goals for the department from the department supervisor, and an asst manager would be given department goals to meet. For example shrink numbers for the previous week or month, vs overall sales and markdowns. Promotional goals such as new credit card holders...it's a very difficult kind of job. Very stressful dealing with angry customers who may want to return a used toilet or even stolen merchandise or worse...using fake id's to return goods...it's tough. the higher one goes into management the more pressure to succeed as well as perform ones job with high ethical standards and integrity. it's not for everyone. If one isn't friendly and honest, easy going, it's not the job for you"
good,"Good Benefits, Decent Pay. I don't have much more to say here, so I'll fill the rest with a bunch of filler non-sense to reach the obligatory 150 word minimum."
good,"Good first job .. good place to start and learn the ropes . "
good,The job is highly competitive with all other specialists trying to be number 1 in the district. If your numbers were low you would know about it on the weekly status update.
good,"I have a disability and Home Depot Manager did not provide the help needed to get my work schedule, causing many reprimands fo missing work scheduled. Late sign due to no one available to help sign in."
good,"I do enjoy working at The Home Depot. The customers are great and the supervisors authentic. However, the higher up you go the more corporate the management gets. They have lost focus of what the Home Depot is. They say ""customer service is important"" but no longer initiate it. My store has so much potential but it is going to be lost as customers will find a better fit."
good,"Electrical sales is a high volume, fast paced department."
good,"As a sales associate at the home depot you are treated as any other sales associate anywhere else you could imagine. It is difficult to get fired, they push you to sell credit cards and you have to work weekends regardless of your reasoning to not."
good,"Working as an associate is easy enough and consistent with daily roles to accomplish and generally set schedules. Moving up in the company can be rather easy with a good work ethic, but moving up to a supervisor position quickly becomes rather stressful due to a lack of general manager engagement and random work hours for example opening one day and closing the next then being off for one day and opening the following. Just a very up and down schedule while trying to maintain a department and keep a team coordinated with no real assistance from upper level managers."
good,Home Depot can be a fun place to work if you can get past the games played by management and other supervisors . Good lace to work if you get satisfied helping customers get there projects done
good,"The pay was't the greatest but I worked with some good people.  Some times I felt like I wasn't good enough for the company, but overall it wasn't a bad experience."
good,"fast paced, no job security, large work loads, not enough staff , great benefits but expensive, good people not enough recognition is offered by corporate given by salary, not enough training for all areas . experience not compensated, district micro managing and replacing tenor. "
good,stocking merchandise and making sure everything was in the correct place in the aisles. also I would do costumer service and assist them in any needs that they had
good,Ok job it for not working in the store try to get in at the SSC or the Innovation center. You learn a lot about different tools and meet new people everyday.
good,"As employees, we are trained to do our job as safely and politely as possible. We are specifically told NOT to apprehend shoplifters unless we are Asset Protection. However, there currently are no Asset Protection employees, so we are expected to apprehend shoplifters. Cashiers are surveyed and graded on our performance at all times, but no other position is faced with this. Therefore, when the store doesn't meet credit card application quotas, the cashiers are blamed. These standards are set by corporate and district managers."
good,"I first start my day by having a small group meeting, getting orders for the day, what merchandise I have to locate in the store for that current shift. I am then left to my own to move pallets of merchandise throughout the store. While completing these tasks, I can be asked at any time by a customer for my assistance. This is usually for help regarding the location of a certain product. By the end of my shift I am expected to have faced all of my assigned isles, provide happy and effective customer service, and to have completed any tasks given to me that day regarding forklift operation."
good,"They care about their customers much more than their associates and their safety. I had been going there for as long as I can remember and was very proud to wear that apron. Now, I wouldn’t want my son or daughter working there."
good,"Customer satisfaction was foremost, Management had issues with authority, thinking they were better than everyone else and treated most associates as lesser people."
good,Store manager isn't caring for your personal life. Store manager takes it personally when you have to call out of work for school or to do something with your family.
good,"In the three departments that i have worked all of my bosses have been great to work with and for, they take the time to know you and what your strong at so you can do the best that you can,"
good,I do loved what I did and was good at it . I just think management needs to trully evaluate who they chiose to run there departments . Of your department adsociateds are training your leads you have hired the Wong lead
good,"The Department more structure and Management needed to help the Employees out more. "
good,"Decent company, just terrible management. The company is more worried about their profit margins then keeping their employees engaged and motivated to better themselves and in turn the company itself."
good,"I very much enjoy serving customers and helping them with whatever task they arrive to the store with. I enjoy leading the new associates, mentoring and coaching them in the ways of the Lumber/Building department."
good,Needed full time work. The people were great and it was rewarding to help the customers in the tool rental area but it was time for me to move into a full time role elsewhere.
good,"Typical customer service position. High stress, work on holidays, and try to keep the customer happy. Each associate is empowered to help the customer. They try to keep everyone as part time employees to eliminate the need of benefits."
good,"Management wws not good they ppicked favorites and would not back you up and never had a weekend off , loved the people there enjoyed most of my time there"
good,The Home Depot was ok to work at but the employees was not to helpful with the customers and you got payed every 2 weeks and the pay wasn't really good there
good,"In that particular store, at that particular time, It wasn't a  wonderful place to work. After 6 months in flooring I was moved to doors and windows, which was fine. The Supervisors and managers fought all the time, not behind closed doors. Right on the sales floor. Honestly, I felt like I was hired to fulfill a quota. I was 1 OF 2 white men working in that store."
good,"Service Desk / Sales Associate                                                               I have definatley  complaintlearn to muliti task. Service desk is contiually busy with in store customers as well as call in customers. From working on customer orders, locating product to customer complaints. This is a postion that requires patience as well as a willingness to just want to help people."
good,Fun people to work with. Good culture. Awful management with no ability to follow through on schedules because they overbook themselves and assume they can hire from the outside. Long hour but fun
good,"Pleasant working environment.  Answering customer's questions was challenging and enjoyable.  Home Depot educated all employees and equipped them with the necessary on hands training to use all of the machinery, and computer systems.  The time spend answering the customer's needs was self fulfilling and rewarding."
good,"check your sales, measures, installs every day, call customers regarding their interests every other day if possible. maintain the look of your area daily."
good,"nothing to say. I go to work and I feel like they don't care if I do a better job everyday or not, all they care about is a body. "
good,Working at The Home Depot taught me more about customer service. The Home Depot helped me advance my skills in building and lumber. Seeing everyone's home improvement projects was neat.
good,Depending on the time of year very busy. Some heavy lifting involved. Sometimes short staffed so someone other than a lot person had to load merchandise. Sometimes it's you loading because you don't want your customer to wait.
good,Great people but low pay. Prepare to earn every cent of that paycheck. Corporate push downs feel disconnected to local needs. Office politics seem to affect some stores. THD Roanoke was a great store.
good,"At first, you will be told you have an undeniable opportunity to advance your career with Home Depot. Two years later, I have tried to expand my experience here, but to no avail. There is obvious sexism."
good,Great work place if your willing to put in the work and time to learn the job. Great place to learn new skills and lean about the products at the store
good,In this company you must be to work on time or everything falls apart. Make sure that you are dressed properly. Also make sure that any task that you are assigned too are complete and efficient.
good,"A normal day at The Home Depot is very hands on and active. You learn about things from every department as you talk with your coworkers and PRO customers. You will constantly be on your feet talking to customers or dealing with heavy bulky items. The job itself teaches you team work and time management very well from the beginning  since from the start you have to deal with customers in a hurry and orders that have to get out. Like at any other place, The Home Depot has rush hours in which you will deal with multiple customers at once wanting different things. This rush and fast pace taught me to have better communication with my coworkers to satisfy multiple customers at once. And it also taught me how to manage my time wisely so customers could get what they wanted fast, but precisely. One has to be very careful on being precise, specially when a customer is on a hurry and they have a large order of items."
good,"i learned so much working for Home Depot. i went into the company knowing only how to run a register and i left knowing how to use power tools, hand tools and more by volunteering to teach the woman's do it herself workshop. i learned and taught all at the same time. i also learned about online orders, inventory, phone sales, custom/special orders, using the VOS system and more."
good,Its a place for hard workers. You can work really hard and do really well but you get paid the same to just wander around and do the minimum. The only plus to working hard is that your manager will like you and you have a better chance to move up. There's no guarantee that your coworkers will work as hard as you though.
good,"If you are into learning about the home, this is the place for you. Customer interaction is always fun for the most part. Rush hour at the store is the best.."
good,meeting new people home depot is my favorite place to shop because i am a wood worker .i learned a lot about lawn and garden management was great awesome workplace the job was not hard but very enjoyable
good,"I worked on a night freight crew and it was awesome! We got to have parties when we finished early for the week, and we were friends out side of work. Best people I have ever worked with in my life. Besides the lousy pay, it is on of the best places I have ever had the pleasure of working at."
good,"MEM's gain valuable experience in multi-unit management and project execution / merchandising standards.  However, there is an extreme lack of upward mobility from this role to the next step for career advancement."
good,"As a temporary employee, the shifts were inconsistent. You might close one night and have the early morning shift the next day. No set days either and no benefits. However, if you land a permanent position, then at least you have benefits. Your schedule may or may not be set at this point. The employees were nice to work with and do their best to help customers with their needs."
good,The Home Depot culture has changed dramatically since my hire date. When I started with the company the values and ethics were exactly what I was hoping for. The current condition of corporate management has abandoned the values that the company was created for. I am searching for a new career that will provide the same values that attracted me to Home Depot in the beginning.
good,"overall Home Depot is a great place to work while going to school or advancing in your professional life. employees makes the company always friendly and helpful, wouldn't ask for better coworkers."
good,"favoritism is rampant. mgmt. constantly changing, raises are pitiful hours great, tons of theft, learned about inventoy, loved the customers,very cutthroat employees"
good,The hardest job at the Home Depot is the constant need to repackage boxes which are opened by the customers. At times whole aisles are littered with open merchandise and it takes time to assure that all the items which belong in the box are back in the box.
good,"I would personally have to say that I love working for the company.  The pay, for the most part, isn't the best thing but they do offer great benefits and the culture of your fellow associates are there."
good,Thus was a good job all i really do is build everthing that is displayed out font or in the store. It is an easy job until you get something new to build.
good,"My co-workers were a bit catty with each other and didn't seem to keep the atmosphere of team play.  Ther e also wasn't much chance for advancement and no benefits for part time workers.  The company,  though good, was not very handicapped friendly either."
good,"everyone was nice and i loved helping customers. "
good,"Not many complaints. Except for, as a college student who NEEDS money they don't give enough hours. Not all managers are the same.  Make sure your job is done and is done correctly."
good,"I worked here over the summer and I don’t really have any complaints. It was a decent place to work at but it did get boring when there weren’t any customers coming up to the registers and you couldn’t be on your phone so you just had to stand there and wait around and do nothing. This job was boring, but easy."
good,"Being that HD is based out of Atlanta and I work out of my home office in California, I am expected to be in front of my computer at 6 am with the end of my day being 8 pm as I need to support my sales team, our installation team and our customers all day long."
good,"If it was not for the fun co workers I would not have stayed over 5 years. The pay is not good and they very rarely bring on anyone full time. Your shifts are going to be all over, unless you can get on nights."
good,"It was nice working at Homedepot. Friendly customers, nice people. It got pretty busy in the afternoons. You have to be quick on your feet and know your job well to make it. You have a lot to learn about in a short amount of time, its really learn on your own. The people I worked with were like family to me. Management was down to earth people and willing to help you with your needs."
good,"As apart of The Home Depot Exteriors: Management, Supervisors and Co-works are great.  Strong working relationships and support."
good,"as opening associate I was responsible for record keeping, in stock compliance, clean aisle, stocking with fork lift as well as with Ballymore lift as well as customer service"
good,"Very fast pace, good environment, great employees, on the spot tranining flexible hours, freight teams is a great team to start off at. Company moving to Montebello."
good,"this is a great first job, physical activity, there is a lot of interaction with the public. I know people that have made a career out of it however there is a very long path to advancement."
good,"Working here was very fun and productive, management was ok, i learned a lot of people skills how to communicate with customers and be able to provide great customer service"
good,"The job was very low key with a lot of walking. It required a good deal of knowledge about hardware type products. "
good,"Working at The Home Depot has helped me gain necessary skills that  in the future i know will be an asset. A typical day is providing customer service, this goes from pointing them to the right aisle, to ordering them a kitchen appliance. My role specifically requires me to drive machines to keep product in our store stocked, along with using an appliance ordering system to get customers the product they desire. Everybody i work with shares a positive and outgoing personality and is very understanding with each other. Though every work environment has it's stressful times, I do not let that interfere with my quality of labor, nor let it destroy my mood. The part i dislike the most about working at The Home Depot, is their seasonal hourly cut for part time associates. Besides that, working there has been a good ride, but i believe it is time i look for something more meaningful to myself, and out of the retail environment i am used to."
good,Learn more about different variety and teaching customer  and important to understand and non restricted environment. easy going management and great experience
good,Enjoyed the people I worked with.  The job itself was challenging and varied enough that it was never boring.  Expectations were straightforward.  I like working there.
good,"Difficult place to work because of the irregular schedule - nights, weekends, overnights, working almost every holiday, etc. The pay is lower than most comparable places to work. Too low compared to the amount of work involved. I could work as a cashier at Hobby Lobby or Bucees for better pay, equal benefits and a whole lot less stress."
good,Home depot was a good place to work and compensation was good as well. Job security was not good though. Organization was constantly doing cuts and reorganizations of the company in various departments.
good,"I loved my coworkers, but management needs to get on better terms with the workers. Too much blame is shifted onto other departments, especially the front end, when it is not deserved."
good,Sales. Service. Stock. Was good in beginning. Cutthroat management. Home Depot is good company. Management...............................................
good,Ok place to work shifts were hard they paid ok but you work for every dollar. two half hour breaks during day shift gave you enough energy to work through
good,"Very busy so the day goes by fast, but very poor management. You do not get compensated for the job you do and they put alot of responsibility on one person"
good,"I loved working as the PRO cashier because I worked for the Contractors, from Monday to Friday."
good,"They never gave people the proper compliments and rewards that were truly earned from their work.  Too much negativity in the environment. If a set goal was not reached by just a tad bit, everyone was referred to as a bunch of losers. No matter how much work and effort was put forth."
good,"Great place to work for part time only; very little, if ever, any chance of full time employment, even when split between departments, stores or roles."
good,It was a good place to work till the end of my working there. I was let go in a mess of the department that I was in and after I left the entire department was fired because after I left nothing got done.
good,"Typical day was greeting customers, handling cash, answering phone, overhead paging. Returns and purchases. Using the computer to locate customer orders"
good,"Great group of people.  Unfortunately, because of big company policies,  they can't reward you,even if they want too . They pay part time employee poorly.  You are not rewarded for hard work , extra responsibilities , or being a reliable employee.   This is why they lose  most people.   The long term employees are paid well but  only because they came into company before HD sold out to Wall street."
good,"Makes you work hard, even stuff that is out of the position responsibilities.  They move you around the department to department and even expect you to clean up others mess.  A lot of customer service politics including the only white ASM."
good,"Home Depot employees were very kind and helpful when I needed assistance with something. If I didn't know something, I could go to them and ask."
good,really enjoyed the people that I worked with. since the headquarters is in atlanta they made the decision on a false incident that cost me my job there.
good,that no matter how hard u do work people wont recognize your efforts unless your apart of that fit in team. best part of the job was having customers that did see your potential and enjoyed your service with the company
good,I had a great career while I worked there.  I learned many skills about leadership and working as a team.  I wouldn't trade my time for anything but it was time to move on.
good,This is a good job to start a career with. There is room for advancement if you desire to advance your career with this employer the schedules vary there was no set schedule for me but it may depend on what department you work in
good,Loved working with the MET group.  They add a lot of value to their stores.  There is much potential to learn and improve skills.  Some really great people work for Home Depot.
good,"Fun yet stressful, difficult time advancing. They do ask a lot of their associates. Can be rewarded for excellent work which I was but no promotion. Great group of people"
good,"I started out as lot a attendant I would help customers load there vehicles, too cleaning the parking lot. I took every opportunity to help a customer with there shopping needs. It did not matter how big or small, from lumber, home décor, gardening, too plumbing. I wanted each one to leave knowing that there need were met."
good,"cash handling, cash register savvy, customer service, assisting customers in locating the items they were looking for. Work the customer service desk. Assist customers in their exchanges and returned items."
good,"there were days it seemed like my supervisor hated me, because he did. However on days he didnt work the days went okay most people were friendly.  After like 4pm it would get so empty and boring like a ghost town so that sucked."
good,"Everyone usually gets along well, however, the only people who are ever ""recognized"" are people who are friends with management. A typical day includes plenty of people getting angry at cashiers because only two cashiers were scheduled."
good,"Loved the staff, very friendly. pay mad in impossible to live on. Worked most weekends, made it hard to have a life with family. Learned a lot on how to make repairs on most home projects."
good,"Working as a head cashier is fun and sometimes stressful, I would love to be full time and get benefits.  They hire too many school kids which makes it hard during school hourss."
good,"I worked there for 12 years, loved my first district management team and store management teams (I worked at a few different stores within the same district), but had to transfer for personal reasons. My next district/store management team was not on the same page and so I chose to go back to school and complete my degree."
good,"The schedule isn't consistent."
good,"Depending on your role, can be fun and challenging at the same time. Have some great managers, and some good assistant managers.  Also have bad ones as well.  The pay is above minimum wage, but not very livable.  They have a lot of foreign exchange workers from other countries for some reason.  As a company they like to do different charity events to help communities, which is great.  But it doesn't really help the employees who volunteer their time as they are not compensated for helping the company look good.  They have good base company guidelines in trying to project and encourage great customer service, but many of the staff can ruin it with lack of any effort.  Overall.  Most of the supporting roles, such as, freight, receiving, etc. are extremely underpaid for their roles in the store operations.  They really need to work on the pay-scale and pay more.  It is no longer great to just be above minimum wage.  That doesn't make a wage livable in an area where you can't pay rent with what you are making. Need higher wages and to enforce that ALL team members are actively assisting customers or doing their jobs, and not hiding from them."
good,"The home depot was a great place to work, the pay was just to low. I would recommend this job for someone fresh out of school to learn customer service skills."
good,Everyone at my Home Depot was really friendly and very welcoming. People took a genuine interest in getting to know me when I first started. Everyone was extremely helpful in teaching me the ropes and getting me up to speed. It felt like a Home Depot family of sorts.
good,Its a good part time job if you don't like to do different things and just want a paycheck. People are usually great to work with. Many employees unhappy with working conditions and lack of possibilities for advancement.
good,"This was never going to be a permanent job for me, that being said it was always interesting going to work because you never know what you were going to learn about. I worked in the kitchen and bath department but I regularly ended up working in other departments as I helped customers solve problems and find products within the store,"
good,"Es un Trabajo muy variante y dinamico, con mucho trato al cliente."
good,"manager are professional, work place good environment , customers are awesome , not paid enough , it's an okay job , love the job just not for me right now"
good,Most of the people in management is insecure and will not help people advance if they feel threaten by them. The do not like hard workers or people that will ask questions. The only want YES people under them. Not good for moving into new opportunities for advancement.
good,"I was hired initially to replace the Manager’s assistant. I started in Special Services, until the assistant moved on. She never did, and there was no discussion regarding my role."
good,It could be a bit stressful when dealing with the customers patients & a positive attitude is key. At all time you should smile & never argue with the customer. Always do your best in providing quality customer service.
good,"I was employed as a part time Appliance Department salesperson with a promise of full time employment eventually. Instead my hours never reached more than 40 hours per week for 3 weeks at the Christmas shopping season, and after over a year, had shrunk to 14 hours per week which is not a living wage unless you're making $40 per hour. Had the company delivered on full time employment, I might still be working there."
good,"Good place to work, flexible hours, managers agreeable. As a Head Cashier I went through quite a bit of training, however the welcoming of a new Head Cashier was not reciprocated by the Cashiers.  Managers did not provide enough support while I supervised the Cashiers. Sneaking cell phone use, mouthing off in front of customers, and to myself was either allowed or ignored. Complaints consisted of 2 days worth of paperwork to be handed in and then they get back to you.  Great job, if you can handle the ""Im too good for this job"" attitudes."
good,"This store's location is only 20 miles from where I lived in Odessa, MO."
good,"This was a great place to work and only left as a job opened in the field i am pursuing as a career. Unfortunately they would not hire me back even though i didn't call in sick, took extra shifts etc."
good,"Great coworkers that made shifts enjoyable."
good,"Hard physical labor. Male customers that will harrass female employees. Long hours and short breaks. Male dominated industry. Some opportunities for training, either to perfom job duties or advancement."
good,"rather not saynanything to posibly hinder myself more from advancemant. but i will say from the stores ive worked, the one i am at now is by far the worse"
good,"You interact with the customer and also get to know about alot of the products in the store. There is a lot of traning that you will do overtime. Management was great at Home Depot. There was notheing hard about the job, they also provided you with training."
good,"Muy buen ambiente de trabajo y muy buena capacitacion."
good,"Lots of young employees, similar to a high school environment. Turnover is high for most positions however there are always allot of other employees on the floor."
good,"Political based job advancements, helps gain knowledge in multiple fields of work, great training process, the environment invites free thinking, problem solving, overall great learning experience, management can be very biased on promoting due to word of mouth despite work effort or physical achievements"
good,"I worked as a delivery driver and it was a fun job getting to ride around dropping off items. "
good,usually part time work and the schedule is always different. management is hard to find and does not want to handle situations would rather the associates handle problems they should.
good,"I would say I love working with the workers, the environment was fun and customers were more on the happy side. management know how to manage a situation."
good,the hardest part of the job was having to upsell the home depot credit card. enjoyed coming to work everyone was very helpful.  having to work out in the garden was very difficult in the heat and sometimes in the cold as well.
good,Don't really care for the way this business is run or the way supervisors talk to the employees. Advancement is little to none. It's just a job to pay the bills in my opinion
good,"Great company, poor hiring policies. People often hire friends to higher positions. changing schedules, leads to stress. Loved that they offered overtime and you can work as much of it that you want"
good,Typical day here is waking up early and have brief meeting. Then you get your equipment and get your job started. Not much time to talk and always on the move.
good,"Although the pay was above minimum wage, employees are treated with such disrespect from both customers and managers. It's a good job to have for experience, but other than that, not so great."
good,"So, what is a problem? It can be a lot of things. We know in our gut when there is a problem, whether or not we can easily put it into words. Maybe you feel uncomfortable in a given place, but you're not sure why. A problem might be just the feeling that something is wrong and should be corrected. You might feel some sense of distress, or of injustice."
good,"Mixing paint for customers."
good,Overall my experience as an employee wasnt to pleasent the management needs alot of work store manager is very nice and makes sure to keep her customers happy always had a better expierence as a customer then a employee
good,i enjoy working at home depot only when i am working for a management team that are more knowledgeable than the associates. At my store there is no accountability therefore associates do whatever they want. Cant call managers for help because most of the time they dont know the answer or how to help you. they have very unprofessional dept supervisors who dont want to be at work. Store moral is horrible. not all home depots are this way just the one I work at.
good,Just like the headline says... the employees are great. The management does not always do a great job-- and the employees feel about them is a reflection of that.
good,great co workers verry helpful but managment  needed alota work and there comunication was terrable alot of times between managers but if u can deal with some managment problems yes its a great place to work i loved my job here but my mangers continued failings all in all is what drove me to resign
good,"I worked with the staffing company on a temporary basis and it was very uncomfortable. It was cramped spacing, we couldn't converse and supervisors were listening to our every word. They called whole groups and fired them on the pot for no reason. It was highly stressful."
good,As an assistant manager you have a lot of responsibilities.  You oversee every aspect of the store on a daily basis.  You are scheduled 11 hrs. but???
good,"Working for the home depot for about 5 years has been an interesting experience. I've been moved around different departments including operations till I settled in Deliveries. Management was on top of everything the first 3 years, then our store manager was switched out with someone new and it all went down hill from there. It was then that I knew it was time for me to start applying to other forms of employment."
good,"Corporate guidelines are great, but independent stores need to adhere to the process of employee recognition and advancement"
good,"typical day at the home depot will be customer service and packing down..alot of task to accomplish and also helping your  co workers...working at the home depot i learn how to drive multiple machinery like the reach truck ,the forklift and the oder picker..the most enjoyable part about the job is making the customer happy to shop!"
good,"I enjoyed working for the Home Depot Company as a Sales Specialist in the flooring department, enjoyed working with the public"
good,"The job day consisted of two things, helping customers and helping the store. Overall the job is quite easy, so put effort into looking for things to do."
good,"Long days always trying to figure out best purchase for customers needs and budget, always learning about new products and how they work.  dealing with customers that do no know what they what, but want  you to find the right product for ""What they are describing"" but can bot find anywhere; but on the flipside when you solve a customers problem by finding just what they are looking for..is a great feeling!!"
good,"Home Depot was an enjoyable place to work.  The people and environment were great, but management was seriously lacking.  They would mark off that we took breaks when we didn't and supervisors were all over the place."
good,"Great atmosphere, I enjoyed going to work. Great coworkers and management were always professional and helpful. Pay was Ok and work really well with family life; scheduling was the best very flexible."
good,Changed up management a lot. Pay wasn't good for the work we had to do. Always short handed and over worked. Has there favorites that they always go to and give the same things to.
good,"I decided quite some time ago that I was very ready to get away from working for big retail companies. There are absolutely great things about this company, awesome characteristics you certainly won't find at other large stores, but the amount of bureaucratic idiocy and lack of accountability really wind up destroying your soul."
good,I was a Cashier at Home Depot & I really enjoyed working here very much. I love Customer Service. I interacted with customers on a daily basis. I helped out when they needed help with products. I am very customer oriented therefore many customers would always come back to my register when checking out. I worked well with employees & management.
good,A great company to work for but the opportunity for advancement is difficult. The department and my co-workers were great which made my experience amazing.
good,"Though benefits are pretty good, the associate lack of respect for one another is sickening. HR is a joke. They lose paperwork and the right hand doesn't know what the left is doing. You're constantly scared of being fired for things that are out of your control or done by others."
good,Great company to work for but unfortunately not enough money. Home Depot is not paying the bills at all. They rarely give me hours. I'm in need of a better job
good,"I started working at the Home Depot as a cashier, and enjoyed the staff, the customers you typically experience range from the do-it-yourself family type to the I-know-it-all contractor type, that typically do not seem to know much, or just wants to complain about the store that they are willingly choosing to shop at, irony at its finest. I voluntarily switched to the Freight Team, and greatly enjoyed the management on it, I acted under minimal supervisor for the most part, you really just grind away in a very repetitive process that for the most is enjoyable if you have a good team and lenient management. The only downside to being full time nights is that you begin work at 9:30 PM and do not get off until 6:00 am, Monday through Friday, now its kind of catch because they say that you have weekends off but in all reality you are getting off Saturday morning, sleeping most the day then waking up early Sunday morning, this causes your life to enter a blur almost as one day turns into two somehow. Overall, I enjoyed working there, if I wasn't ambitious to excelling in other careers or I needed to get back to a mediocre grind, I would happily go back to working nights with the company."
good,"Environment was stimulating until poor quality began to seep into the management structure.  Compensation could have been improved also.  Compensation was not commensurate with worked performed and responsibilities assumed.  Felt highly esteemed by co-workers and customers alike, yet received just the opposite response from management.  Communication was way only and did not go uphill.  No feedback on submission of ideas to improve the company.  Praise rarely given.  Difficulty encountered in getting reimbursed for expenses."
good,Home Depot is a great place to work. Not only do you learn useful things like how to use tools and basic home repair but you get the chance to do it while helping customers.
good,"home depot was a good job, job but did not offer growth i needed at the time. job duties range depending on positions great coworkers. management left more to be desired"
good,"It's  a lot of helpful employees there,some days it could be fun and some days lack due to when its slow, you have no customer and all your work is done work is not steady..."
good,Working at The Home Depot I have learned a lot about home improvement but I am not supported as an employee.  The management team at my store does not care about the employee and wonderful managers were let go because they were treating their staff as family. The hardest part of working their is the fact that I am a woman and I am stereotyped to not know anything so I have to stand my ground and prove that I do. But it can be balanced out by the people that I work with.
good,"Good working environment.  Coworkers are fun and easygoing.  Alot of favoritism and only they get to advance in the company.  Full time associates get set shift, but it's not always what they want, and some cannot even see their families.   Part time associates get minimum hours dieing slow season."
good,Home Depot is a good  company to work for and some great associates as team members.  Now their Management  is another story.  They will systematic get rid of there more experienced and tenured Associates
good,"People were fun to work with, Management was not very good., Fun evierment just not very friendly management. "
good,Its hard most of the time to find a reason to get up and go to work everyday other than the people I work with. They are the reason I look forward to everyday other than my customers they are the most important to me.
good,"i enjoyed my time there and if i had a chance to go back to the home depot i will "
good,"Loved working at home depot, somewhat good managers. Had great co-workers. Hadrest part of the day was dealing with rude customers."
good,"I enjoyed coming in knowing  I was gonna be building something or making displays or making the store look presentable and that was what the customer seen and made my job more of a accomplishment knowing a customers experience was impacted on my job duties, also enjoyed my co workers there never was a dull moment with them"
good,"A typical day at home depot a lot of standing Mornings usually start off slow. There are items that always need a price check. Getting a price check is always difficult, Its hard to get help from your co-workers in other departments. a lot of dis organization. The co-workers here are friendly that is home depot model nice friendly people and people who want help others. the hardest part of the job is getting team work, getting price check, which makes my job difficult and working with management that does not know their role. the best part of job is potlucks cashier appreciation bonuses we get quarterly and complimentary water."
good,I would clock in for the day. I was on the lot gathering buggies and flat carts for the customers. I would sometimes have to go get straw for customers. I would also at the end of the day clean up my area before the next guy showed up on his shift. What I learned is to work in a heated environment. Management was great working and helping with the employees and customers. My co-worker's were hard workers as well as the manager's. The hardest part about the job was always being on my feet non-stop. The most enjoyable moment working there is I felt like I was apart of a winning team.
good,"Working for Home Depot was a new experience. I loved that the people where very close and family oriented. The company seemed to care about their employees. However, there was some flaws with management but overall it was a great work environment."
good,"The staff were easy to get along with, however I found that the management wasn't very coordinated. The workplace conditions were fine if a little disorganized at times. I found the hardest part of the job was putting up with the monotony of the routine and the lack of proper training, often you're left to fend for yourself. I enjoyed being around the other staff and customers as we got along quite well."
good,Good company to work for. Gets a little boring and repetitive after awhile. Always room for advancement if you seek out different departments.
good,"Good co-workers and lower management, upper management was very poor and made the job very difficult to perform at higher levels of effectiveness and efficiency"
good,"Enjoyed working outdoors, also enjoyed being surrounded by very knowledgeable employees. Picked up many valuable skills that i carried on to other employments."
good,"fun place to work when applications were working. Dealt with store associates and not customers, so professionalism was a priority"
good,I was still in high when I worked at Osco Drug well when it existed. Great job for high school student for side money. I loved working thir. flexible schedule and great friends
good,"good fun enticing loved it family	"
good,worked with my other job.  always short employees in the store.  let me do my job and learn other areas of the store.  loved the customer service was very busy.  pay was not good.  but communication between employees and supervisor was great.
good,"Cash handling, customer service, scheduling cashiers lunches and breaks, ringing customers and picking orders for online orders"
good,"Active listening skills.                                                            Sharp problem solver.  Telecommunication skills.                                                     Organizational skills.                                                  Store maintenance ability.                                                     Adaptive team player.                                                                                                                                                  "
good,"its a good job, and it has its moments. some customers can be rude, but its alright overall. Management can be nice but they also have their days."
good,Decent place to work you don't get paid very well and the hours suck! If you are thinking about working there just make sure you fill out for Met Team or Freight Team trust me you won't be sorry
good,"I enjoy greeting and sending off warehouse workers. They are nice and pleasant to deal with.  Enjoy their joking around, but they keep it at a professional level. Hardest part of this job is staying awake, but the ""gang"" pops in to revive me at times."
good,"It is a nice place to work but the pay is way to low. They offer very many full time positions, therefore no medical insurance is available."
good,"work culture is good, can transfer anywhere after 4 months, some managers care some dont and flex working is not fun do your job and always increase your knowledge with pk's"
good,Management like to play favorites with the associates and not give everyone equal countability for what they do wrong and . They also like to cover up for on another when it come to HR related problems witch is totally unfair to the people it there to help
good,"employee supervision, store sales, scheduling, customer service, operational expenses, responsible for all merchandising, inventory prep, pricing, loss prevention, store activities and morral"
good,The Home Depot is a wonderful home improvement learning institution for a highly motivated self starter individual. Moderate product computer training for each department with very little assistance once you hit the sales floor. Favoritism/nepotism plays a large part in upward mobility. Large majority of management team are not as knowledgeable as you and care more about sales numbers than you as a person. The most enjoyable part of the job was servicing the customers and enlisting the expertise of other co-workers to demonstrate different ways to solve their problems. Volunteering with our community outreach program (Team Depot) is a highlight. The hardest part of the job was to exceed the requirement(s) of the job and receive little to no recognition. Pay is not commensurate with the job you do. Promotions are few and far in between unless someone leave or terminate.
good,"I enjoyed coming to work with a new adventure of regular and new customers projects. Even enjoyed most of my co-workers and it felt like a family place. Every day was never the same, even though it sorta was."
good,fun place to work sometimes the customers can be a little  to demanding but it comes with the job.wish they paid a little more then i would have been able to stay at the job but in all a good company.
good,"A typical day in the lumber department is non stop work. There is always something to be done. From down stock to flat stacking the lumber as well as cleaning maintenance. My job is to put away any lumber of building material freight that comes in that day, in addition to down stock and have the department look clean and ready for the next day. Management adds on to my already busy task schedule by adding on their own lists and agendas. Very micromanaged atmosphere. It would not be as bad or stressful if everyone pulled their own weight in the department. I feel as if some days that I am left with the whole department on my own. The hardest part of my job is to find out what would be acceptable to management if I don't get everything completed. The attitude is if I don't complete everything in that one night that it was a failing night. I feel as if it should be what did you not get done we will pick up where you left off thank you for your hard work. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with co-workers and showing some of them a different and easier way to stock with the forklift. Where others don't dare to try I am willing to try for the sake of making the work less difficult. I have learned that I am a hard dedicated worker and how to stand up for myself against others in a non confrontational way. I have also learned that I am a pretty good fork lift driver. You have to learn to be handling 20 foot lumber."
good,"overall ok place to work, customer service is promoted but not always top priority.people are ok for the modt part.promotion depends on who you know.pay is good but no binefits"
good,this company is run by the HR department.  Management has no say in any of the decisions made by them.  Operations control is nonexistent by managers/ supervisors.  they do treat their associates very well however.
good,"Sales goals are to be meet.  Continues sales of credit,protection plans on produces and appliances, kitchen & bath, electrical, plumbing, decor & flooring sales."
good,"i work wedsday thursday friday, i mostly drive a stand up lift useing a scanner gun to locate product. i stage at proper location ."
good,"The management should ask for input on processes from the associates on the floor. "
good,"If you like people and a fast pace, this is a great place to work. Not as many hours as I would like, would like a full time job. Management works too!"
good,"A typical day at work is assisting customers by completing a sale, answering questions, setting up deliveries, will calls and phone sales. I learned a lot about home improvements. Managements are just that managers. I enjoy and love my co-workers we share and care about one another. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet for 8 hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking to customers and especially the regular customers and the co-workers."
good,"Whether a customer is in the store to pick up an online order, gather information or details on merchandise or to troubleshoot an issue, the associates at Home Depot put the customer experience first."
good,Great place to work not a lot of room for advancement unfortunately. The managers at times make poor unified decisions but overall a healthy place to grow as an employee.
good,"Typical days consisted of mundane retail work. Stocking, assistance, product knowledge. You learn allot about DIY, and how to tend for your home and garden due to the great information provided during training and from the vendors. Management differs from time to time, you will always get that one who is just there for the pay check. If you can deal with unruly customers and some times the pain of working for a big corporation then its not to bad. Getting to help customers with detail and sage advice is always a great feeling."
good,Long hours. No outside Life especially working nights. the process of stocking shelves gets redundant and you are not provided an efficient amount of help in order to follow the company goals
good,"helping customers in all departments, keeping department clean and in stock, loading vehicles with forklift. I enjoy working with my co workers and the managers."
good,"Ive learned a lot about networking equipment and working with various groups.  Management is good and most of my co-workers are great folks.  Not enough networking people here to support Home Depots growing network.  The best part, is what Ive learned and can use with other companies that can utilize my skill set."
good,It is an exciting place of business. a great place to get some skill/work history i wouldn't make it a career though. its not really the long term kind of place to be.
good,I have worked at the Home Depot for the past 9 years and lets face it box store retail is a bit of a challenge. Don't get me wrong I love doing my job and interacting with customers but the communication just sucks. I was proud to be promoted to a Supervisor position and served in different departments with that title. I've received the regional vice president award and had the best inventory ever this year. Due to lack of support and communication this job is very wearing on a person. This is why I'm looking for a different job with a stronger team.
good,I enjoy talking to customers and helping them with projects. Hardest part of the job is maintaining the aisles. I go into worok write down my inventory and make a list of things to bring in.
good,"I like my coworkers and enjoy working with them, but the management needs some serious improvement. Also, nearly everything needs to be updated because hardly any of the equipment we use in the store actually works. Half the time the Point of Sale system doesn't work or it freezes up in the middle of transactions. We don't even have the TAP option on our Point of Sale system. A lot of customers often complain about this. Home Depot is a multi-million dollar corporation. So why is it that we can't afford brand new equipment that ACTUALLY works? Most of the time I have to scan items multiple times before the scanner even recognizes the items. Come on.  That's just sad."
good,"A typical day meeting my customers needs. I learn that every customer has different needs. Management is there to guide us. My co- workers are a part of my team. The hardest part of the job is a difficult customer, but I have to make them happy. The most enjoyable part of the job is having customers sending family and friends for my help."
good,"The only bad thing I have to say about this company is that, everyone is just there for themselves. No one wants to help you advance and when you do advance there are people there that will try to destroy you and your hard work. Love the company, Hate the management."
good,working with company for 12 years but working towards earning BA Degree.  Would love to stay with the company but I am not sure I would like to move to Atlanta
good,"Great place to work, all the aspects for a great career are there if they would pay for career minded people. Pay is bad but the company is good, very fun and rewarding making customers happy."
good,"prepping area for customers....provide excellent customer service"
good,"I enjoy this job but I need a full time job."
good,"I moved all around Home Depot when I worked there and had learned nearly every department in that time. The turn over rate and lack of passion of a large amount of the employees caused a lot of conflicts with my ability to do my job successfully and to the best of my abilities. If every employee really strived to follow the goals outlined by the company, it would probably be the best place to shop and work."
good,The job is great but the management sucks; the coworkers are actually cool individuals. The hard part about the job is just having annoying and unreasonable managers but the other hand the most enjoyable part of the job is the success sharing.
good,Working at Carat is a great work environment and has been an amazing career. I am ready in my career to move on from Carat and look a positive move in the ever growing digital media space. My vast knowledge of digital media along with my traditional background proves me to be a valuable member of any team.
good,"A typical work day for me at Home Depot is giving great customer service to any person that approach me or any person I approach. I explain to every customer that is in need of know how an electrical/lighting item work. I go into detail about any item in my department. I also, suggest other items to sell more products. I always smile and thank the customer for shopping. Home Depot have this job that is called pack down. I do pack down every day during the week by filling holes of any items that is empty/low on stock. I also, learn  from customers. It is a lot of contractors that come into home depot and have more knowledge than  me on certain items, I ask them to explain those items to me and what they are use for to gain my knowledge. At the riverdale Home Depot the management is not all that supportive of there associates. Some but not all of my co-workers like drama and I do not feed into it at all. I say hey and have  a great day to be respectful. I really do not have a hard part at work I just love to learn. The most enjoyable part of my work is putting a smile on every customer face that I get in contact with."
good,"Easy job. I worked in the lumber department for a short time but I learned a lot about different kinds of building materials. learned how to use the radial arm saw, circular saw, and many other tools. flexible yet steady hours. i really enjoyed this job and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a job which pays about $13 per hour."
good,"The MET teams are or were, as they may have changed, the teams of internal merchandisers for home depot.   They traveled between stores doing merchandising for various vendors as company employees. The teams do everything from basic displays, and product placement to major steel resets.   The overall culture is very professional but actually varies significantly from store to store or MET team by the attitude and personalities of the managers.  The training was really solid set by both the company and the vendors. "
good,"Learned how operate and maintain several types of forklifts including propane and electric types, also learned how to operate RF scanners to handle inventory."
good,"Very good company to work for. "
good,Customer Service was once PRIORITY.. Overall diverse learning experience.
good,"An ok job for a student wanting to work part-time.  Management is not bad, company asks alot from full-time employees."
good,"One deals with customers of all sorts, some are pleasant and some are a massive headache. The Home Depot can be described as a typical business, one that is always about sales. An associate conducts business with contractors and customers that are stressed out and irate, due to the difficulty of their projects; this in turn will affect the associates mood over time."
good,"It is a good place if you are looking for a start into a career, or if you are a student or graduate. The pay that they give you is not as good as other places, however they have amazing benefits."
good,"The typical day at work for a Home Depot employee consists of heavy lifting, constant customer problem solutions, restocking and order filling. The management are very nice and very clear on job duties. The work environment was the best and the worst, but my co-workers were very friendly and often hard working."
good,"As the delivery/will call coordinator, I was told that I am a ""mini department head"" because I call my own shots and have my own responsibilities separate from regular associates. I liked being counted on and being someone people would go to to solve problems not limited to deliveries and will calls. I learned to manage my time and retrace my steps after being distracted by customers or other associates' needs. I developed a way of ""defusing the bomb"" when dealing with customer relations by way of controling the outcome of the situation to an understanding relationship."
good,"not a future builder, only looking for part time puppets. since the beggining one can try as hard as possible to move up, but it wont happen. the rotation of part timers is incredible, there is someone new in a store at least weekly because of the people wanting to quit"
good,very good people to work with except for management personal certain people seem to discriminate against you
good,"Management was not on top of things. They were more worried about associates conversations an life outside of work,"
good,"I worked on the Freight Team for the Home Depot Hardware store. The Freight Team contained six guys that definitely had to work together to get nightly tasks done. My shift was the third shift that went from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m. everyday. This job was interesting and taught me the behind the scenes work that goes into manufacturing and the movement of products. The manager that I answered to was my freight supervisor that was always there for help. Through my time at this job, I have learned how to handle fork lifts, electric pallet jacks, electric ladders and pickers to name a few. Another atmosphere that this position exposed me to was working under OSHA. With this employment, we had to work under many safety procedures and document all work or accidents, Finally through this job, I have learned that I can handle any shift, no matter the time assigned to me.Also this employment was my first involvement in a team surrounded position. I am fully capable and enjoy working with a team."
good,Good place to work but advancement was scarce.You were locked into position for 6 months.
good,"Fast pace"
good,Work overnight as freight handler responsible for breaking down stock and stocking shelves for the next days activity.
good,"I worked at Home Depot RDC for almost 2 years, and during those 2 years I mostly enjoyed my employment. There's a couple cons to the warehouse such as ridiculous insurance prices and your occasional supervisor who doesn't deserve to be in the position they're holding, but that's also a biased opinion. "
good,"Company is solid and has lots to offer community and home owners. Days fly by in the spring and summer but not so much in winter. Management intends to be consistant but unfortunitely cannot. It is the nature of the beast when a company becomes this big a different message is received, filtered and sent along with different emphasis on subject manner. It can be confusing. A large percentage of co workers are awesome. They themselves are homeowners and parents. They are dedicated and love what they do. The hardest part of the job is the consistancy with the directive. The best part of the job is a follow up with a customer that struggled with a project that now has succeeded with their project."
good,"a typical day at work mostly include packing out products and interacting with customers, managers are usually friendly and coworkers even friendlier. the hardest part of the job is a slow day when there is nothing to do and you are just waiting for the time to leave. the most enjoyable part of the job is the customer interaction, where you meet really nice people and have a laugh and building up relationships with complete strangers."
good,Working at Home Depot as a Merchandising Execution Associate was a good experience. From helping out customers to making sure all our bays were set to vendors standards. I had to make sure everything looked its best at all times. I loved that we had a great team and our supervisor was very helpful.
good,There was a great group of people to work with. Home Depot is a great company to work for. Some of management could use people skills training.
good,helping customers as much as you can. scanning there food and help packing them to go home. organizing all alleys to keep customers coming back. Learn how to speak to people learn self control to keep my head up and give a helping hand when needed. co-works are all great people to work with makes you work day as happy as possible
good,The work shifts are long and taskful.  The management team can be supportive if you demand it.  Co-workers are of all backgrounds and experiences.  The hardest part of a manager's job is terminating employment.  The most enjoyable part of a manager's job is promoting a well deserving candidate.
good,I was there in a seasonal position for a few months.  Each day was different.  I mostly dealt with customer issues and problem resolving.  I enjoyed the time I was there as a seasonal employee.
good,"It was very hard for me when they fired me Nov. 23 2013, This was a shock to my being. I was asked to meet in the back with loss prevention and was told that they had proof that I had let people walk out with items and that, was when I started crying. I was being accused of a horrible crime, to me stealing is a big deal, for me it rolls around lairs and disrespectful people. So I was asked to sign some paper and I did walked out with a broken heart, I loved my job. I talked to my mother bout it and she asked me if I had asked to see proof? I said no I was upset at the moment and wasn't thinking straight. So a lesson learned, don't just except what they say stand up for yourself if you know you did nothing dishonest you have every right to ask for proof."
good,Working here was fast paced due to amount of customers also due to poor coverage at times as well . The store was managed well overall but certain departments seemed to lack in management. Overall they seemed to hire competent employees who were easy to work with . The hardest part of the job was keeping shelves stocked during the busiest hours because they did not allow any tasking during that time. Customer satisfaction to me was the most rewarding and enjoyable part of this job
good,Home depot is a place that you can go to learn a lot of things than any other retail stores.
good,I enjoyed my time working at Home Depot. Could improve on some things but decent company.
good,"I enjoyed working at Home Depot as a sales associate in the Flooring/Decor dept. I was hired as a ""seasonal"" employee (Apr to Sept) and so was not given a chance for advancement. It takes some time to become knowledgable about the various flooring options and comfortable selling them. The computer program for setting measurement services and selling installation jobs was hard to master. Just as I was becoming good at it I was laid off. "
good,"I rather enjoy working for the company, in that it's fairly pleasant. I enjoy my coworkers, and it can be rather satisfying to work there for the most part. Management seems to actually care for it's employees."
good,work the early morning shift taken care of the outdoor plants
good,Ive been with home depot for almost 8 years and have enjoyed most of my time there despite the hectic nature of the business.  But now they are eliminating most full time positions and starting pay and increases are have dropped drastically.  Not the place it used to be.
good,Management at Home Depot varies substantially from department to department as well as store to store.
good,"I worked at the Home Depot In Newark, CA. It was a fun experience but is highly dependent on what managers and coworkers you work with. Other stores in the area were much worse and different managers were much harder to work with than others. Overall I loved my experience but it highly varies between what store you work at and what the management is like."
good,learned alot about cash registers and i enjoyed helping people out and good co workers made a day at work much more enjoyable management was always   hard to get ahold hardest part of my job was dealing with people who had a attitude
good,I help customers as I am stocking the floor or straightening shelves. Customers are mu first priority.  For the most part management works good with me. Most every one there gets along. The hardest part of the day is when you want to help someone and you don't have the means. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers get the things they need . then they tell you how great the help was.
good,"If you are interested in retail work, this is not a bad place to work. The hours can be difficult and getting a good pay rate even more so. The people who worked with me were generally very nice and caring. Some of the managers were career ladder climbers and would use anyone they could as a step. But that happens almost anywhere. Dealing with regular customers was usually a joy."
good,Over the years THD has gotten a higher employee turn over and is losing loyal employees
good,Start work then go to the back and get your list off duties for the night. finish everything and clock out.
good,"I love working at home depot however like all retain positions there are many many wonderful aspects and a few frustrating ones."
good,"It was a good stepping stone job, I could not see a career being made of it because it requires the suppression of values for career advancement as a woman."
good,"Home Depot is a great company where you can build on your skills and learn new ones. Management does not share too much company information with anyone below them, which hurts the trust of lower level employees. Anyone on the same ""level"" of the employment tier all got along and trusted each other. "
good,"Begin my shift by clocking in on the time clock, greeting everyone, even when I'm not in apron along the way to the break room, then again on the way out. I check where I am scheduled, and then ask a manager just to verify it because sometimes they need me elsewhere (certified in Returns) and then begin my shift as trained. I learn new things daily, such as how to prevent theft, different ways of ringing up merchandise, etc. My co-workers and management are great, they always help me. The hardest part of my job is angry customers, I am great with angry customers, but sometimes people are just unpleasable. The most enjoyable part is hearing how wonderful I'm doing, it makes me feel great."
good,Helping customers and feeling good about it. I enjoyed working with the public.
good,"Answering phones,and processing invoice in person and over the phone, placing objects on will-call"
good,"Co workers do not work as one. Even when you try to go above and beyond, its either not noticed or you get reprimanded in the end for not doing it their way."
good, 
good,"What I learned was how to be valuable in retail business, in customer assistants skills."
