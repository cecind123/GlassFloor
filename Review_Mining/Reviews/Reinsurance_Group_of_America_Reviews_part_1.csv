bad,"Dysfunctional, out of control, complacent management (nepotism, yelling, and name calling) and HR does NOT protect their employees."
bad,"play the game, be a manager.  it's all about who you know which will determine your future at this place.  IT is a joke.  I'd say it's an good old boys club but it's just the opposite.  Let's award people on what sex they are."
bad,"Sr. Management is very disrespectful.  They encourage a culture of blame and gossiping. Lots of narcissistic people who are making employees life very difficult "
good,Have really gone down-hill in their treatment of employees.  Mgmt bullies.  Good employees overlooked.  Forcing some to quit.
good,"Good, professional, demanding work environment.  Excellent for on-the-job training but limited in mentorship, career development, and advancement."
good,"Stable but stressful place to work. Lacked advancment, it seemed that new managers were always brought in from the outside. And I did have have staffing issues in my department, which accounted for my long work hours."
good,Working as a temp. assistant to the lead video editor and shooter was a good experience in general. I was able to gain a good understanding of the efforts involved during launching various internal communications on the global office scale. Staff was very friendly and professional.

good,I'm just going to write a bunch of words becuase you don't need this information and you're wasting my time. I'm just trying to setup a job profile and you're wasting my time.
good,"Overall good Company to work for. Good salary & great benefits. Some people in charge are detrimental to the Company's otherwise good culture, unfortunately."
good,"The culture is interesting with mostly actuaries filling the ranks.  The company is global, so the international offices are unique in that they are somewhat independent, but still follow company policies, though sometimes there is a rub when that clashes with country cultures or other regulators that do things differently than the US does."

good,"RGAre is a wonderful place to work.  With in-house training, there is always a way to increase your pay.

good,"Pros"
good,"I have worked at RGA for eight months. They were ready to offer me a full-time position and I was ready to accept the position until my partner was relocated to the east coast. I cried. This is by far the best company I have ever worked for and I enjoyed my job here more than any job I have ever had. There is a walking trail, cafe, workout room, yoga classes at lunch, flexible schedule and an amazing culture. Everyone is caring, thoughtful but very professional. There is NO drama. If you have the right attitude, are willing to show up every day and work hard, you will be recognized and you will succeed. I thoroughly enjoyed my job, found it challenging and engaging and I learned so much in 8 months I wish I could stay 19 years. I wish I could retire from RGA."
good,Interned there summer 2014. Worked in US Valuation and was working with full timers to develop models that simulated certain mortality scenarios the company might encounter. Was an awesome experience
good,"RGA is a very good place for insurance-related jobs. The reinsurance business is prosperous and promising and work life style is second to none, very comfortable place to work at."
