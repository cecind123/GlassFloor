rating,review
bad,"They prioritize nothing, offer no help. Teamwork is a joke. Managers don't care, they use you as a footstool and throw you under the bus often. The benefits don't out weigh the amount of problems with the company as a whole."
bad,The Management doesn't care about you they just want the job done. They want you to come to work even if you are sick even though we work with raw food.
bad,"Low wage "
bad,"Never again!! In fact I do not have Walmart on my resume. A horrible company. Zero benefits until 19 months of work! Wasteful with food returns, never on time with your scheduled breaks/lunch, point system for tardiness/late, would not allow me ( a germ phobe) to wear gloves to protect my health, bullying was allowed and never acknowledged, training by computer waste ofvtime"
bad,Towson Walmart is very unorganized. Managers are sneaky and they have their picks on people. You overwork with a little bit off money. As well as they will cut your hours and blame it on the system when they manually put you on the schedule when they need you.
bad,"I have nothing nice to say about my experiences at Walmart. I was fired without notice because of an automated system based on absences and was told that they ""do not accept doctors notes""."
bad,Theu dont care unless you suck up theu dont care if you have a family theu gave a lot of people a raise and took it away. They dont want to gove you time off they dont want to work with your hours its not a good place to work and they give people manager jobs with out giving everyone a chance to apply for thst opening
bad,Worked there fir 5 years and the company did nothing but mistreat us all and put me on all kinds of meds because of the horrible ways.mistreated and yelled in our faces. Always unclean working conditions
bad,working here is unpleasant. there is no balance between family and work. Most of the people you work with don't know the meaning of team work. so you do most of the work yourself.
bad,At Wal-Mart no one cleans after themselves. They leaves empty pallets all the time. Accidents everyday. Managers never listen.  Last 2 years I had 8 different supervisors.  Managers lie 24/7.  New people are paid more then me.
bad,Worst people you could ever work for don’t even set yourself up for failure like that they expect you to put the company before your family & anything else in your life biggest regret of my life ever working there & extremely racist
bad,"Wal-Mart only cares about making money. They will look to straight in the face and lie to you. Management is too worried about making themselves look good to help with any issues. None of the management is on the same page so what might be good one day is completely wrong the next. They have no compassion for employees or customers."
bad,"Walmart was honestly the worst job I have ever had. You never went on your breaks when you were supposed to and when you got locked out then you get in trouble for not checking people out.  All the managers were very rude, it was just a horrible work environment."
bad,Walmart on the out side seems to be as bright as a new penny clean nothing worng with it but if you throw the penny on the ground it get dirty the same with walmart after a while you see the the people that are d
bad,I had a great supervisor but favoritism plays a major part in getting a management position. The company does not value its employees or their families.
bad,The worst company anyone could work for. You may as well sign your soul away and hope you have no kids or dependents. You will not be able to support them or yourself.
bad,Dont apply to walmart not a friendly place to work!!!! its like slave mentality  over ther and pay is pathetic. Management  sucks lazy and fabricates stuff espically  the assistant  mgr. Ss!!!
bad,The company is not a bad place to work. Management is terrible. The customers are good some of the workers as well. Their policies are horrible & corporate does nothing when notified of a problem.
bad,If you can find somewhere else. Go there. I do not recommend this place for anyone. They'll cut your hours and if your not management you dont matter.
bad,Worst place I’ve ever worked and I’ve worked some dump fast food places the Farmington Walmart’s management teams training is horrific not to mention the lieing and drama that goes around in both crew and management
bad,Working for Walmart was good for the fact of its always busy so the time didn’t seem to drag on otherwise management was not very good  I got let go for my attendance because they wouldn’t take the points off from when they scheduled me to work at 3 pm knowing my availability wasn’t until 3;30 at the latest because my class ended at 3
bad,They don't care about the employee's or the customer. They're only trying to get their own bonus and that's it. They have very bad racism and favoritism by management.
bad,This company lacks respect for their employees. Their scheduling wasn't flexible and many feel as though they are expendable. I would not recommend working here to others.
bad,When down and feel like you have nowhere else to go. Just work for this company they will make you feel worse about yourself. No longer a family oriented company they don’t care for their people !!
bad,Management does nothing but sit in the office and play on their phones and doesn't encourage any of their employees to become more than what they are.
bad,"They are rude, unethical, and do not have qualifications to be cashiers yet are managers. They tell you what to do even though it's not in your job description"
bad,"1) Lower wages for female vs male "
bad,Will never work for them again and don't recommend anyone else does either.  No management cohesion plenty of gossip and favoritism.  Always asking you to do more work and more hours without pay instead extended lunch breaks.
bad,I worked warehouse and it is not a secure job. Management is ill mannered. HR doesn’t do anything to resolve problems and will tell management confidential business.
bad,I would not recommend anyone working for Walmart. They treat you like a stupid child. I was hired as an electronics expert. I was quickly converted to an overqualified shelf stocker.
bad,Walmart is the worst company ever to work for they don’t know how to treat their employees u never get a off day the don’t care about your health or anything they don’t do holiday pay or overtime
bad,"This was the worst job that I ever had managers would rather you sit back and not say anything if something is not right. "
bad,Don’t make a full paycheck unless you’re salary. All they care about is the numbers . They push you to work as few hours as possible and do as much as you can do with little or no training.
bad,"Worked to hard to long there, seems we’re just numbers to them! There planning big transitions of forcing people to step down and force upper management to take pay cuts after 20 years of loyalty!! Not worth it anymore!"
bad,Not good at all they do not work me enough to know but supervisor  is great.sally they  give me no hrs and tell me that Corporate is call the spots on hrs  thanks
bad,"For this store to be one of the largest retail chains in the world, associates should be making way more in wages. Another reason for the high turnover rate.. Employees are not going to continue to work at companies where they feel under valued and unappreciated... And to top it all off, company wants exceptional work done but does not wanna pay people adequately."
bad,"Workers don't work , they have no knowledge, no work skills they avoid their responsibility & put their work load on other people. Their are to many wanna be  chiefs & no indians! Managers need to be more firmer with staff responsiblies . They take advantage employees of overtime, to make extra money. They show a very negative example for new employees, Especially with people that have worked for the company for a long time, theyttake advantage of"
bad,Worst job I have ever had. Its  not the company it the managers. They need training in employee management.  How to set an example for them and not trying to avoid them.
bad,"Unless you’re desperate, DO NOT WORK FOR WALMART!  Horrible management!!  Everyone knows and has heard how uncaring management is there. For the work they make you do, with no help, the pay is lacking."
bad,"Horrible place. They never cared about any of the employees, They were all self serving and hated to be there so everyone was miserable. Store was always a disaster and all these half-butt workers couldn't manage to make it perfectly straight."
bad,"Management doesn't care what happens to you, the coworkers I had were lazy and hateful, we were threatened with losing our jobs when being set up for failure when it comes to specific tasks, and you're seemingly expected to do multiple people's jobs with no recognition or compensation simply because your coworkers dont do their jobs but don't get punished for it."
bad,"Very unequal, favoritism very obvious,. No advancement, no training, No direction, No Management guidance, the pay is very poor, no overtime pay, no holiday pay, receive very little sick leave or paid time off"
bad,"Overall easy job, but with ignorant managers who have no reason to be in the positions they are in. It’s not an exciting place to work. It’s one of those, “I wake up and dread going there,” kind of places."
bad,"Demanding managers and unfair policies"
bad,"2nd worse company I have ever worked for in my life. I literally got fire for being sick and having to go to the hospital for it."
bad,Management sucks and no job opportunities........................... too many relationships going on and it’s causing problems..............management is poor
bad,The manager of the department in worked in no respect for his employees  unless you were his favorite. always changing the rules to make himself look better
bad,"No one cares about you or your customers, heck I got written up for too much customer service! They laid off 60% of people and made sure none of us could get unemployment! Stay away!"
bad,"Store Manager disparages managers and associates openly in front of others. Inconsistent fairness, discrimination is the norm. Not a good work environment."
bad,"everyone that makes it over a year seems to be a manager OF something with no management experience or personality to be a neutral manager, the experience I had with management was, favoritism and clicks."
bad,"Their management are in management exclusive gang to target any employee who they feel deserves to be terminated for any reason, legitimate or not. They treat their hourly employees like slaves and treat their store management like the slave masters. They work their poor ""slaves"" to the bone and if they get sick or injured from the inhumane hours, bad pay. and no benefits; they simply use the state and federal at-will hire and FIRE laws to wrongfully terminate the hourly part time employee(s)."
bad,"Use Walmart as a place to get experience, but leave as soon as you can. The way management treat employees is distasteful and very unprofessional. You are not a part of the team."
bad,They blamed CAP2 for every other department not finishing their work. No manager wouldn't to help the workers only yell at us to work faster. Also they will fire you and not another person even if the same reason applys to both workers
bad,"I spent four years stuck as a part time associate with no real option to move up.  Every year you receive an incredibly tiny raise and every month they expect more out of you.  At the end of the fiscal year expect to work 24 hours or less a week, because your store manager will likely want to rack up a large labour bonus for themselves."
bad,"Its ok, doesnt offer much they dont go by the regulations, they are strict and rude and once you dont work there they will escort you out. They have managers that dont care they will coach you for no reason and yell at you for no reason. I will not recommened this job."
bad,"I worked there only a year because there to much favoritism, not enough hours, and they punish you by cutting yours hours if you don't put them first."
bad,Walmart was not a great experience for me. When I was hired on I was told I would be working a specific set of hours. At orientation I was given a completely set of hours and when I questioned management they made me feel like my concerns didn’t matter. I was also pregnant at the time and they didn’t offer any kind of flexibility to my schedule for dr apts.
bad,The company has changed so much over the past 19 years that I worked there  they tend to get rid of the employees that have worked there for many years that are are making great money
bad,"Great lots of opportunities, and several locations to transfer to should you need to move or changes cities. "
bad,The management are very ghetto rude and lie. They act like they are in the streets Then when u address them they want to try to act professional. The work is hard and the pay very low. I worked at the Palmdale site in Los Angeles CA and they refused to pay the minimum wage at 14.25 for all companies with 25 or more workers. They said we were in Kern county which obviously we were not
bad,"You are required to work your shift even if you are sick, and you are made to feel like you costing the company money if you do not complete an overly booked task."
bad,"Horrible place to work because of managers, the customers were amazing,  Walmart was a lot better to be employed by when Sam walten was the CEO. It went to garbage"
bad,"Its unorganized, frustrating, and you work harder and not paid on the basis of your work or the things they ask you to do. Best part of working for Walmart is applying for the front end."
bad,"My review is LONG but worth the read, please hang in there. "
bad,No respetan la vida familiar de los jefes cero empatia
bad,"Management is lazy and just sit on their phones in their office "
bad,"Don’t let them fool you into, “we only have 1 full time position available at this store”  "
bad,Walmart once was a company that cares about its customers and employees now its all about how much money it makes.  Theres never enough training for new people and as a supervisor saying this the management team doesnt care about the employee or the customer only about tasks from home office getting completed to they dont get yelled at. They pay you enough so you cant leave but not enough to live off of.
bad,The managers were so unhappy which makes their people unhappy. When you would ask for help they would act like you were a burden. I wouldn't recommend working here ever.
bad,"Always over worked, favoritisms in management, unfair all the time, no raises like promised. Even if you go above and beyond for them they don’t appreciate it, they expect you to do it all the time."
bad,"They have lost some amazing employees, because of the company. i would have to be completely broke, and have run out of every option, before I would work there again. Again one of the WORST companies to work for."
bad,The company will suck you dry of every ounce of happiness you have they do not accept doctors notes and are not understanding of life or family emergencies if you do not show up to work even while there’s a blizzard you can be fired I was fired for having the flu which in result put me over my points
bad,Some employees are very sexist & racist they also play a role in favoritism  I was only there a short amount of time but it wasn’t what I had expected I would consider working at a Walmart again just a different location.
bad,If you're looking to be ripped off and and unvalued his/her as an employee Then this is the best place to go work for. Your asked to do tasks that are not in your job description
bad,Too many management turnover.   No clear direction of job duties.  Too many different managers giving different job duties at one time.  Difficult to schedule the hours you wanted.
bad,do not work at walmart unless you have no other options. Hours are not guarenteed and the performance expectations are way out of proportion to what they pay you
bad,"Overworked employees in harsh conditions, an example would be in summertime while working in the backroom. Barley any AC and no water provided while unloading truck."
bad,The management never works with when your availability is on your schedule. And overworked and underpaid. Other than that working on vehicles was a good job.
bad,Walmart is the worst job I have ever had the management team there do not know to manage or take care of there employees. I would not recommend anyone to work there
bad,Never tell them you have anytime availability. You will change shifts 3 times in one week. Some days early next day evening. Very low pay unless you are just out of high school.
bad,"Management doesn't care about employees,very disrespectful and constantly lies to employees store 1772"
bad,Some positions required specific shift times.  Management didn't seem to care about the employees well being or needs if something was set by corporate.  When asking for exceptions I was told that I could step down and take a pay cut.  Not very friendly.
bad,"Management is the prime issue. One manager will tell you to do things one way and then another will come along and tell you to do it differently. And if they disagree, you get stuck in the middle. Nearly all requests for unpaid time off are rejected. They take forever to process paperwork, like an adjustment slip. And if you need something as simple as a physical paystub, you'll be waiting weeks to get that, because most members of management do not know how to get a copy for you."
bad,"Nothing gets fixed, machine’s keeps breaking down and doesn’t get fixed within 6-8 months. Management has you to strip the floor with a machine that doesn’t do the job. They blame you for a The job not getting done when you comply with there demands and yell at there hardest workers."
bad,"The management at Walmart is sneaky, and they pick favorites with the employees working there. They will put words in your mouth, and put you on the spot. They will also threaten your position, and put fear in losing your job. I do not recommend employment with the company."
bad,"Walmart is always hiring cuz they're always firing. Not just minimum wage employees but upper Management also. Point system for days missed is unfair. Employee hours are cut in half in January. Guess they didn't make enough money over Christmas season. Unless you're desperate, look elsewhere for employment!!!!"
bad,After constant changing was struggle to do job right. Environment always on edge. Vacation and hours are not to pare. Custormers were the biggest joy. Co-workers make jobs bearable.
bad,"Si no le caes bien a los jefes hacen lo posible por correrte o te cambian de departamento cuando quieran y te tratan de amenazar a cada rato, los supervisores se roban el dinero y hacen que tú lo pagues"
bad,I pointed out when I feel like I should not have and I got pointed for things I did not understand what for like key dates and ppto no one other one associate helped me with the rules
bad,"The most misserably managed and poorly operated company I have ever come across and wish I had never started for them. The managers are inept and care nothing for the employees least of all the customers. The management changes continually as they keep quitting and they follow no company protocal according to the Walmart hiring ""Orientation"" and ""Pathways""."
bad,Company is horrible to work for because they take advantage of you underpay you and unless you are in their click then you aren't given the opportunity to make a career for yourself here.
bad,"Worked 10 years with no infraction and consistent evaluations outstanding work took pride in my job.Went on FMLA for my spouse and the 25 year old manager of 1 year got pregnant and felt “your husband should not matter,he does not work here! I’m having a baby everyone feels if u were taken out of the it would be best for all” a week later i was let go over a lie"
bad,As of right now I'm in a find a different position or get out. They are changing the managment positions. They are not letting me step down unless I transfer. The new management positions are fewer than what is now.
bad,Do not recommend. Terribly mean and bully-ish behaviour that is supported and backboned by HR.  Corporate Giant taking advantage of hard working people.
bad,"Majoritally, you will find this job to be unbearable due to the imaturity of it's staff "
bad,The management team is awful needs improvement there’s no appreciation management also picks on people and treats everyone differently I do not like it
bad,"Lazy managers that play the blame game, terrible pay, they keep you part time so you never get bennies, you get sick, work or get fired. Desperation job only."
bad,"Do not work"
bad,There's a lot of racism in the company people are being charged no one is being fired people are just being moved from store to store the company is more about campaigning then about getting the work done and respecting and appreciating their customers
bad,"when i first started working at walmart, i liked it a lot and i liked the people that i worked with so much that they became family, but be very careful because there’s a lot of drama and toxic people."
bad,"Two years of exemplary service went unrewarded when I was injured enroute to work.  Because of my injury, I was unable to lift a 75-pound safe on my own and my manager fired me on the spot - just a week before the Christmas Bonus's.  "
bad,Just be careful and how you do things with this company. The store I worked for 1270 is not a great store to work at. The so called Mangerment Team Sucks.
bad,They work the employees like salves and pay the bare minimum. Also treat management like dirt. They work managers 60 to 70 hours a week. They have the bare minimum of associates. Also if you dont play politics then you are fired.
bad,"Management has poor management skills. "
bad,No advancement. Horrible managers. Never willing to accommodate schedule. Job culture is similar to high school. Low compensation benefits. Not for everyone
bad,"I worked at Walmart about 6 months, in an HR position. I've worked in HR for over 25 years and this was the most negative experience of my career. I do not recommend Walmart to anyone. It's a very hostile, good ole boy environment. It all depends on the manager you get, if they like you, you've got it made, if not look out. They definitely play favorites, and violate their own policies. They have a ton of ethical, integrity, and compliance issues. The Open Door Process is a joke; they will almost always support the store manager, NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO. Run, do not walk to any other employer. You should only go to Walmart if you have NO OTHER OPTION. I've worked in HR management for other retailers and this is the most unsupportive, hostile, negative environment that I have ever seen. My experience was so bad I won't even shop at Walmart anymore, after 30 years as a customer. They are HORRIBLE to their staff. These people deserve better, low pay, hard work, long hours, and ridiculous attendance policies, with rampant favoritism. No one has a work life balance of any kind here. Harassment flourishes here. EVERYONE deserves better."
bad,"management was a total joke. Had supervisor stealing from store and constantly blaming employees he was over, even though they repeatedly ask for the camera to get watch"
bad,"They will work you until your body breaks.  Christmas is a mandatory day off and they take hours from your PTO bank so that it is a ""paid"" holiday.  There is a ton of favoritism.  People never seem to get fired, no matter how much they play around instead of working."
bad,Terrible place to work they terminate on hear say no evidence i would recommend this place to anyone they don't train help long enough terrible place .
bad,If you can avoid working here then do so. This place demands alot for the minimum wage they pay you. Management is incompetent at best. The bottom line is store profit at the expense of the employees.
bad,"Poor management, gossip central, favouritism, little consideration for associates, worked almost every weekend, poor hours... lots other places to work than here. It's no wonder they cant keep anyone"
bad,All they care about are numbers. Management low or upper are not approachable people. Very chilling and cold responses to everyday problems. Do not follow through with concerns of injuries. Not worth the pay unless you are management..
bad,"At 1st, it was a good place to work, but it's hardly a good paycheck for living along with the discount offered. Plus, most management and supervisors won't give the proper respect."
bad,"I would not suggest it. That is just how I feel maybe there's others already and that would enjoy it."
bad,Walmart doesn't care about their employees.  It is like a cult of people.  The staff are rude and unhelpful.  Walmart takes advantage of people that can't think for themselves.
bad,"Management is terrible, not scheduled hours I put on my availability... pay is not great, your just a number and are replaceable. "
bad,"The only reason people work here is because it pays higher than minimum wage. My entire experience there was soul draining, and exhausting. I didn't stay longer than 2 weeks because i couldn't handle the straining environment."
bad,Terrible place to work I don’t recommend this place very rude and non considerate. Too much work for little pay. I hated that place and don’t recommend it once again
bad,"worst job i have ever had,zero hands on training, never met the store mananger and assist.managers are nowhere to be found and when you do see them they are rude, have bad attitude and think their s**t dont stink, when you ask for help you feel like an idiot, Everyone is 100% miserable.some people i did like but for the most part it sucked."
bad,They expected too much for not enough money. The managers all were horrible and insulting. They do not care about health issues or family crisis. I absolutely would not recommend working for Walmart
bad,Terrible with respect for the individual.All the trouble makers are left to work there while the true hard workers are either chased out or fired.I would not recommend anyone to work for this company y.
bad,I'd never recommend this Walmart the assistant manager is not very professional and definitely has no customer service skills and is very difficult on the employee as for the manager it self she always turns a blind eye and does have an issue with favoritism but to complain about any issues you'll rather not be heard or let go .
bad,The hardest part of my job is dealing with the managers and supervisors. They dont care about the employees. They dont pay for holidays days but if you dont show up they penalize you with 2 points in attendance and you get fired with 5 points. You have to work 40 hours to get 1hour PTO.
bad,Muy mala empresa para trabajar no tienes vida social y el salario es muy poco los jefes se creen los reyes del mundo
bad,Walmart was a horrible business to work with. The managers did not care if you were available or if you had a medical emergency or any emergency for that matter.
bad,I got a job at Walmart and the management was horrible . I had a very personal experience happen to me and they were nor supportive or understanding about it . I wouldn’t recommend for anyone to waste their time working there as I did . They cut your hours to almost nothing but let the managers keep their hours which is bizarre and unfair
bad,Walmart is not a family friendly  business  they are a money driven company that thrives off of not having enough  employees  to do their job or fire them flat out
bad,"The place is a revolving door of people. Most new hires do not last, and you never have enough people to do the job (which they will tell you that you are over staffed, but those who came from other stores, know policy, etc... know that's a lie). Entire culture is negative. You will rarely if ever get praise, and if you do it becomes a point of contention with fellow employees, so it's never a good thing. Your best bet is to apply elsewhere or work here til you find elsewhere."
bad,My job at walmart was make my customers  happy. Help  customers  at the deli   cutting   ham cheese and also making all  the parties trays. And bake all the breads and bake all there sweets
bad,You aren't told you have to pass a test in order to keep your Job. The management is horrible about giving information. And it feels like you are in school again with a point system. I you call in you have points put on your attendance.
bad,I worked there with my first day of training and they put me on the sales floor without training and without management and had to figure out the floor and how to satisfy customer service.
bad,"This was, by far, the WORST job I ever had! I would not recommend ANYONE to work for this company. I was with them for 3 years and I was literally sick everytime I went to work because of the conditions regarding management and the company as a whole."
bad,Doesnt accept doctor notes or work with your schedule if you are a single mom. Very hard to move up in the company. Doesnt pay very well and are always short handed.
bad,"Walmart in Geneva, Alabama is probably the worst job i have ever had. Most of management is racist. Everyone is grouped in ""clicks"" and if youre not in one then you will not succeed. The hardest part of working here is that the fellow employees have nothing bettter to do then to talk about other people and complain about their job."
bad,"The location I work at right now, where do I start. The managers are ALL about themselves, they have FAVORITE employees, They will see you struggling with something and wont even help. The store is unorganized, understaffed and they're forever changing stuff like little rules and stuff making things more difficult for the employees. They will have you doing other peoples jobs for example I'm a Cashier, they'll have me cleaning floors, coolers, refrigerators, scrubbing stuff down, washing windows, counters, pushing carts outside, zoning the whole store anything they can think of that they dont want to do themselves.. like I'm the maintenance person. This is almost every shift I dont get paid to do all that extra mess. There are days we don't have CSMs at all especially on really busy days it's really just a nightmare (Depending on who you are) but I wouldn't reccomend."
bad,Management wasn't the most sharp. Lots of employees slacked off as management wasn't on the floor & right then I knew a retail place isn't a job I want to be in.
bad,"Would not recommend Walmart at all, in 3 years I had 4 different bosses. Everyone required different things and not consistent across the board. Corporate politics at worst."
bad,"Treated unfairly and wages are not enough to cover basic needs, schedules are all over the place. Benefits weren’t given and some workers are not friendly!"
bad,"Worst job I worked for in my life I'd prefer to work the fields apple picking then work at walmart, horrible pay and no hours for ot, leave those jobs for the 15 to 16 year old"
bad,"The job description of a sales associate includes greeting customers, educating consumers about products and services, and promoting the business in a positive manner. Sales associates must know the importance of networking in order to build and maintain a client base."
bad,"They treat everyone as if they're replaceable, and do not matter in the overall functionality of the day to day business. Management only likes you if, and only if you kiss their butts."
bad,The pay could have been better. Walmart needs to pay more for all the work being asked to do. They don't work well with schedules either. They will lead you on thinking your getting a higher pay
bad,Walmart has favorites and chooses who they want to be nice to and the ones they want to treat like a slave. I could no longer work there. They aren't friendly and management is everywhere with their job they dont know how to do their job. Walmart is an unorganized rude company.
bad,So bad . So much drama and mangers are a complete joke ! Late breaks and lunches ! Stuck on a register once and had a girl problem and they didn’t care at all ! I’d skip this place
bad,Horrible place to be employed they dont have enough people and when you're drowning in customer ever manager that should help you avoids you're department no matter how many attempts to get extra help they can careless. They also expect you to do everything and more when you clearly explain that you need help.
bad,"Management doesn't care about employees. Pay is higher than some places, but not worth what you have to do. Customers ae constantly cranky. Store was always a mess."
bad,I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Management doesn't provide the things u need to be successful and they go through workers like water. Management only cares about their bonuses and themselves.
bad,Te topas con gente de cultura muy negativa q lleva más de 50 años laborando ahí y q no aceptan cambios de gente más joven
bad,Never work as unloader!!! Pay not worth it for doing the hardest job there. Management is the worst. Wouldn't let me take a second to have a drink as I'm sweating like crazy.
bad,Day to day easy or hard change by day and they make you clean up trash without  gloves but all the people are great and i did kind love it i will miss ti
bad,"Don't waste your time here for longer than a year.  Don't drink the koolaid here.  If you HAVE to work at a walmart, get in the door, get paid the most that you can by sucking up overtime and take as many days off as you can, use all the benefits that you can, Then quit at thanksgiving time so their black friday sales suck and you get the holidays off! Then apply at a nice small grocery store or a coffee shop, Enjoy your life <3"
bad,Management is uncaring and they are not concerned about employees....always complaining about things knowing the employees couldn't keep up with amount of work involved
bad,No Wal-Mart terrible place yo work it's only temporary work. Never again terrible place terrible don't have a good rating from mee worst place I ever worked they never offer anything would never say anything good about Wal-Mart cause that go destroys lives that company don't know what they want has worst management..never refer anyone there.wages are not good enough don't shop at Wal-Mart cause
bad,"No one cares about you at Wal-Mart. Your expendable, unappreciated, overworked and under paid to say the least. Management plays favoritism, nepotism and are very hypocritical."
bad,"Just beware, each location has different management. Company does not care about its employees. Due to a situation in my family, I chose to take a job at the one closest to me, worst decision I have ever made. People in management look down on and treat workers below them like sub-humas, and favoritism runs rampant. Those who are new and are favorited by management can not do their jobs and do what they please; while those who work and actually do their jobs get punished for every little thing."
bad,Walmart is a screwed up company to work for they don’t care about their associates they don’t really care about the customers either MANAGEMENT IS POOR they need to do more evaluations when it comes to being a store manager or any high level manager because the customer service is pathetic
bad,"Unloaded truck and then stocked grocery isle. (cap 2) Then was a sales associate. Management will lie and cheat. The worst job I have EVER had. They play favorites. As long as you stay away from management you will be fine. Incompetant Management with no college degrees.  Three members of Management left after I did. Unprofessional and they work you to death. I was let go due to the color of my skin. I got a lawyer and he said as big as a company that Walmart is, I would be fighting them for years.  I quit Walmart that day I was suppose to come in then and they said I abandoned my job?? I was held by security and not allowed to leave until someone picked me up."
bad,This place sucks  it is a total embarrassment to work there. The C.S.M.  S are allowed to disrespect you anyway they want and the upper management expect you to just smile and do your job. I was told by two different managers tjat they have the right to disrespect me and I can’t say anything back or they will ask me if I’m sure it’s not all in my head and I’m not imanging it. I have never been so disrespected in my life.
bad,"Racism "
bad,"They were terrible at helping with skills , had terrible management when it came to helping their workers , not a happy workplace , I wouldn’t recommend working at Walmart"
bad,Lousy coworkers! Who tell all your business that’s work related! Clicks! No chance to move up what so ever unless their for over 5 plus they told me but will promote from outside always usually
bad,"I worked as a cashier for 5 months and 23 days. During that time, I dealt with some of the scummiest people I think I’d ever work with. My first real day as a cashier I worked a 10 hour shift without receiving a break or lunch until 8 hours into my shift when they finally “realized” I was working a cash register. They will fire you over the thought of a union or even talking about it."
bad,"(Cap 2) This has been the most stressful job I’ve ever had. I come in and immediately am bombarded with so much work to do and they only give you so many hours to do it. Even the fastest worker cant finish it in the time they give you. And then you get lectured on your time. I’m over it. Everyone on cap 2 is over this job. I also was a cashier before transferring to cap 2, the customers are brutal. They cuss you out and report you to management for stupid things like they couldn’t find a certain product as if that’s my fault or my problem. I’ve gone home from work crying several times. I hate Walmart"
bad,Not a good place to work! The pay is horrible and management sucks!  They don’t care bout your well being.. The company on a point system.. 5 points you out
bad,"Management is unorganized, passive aggressive, back stabbing, layers and only help a select few succeed in their jobs while making sure to set other's up for fauler. There is a reason that so many people walk out of one of the highest paying jobs around."
bad,"Horrible, doesn’t care about associates at all. The associates that stock shelves blare music and are rude to customers and other associates. Managers don’t care if something is broken there is no room for opportunity"
bad,"This company is the epitome of slave labour, paying next to nothing in an hourly wage for work that should be completed by upper management, and they will threaten your termination if you bring forward your concerns within the store."
bad,"If Sam were alive he'd close the doors. Most uncaring, ruthless company I've ever worked for. Treating employees like a number or just another warm body would be a compliment. Keep your mouth shut, don't question or suggest anything. Don't get sick or have an emergency unless a mgr likes you and will make your points go away you'll risk being fired."
bad,Management here freaking sucks and it’s nothing but petty drama. I hated working here. The work required is ridiculous and the Deli manager is rude and spiteful.
bad,This has been the worst job I've had so far very disrespectful from Managment and customers. Nothings organized and they let customers do whatever they want to you.
bad,not fair not family oriented no respect for the individual. no compasion. things constantly change more and more is piled on top of you extreme work load
bad,It's got good pay per hour and it's got cheap food and free coffee for during the winter. Family-friendly and can provide good hours if you stay long enough.
bad,"Walmart is horrible, they don't care about there customers or employees. Management is always yelling at there associates and putting them down. definitely wouldn't recommend this place to anyone because of how unprofessional the staff is."
bad,"DON,T give your life to walmart , they DONT give a darn  about there associates !  They lie, they are NOT concerned about there store employees, the harder you work the more they expect. Others walk around on the clock doing nothing and get away with it cause walmart needs bodies and / or afraid of a discrimination  lawsuit!   NO morals left in this company that is why most of us are hoping they fail, cause they are doing it to themselves, they DON,T listen to the associates who  do the work and KNOW THE CUSTOMERS!!  ITS ALL ABOUT THE MONEY, NOT SAM WALTONS VISION!"
bad,"I worked on a small team of about 14 people, out those 14 people, 6 of us were guys that did all lifting. Teamwork is meaningless to upper management."
bad,"The attendance system is the pits, the customers are lazy and mean, the work load goes way beyond the pay rate, even if the customer initiates a tip we were not allowed to accept it. if we did accept it, we would be fired, nobody in my department was happy. They play favorites with the job duties, everyone in your dept thinks they are the boss. Seriously....the worst job I ever attempted."
bad,I’m a very hardworking individual but working for Walmart was a very low point for me. The managers are horrible and are constantly texting there friends or gossiping and are never doing the work they are supposed to. They ignore when the cashiers request assistance and just end up making the customers angry.
bad,As a loader at Walmart you will be worked to the point of exhaustion so they can send you home early so they don't have to pay you for 40 hours. Worst job I've ever had.
bad,Once you are hired you are at your own risk.  Management does not know how to manage and everyone seems to do what they want to do until they get caught stealing or slacking which I do not understand since there are cameras everywhere. Does not value employees
bad,"I've worked for Walmart for over 6 years and over that course of time it has definitely been a heck of a ride. I enjoy helping customers, the best part of my job."
bad,"Very terrible boring, no room to grow. Noone listens, hours seem long the schedule is terrible your there for what seems like all day to many rules and makes you feel stuck. No windows standing in the same spot all day for 8 to 9 hours."
bad,Walmart is a horrible company to work for all the managers do nothing but pick favorites! You can work your tail off and still don’t get noticed for it
bad,"I have nothing good to say about Walmart. The management, employees and customers are of the lowest quality possible. I felt dead inside working for this company. Cannot recommend to anyone, other than as a stepping stone to find another job."
bad,"They treat you like garbage. No work life balance. No time off. No respect. Pay isn't a living wage. I don't recommend Walmart, especially the Belleville location, at all."
bad,"hate to work there, managers sucks, the people suck, the customers suck. no fairness, work you so much than what they pay you for. always have to ask for master card."
bad,"They don’t care about following the rules. The associates try to mess other areas up  to make you have more work and no one helps each other out, it’s an everyone for themselves situation"
bad,Was sexually harrassed during my time there wasn't given a chance to apply back because store manager thought that I may sue the company because of my experience there which was unfair and discriminating
bad,"When you first start working you might feel welcomed but it won't take long to notice how miserable everyone is. Management is a joke, they're always mad about someone above them so their negative attitude trickles down the ladder effecting everyone. Your personal life means nothing until it gets in the way of work, and then they see you as unreliable and that'll never change. You're better off anywhere else."
bad,"The managers would treat you like some low life. The supervisors, half of them don't have a high school diploma. They do make their coworkers and employees do all the work for them. Even minors were doing jobs they weren't allowed to by state and federal labor laws."
bad,"The worst place I have ever worked, they treat you horrible, disrespect you and expect you to do the work of five people. It's not the same company that Sam Walton created."
bad,"The store I was in specifically was great, but corporate was/is terrible. They refused to work with me when I got sick, and switched my salaried manager so that I would have no support whatsoeverever. 0 stars, would not recommend."
bad,"They fire everyone relentlessly , no sensitivity in the work place. If you do not speak Spanish you will have a hard time . Manager made commands in Spanish , confusing me . Oftentimes she assumed I heard and got upset when I wasn't doing something she asked  but was said in Spanish. Generally Hispanic , they play favoritism."
bad,Management is never satisfied and has favorites amongst the staff who get away with anything and some people who get picked on for everything. Management lies to staff. Management freaks out when there is going to be a store visit by a big wig. They never schedule enough staff and then get upset because everything can’t get done every day.
bad,Management was horrible to thier employees. Not understanding. They dont scedule you then fire you for them messing up. Very stressful enviroment. Every time I went to work my chest gurt from all the stress.
bad,"The bare minimum training received at the beginning of the employment process with vídeos was enjoyable and exciting, but working hands on, in the sales floor with management was a horrible experience, there is no training they expect you to know already what to do with no knowledge what so ever about your department, and then have a member of management come and question you about why nothing has been getting done.. when you do not have a clue to what you are doing .. there was no sense of direction and management is extremely rude and speaks down to you like you are a child! This experience has been the worse management at this facility needs changing immediately.."
bad,when you get your yearly evaluation and they tell you you're in the top assessment you do not get any reward. you do not get a raise. They have more managers than than needed and they don't listen to the grievances anybody has
bad,This Job Is Horrible . You Dnt Want To Work For This Company . They Treat They Employee’s Terrible And Dnt Pay Fair For All The Work You Do . It’s Actually Sick . They Need Better Management Asap
bad,Honestly the only thing they have going for them is the pay but for all the responsibilities I have it isn't worth it. Honestly I do almost the same work as a manger but I'm nowhere compensated for my work.
bad,"If you a job that tries to fire you for going to a funeral, for needing time off for a medical procedure that determines whether or not you have cancer, or for getting very badly injured at work and giving them a note to be excused from the rest of the day FROM THE HOSPITAL,  which they refuse to take and tell you if you go home you’re fired, this is the job for you! Management absolutely does NOT care about any of their employees, unless you somehow become a “favorite”. In that case you can get away with anything. I heard many members of management talking so unprofessionally and rudely about their workers that it almost made my ears bleed. If you get sick you have to file for a medical leave. If you haven’t worked there for a year, it will get denied and you will get fired. Even if you have worked there for a year, unless you were at deaths door, it will probably be denied and you will be fired. If you have an emergency and leave work, you will be fired. If you get a “warning” 3 times, you get fired. (These earnings are often things such as “hey you’re getting coached because you forgot to pick up a piece of cardboard.”) Yup, 3 warnings like that and you’re gone. If you need emergency time off for a funeral, you’re probably getting fired. Just don’t do it. You will never have time off and will be working for a company that does not care about their workers, just the money they are pulling in. The amount of times my husband and I left work crying or fuming in the short 3 months we worked there was astronomical."
bad,They're terrible place to work all around not saying everybody there's the same but mostly they're bad from workers to management not a place to work if you're trying to get ahead n somewhere in life....snakes in the grass over there....
bad,Working at this company is one of the most racist jobs I have ever had they are very disrespectful and they don't care about anything just rude they don't go by your hours
bad,I loved working there in the beginning... However once they think you have bern hooked its all down hill. They dont care if you are sick or not they expect you to come in. Not family oriented at all. They pay no attention to concerns. They are rude and lie to associates and customers
bad,Middle management walks around flexing their muscles in front of all of the employs so they can say Hey… I am superior over you. They offer no positive words which I believe employees need some of that.  I sincerely believe this door will be closed sometime over the next 5 years. I have been in sales and marketing my entire adult life. This store is definitely not going to make it.
bad,wal mart was a bad company i did not like it they did not train help or address issues the workers were unprof and rude and unhappy i did not like the company
bad,"The absolute worst place I’ve ever worked for . No recognition, no advancement, no support, no pay, no help, no anything . You are underpaid, and over worked."
bad,At this location there was a lot of Favoritism going on so much where the boss pick & choose who she wanted to give a Christmas gift to & her favortes got all the morning shifts. We where short staff for at least 2 years so bad were we couldn't take any brakes cause there was not enough people to cover you
bad,No motivation or encouragement and worked to replace full time associate and their benefits.  Hire part time associates where payrate and benefits are cheaper for the company
bad,"I'd understand if you ever had to work here, but would never advise to stay. This is by far is the worst place to work and you'll never feel more miserable."
bad,Management was unfair and used us workers like slaves while they smoked or sat on their phones in the office. I felt as if i could not be sick or i could not miss work without getting fired.
bad,Don’t do it  they treat their employees like trash but want you to work your butt off with barely a kind word to you. You couldn’t pay me any amount of money to go back to that Walmart
bad,Horrible job experience managing is disrespectful and never help. They owe people back pay from checks being wrong and they have yet to receive it.Bad
bad,Moral at store I worked at was very low. Upper management didn't care about people that actually did the labor. Layoff of cashiers to put in pickup and self check was the last straw.
bad,Pointless so so pointless. There is no need for a place that constantly makes u worry if u have a position or not in the end of the day.................
bad,"Worst company ever to work for.  They do not care about you, your family, or your loyalty.  They will terminate you for the smallest mistake.mistakes."
bad,"They say they dont discriminate but the managers and HR certainly do so. I've tried to work at the money center , Walmart .com counter, and a CSM position trying to get promoted and learn more and was passed up and a lot of politics  going on always amongst employees . The environment was toxics at times."
bad,"I hated working for Walmart. I worked there for about 5-6 months. The workload was way too much for one person to handle, your management never supports you, you’re always talked down to, the pay is awful for the work you’re asked to do, and the work-life balance was a joke. Don’t ever consider working here if you value your mental health because, take it from me - this place will drain you. Management plays favorites and if you don’t do every little thing they ask, you’re viewed as the black sheep and will be treated as such. I was promised $11/hr. full-time, but only got paid $9/hr. with 20-25 hr. weeks. But it was still a job, so I took it anyway seeing as I was told within two months, I could move someplace else in the store and make more money that required full-time hours, which was a LIE. I was a lot attendant, so I had to help keep the lot clear of carts (with teammates) and assist customers with carry-outs. Any time your manager needed you to do a carry-out, they would try to reach you on your walkie-talkie but wouldn’t refer to you as your name, but as “stockman”, which used to infuriate me to no end, but whatever. There were no benefits, even though I was told I would receive it. All in all, Walmart is a very dishonest company who should value their employees more and find better management who weren’t racist scumbags. Don’t work here. Don’t work at the Cortland, Ohio Walmart. Trust me."
bad,Poorest management in Wal-Mart. Employees are treated less fair then customers in every situation. No need to say much more. There's a reason that location is the lowest rated store in the district!
bad,"Overall when good managers were still there it was a nice place. But those left to start another job or their own business. The current managers, DM, ADM and the chain goes all the way to CEO and HR, are the worst to deal with. No loyalty to dedicated staff, favoritism is at play at every level of the company."
bad,They just want people that will shut up about the problems they wont fix when I tryed to get management to see the problem they wrote me up and a month later said I haven't improved enough when I had to work harder to make up for the lazy people
bad,"They tried to be flexible, maybe, but I had to fight for it and remind them a lot, too much, and I was in school and they didn't seem to care at all. I was always over worked and expected to do everything on my own of my whole produce department, while coworkers wasted time walking around and talking to other departments. Management allowed employees to get away with laziness, while I was hurting myself and working way to hard, lifting heavy stuff, organizing, everything, all on my own and they didn't care about my struggles, even though I was in school, they wanted me to work even more. It wasn't until I put my two week notice that they finally wanted to do something about the situation."
bad,The work environment was not acceptable. The workers did subpar work and the management would not hire more workers when the previous workers quit there.
bad,"Management was constantly complaining telling us we needed to work faster, and the number of hazards I came across was ridiculous. The pay was decent, but not good enough for all that."
bad,"Frist off your treated like a dog having your supervisor bark orders and time frames to be done by."
bad,"Loved being a technician till the Garden City, ID pharmacy. The pharmasist nitpick and are scared of losing their licenses that they over complicated and put the  of customers at risk. They make the work harder and are rude. One there is verbally abusive and the company will not do anything about it. Stay clear of the Garden City, ID pharmacy."
bad,Tuve muy mala expericiencia en esta compañía y quise ponder un complain y no pude porque no tuve las suficientes pruebas en mi mano para hacerlo.
bad,their attendance is on a point system. you can get fired for having to do impatient at the hospital. it really is messed up. im surprised i dealt with it so long
bad,"To many chiefs not enough Indians, Upper management has no respect for the people they manage have no idea how to communicate between one another,you have 5 different people demanding to do 10 different things..They lead by do as your told, not by example, managment speak to staff members like garbage and provoke a hostile work environment."
bad,Management are bad people they treat their employees like they're underneath them a children and benefits they give them to you and then take them away.
bad,Todo es pésimo y peor en Walmart no tienes vida la gente cree que tiene el poder te fastidian
bad,Worst job ever the supervisors where horrible and little minded I will never ever rate them good they are very rude and messy they show favoritism towards curtain people they never helped me when I needed their help they always had a bad attitude just not good job to work at the job was easy but the people made it hard
bad,"CSM's have attitudes.  They don't treat employees with respect, nor do they care about us.  They don't give employee discounts for groceries anymore. The management/CSMs don't communicate with employees unless they are giving attitude. They make it very difficult to be happy at work. I love to help people but the management take away all positivity the employees have to offer."
bad,I feel stressed. I feel like the company is moving to be like Walgreens. There is no stability. They continue to change things and I feel like I have worked hard thinking things are gonna change for the better but it just keeps getting worse and worse.
bad,Má organização da empresa e falta de respeito dos superiores com os funcionários. Pessoas difíceis no ambiente de trabalho e desorganização na parte administrativa e do recursos humanos.
bad,I think this company used to be great. But however working for this company leaves slot to be desired by the employee. The hour are bad the pay is bad. There is no advancement these days. The management  needs to be improved. And they do not care about employees or there families.
bad,Walmart jobs are there but management is not they will find a way to fire you even if they half to make one up they act like they are the police and want to be nothing more and think everyone is out to get them
bad,Didn't like working there at all. They make it impossible for single parents. Fired me for calling out because my children were both in the hospital sick.
bad,"Shady business practices to say the least. I had my hours cut the week I hit 90 days so I no longer qualified for medical. (I'm type one diabetic) After asking if I could get released from the rest of my shift (about 2 hours) because I was having a nervous breakdown after losing my little brother a week earlier, they told me to take 10 minutes then get back to work. Politics and favoritism is how I would describe working there. The harder you work, the more they will abuse you there."
bad,Walmart does not care about their employees. If you get sick and have to take an absence they’ll point you even with a doctors note. They don’t help their employees during shifts.
bad,"They do not adhere to schedules.  They change schedules without notice.  They do not adhere to company policies, ""they"" are management, doesn't matter what corporate policy is."
bad,"They expect way to mu, h out of their employees and u r treated horribly bad. Management was horrible"
bad,I would not recommend a job at Walmart to my worst worst worst enemy!!! They lure you in with high hopes and once your hired they start treating you like s***! They show no respect for anyone and there is no open door. There never was. All lies. They are very deceitful. Don't fall for them. The truth be told if it's too good to be true it's because it isn't.
bad,If I lose my county job and Walmart is the only place hiring. I’ll live in my car under a bridge instead. I would work back at McDonald’s before going back to Walmart.
bad,You can grow fast but you have no life. Management just keeps adding more and more tasks every day. You end up working as if you were salaried even though they pay you by the hour.
bad,High turn over. No respect. You will get treated like nothing. People who dont work or play by the rules get treated better then the people who work hard
bad,Worst place to work over the past year. Needs much improvement on both management and corporate decisions. This company is headed in the wrong direction.
bad,Walmart was fun but I had to leave because I found a better job for me. Walmart was a great experience. I honestly feel like I would have. Stayed there but the pay was better at my new job and I needed the money .
bad,"This job is easy to get yeah, but it also stress filled and all the management with treat you like poo. I hope the people that work there know how much they are worth because they aren’t treated well"
bad,"My time here was awful, I worked at the Naperville, IL location off Route 59. The store manager was awful, he refused to okay orders until things were done his way. WHICH left the store severely under stocked or overstocked in products not used. I worked in the Deli department and that was terrible because there was so much inconsistency and no one ever knew what to do. The store manager did not listen to us who actually work the counter but instead pushed his agenda with threats and bullying. Our department managers were awful as well, ridiculing employees and too often not assisting us with orders and serving food. On top of that when we would overhead for other managers to come help no one would come until 20+min later but by then we didn't need their help. I had to go on early maternity leave due to be forced to lift heavy boxes (mind you these are filled with meat), stock freezers, wash equipment for cooking, changing the oil in the fryers and pushing heavy loads to my area to restock. Walmart does not care about their employees but cares about money. You as an employee are expendable, your handwork does not matter and your ideas to better your department are ridiculous."
bad,HORRIBLE place to work they don’t care about you as a human being they don’t care if your dying your still obligated to meet production which is impossible they hire supervisors that don’t have no experience what so ever in the position
bad,"Picking up orders online, racist and sexist manager gave everyone a hard time in the company and happened to be the manager I had to deal with. Overall very stressful."
bad,"The worst work experience in 40 years "
bad,Management at Walmart cares about no one but themselves. They look for ways to make themselves look good while over working their employees. You the employee are last in the bottom
bad,the management was poor and I was not payed properly for the amount of hours I worked. the people I was assigned to work with had bad attatudes and refused to try and be friendly.
bad,This is absolutely the worst company to work for. I would not recommend anyone to work for this company. To many changes that does not benefit the worker.
bad,"Overall, the company does not put employees at the top of the priority list.  You will be on your feet 8 hours per day with 1 hour for lunch. Back room operations are almost unbearable (hot) in the summer."
bad,"Managers didnt really care that much. they were there to collect a paycheck just like everyone else there. We got paid decent for the work, but it got very repetitive over the time that i was there and got very draggy in the day to day activities."
bad,The management treat you like a slave for example my manager came in one week before Christmas and cut our hours ruining Christmas our store manager talks to you like he owns you!
bad,Their point system sucks. Least understanding company I’ve ever worked for; they don’t accept doctor’s notes for any circumstances. I’m pregnant and lose a point everytime I’m sick and need to leave or have a doctors appointment.
bad,Ao meu ver a empresa poderia se mais compreensiva.
bad,"Worst job ever, I do not recommend working here If you want a decent pay and to actually get 40 hours per work. Also management is terrible there. I do not recommend."
bad,Dont work in the pharmacy at Walmart. The managment sucks they need more help than they have and its unorganized. The manager himself balaam is nice but he doesn't realize he needs to hire more people.
bad,A terrible place to work without a chance to advance. Managment are useless and the job has no perks to speak of. This company sell nothing made in USA but they brag because it's a USA based company.
bad,Will work you to death cuts hours alot have poor mangment and alot of work drama thats really unprofessional but the customer are grate and that what makes the job a little bit worth it
bad,Don’t ever expect your family life to be more important than your job while working for Walmart.Working at Walmart is a soap opera.Everybody talks behind everyone’s back
bad,"Greedy management looking to fill their personal pockets by finding ways to cut the employee's  bonus short.  "
bad,I am a front end Cashier and management can care less about you. They do not know how to micro manage at all. You are always disciplined on what you do wrong. You are never recognized for a great job you are doing. If there are any changes with procedures you are not advised by your managment and you are disciplined for not doing your job correctly. They do not give your breaks or lunches on time.
bad,"I hate working here. We are always under staffed, there is not enough people to get done what needs to get done and management acts oblivious to that fact."
bad,No compassion whatsoever for the associates that have family. This company says its all about family well its not they only think about this company its what comes first not your family.
bad,"No hours for competitive pay"
bad,"The managers are slow and nothing really gets done without you having to constantly ask them to do it. Also, you get little to no benefits............"
bad,Some managers were great but some were all for themselves and not for associates.  It was them against the store.  They lowered the morale of the total store where the associates didn’t want to be there then these managers get hired into higher positions.  It was a joke .
bad,This place takes your soul chews it up and spits out a husk of your former self. I highly discourage anyone from working here. That's why they put all the new people upfront to interact with people because they know the ones that have been there a while no longer have a filter.
bad,Just another big business company that doesnt care about the employees. Management is careless and puts all the work on the hourly associates yet takes all the credit. Always understaffed and working multiple positions at a time with no compensation. NOT WORTH THE STRESS
bad,they simply don't care about there people. all they care about is there money. you could be laying in the floor with dyeing and they wouldn't care at all!
bad,management and supervisors pick favorites and break several health codes even if you make them aware. All coworkers hated the job and only stayed for the paycheck
bad,Most unappreciative place to work! Horrible Attitude! Rampant Favortism! Customer is Never right! Cannot trust or rely on managers or fellow coworkers! DRAMA CENTRAL DAILY!!!
bad,"No benefits, labor exploitation, no flexibility, no full time."
bad,"It is by far the worst company anyone would ever apply to. A lot of people see it as a last resort and that’s only because they don’t know their options. If I would suggest anything while applying there, force management to be better"
bad,"Everyday is another mess that someone else created that no matter how hard you try to fix it it just continues to get worse without any help from others, it's full of nonsensical issues that should not exist but do."
bad,Did not enjoy working here. They ask too much out of one person that its ridiculous. I would not recommend this job to anyone unless it's the only job you can get
bad,Very rude and play favoritism and racists. Don't resolve issues try to hide them. When complaint  wasn't resolved and told to wait 3 months to see changes
bad,This company treats their employees horribly I would not recommend working here. They expect you to do the work of 3 to 4 people and when you don't you get in trouble. We are constantly understaffed and the point system allows people to consistently call in leaving you high and dry when it is important to have people there.
bad,"We are quite frequently understaffed, we are asked to leave early rather than receive overtime.  Management is not supportive or understanding.  They cater to younger people and the older people that show up to work on time and with consistency are treated like trash.  While you are not directly scrutinized they are passive aggressive in their ""just do your best philosophy."""
bad,Walmart will work you like a dog. Tell you to not put your heart in the job. They don't care how much they work you they don't give you proper breaks with make you work through your lunch but still make u punch out. They are a cut throat company. Work hard for them with low pay. I hope you don't have a family because u will not see them much Walmart is your family.
bad,N/A Not the best company to work for. Not family oriented. I wouldn't work there ever again. I wouldn't recommend anyone of my family nor friends to work there. And the pay sucks
bad,"The company is good. However, the management is the problem who runs the business.  They do not have enough staffs to the point that they will make you fill in the vacant position do a while.  Selective"
bad,Walmart only looks out for Walmart. I have seen many people get fired due to illness or injury outside of work. They expect the impossible from all employees and take no logical reasoning as to why their impossible task wasnt achieved.
bad,"worst job i’ve ever had, people are rude and no one helps the management is awful and they don’t do anything "
bad,It was the worst company i ever worked for i mean i liked my job it was just the back stabbing management an store boss that was wat made it a bad experience to work there
bad,"They treat associates like garbage they are not helpful with anything, they do not train you when you first start. They are not flexible with anything"
bad,Always getting picked on and was never appreciated by anyone they had favoritism for certain workers and got fired for going to a funeral but forgot to call in so I understand the situation on that.
bad,As an example to my summary even if you came in on time and got right to work. If my coworker didn't show up for work or was late it was my job to try and pick up the slack with no help. I was threatened on a daily basis that I would be written up if I didn't get the job done fast and more effective when doing a two man job by my self without the right equipment to do said job.
bad,"They do not care about their employees. They want work horses. Family doesn't matter to them. No fairness in money, hours or anything they are very greedy. No pay for holidays unless you use your sick or vacation time."
bad,"You die a little bit inside every shift. The managers don't care about you. If someone dies, too bad, you could lose your job. If you're sick, oh well, don't even bother with a doctor's note. They won't accept it."
bad,"I got hurt while working there, had to have surgery and to the date they haven't let me fill out the paperwork to file a claim. It's been 2 months. They took my number out of the system put it on their phones and text me work related stuff both on and off the clock."
bad,The managers were HORRIBLE! the store manager was very rude to employees and managers. she threatened them. all the managers there shouldn't even be managers thy are so rude and unprofessional. working there was so miserable. I hated going to work everyday for 2 years.
bad,"Walmart only cares about how much money they make, not about their employees."
bad,"If an Associate has an issue with you and you are reported to Management, Walmart will only get one side of the story and not allow you to defend yourself if a charge is leveled against you. Associates can say whatever they want about other associates and you will never know who said what, why, where or when. Very unfair. I would never work for them again."
bad,The managers wasn't solving any situations I had.They nvr was around n the store.When you call them on the walkie no 1 awnser until 5 to 10 min later.
bad,The will load was crushing people and they just kept piling it on. They really didn't care. The more managers fired and wrote people up the more they succeeded. That's no culture to be part of.
bad,They are one of the worst companies I ever worked for! Their benefits suck I’m in debt 4300.00 from medical alone their deductible alone is 6000.00 for a single person I can only imagine for a family! Management violated my privacy by telling the associate I was complaining about . I was sworn at by an assistant manager! I could go on and on ! In all a really terrible work environment!
bad,"Do not work at the levittown location. The managers are terrible.  Accept for some of the c s m ... The customers omg... the store is terrible.  Not enough staff, so they over work the little bit of staff they have.. no room for advancing unless your kiss butt..."
bad,Place sucks! Worst ware house I've ever worked at just horrible they're not the greatest  they're bleep  holes. U also had snitches. If you was to get hurt they treat u even more  like 💩 Anybody that goes here you'll find out soon how they are.
bad,"Walmart trains you on how to treat customers, then allow their GM's to cuss at you while you are trying to treat Walmart customers with dignity and niceness."
bad,They lied about a lot of stuff just to get you to want to work there and when it is really bad weather outside they do not care about the safety of their workers
bad,"I started this job to get me out of the house and make a little money.  After a year of employment and a new team of managers coming in, it is not a happy place to work. The new manager team doesn't listen to anyone. What they say goes without any helpful concerns from employees.  They are definitely NOT team players"
bad,"Very bad place to work, no training, no appreciation, the work isn’t hard but it’s the way management treats you, very bad, no incentive to work there, modern day slavery, the only people that can work there are the poor foreigners that don’t know we are not suppose to be treated this way"
bad,"When I first got hired I told them I would prefer to work nights, so they put me on nights, but over time they started scheduling me during the day. When I complained about it and reiterated my choice I was basically told that no one gets to choose their schedule and I would have to accept what they gave me. Management was part of the problem because they didn't care. Often times they'd be in a back room messing around and not answering pages for help. They don't pay you enough to deal with what you have to deal with either."
bad,Working for this company is an absolute joke . Customer service management is garbage and have no respect for the people under them. You hardly ever get help and when you fall behind due to coworkers being absent they still take it out on you. However now that I have been gone from this trash company for almost a year I am doing so much better. Leaving this company was the best decision I ever made and I would recommend Any other job over this one.
bad,There is no work life balance. Your life is Walmart. It is a popularity contest if upper management doesn't like you you will be out! The harder you work the less the recognize you so don't bother to give any more than you have to.
bad,"Walmart In Many LA, had it days where it could be good days and also where it could be bad days. "
bad,"Working at Walmart is so depressing, the customers treat you horribly. The managers only want the customers to be happy. They will always pick customers over you. The work hours are very flexible but the call out rules are ridiculous ."
bad,Employees are not treated with respect or with understanding   Your work n efforts are dismissive needed days for doctors appointments or death in your family are penalized
bad,Just don't do it not fair at all to the women at the workplace . If you want to move up just don't work hard because the one's that work hard never move up in the company
bad,"I feel bad for the people who work at Walmart, after 13 years with Walmart I have seen it all! Treat there older employees like trash! Terrible company to work for! I can’t even shop there! Poor employees company should be a shamed of them selves.."
bad,Walmart is by far the worst place I've ever worked and I have worked at a trash dump for minimum wage. I still have not recovered from the mental anguish that was inflicted during my employment.
bad,"Bad place to work, no time for family, poor pay, too much stress, no work life balance, long days or nights depending on which shift you work on, bad schedule."
bad,I worked for Walmart for 15 years and suddenly they started bringing in new managers that were just plain hateful. They never appreciated the people that were willing to stay overtime and do extra work when others didn’t come in. I was a donut maker but often bread bakers never showed up so I did both jobs without waiting to be told to. I helped the department manager fill the floor too.
bad,This company dose notcare about the employees and when you open door stff they do not listen to you or even attemt to fix the problem. I will not go backto a company that dose not care for thier emplyees
bad,"The management does nothing constructive except cashier. They micromanage their employees, threaten their livelihoods, they do not let their employees take lunches until six and a half hours into their shift which is gross management. The other employees hate their job and expect you to quit within a matter of days!"
bad,"Walmart doesn't give two s*hits about their employees, as long as they're getting a sale. I would never do it again. If you're thinking about working at Walmart, think again. If I had the choice I wouldn't even shop there."
bad,To make sure you go in with a mindset you are there temporarily.  Do not plan on this being a career.  Beware of the slackers and hard work for little pay.
bad,Walmart is all about money. They promote who they want not who deserves it. Their stores are very dirty. Managment does not care about the departments they are over. You do not get the support like they claim
bad,I was with the company for 4 years and I have to say it has probably been one of the worst jobs I’ve had. There is no chance of moving up the ladder and furthering your career there unless you are a managers pet. The management is awful they do not care about there employees ball they care about is making a buck. And there taking all jobs away before long there won’t be any employees at all
bad,I hated working for this company especially after the summer ended. We are also doing the work of two pharmacies put together with lack of help. My Pharmacist/Manager would always say about how he has people lined up for interviews to get in and help but that never happened. They are all talk there and I cannot stand any of that. Too much drama and not enough team work. If you also stand up for yourself you get written up.
bad,"Please do not join, Culture is toxic and very political driven.Not at all women friendly. People expect you to work on weekends also and leaves are also not easily available."
bad,I thought that working for Walmart was terrible. Never felt like I was appreciated. Always had to do someone else’s job. When I was just a sales associate they would make us go up to check people out and cashiers made more money how rude is that.
bad,They dont care if you're sick with the flu or s fever you'll get a mark for not coming to work or even if you have to leave for medical reasons during your shift they'll give you a mark
bad,I despised working here. There was no training done by a manager. Instead I was trained by a coworker who had the most experience. There was no incentive to work to my fullest because there was no feedback unless it was negative. They accused me of doing something I didn't do and fired me for it. I hate this company and corporation.
bad,Lots of personal reasons & very rude managers in Lockhart Texas they are very good at picking the ones who get away with things and picking the lines who don’t . I wouldn’t recommend being a cashier for Lockhart Walmart .
bad,"I’d rather not elaborate further in fear of retaliation "
bad,Working at Middletown Walmart was a headache and a bad time.The managers are Extremely rude they like to talk down to the employees n have no respect or support for anyone. This is a horrible place to work for. Oooo n biggg time liars don’t believe a word they say.
bad,They are horrible company to work for  and the bosses are horrible as well they don’t care about anybody or  anything but them self and when u are sick or Injured they don’t care
bad,Management would gossip and show favoritism and also complain about the task achieved perfectly everyday given to us at the same time and complained about other shift associates work we would clean after and finish while not communicating at all with other management. Open door situation with management at least two or three times once with me and also only received two bonuses in my whole work experienced due to many reasons given by management. Horrible schedule flexibility using fear of less hours of work to get employees to have specified schedules and more.
bad,"The managers were firing everyone, with no reason at all. it felt very odd working here.  the managers were always always on your back. it didn't felt comfortable."
bad,What I learn at work is how to respect others and I learn how to stack things on the shelf the right way and be respectful to ever person that walks in the store
bad,"The Walmart I worked at was very unorganized and all over the place, they made a cashier on one of the busiest days  of the year without training. It was awful."
bad,"This company and its store managers don't respect their workers.   Working for Walmart is a soul-crushing grind.   You will work holidays, and you will be lucky to  get two days off consecutively  each week.  It is hard to get full-time hours these days, but what a treat  if you can!  You will be miserable here.   Don't do this to yourself.  You must live!  Live !"
bad,Management dont care when you can or cannot work...they schedule you for whenever and expect you to find coverage for days you weren't available. All about speed and getting Mastercards not about the customer.
bad,Set you up to fire you. Clicking place. Don't work there. Boss are bullies. Do not get enough hours. If you are sick and work anyway they don't appreciate it. You have certain amount of sick hours and you are fired. Not family friendly.
bad,"Walmart uses unfair working  conditions. "
bad,"This place is not a good place to work at. Management is rude and not organized, play favorites with other employees. They don't value their employees and write you up for stupid reasons."
bad,Bad management so unprofessional the customers were hella rude just like my managers waaaaaay to much stuff you to go on I am happy I left because that walmart was waaaaay tooo much
bad,"While working there, I identified as male and asked management to use my preferred pronouns and name. Not once did they do so.  I also had to repeatedly do manager's work for them. After they saw I was better at zoning than most people, they started only half-finishing tasks, then asking me to fix it, taking me away from my designated work station and making me fall behind."
bad,No respect for the employees AT ALL. Some Department Managers are equally abused. Walmart has lost the heart & soul of what Walmart was meant to be. I understand it has to be profitable but what about the customers that USED TO ENJOYshopping there? I can not count how many customers have complained about how depressing it is to see associates not smiling or happy. Way to go CORPORATE  keep up the awesome work...gcorporate
bad,Walmart managers are the main reason the turn over rate is high . They are bullies and very much will put others down and coach you say how they are right regardless and there is something wrong with you.  Because you not letting them fuss you out more importantly not respect you
bad,Do not work here.  They work you to the bone and they don’t care.  I was part time and was still asked to do over 40 hours a week with zero benefits. Bad company
bad,"Management doesn't really care about their employees, the hours and pay are very irregular and you can't have a quality family life around it. They try to find any and every reason to write you up."
bad,"I am not going to Bad Mouth Walmart, but they have issues.  If you like watching ""The View,""  then Walmart is your Dream Job in Reality.  I am not making this up.  I worked there for 10 years, and am grateful for that time.  By working there I dug my way back up from almost declaring Bankruptcy.  Walmart was good to me in that I had employment and paid off my debts.  Walmart and it's Management/PC PR Ideaologies made me earn every penny.  EVERY PENNY...  I did not love the job, but the wonderful people I was around for the most part.  Walmart Customers and Associates can contribute to much daily happiness and helping to forget the Negative Issues.  Walmart has changed too much since I was first hired and not for the good.  My basis for leaving is that I am simply done with the Political Correct & Public Relations Ideaologies of the Passive Aggressive Women and Male Eunuchs who run the company.  It's NOT WORTH IT..!"
bad,The only reason I stayed was I needed a job. Don't bother trying to stay here as long as I did. Skylights gave me migraines and the management is awful.
bad,"Changing company structure of operation. Most stressful place I ever worked. Management doesn't support crew members. Doing the job fast, and cheap is all they are interested in. Not right. Terrible produce is the result."
bad,Tyrannical in the sense that i wasnt allowed to listen to my music or watch a movie on my half hour break. Non paid. And the manager would yell at me every night. He wouldnt explain too me how to use the heavy machine equipment hed just hand a 400 pound cleaning machine too me. And say use this on the floors. I  hhad to figure out the equipment
bad,"Ignored education...to many foreigners who felt they were entitled...poor health insurance...to customer service oriented...poor security-customers just walked out with merchandise.."
bad,"I'f I could rate Walmart a 0, I would. It was one of the most mentally and emotionally draining jobs I've ever done. The management did not care about the associates and were unrealistic in their demands in productivity in relation to the amount of associates we had to do those tasks. When we didn't finish a task, It didn't matter if the task took more hours then we had people, we were still looked down on for not finishing. I was personally talked down to, as were other individuals, because of unrealistic productivity goals. The benefits were non existent. It took too long to build up PTO (in my case roughly took 1 month just to have 8 hours worth of PTO), so like most people I had do use occurrences, which punishes the associate when it comes to bonus time. If you had occurrences or points on your record, the bonus you rightfully earned was deducted. After they changed the was bonuses were given out, I never received a bonus do to absences from illness. The worst part was definitely the management. We had a manager that associates had tried and tried again to complain about to the higher ups because of the way that her treated the associates. Nothing was ever done about it and the abuse continued. When shift change came, none of the shifts wanted him and argued about which shift was forced to take him. We ended up with him again. Because of this certain person we have had good managers either change stores or positions just to avoid him. We lost all our good managers and ended up losing a majority of our staff because no one could handle working with just him as manager. He"
bad,"I worked here for nearly 4 months and at the end of it, literally every single person I had on my team was either fired or quit because of how horrible the work environment was. The supervisors were complete know-it-all types, as if their job was helping to change the world or something which is a complete joke. The employees are mostly incapable elderly folks complaining about their aching bones, a few 20 years that act like complete jerks and to top it all off, the management is absolutely atrocious. They’re the most useless workers their, doing absolutely nothing but screwing employees over and constantly complaining about how things need to be done within a very specific time frame. "
bad,the hours weren't that great and some of the management i met while working there were rude and not helpful when i had questions. I don't know if it was just my department or what but it was not a great work environment.
bad,"Managers are lazy, they burn and abuse the good employees and turn around and praise the ones that don’t do anything. If you are a hard worker and have amazing work ethic, this is not the place for you. They will terminate you once you start to get burnt out and show a little slack. Your worst could be everyone’s best and you will still get dumped on. Pay increases of 10 cents annually for your hard work. Fake promises."
bad,They don't carre about you being a human and having feelings.this was the most stressful job I ever had and not because of the customers becuz of my managers /supervisors. All woman who have attitudes 24/7 and have these huge ego's that they are better than you. I hated every day coming to work. #mentalhealthisworthmorethan$11/hr
bad,"no skills,,sad nday at work always disrespected never no training. power hungry no respect for the individual...people skills is very bad..no training programs"
bad,I worked for the baldwin park location for 4 years with no problems. In 2018 new management was EXTREMELY RUDE and disrestectful. The management is very vindictive. If you don't do what they want they WILL tamper with your hours. Management has no structure and seriously unprofessional.
bad,Cant say i liked the place or the company. Of course you will always meet people you like which makes working there a bit better. My experience was all over the place. I had a manager who pulled me into a meeting to curse at me infront of his night crew to my supervisor commuting suicide. People always yelling at you no matter how good you do. I would say this place would be great for you if you have no where else to go and want to move up in a company that doesn't care as long as you can make them money.
bad,Over all during the 5 months I was there the schedule was terrible. They don’t respect your availability and the CMS are terrible when it comes to training new employees. Great place to shop at lossy place to work.
bad,"Do drive for walmart ""spark"".  I have been working for them since they launched in sioux falls, sd.  The manager named shawn at the louise store location is a hoax and the grocery orders department are a bunch of lazy liars."
bad,"Lack of leadership. Everyone has the book, but no one is reading off the same page.  To top it off, the store manager threw his book away and does it his way even against reginal marketing managers advice. I was on cap team one fresh area. Time given to complete task was insufficient, often short staff. Continuously cutting back hours, no employee can survive on 16 hours a week  I worked there for 14 years and 99% of the time received 32 hrs per week. When you attempt to talk with management, it is corporates fault. I would have never quit if they hard not shortened my hours This is not coming from non-performing employee, I had 14 years of exceeds evaluations."
bad,Management does not follow the protocols that headquarters mandates. The only thing that they care about is their profit margins and not the employees.
bad,"They over work you as a slave n always threatening to fire you, no matter how much effort you put into it's never good enough,  favoritism and racism is still alive here. I hate this environment. Now they're automated every position n no one is talking about it but Andrew  Yag 2020"
bad,"Working at Walmart is a joke. They are always severely understaffed and the remaining workers are meant to pick up the slack. When the tasks cannot all be completed because of the lack of staff, everyone suffers. The attendance policy, management, corporate, everything is terrible."
bad,Walmart has no benefits for their employees who have stuck with the company for 10 years or more they treat you just like you are a new employee.with no benefits no pto time.holidays no time with family.I never get to spend time with my family on that holidays ever but christmas.that sucks if you have small children .
bad,"Great place to work at, but the management team could use some help. Great benefits when they kick in, and the policies do allow you to work around your life."
bad,Ever since I started working at Walmart it has been nothing but drama. I tried to go I’m and do my job and leave and it just wasn’t good enough. No matter what.
bad,"as easy as the task of cashiering is, this job has made it unbearable. the customers are extremely unhappy with everything that goes on so they often will vent to the cashiers as if we have any authority here. The customer service managers are all girlfriends and chitchat and gossip while you may have gone over the lawful time to work without a lunch or break. they pay no mind to you or your needs but expect you to go above and beyond for them"
bad,I don’t have very much to review about Walmart. In all honesty it was very unorganized and management was very unfair. I applied as cashier and they demanded me to me in different departments
bad,"I had been with the company for several years. I was not treated well by the company the entire time I worked there. My last position was assistant manager. I was screamed and yelled at so often that I started having panic attacks at work. We never had enough people to do the tasks that were given. We were given tasks each day that had to be done that would not allow us to complete our regular duties. it was a loose loose situation every day.  Always fearing loosing my job. no matter how hard I worked. Their is an open door policy in place to report abuse. It was hit or miss. Sometimes an issue was taken care of. Most of the time it wasn't , and the abuse would continue."
bad,When I worked at walmart I was doing managers job and never got moved up or a raise that's why I left hours were bad also. Was working bother electronics and wireless.
bad,"I honestly feel like I've wasted 11 good years of my life on this company. They took holiday pay, there's no overtime, and the pay is definitely not equal to the level of work they expect. They dont follow company guidelines. Also, they have no concern or care for the workers."
bad,"DO NOT WORK AT WALMART! They continue to increase the workload on its employee's while offering NO BENEFITS , INCENTIVES, OR HOLIDAY PAY. I'm part time and work in the evenings and my lazy, power tripping, sorry excuse for a department manager leaves the majority of the workload for me to do. I am required to zone and put up stock for shoes and jewelry, pierce ears, change watch batteries AND cover apparel and fabrics/crafts if no one is scheduled or on a lunch break. I've been to management twice in regards to my department manager and nothing has been done. She feels I'm her peasant/slave and that its my job to pick up her slack. I'm an efficient, organized and hard-working employee and I nor do other good employees deserve this juvenile foolishness from a whiny brat who should not have been in a management position in the first place. Scheduling sucks and changes to frequently without notice and everybody is two-faced. The veteran workers are nothing but a bunch of bitter old gossiping hags that are mad they stayed at Walmart for all these years. Don't let desperation get the best of you like it did with me, keep looking for a job and never settle for Walmart. NEVER!"
bad,I wouldn't recommend working at Walmart as an unloader. Pay is not worth the hazordous  work and long hours sucks. This company under appreciates it's workers.
bad,"Would give 0 stars if it was possible. Walmart is a corrupt corporation who that has no respect for employees and treats them like property. My manager was fine until he was replaced with someone who was rude, insensitive and did not understand how my job worked at all. There is more but I'll keep it short and sweet. Avoid Walmart at all costs."
bad,"walmart doesn't care about the associates or the customers.  all they care about is getting money.  they have taken away benefits from us and   "
bad,"it was nasty, the management was unfair one sided and do not care about their employees. its not nothing to talk or explain about the job no one like working their the customers always come and show disrespect."
bad,"Management only cares about their selves , most the time managers forget to correct something you remind them of 6 times , schedules constantly changes one day off 5 days off and if your in the deli its excruciatingly exhausting ,day crew dont do anything to help"
bad,"The warehouse was super dirty at all times. The management advocated cleanliness and never actually cleaned or had anyone clean. everyone did the bare minimum, except for the people  who have to pick up their slack. they pay you a lot to keep your mouth closed about the terrible work environment and then will fire you when you question them. lots of the employees are openly heavy drug users to get though the job. management was accepting 'favors' from females that did not want to work as hard. HR is in on all the drama because they used to be in the warehouse and so they protect people who have friendships there."
bad,The people that work there have cliques. It was  a terrible uncomfortable experience. Moving up was impossible unless you were included in the cliques.
bad,Store manager that is unstable yell throw things treat people poorly fire exits broken doors in receiving broke for weeks when asked for training told no ask for help told no ask for days off given hard time family members die and hard time given
bad,"Discriminates against women, unless you happen to be sleeping the management. Unfair, inconsistent, filled with harrasment, and all around bad management.  If you want to be treated poorly, apply here."
bad,"it was okay. was cash, not the best people working for that company where the location is at. could have better managers and more hours available. it was s decent place"
bad,They will tell you in a orientation that you will get recognized for your hard work. I worked basically by myself this year in layaway and not one time did they say thank you or you done a great job or anything. Matter of fact they made me feel like they waited til layaway over and started cutting my hours and it’s a horrible place to work at. I want out of there and get a job who will appreciate and see how hard working I am
bad,I work very hard to move up in the company and 3 years  turning there backs on improvement for me. It was very stressful. No communication between managers. No teamwork.
bad,Do not work here be aware. Not a good company to work for. The hours are not flexible and the managers are terrible. The cashier managers are very rude and mean and they get an attitude when you ask for help
bad,"I loved my job the first couple of months but as i was working there i come to realize that there is no respect, organization, leadership, help or anything you need to succeed. You have to figure out how to do everything yourself."
bad,"This is the worse job I have ever had. Management is a joke. Unless you are a bosses pet, you will get treated very badly. I do not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"Non caring, DISRESPECTFUL, intimidating, partiality, overwhelming, overworked, disorganized, power stricken and a DISCOURTEOUS company!!! They have a task master that they put forth towards associates that themselves can't do!!! I haven't gotten a decent raise in about 3yrs."
bad,"Management has their favorites. They say there are many opportunities to move up or even to different departments, but unless you are the favorite you're stuck and treated badly. The harder you work the more they take advantage. They don't care about the employees. I've never had a job where almost every employee hates their job. The good part is some employees and customers are really nice.  Helps get through the day."
bad,ambiente laboral muy tenso desde que llego la nueva administración  los colaboradores trabajan con miedo no respeto hay acoso laboral se trata muchas veces con malas palabras a las personas se les llama la atención  adelante de los clientes en los pasillos sin importar quien escuche  muchas veces por radio con gritos los trabajadores están muy estresados    .ni los tiempos de colación los respetan muchas veces
bad,"This job was okay with me, but one month into the job came down to a sever hand injury that occurd outside of work and missed to many days and in result I had to be terminated."
bad,"They work you to death, then talk s*!* when you cant continue to work after you die. Management is awful, dont waste your life working at Walmart....."
bad,"The other team members are great, the job is easy, the management sucks. They don't treat you fairly, they seem to care about you and then go behind your back to another associate. The benefits are decent, but the amount of work they want done in day with a limited amount of people and hours is insane, they should at least give us a raise or say thank you to us who work hard."
bad,Treat you terrible.  Work all holidays and we're even talking about a one time on Christmas.  Treat the new employee s better than the few idiots that stick around and put up with them . Bad turnover.
bad,gente prepotente jefes y gerente groseros despotas no recomiendo trabajar alli a nadie mal lugar gerentes prepotentes gritan a los empleados y los amenazan salario miserable de lo peor ...
bad,Management has been the same management on ledo everyone is likely related or are best buds treat associates like dogs and will find absolute anything to get u out of there!! if they feel like u are too good of a worker u could take their position so if u are a new associate LMAO definitely no moving up!! So they will find any little thing to fire u or will give u a reason to quit by giving you no days on schedule to working u 10 days consecutively no off day in between!!
bad,I hate this job because it’s the deli. And the location is far from where I live. My managers pick favorites and I’m not one of them. Plan on working long hours for 11 an hour.
bad,I dont know who is reading this but all I can say is I've given 8 years at Walmart haven't moved up at all and I have gone above and beyond the company's expectations and its gotten me nowhere I realize Walmart has been nothing but a waste of time and money because I really dont make any or enough to get by.
bad,"Pesimo servicio, la verdad. Son megreros a mas no poder"
bad,Over the time I worked there the yearly review and raise scale didn't really do much to encourage outstanding performance and that got worse over time. If you are aiming to be management be ready to teach yourself fast.
bad,They act like your friend but will turn on you so fast to coa. For the most part the associates are good and nice people and a few of the managers are friendly but there are a few who everyone dislikes at this store
bad,"no leniancy even when it comes to sick children or family. work every weekend. unorganized, rude to customers regularly. lead pharmacist often checks things off without actually checking them."
bad,The management team are a joke and does not care about there employees at all it's all about them...  don't know how to staff employees at all.would love to fire all of corporate people.
bad,They fired me cause my cousin had passed after a drunk drive went head on with his car that same week I week to work everyday but when I called in to go to his funeral and burial I was bashed for it from management and fired cause I accumulated to many points with out the knowledge of me getting that many points. Walmart store 3763 is cruel and careless
bad,"Over worked , under paid , under staff , racist , discriminatory,  fail to communicate with associates about policy work changes , I would not recommend this employer to anyone,  not even my dog ."
bad,"they pay u very bad for all the tasks u do. managers only care about themselves. underpaid and over worked its pathetic. this company makes so much money but rather give it all to the investors rather than the people that are paid so badly for them to keep their ""low prices"" lol smh"
bad,"Employees are not valued. There is almost 0 chance of progression. They will keep your hours below 40 a week to ensure you are not a full time employee, upper management will make you cut hours if you go above 32 even if it is management approved,  and they will find ways of how to cheat you out of your quarterly bonus. No self respecting individual will work at Wal-Mart."
bad,If you work for Walmart you're pretty much asking to be mistreated and they  will almost always make sure you fail at your job and they will do their best to fire you after 6 months most of the bosses are sexist and racist and for the most part only care about them selfs
bad,Management have no respect for the individual or compassion. It is all about money not about the people ( guests or employees. Unless you are upper management pets
bad,"Started at Super Center in deli. Promised I wld never close. Had to become a closer. Riding a bicycle home late night on a dangerous route. Was wrote up 3 times in a week, twice for not taking an unscheduled lunch and once because I didn't do something I was never trained for. Almost fired after being hit by a car and missing work. Transferred to Neighborhood Market as over night stocker. Then entire crew forced to days, with customer service being priority over stocking. Still expected to do our job along with added responsibilities and a pay cut of 50 cents/hr. All were guaranteed a preferred shift/position/transfer. Only 2 ppl got it. Everyone quit or got fired within 3 months after I quit, even the assistant store manager that wouldn't not find me a replacement.  I walked out when they cut everyones schedule by a full day per week and expected us to still get everytbing done even with a .ajor cut in labor power."
bad,"Terrible place to have to work. No raises,cut hours so manager can make his bonus,no work to life balance,nobody there is happy,you are tasked with more work than you can ever get done on one shift.....stay FAR FAR FAR AWAY!!"
bad,"No work life balance."
bad,Its sad because walmart does not appreciate the people who actually do their jobs and work hard.... They put money hungry rude people at the top of their prioritie list. Us bottom people who take pride in our work n give it our all aint nothing
bad,"Upper management doesnt appreciate the very very hard work you have to deal with, never really helped with anything even if it was something they needed to come upfront for"
bad,If you aren't a mgr they treat you like garbage regardless of your previous experience.Poorly run.If you are down and out it's a placeholder and that's it!Humiliating experience!
bad,"I would never recommend anyone to work at Walmart.  Biggest mistake of my life!"
bad,"All management treat you like your beeneath them. Their insurance benefits are very expensive and it doesn't pay out unless you have paid a $10,000 deductible per person"
bad,The managers and associates often talked about each other . There were some nice helpful co-workers there but not much . They cannot manage spacing their either over staffed or under staffed
bad,"I work overnight as a cashier/ stocker / mod team I can’t complain I get my 40 hours but it’s horrible people over work you. You have to work holidays they complain about things not getting done but won’t hire anyone a lot of new rules they over work and not enough pay and they give OT then ask you to cut it. I’m just waiting on something new to come up. Bc goshhh this place sucks. Only people really making"
bad,I worked for Walmart dc for 13 years never got a thank you for the job I did or anything all they cared about is there numbers and that's it and they can care less about u I remember when my grandmother passed  way they still wanted me to stay the whole day so never work for Walmart best thing for me when I left.
bad,At first it was good. Now the store manager isn’t good and associates don’t do what they need too. They never have the shelves stalked for the customers.
bad,"They seemed to not care much of employees, if it was raining you had to go get soaked and possibly sick, you were thirsty had to wait till break need the restroom had to wait till break"
bad,"Wal-Mart should be a last resort type of  job; and even then, look elsewhere before submitting the application. This company truly do not care. And at $9 an hour, its not worth it."
bad,This company does not care about their employees the bottom line is all they care about. There is no vacation it’s called personal time off Thales forever to get any then you gets pints for calling out sick unless you have the protected personal time off once you hit 5 points your terminated it’s a point a day.
bad,It was busy it felt like the carts would not stop i worked mostly by myself barley any help. i did not learn anything i didn't already know. the management staff was horrible.
bad,"a lot of racism, favoritism, managers like to nitpick, I never got a raise I made the same amount as someone just got hired it was just a horrible place to work"
bad,"Wal-Mart is a form of modern day slavery. The pay is minimum at best, the management system is childish and anti-employee. I never worked at a job where supervisors are yelling and screaming."
bad,"Let me start by saying that the management at Walmart are trashy they all fraternize, flirt, nd sleep with one another. No one has respect for them and they don’t even respect their own workers they flirt with them, use them and blame them for any given problem. In the past year they changed management 6 times bc of those issues. The customers are so rude nd disrespectful plus the work environment is filthy and disgusting."
bad,"Horrible management  who doesnt care about the wellbeing of their employees, terrible company to work for. Very stressful for a stocking position, you're better off shooting yourself then to work here."
bad,management is rude and condescending you will be paid near nothing even if you are the best employee they have ever had your raise will be the same as the worst employee they still have.
bad,Didn’t work with the company long enough. The staff was making you do things other than your job description but I felt as though I was being picked on because they only asked me to do those things
bad,"I never thought I’d work under so much corruption, literally if you’re not messing with your manager your job is on the line.  I’m a hard worker who gets harassed because I don’t kiss anyone’s rear end. Trust me it’s not worth your time. They treat you like you owe them something and they treat you like a slave"
bad,CSM harrassed me for 7 months called ethics and they said give her another chance I quit ..plus I dealt with jealousy and envious co-workers throughout my career there like low budget ghetto come up not a place for classy people ijs
bad,"Unless you are in desperate need for employment. Stay away! They are one of the top two corporations in the world. You are nothing but another number because as soon as you leave, you will be replaced and you are treated as such."
bad,"The culture in pincher creek Walmart is not what you want to see in a big corporation  like Walmart.  The management would rather delegate work to the lower level staff and stand around chatting with their friends. "
bad,"The most hostile work environment I have ever been in. Fellow associates are borderline violent and rude, and managers are unethical and get away with being so unethical. The culture is sickening. Those that work hard and do their best are abused and mistreated. If you are lazy and have no work ethic then Walmart is the best place for you."
bad,"Incompetent managers who didn't do their job and made it very hard on cashiers. Hard to pick up paycheck because managers didn't respond to requests. Lack of products, slow floor service due to bad scheduling also made customers angry and made it hard on cashiers"
bad,"Very disorganized, no real leadership. Want to work employees very little pay. Always calling you in early and making you stay late. People always call out nobody works really hard"
bad,"For me anyways I felt like I lived there I worked 3-11 everyday for 2 years never had a weekend off, So I had no personal life. Tried getting cross trained and never got anywhere."
bad,"The management at the store I worked at didn't care about the staff they were responsible for. There was no training and no help from upper management. Supplies were always out and the budgets for them were always cut. Walmart says they care about their employees but they need to make sure they hire better management people who follow their guidelines to the tee. Maybe the CEO needs to tour the facility in  Airway Heights, specifically to see who is doing the job and who isn't!!!! That store is always out of products for the consumer and most of the employees are unhappy! Fix the problem, CEO, do YOUR JOB!!!!"
bad,"If you live your family, don’t work at Walmart, they are not family friendly. The manager and asst managers are extremely unfriendly to staff AND to customers. The shelves are bare, rotten produce, and rude arrogant staff and management"
bad,Management here is very poor. They don’t know how to talk to people properly and they expect you to do so much work for very little pay. Also they barely work with your school schedule and they constantly give you very long shifts like 9-10 hour shifts back to back & They always schedule you against your availability. Don’t work for Walmart they are not  a good company to work for
bad,"I work for Walmart ....they don’t care about the customer or their associates!About making money!Core schedule is base on when they need you there for work!Don't sign it ,you will lose your job!Walmart say customer come first  no it is one big lie!Walmart care about money they even sell use ear bud etc...just to make money!Sign a statement saying you won’t join a union before you get hired!Treat you liked nothing!"
bad,"This particular store is toxic. Upper management plays favorites, they play nice in front of bigger bosses that come in but treat the employees badly. There is always a fear of retaliation if you try to speak your mind and they really don't care about your life outside of work. Until they cycle out of the bad management at this particular location I would advise to work at a different store. Pay is decent but if you are a good employee they will use you and the bad employees reap the benefits."
bad,"Mal trato con el personal sobre explotación con el personal, abuso de poder"
bad,Jai été victime d'intimidation par le cogérant du magasin. On m'a manqué de respect plusieurs fois. Gros manque de professionnalisme de la part de la plupart des membres de la direction. Aucune considération de l'employer. Over time obliger à plusieurs reprises. Stress continuel en plus de se faire dévaloriser à la journée longue. Je ne conseillerais pas ce magasin à mon pire ennemi.
bad,Poor management always understaffed you earn paid time off but rarely get to use it with the excuse of no coverage. They will pay you down to 80 hours every February. Open door policies are truly a joke.
bad,"If your a teenager and never had a job, its a great start position. I feel like its not a long term position.  They dont have many growth opportunities, and dont treat there employees as well"
bad,Worst place I ever worked. Managers treat treat you like poo pooThey lie to you benefits  are terrible and getting worse!!Don’t ever work for Wal mart!!!!
bad,"Not treated equally ,there is favortism . No repect for each other. The changes in company for needing time off or sick time .The attendance points policy against the workers"
bad,"Asset protection and receipt check at the door. Greets customers as they walk in the store, and maintains door area clean. Also assists with other tasks placed by management."
bad,"I don’t care if you’re faced with living under a bridge, DO NOT work for this retailer of cheap chinese junk.  Mis-management is rampant and indifferent.  There are American flags all over the place, yet those flags, as well as the rest of the excrement under that roof, are made in china.  This entity CLAIMS to be American, yet it exploits people at an evil, calculated and deliberate manner.  HEED MY WARNING...PASS THIS ONE UP."
bad,Associates have zero say in their scheduling.  Attendance policy and associate benefits are very low compared to other companies have been told about.
bad,Some assistant managers are awful at communicating with cashiers and other employees. Walmart never schedules enough cashiers. Some managers complain  about having to jump on register to help out the cashiers serve the customers to avoid long wait times.
bad,They changed your schedule without telling you. Poor buisness and management practices. They ask you to work overtime and then at the end of the week they make you cut your time.
bad,They will use you and abuse you there. I became severally depressed and management just breaks you down. Everybody gossips about each other. You get talk to like you are trash they have no sympathy towards your problems or flexibility for emergency.
bad,"Always understaffed or staff calling in, not a fun place to work as the Customer expectations do not add up to the pay or staff they have hired.  Holidays are a gong show there is a reason staff seems unhappy is because they are shown no respect or appreciation."
bad,My opinion to working at Walmart .the managers are mean .the job sucks .the worker dont Want to workers you work so hard and  you like burnout I don't feel like coming back to work . i feel like sometime  i want to quit short staff.
bad,Walmart used to Value their Associates and customers more. Now it's just about cutting jobs using more technology and robots instead of people and have completely cut out so many jobs and cut hours. So there's barely anybody ever on the floor to help a customer and if there is they're so busy with all the stuff that gets thrown on them who has time for a customer. That's why a lot of Walmart associates are so rude these days.
bad,"I worked as a courtesy associate in the parking lot, a cart pusher. I worked there for 5 months. This was my first job. I liked the hard work but I hated the job and I didn't like where I was working. I never worked a set schedule. My schedule always varied. I worked random days and hours"
bad,I do not recommend working for this company. I have invested 10 years with this company and I feel like I should have left a long time ago. Dont waste your time applying here
bad,"Some stores are better than others but overall, Walmart is not the retail giant that it used to be, especially when it comes to taking care of their employees."
bad,"Avoid East Brunswick Walmart at all costs a possible employee. Poor management from the store manager on down, total lack of staff and equipment to actually get work done and not remotely enough benefits or compensation."
bad,Decent for first job for young adults if you're not good with life or your hands or brain. Get no where in life there even at management level you will still make nothing.
bad,Everyone talks down to you. It’s a hostile work environment and it got to the point where I dreaded going to to work. There are a few good people to work with but management is not ideal.
bad,Hard work bad pay very nasty management doesn’t know how to talk to employees cussed them out talk down to them and belittling the employees nothing never good
bad,Cuando agaran a un fardero no te apolla jerencia te piden que afuerza agas recuperaciones no te pagan el tienpo extra que te quedas a laborar los jefes tienen a sus preferidos un desmadre las tiendas
bad,No hay control no hay confianza todos hacen lo que quieren los gerentes no cumplem
bad,Chances of advancement ha 10 years there trying to move up finally moved to full time after 6 years can never do great on evaluations so busting your butt won’t do you any good people who slack and goof around seemed to move up quicker than people who worked hard to move up
bad,Even though I was one out of 2 people in a department. Said they 'couldn't spare the time' even though I was expected to do the work of 2 people in the span of 4 hours even though I wanted more and requested more.
bad,I did not wanna fill this out and im not sure why im being forced to. i have nothing good or productive to say about this company. its a job and theres a check. end of story
bad,"Hard work no hours, 2 to 3 days out of the week. Hard work, doing others task, no management, lol to no training. Had to ask for for more days and hours to try to get by"
bad,They don't care at all about their employees. Their odds no opportunity to better yourself if you are 60 or older. They weed out older associates by making it too hard to work there. Age discrimination is rampant.
bad,Never work there again.stupid for Taking away overnight stockers.store empty alot.trying to use Sam's club method at checkout waste of time inconvenience don't work
bad,Regional changes on having a set schedule are no more. No holiday pay and no overtime. Management changing yearly as it seems to be a training store for the market team.
bad,Management is a joke and corporate is about corporate. They truly believe that you are just another body that can be replaced. Do not recommend working there
bad,"I was terminated due to me having a left foot nerve injury I got from a car wreck in 1999. I worked for Walmart Supercenter 5 years, after 4 years, a new manager came to my Opelika Walmart location who claimed my position my be too hard for me due to my left foot disability. I told him I’ve been working since a year after my wreck, the summer of 2000. He looked for reasons to fire me. He ended up"
bad,Horrible management has no clue what they are doing. No way to advance or try out different job departments no way way to ever get a raise. And no way to ever become full time because walmart is too cheap to pay out benefits. And they limit you to 10-15 hours a week max. Stay away from walmart unless you enjoy being treated badly and staying poor.
bad,"Trabalhar na Walmart foi bem ruim. Havia muitas coisas erradas lá, como roubo e agressões verbais dos encarregados. Não tínhamos quase disponibilidade pra nada, e o pessoal antigo tinha certos ""erregos"" que os novatos não tinham."
bad,"I was personally overworked, underpaid, and by the time you use the insurance, you run out of points to take care of yourself. Not the best option in my opinion if you care about your physical/mental health."
bad,"Manager of Fort Sask store should not be running a store. Doesn’t care about employees, only promotes brown nosers. He talks to employees like they’re all stupid. Just sits in his office all day and doesn’t help employees or customers on the sales floor"
bad,"You get no paid vacation or at least my location didn’t give any, requesting days off is one of the hardest things to do because none of the managers bother to check there email to see you requested a day off you have to constantly remind them to look but they never will, the managers are extremely rude and if they do something wrong they’ll find a way to put the blame on you"
bad,"If you are 20 years old and have not seen the world, this is a place for you. I write this because I am old and have worked my way up thru the ranks & had a good job. But the things your are to endure does not make it worth the wild. In both spirt it and life. Family and friends are the things to live fore. I have finished my rant about corporate life, only you can make your decision about a company & what you want out of it."
bad,Managers are not supportive..and they will gang up on you..bulling employees and lie about you..what's good for one dept manager does not apply to the other dept managers
bad,The Walmart i work on doesn't care about associate the don't give us respect they coach us for no reason and they never gave us our bonus and even if you graduated pathways they don't give you a raise some of them are so racist.
bad,"The manager is extremely disrespectful and inconsiderate to others. I drive from Starkville every morning trying not to have an accident and she still does not care. I’m on the urge of losing my job because i clock in sometimes 7:11 AM Or a little later because i have to"
bad,"I broke my finger while cleaning the sink in the bathroom. They sent me to the Walmart doctor, who told me that there was nothing wrong with my finger. My finger can't bend until this very day. Then management looked for every single excuse to fire me. Horrible people!"
bad,En esta empresa la administración antigua que tenían era horrible
bad,"Not enough hours as a fulltime employee , always different schedules, no overtime allowed to finish what I started, takes too long to get health insurance"
bad,Horrible place to work. WalMart is the biggest company in the world and treats their employees like dirt. Always changing the rules to stack against you and make your job more difficult. Management is horrible. They claim to be family oriented company but they are NOT at all. Horrible place to work for. This company will suck the joy and life out of your soul and spit you back out.
bad,"Life at Walmart is like prison"
bad,"This by far has been the worst company you can possibly work for. If you even clock out a minute late you will get in trouble, as getting any overtime is an absolute sin. Employees are not treated fairly at all and are treated like children."
bad,"Te contratan como multifuncional, o sea, haces de todo aunque no sea tu área, te cambian el horario de un día para otro, no hay respeto de gerencia hacia el personal"
bad,"You dont get bonuses based on your work. It is a crossed the board 2% . So you get as much as a person that doesnt do their job at all. They dont train people right. And expect your job to come before your family at all times. Especially during the holidays.  They will change your schedule to fit company needs even after your schedule was already out. Even if that means you miss the holidays with your "
bad,"Would not recommend working here at all  Basically No body knows what is going on, I never got trained for any thing from Wal mart  mgrs. I learned from fellow associate employees how to do things. Total and complete mis management . no organizational skills. what so ever. difficult and very stress full place to work. Their are better jobs out their that care about their employess ,However Walmart is not one of them."
bad,When I first started at Walmart I was excited   I liked the job but after working there a few months I knew there was no future   I want to work for a company that gives you raises based on performance and hours worked   They didn’t give any raises
bad,People here are very judgmental. This is a toxic place to work. I ended up stuck here and loss myself in the process. They only give promotions to family members no matter how long they've worked there. People will act like your friend just to talk badly about you behind them. The schedules change like every other day. It's just a very toxic unfriendly place.
bad,"Very bad company to work for. Managers have their pick people. Managers want"
bad,Managers at this establishment do not work with integrity. Some managers are lazy and cut corners. I did not enjoy my time here. Some of the employees were very nice and deserve more then the payment they received because they were doing the managers job. I would only recommend this job to someone if it was their last resort.
bad,worst place of employment...don’t care about your home life...walmart is your life...no holidays off and no holiday pay and you get double right ups on holidays that you don’t use your time for...mind you you don’t accrue a lot of time! hate this place...looking for new employment as we speak!
bad,"Management does not care about is associates. They are unfair and very biased, and have no regards to associates health Abbas well being. Point system is highly unfair to single, married, and associates with families."
bad,"They will take much as they can, the people - coworkers are great but management is not. Job is very demanding and a lot of walking on concrete floor. Raises are once a year and VERY poor. Bonuses are a joke."
bad,Eastlake Walmart is god awful. I worked here and I refuse to even shop there now. Shelves are always bare. They don't hire enough so there are never associates to help. They expect employes to do everything in the store including stuff you are not trained to do. Then doc your pay for not knowing how to do it. Worst place to be
bad,"Walmart doesn’t care about there employees everyone there works scared to loose there job your a slave for Walmart, you nearly see your home and wife."
bad,"You gonna have at least 5 supervisor "
bad,"Don’t ever go near this company. You’ll be treated like a slave. Closed economy, pay via Company card, encouraged to apply for food stamps, rental assistance, etc."
bad,Continuously understaffed but still expected to complete a constantly increasing workload at the same pace as normal. They refused to hire additional employees despite losing members of our crew. A regular unloading crew was say 7 people we were down to 3 or 4 but still expected to do more work than was expected of the 7. Ridiculous expectations with management only caring about the bottom line.
bad,Company going down hill...used to be decent but not anymore...all they do is take take take. Never tell you good job..always look for whats wrong instead of whats right..Management out to get you and play favorites.
bad,Its was alright could have been better. If a person is interesting working for Walmart just apply to position that they are interest in and be patient.
bad,"Not a good company.they say a,lot off things .as far as family and pay and never come though the hours they make you work is not conducive to family or a good life ."
bad,"I really didn't like working at Walmart. It seemed nothing was ever good enough for the managment and because of that I really most motivation ti even try. It was my first job of course and everyone hates their first job, but it was not a work experience I think anyone should suffer through."
bad,Worst management I have ever seen.  The better managers all leave because of the poor treatment they receive.  Associates aren't treated any better.  It's all about the $$.
bad,"Cap 2 stockers gets paid as much as a cashier and they want us to work all over the store. We are underpaid, unvalued and micromanaged like crazy. We are basically the glue to Walmart and we are treated like bottom of the barrel. As soon as I get another job I am running and never looking back. There is no chance for growth...... they pass you up on every promotion and even going to a different departments is a struggle."
bad,"After working there for 2 months on 2017 a new guy and his friend were hired and i thought walmart did have a good environment for their workers but i was wrong, one day after coming from lunch the new guy kept trying to pick a fight most of the time. Had to resign from the job due to toxic environment and would never recommend anyone working there."
bad,They don't treat they workers right or don't know how to treat there workers plus the ones that's don't work they treat them like gold and the ones do work they treat them they nothing to them
bad,"Whether you're filling orders for Stores or performing general repairs. At Walmart, you’ll have continuous training, a clean safe working environment and have the opportunity to perform with industry leading technology. Our associates move fast-but they do it together."
bad,"you just work for a check"
bad,"wouldn’t recommend  to anyone to work at the Walmart in dix 30 Brossard , they treat you like trash and don’t care about your needs . I have never felt so stressed and so much anxiety from working at a job .They ignore you for days if you take a day off of work because you’re sick . You get yelled at in front of clients by your boss. You’re used all the time and they make you stay an hour longer after closing time when you’re shift has ended. If you decide to work  at customer service you have no one to help you so good luck to anyone who applied there"
bad,"Managers were always pushing too hard, I was fired for being to fruity. they expected us to accomplish feats by ourselves that normally take more than one associate."
bad,"Worst job EVER! This job is not for college students nor people who works here for a living. This job is really a job for High schoolers. The pay is well but not good enough. We work during the holidays but no time and half and if we don’t come in that’s two occurrences and we only could get five until we’re fired. It’s very weird here, only the managers can have a nice life. I’m supposed to be working part time because of school but instead I’m working full time hours,which is interfering with studying and homework"
bad,Streetsboro Walmart is not the place to work. management sucks they don't know what they're doing. And I let things walk right out the door so if you want to still go to streetsboro Walmart
bad,I really donot recommend this company for working as they just think about their business and donot care about the rest of people . I wish that I have started in other places and did not waste my time there .
bad,"Long story short, I was put on medical leave for 6 months and my management figured after 6 months of bills piling up 12 hours a week sufficed. Had my full time position taken away as a result of my medical leave. Overall, horrendous experience."
bad,"Half the time, I was doing work that had nothing to do with my job title. I learned inventory management. Along with some managerial experience without actually being a manager. Customer is always right."
bad,Just horrible i was abused here and management didnt do anything. Management was unorganized. Staffing was bad and the employees were trash and rude  and even fights happend
bad,"No vacation days, no holiday pay, no sick or personal days. Must work on Thanksgiving, no exceptions. There's a point system, 1 point for absence, .5 for lateness, 2 points if absent on key days. When you reach 5 points, you're fired."

bad,Walmart is an absolutely horrible place to work and they don't care about their employees getting sexually harrassed by other employees that place is a total joke and the pay sucks for what they put you through there and the customers are rudeand act like you owe them something.
bad,"Every assistant manager is out to cover there own backside they tell you what you want to hear to get you out of there office, when you start an open door case the store manager lies to your rep to make it seem like its you that is the problem when in all actuality it them they dont care how hard they work you they dont care that you have a family and need to make appointments and school I told them when i got hired i needed everyother weekend off for visitation with my child yet i was scheduled any way my first my first month there i worked a month straight without a day off they simply dont care them when i got"

bad,i must say Walmart is a wonderful place to shop or even a great place to waste time if you need but it was not one of my best jobs. Well at least the location i was at
bad,Horrible place to work. Make you work long hours no breaks and mistreatment  by upper management  they look for ways to make people comply to their ridiculous schedule
bad,This company has no respect for their employees. Managers show favoritism. Schedule is rarely the same. Schedule changes without permission. Unsafe working conditions.
bad,"It's an awful place to work! Save yourself. Reported my manager to ""ethics""(internal reporting system of walmart) 3 times which is a joke in it's self. The training is a joke! The managers are all awful, always yelling @ you and barking orders!  ""my way or highway"" ""i tell you what to do you do it or quit that's it or quit"" just do your job and shut your mouth. There's no conversations or explaining the job to you. I'm sooo glad it's over!"

bad,They treat people like trash don’t care about people they don’t even care for the customers do not work there be very careful because you can find that is the worst place you can work
bad,"Walmart was a good company when I first started working there, the longer I stayed the worse it got. Their employees were no longer a priority just profiting"
bad,"If you want your efforts ignored by slack-jawed management who treat you like a trained animal, like staying at the bottom and never making anything of yourself, never having a good day, dealing with coworkers who undermine you to try to gain credit with said slack-jawed buffoons, basically dealing with scrambling, screaming, lying, politically motivated, hyper-dramatic apes on bothsides of the counter, then go join the Walmart family. Otherwise try your luck elsewhere"
bad,"Management was terrible. "
bad,High in discrimination .... They don't like slow overweight people... And they treat their employees like garbage!........... They say they give u PTO but they will never approve it!
bad,"Management sucks, they have the highest turn over rate. You don't get treated with respect a d they just treat you like a number. Corporate doesn't care either."
bad,"I was in OTC and HBA when I started there were three of us the two left I was left running the whole place basically by myself therefore I was doing the work of three people and not fairly paid for it, because I worked so hard they would not let me advance anywhere."
bad,"while working at this institution, i can say that my experience was far from pleasurable. it would be among my to three worst jobs I've ever had. there is more that can be done to improve the happiness of employees."
bad,"no room for advancement, lots of hostility, generally low mood atmosphere. Would not recommend for long term but great for a stepping stool or extra cash around the holidays."
bad,Worked extremely hard in the positions where many would not work and got treated as poorly all through my 14 years. You asked for support and they would look the other way.
bad,"Will not say anything bad, but neither will I say anything good. People make the place, so walmart like anbywhere will depend on the team that is in that store as to how good a place it is to work."
bad,"unfair place to work. treated rudely, you cried, mamagers are horroible, not taken seriously,  poorly treated, not a fair pace to work at at all......"
bad,The absolute worst management I have ever seen in my life all they do is go out and smoke all day long. They never get their pay right. And the people who work at Walmart I was just as bad
bad,Awful company to work. No respect for the individual from management and the company tells you to respect every individual. Every year the company takes something away.
bad,spent my time working here so miserable. they really don’t teach you what you’re supposed to do and they just throw you out onto the floor and have to learn everything yourself. change your schedule constantly and overwork you and try to send you to other sections when you still have to fulfill your own. managers are very rude and don’t like to help with anything and you can’t bother going to hr because they’re friends with the manager and won’t help
bad,"This company does not care about it's employees at all.I know it's retail and poor customers are to be expected but the company will not back you up at all. It doesn't protect those of use with disability if you haven't been there over a year. I personally have a disability and the only way I am protected from their point system is if I fill out an LOA form. You are not eligible for one until you have worked for the company for a year. You call out you get 2 points. You call out on a weekend and it's 4. You're 10 minutes late or 10 minutes leave early it's 1/2 a point. You have until you get 7 points before the fire you. They do not expect doctors notes or ER notes. You are expected to work even if you have a fever or are throwing up. A different breed of human shops at Walmart. This place is not worth the $11 they start you at. It takes the CSM a minimum of 20 minutes to get to you if you need help no matter if there are 3 of them or 6. Customer will yell at you for things you have no control over and that's to be expected it's retail, but I cannot control your WIC benefits and what they cover. I cannot control your food stamps and when they update and reload. Management is a joke. They are more worried about their bonus then anything else. I went from 3 months of 30 hours a week to sorry we don't want anyone working more than 10 hours now...I have bills to pay and kids to feed. If you are scheduled 6 or more hours you have to take an hours lunch. There have been times where I have to take my 15 and much lunch at the same because the CSM's will forget about you. You're not"
bad,"Unfair management. They got rid of the good managers that the customers and workers liked, for mangers that customers and workers hate. They had no clue of anything that was going on in the store."
bad,"They dont care about the issues within stores and have the most rediculous point system. If theres someone with the abilitiy to rise in position that managers dont like they'll find reason to get rid if you, they wait until the end of your shift before firing you then REFUSE to pay you for the last day"
bad,there rude to their workers and do you anything to get rid of them and they dont listen to the workers when they need them unless its something false and lies on others
bad,Walmart was the worst job. From the store manager down to the csms it was nothing but drama and bad communication. I tell everyone sometimes that money isn’t work the headache. They talk down to you and have no respect for you. Also they don’t like for you to change your availability and will not change it sometimes.
bad,"if i could give less than 1 star i would. this is probably the worst place to work. there is no communication between managers and scheduling is a joke. i had to fight with management to get my ""guarenteed"" 12 hrs a week."
bad,AsM think they have power and treat us bad if they have a bad they take it on us then they sleep play on theres phone when try to see the time on our phone they get mad '
bad,They treat u wrong they let u do it by ur self on ur first day and u dont know what to do they just look at u and let u mess up and get yelled at by customer s
bad,Walmart doesn’t care if you have a family and they want you to work on thanksgiving even if you don’t have anyone to watch your kids. They should pay employees $16 and you should get set hours and certain holidays off
bad,"Stressful Stressful stressful Stressful Stressful Stressful Stressful. "
bad,"There are people at Wal-Mart including management that will treat you as if they don't need you or your opinion..."
bad,I was let go unjustly. I did everything they told me to do to keep my job and they let me go anyway. I applied for unemployment and was contacted by employment security because their answer was different from mine. I was asked details of my termination and gave them and provided phone records. I was found eligible for unemployment. WalMart told me that after 6 months I could reapply. I tried and found out I am blacklisted from working at WalMart.
bad,"DO NOT try to work at Walmart. It is a nightmare. Managers are always gone, or being replaced, and if they are around they'll smile to your face while treating you like you're nothing. Also they will never have your back even tho you were doing your job word for word what they told you to do, but customer says anything and you're wrong. Customers think you know every item/price/spot/ really everything but in the same breathe think  you're too stupid to know how to do you're job that you've had for too long. "
bad,Need I say more?  Never in my entire life have I witness such poor management and unappreciated employees who work hard.  Some managers and  employees are there that should not be and some great hardworking employees are let go.
bad,"don’t do it."
bad,Worst place to work for.  The rumors are true.  Terrible atmosphere to work in.  Assistant-store manager were idiots.  Gave out our scarce supplies to other stores without realizing that we were also running low.  Depart managers didn’t know how to run their departments themselves.  One didn’t know how to make sandwiches nor use oven In the deli.  One barely showed up.  Another didn’t know what duties they were required to do by themselves.  All relied on lower non-managers employees to do their duties.  Procedures from the corporate office was ignored.  Attendance policies were ignored.  Medical restrictions from employees’ doctors were ignored.  Safety for employees were ignored.  Really depressing place to work in.  Stay away.
bad,"Very racist, unprofessional, and discriminative company to work for. Management is very rude! They don’t care about there employees! This company has to b the worst company ive ever worked for"
bad,"Salary managers make all of the money while hourly managers do all of the work. Treated horribly. Pay is just horrible for amount of work you do every day. However, overtime is offered if you're willing to stay and do work. Especially around holidays."
bad,"It's the worst place to work, they are racist, they don't care how much effort you input, they promote their own people."
bad,I loved my job at Walmart. I was planning on retiring from there. When u have a health issue or family emergency they don't care. I was fired for calling out during a snow storm. I live twenty five minutes out in the country. They would rather I wreck my car and put my life in danger for them.
bad,"Store manger did not care about keeping promises, bad management with self interest means hard to move up or around in company, they do not give full training and expect employee to have full knowledge on everything from the start"
bad,They terminated me my last shift of work and waited until my shift was over. No explanation why. I am a military wife and that is my life. No respect for military family’s that have to move frequently. k Walmart Kingston not professional at all
bad,"I make 13.95  an hour after working there for 15+ years and people are hired in and making almost as much, About $.50 less I don’t think that is fair. They keep taking away things that I feel we have earned are used to be a great company to work for not so much anymore. I would not recommend to work for this company it is not family oriented anymore"
bad,"The most unpredictable place to work. To many chiefs and not enough indians. Always giving more work and cutting hours.  Always shows favoritism and only let's certain people do nothing while giving others multiple task. When you give a complaint, it is brushed off."
bad,Will fire based on hearsay. Unbased claims as to reasons for discharge. People there are discriminatory and rude. Very selective on which rules to enforce and when. Overall dirty bathrooms horrible maintenance crew. Lazy workers not all but a lot. Very unhealthy work environment.
bad,"I wish I could write everything wrong with this company, there is just to much. I will just say they have a huge turn over and there is many reasons. Horrible place to work with awful management, all of them from the store manager down to department managers do nothing and expect the associates to do everything then take credit. Worst place I have ever worked"
bad,"This company will not help you if you get hurt, the company they go through to get FMLA will lose your paperwork. Not good for older people! You can do better!"
bad,Everyone I worked with was wonderful and it's the only reason I stayed so long (that and I had bills to pay). Management is terrible and the company is going downhill quickly. They expect you to have no life outside of work. All the employees I worked with hated it all equally. I'd rather flip burgers than work for this company.
bad,Danforth and sante Fe in Edmond Oklahoma is a bad location to work for. Nobody iny department help me with the Frozen Dairy trucks. It's am abusive place to work.
bad,It sucked management was horrible and unorganized and they stalk the employees . I never felt so stupid for working for eleven dollars . They overwork you and even try to holler at you . Rules are to strict also .
bad,"This location is almost in Powell, Ohio ( 7730 Sawmill Road, Dublin, OH) with customers that have higher wages and are very spoiled. "
bad,"Managers there cared more about self gain than you there employee, they just bark at you all day instead of talking to you like a human being, they don’t appreciate the extra mile you go for them but instead nick pick and complain. It could have just been at that particular Walmart not sure."
bad,"Exceso de trabajo, deben contratar más personal para no cargar a los asociados de trabajo."
bad,I was accussed of mistreating customers and it was not me the customer did not give my name but only a description and it had to be me was a punch in the gut for me I took pride in my job and the customers I helped daily
bad,If I could change one thing about Walmart  then I was change the fact that they have favoritism they need to give ever one the same equal amount of respect
bad,"For being just a big company they didnt pay good at all, I wouldn't recommend anyone to work at walmart unless you really had to, even than I'd try finding a different job"
bad,I have worked at walmart for a year and a half and I personally have health issues like I get dizzy and half of the time I ask them if I can sot down because it gets so bad I can barely stand and they won't let me. Also the management system is extremely poor. They only care about them self's.
bad,Toxic work environment doesnt even begin to describe this God forsaken place. You're will to stay positive and not carry the nuclear radiation that is Walmart store #2064 home will be tested. Tread lightly.
bad,"I was getting paid as a regular frozen foods associate, but doing the job of frozen foods manager. Then they hired someone outside of my department to take over as manager, they did not even offer me the job."
bad,This company is not bad it is solely up to the location that you are working in and for. I have noticed that a lot of people like to not do their jobs and rely on having others break their backs to get ahead.
bad,"Toxic work environment. Management was very unprofessional & inconsistent. Very poor management which facilitated a hostile work environment. No room for growth or advancement. Dead end job. Disrespectful workplace. Although the money is good, it’s not worth working in an abusive environment. I would not recommend working at Walmart to anyone."
bad,Poor management no holiday pay no vacation pay the restroom is to dirty and nastythe salary is to fairy stressfullthe other associates are not friendly alot of stupid costumer in the walmart florin
bad,"I liked my job when I first started Walmart, but then started to realize that the only thing Walmart cares about is its money and there upper   Management. I was wrongfully terminated ( I had FMLA) and I did have a total of 5 points but had to 2 that were supposed to come off because of my FMLA I talked to Sedgwick weekly. There was some issues with the paper work and I tried explaining that to my Up front  Coach  and he wasn't willing to listen. My up front coach only cared about one thing and I will not repeat it because I'm sure I would get in trouble. I was a CSM I would come in and work double shifts if they needed me but for some reason they always get rid of the employees that wanna work. I wouldn't recommend any one to work for Walmart. I wish anyone working at Walmart the best. Some may think this sounds petty but I'm not I'm just speaking the truth. If this were to actually get to upper corporate I would be more then willing to sit down and talk to them and let them know about there management."
bad,"Walmart is just what you expect: terrible. There are never enough people and they constantly overworked us for not nearly enough pay. One woman who worked there for thirty years will a awful tobacco allergy was consistently put on the tobacco line until she went into anaphylactic shock and needed to use her  epi-pen. The predator fish were stored in the same tank as the pry fish so they were constantly eating eachother and creating the worst possible animal abuse  situation. There were hundreds of dead fish bodies laying around in the sinks from the tiny Berta fish that starved to death. There were never anyone on the floor, so any time a cashier went on break to shop, we were mobbed by customers looking for help. It was awful. The day I left was the happiest day I ever had. It was like a literal weight lifted off of my."
bad,I worked for walmart for over 3 years. Don't work for walmart. Corporate sucks. They are greedy and only care about making money and employees get nothing but over worked and under paid
bad,La verdad esa compañía no le importa sus empleados no te permite crecer como persona y quieren tenerte de esclavo haciendo trabajos de mas por menos
bad,"The upper management are not compassionate about their workers . Very bias at the location I worked and if you don’t brown nose, they keep you stuck in a position and give their friends and family positions and over look the qualified candidates. I rate this company a 0” they screw over great workers."
bad,I hate Walmart all I gotta say. I would never ever try to get someone to work there! Please do not try to work there it cause way to much stress makes you flip out!
bad,"If i wanted to be treated like an animal i would go live in a zoo, no manager made me feel like a was wanted or needed because the way they treated me and my coworkers made it seem as if they wanted us gone for no fair reason. and they all felt like being a manager at walmart was the tip top of a career and we should wash their shoes"
bad,"Walmart is a high stress environment also speed work place.ots also very competitive ,some benefits great 401k employee discounts "
bad,"Not only is it the worst place to work, you have horrible customers that treat you as a sub human being and have managers that do nothing but sit in their office and do absolutely do nothing while their workers struggle with a rush, and are terrible at answering question. Mostly ends up making you like an idiot.. It is not a very well organized establishment/"
bad,It was a very stressful environment. I ended up quitting due to being the only one on the floor talking care of customers and cashiers. I wasn't seeing my kids enough.
bad,"Horrible people, horrible management, horrible hours, horrible pay, overall HORRIBLE. would NOT recommend working here if you have a family of any kind."
bad,I worked at walmart for a year and they want one person to do all the jobs! These people are over worked and underappreciated. They have unrealistic expectations of their employees. And the employees who do their jobs and do them well are not recognizd. This place drains the life out of you.
bad,People horrible i cant stand the clickish junk how they played favortisim towards who they liked and dis liked just no chance to grow if i wasnt kissig peoples rear end
bad,The places is like working with management that dont care. If you are sick they point you. If you have surgery or a chronic conditions you have to fight with an outside company who doesn't know you. They give you a raise and then find ways to take it back or cut hours
bad,As a Personnel Coordinator I was caught in the middle of the associates and the management team. I seen both sides to working for Walmart. If the management team doesn't like you they will put a target on your back. If you are very good at your job they do not let your promote to keep you in their store.
bad,I do not recomend anybody to work at wal martlow...terriable managent.constant harresment...work that can't ever be done....high turn over rate...low pay...not enough help to to get job done
bad,"Learned a lot about cash handling, I got to develop a relationship with the customers."
bad,bad not well management is rude low pay for the work do not work here they take advantage of your hard work to their bad company cant even be sick or you will get fired
bad,I was treated horribly. They looked down at me. They also treated me as if I was Warren from Something About Marry. Then they tend to discriminate against me because of my age & race. They tend to pay favoritism to certain genders & race. Every employee is used like a disposable tissue.
bad,They violated ADA and would even scream in my face. (Knowing I am hearing impaired) I would be bullied and made fun of for my disabilities. The managers were last doing their jobs. They would stand around on their phones and gossip all day.
bad,"I say it's not a good environment because of the management mainly.They don't know how to treat their good working employees and all they want to do is sit in their offices and make ""conference calls"". I've been working their for four years and they don't even seem to know or care even after i've helped them get in the top three in the market numerous times in several different departments. I am a very diligant and hard working person and I feel like they don't appreciate me at all."
bad,Stressful and they dont work around schooling or appointments.. They treat the employees badly. And they are vendictive if you ask for a sechdule change 3 weeks in advance..
bad,"If you have no other options in life and aren't able to get a real job that requires skills and education then this is better than fast food. But, if you are a teenager or other wise a failure at life (over 25 and working in the service or retail industry) then it pays a little better than most. But they will lead you on about full time hours and never give them to you. Also, you had better be prepared to bleed  for Walmart if you want to get any recognition for hard work. They made me sign a statement saying I neglected my job duties when it was actually some one else. They refused to look into it and threatened to fire me if I did not sign. Fast forward 2 years and I make enough to own all of them."
bad,"My job would"
bad,I would never recommend working at walmart it has low pay and absolute no respect its definitely not worth it. Also because of how many customers show up and make small thing into a huge problem.
bad,"If you need a job quickly, go for it.If you plan on having a career, Walmart might be a great place to learn what not to do. The benefit of this working environment is to learn from your mistakes and others."
bad,"Falta engajamento e respeito entre as lideranças e os subordinados,"
bad,The job was okay depending on who you were working with. most of the time you would have to do most of the work if not all of it because your teammates didn't want to help
bad,"I wouldn't recommend on working at the Wal-Mart in Arab,Al they are horrid poor customer service, unclean, horrible management. The only way to move up at this Wal-Mart is to either be sucking up or having relations with the management that is over the section you work in."
bad,"Flat out horrible, you're treated like a number, they don't care about your health at all. The insurance is garbage even the higher one you can choose to get. Management talk to you like you're nothing more then dirt beneath there feet. No likelihood of promotion as they are ran by favoritism. The pay is a joke, you have to use protected PTO if you're sick and have to miss you only get 40 a year"
bad,"Literally the worst job I had my entire life was new to retail ... expected more, not a place for me unless you wanna be stuck working minimum and doing all the work for store to be running, poor co workers judgemental when you are new and don’t know nothing w poor training all my maneger did is give me one task and was wondering around looking for him then when u ask for help nobody suddenly knows and it’s back to being that new person they don’t know what to do w him or needing knows LITTERAY"
bad,Manager treat you like your lest then a person  they can have a whole attitude with you and yell at you but once you say something they don’t like they will fired you
bad,I stayed at this job as long as I did because of the pay. I was a hard worker and did my best giving over 40 hours a week just to be laid off in another round of cut backs. Was here 6 years and there was lay offs every year
bad,"My Review is only accurate for the Location and period of time I worked there. After the Manager released me, he was Fired 4 months later once they discovered his Managing was not the Walmart way. His Store and Employees showed this. There are really well run Walmart Stores out there that are everything they profess to be. You have to be lucky and not an outsider to get one."
bad,"no advancement, low pay,expect more for less pay,threats,scream at you,these people care less about you, you are a number and if you don't like it there is someone waiting to take your job"
bad,"They say they are family oriented and have an open door policy for problems or concerns. Sadly, this is not true. Management does not take responsibility for things they should. Hopefully this is just my experience."
bad,"Don't work here. You will be worked to death and yelled at for mot being three places at once. Turnover rate is insane, its a revolving door. Management included"
bad,"This job was okay, but they really need to pay their employees higher wages. Its really sad, how Wal-Mart makes all this money and the pay for their employees suck. It's a disgrace!"
bad,"my knowledge of auto's and mechanical was not used or wanted."
bad,You cant call sick  and if really  sick you fire they don't  care  if yor sick are  not if family  emergency  they could  care less a the supervisor  mean  yhey make you work overtime    special  if your work in front plus csome cashier  unfriendly Manger  very disrespectful    head Managers  if you problem  he could careless
bad,"Never could do my job without being called up front to run a register. On Christmas Eve, she had one cashier scheduled. I was told that I would be paged up front on my day off and this happened frequently. No communication between management and associates. Five minutes of training if you are lucky. Youneverlllknow if you did do"
bad,"I would not recommend Walmart unless you have no other options. I worked in several locations all over the state. Often times management was erratic and inconsistent in training and temperament to an extreme degree. This was present in every location I worked at, The hours were very long which can be a benefit depending on your needs. Hard labor due to lack of people and a culture of ""do more no matter what"" which leads to harsh treatment of employees. If you must try to keep it short term."
bad,"No igualdad cómo pregonan no tienen ética te tratan como animal. Los jefes inmediato no están preparados, sin ningún tipo de aprendizaje con ellos."
bad,Don't care about employees unless you are a favorite. Don't care of you get enough hrs or not. Fire people for no fault of their own. Some of the management is ok. They tell you all the great things for working with Walmart but they treat you like you don't matter and you are easily replaced
bad,They say they will work around your schedule  and they do not at all... they say its family comes first maybe theirs but not the employees does not come first
bad,When I go in for work I do not expect to feel unimportant and belittled by workers and especially management.  I learned that Walmart has a high turnover rate for a reason and it is because no one wants to stay. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the gossip between managers and workers. The stressful working conditions of the workplace kept workers on the edge of being fired; sometimes for unjust reasons.
bad,"I have been with Walmart for the last three years and I for one give great feedback to any great company I work for; but Walmart is far from great when it comes to promoting the right talents for the job. The work conditions are the worst; especially when the higher up management are perfectionist, it’s a toxic workplace to be in."
bad,"Working here pushed me to go back to school. It also proved to me that saying ""its not what you know its who you know"". There were so many people with no experience being hired as managers while the workers applying for the management potion who knew the job were passed over and in the end had to train the new management on how to be a manager."
bad,"Worked there for almost 4 years, was promised multiple raises that never happened. Management is lazy (most of them hide in the office all day). I worked in multiple departments to try to avoid having a nervous breakdown and it didn’t help, ended up having one anyways. I had to go on a leave of absence and they wrongfully fired me for it. Save yourself the agony."
bad,"I'm a hard worker that finally got a supervisor job after a year of trying to get higher in the company. "
bad,"I loved the Department I was over. I loved the associates I worked with. I like working a fast past job, being a department manager, I got exactly that. However, upper management excepted way to much of us with absolutely no help."
bad,I enjoy working as a pharmacy technician my pharmacy supervisor Sonic when he was very as knowledgeable as well as reasonable. My overall supporting supervisors did not take the time to inform me that I would have needed more time to get my maternity leave approved and as a result I was marked absent for days that I should not have been. However that is not the reason for my departure fromthisposition at this company. This story is no longer open
bad,This place sucks. Stay away unless you want to work paid slavery. You do everything. No paid time off. No raises. No room for advancement. They tell you you’ll get a dollar raise when you complete “online training” that you have to do DURNING your shift. But they never let you go back and do it. Oh and never go out to collect the carts cause you will never come back inside. They do that to the employees they don’t like. STAY AWAY
bad,This is the most terrible place I have ever worked for they don’t care about you or the customers only themselves they don’t give raises unless you are management or you are the managers pet the insurance is terrible if you are lucky enough to get it you will work every holiday except Christmas which you don’t get paid-for you will be told to do something by one manager then get in trouble and wrote up by another for doing it.
bad,"I would not recommend Walmart EVER, they are not good the the people they hire, they are rude, and will right you up for absolutely no reason and then fire you for someone else’s mistakes."
bad,"Poor management, poor salary/ paid hours.Poor leadership. The company is run by nepotism. You can only get ahead if you are of a certain race or if you know somebody who knows somebody."
bad,"Management was careless, no values. Complete disregard for staff safety and well-being. Forget job security as ""paid PROTECTED time off"" which is intended for calling in sick/injured/family care, because that will do you no good. Management has no clue how to manage. The pharmacy department was like the movie ""Mean Girls"" only middle-age version. No sense of camaraderie, teamwork, unity, mission, or simple values. As for the customer-base, ""people of walmart"" videos on youtube will give you all the perspective you need to know."
bad,It is a high stress environment. Working for managers under stress makes for a difficult workplace. The hardest part about the job was that we were always under staffed.
bad,"Management at Walmart is not aware or care that employees don;t work, are late from breaks and lunches.  There are no punishment for these workers, The store is dirty, unorganized and employees do as they wish.  Management is more concerned about the product than the employees and look of the store."
bad,"Can be easily hired, so that's a plus. Aside from that I have nothing positive to say really. Experiences do differ however, and although  most are not positive, I wouldn't let that come in your way of looking for a way to make your livelihood. Sometimes you've got to do what you got to do to make it work. It's all in the way you look at things. I wouldn't look to Walmart or it's management staff to make things better for you. I'd say make yourself better and worry about that, then you'll find happiness and succeed. Also, you're amazing. :)"
bad,"The culture of Walmart is one that on the surface seems to care about their employees but the reality is woefully different.   I was hired as a janitorial person on the night shift but I was immediately told to go work in the stocking department because they were short handed (inadequate staffing is a norm there...why? because they want to stay in a budget and also employees quit or call in sick frequently.   My manager had mental problems and he wanted me to blow the warehouse with a leaf blower and no doors open, so the place filled with dust.  I thought this was crazy but I had lost my voice and I couldn't complain that I had respiratory problems.   The training process was thorough and I really liked the lady.  The day shift seemed to be many assistant managers but when you needed a door unlocked in order to do your job, many times there were none available to help. You also had to adhere to a time frame for doing your job and it didn't matter if you were told to go take out groceries to a waiting car.  It meant you had to do a rush through in cleaning the restrooms and that usually means if you took time to clean something that really needed attention, you were told you were going to slow.  The store had a high incidence of theft and they would blame their door greeter instead of hiring adequate security personnel (there was one!! who would walk around the door and ""engaging"" with a potential shoplifter which meant ""greeting them"" and hoping that would deter them from walking out with something.  If you want insurance you have to wait a YEAR!!  I could go on and on with"
bad,"Walmart's management has very poor people skills and resorts to abusive behaviour and language at the South Common Store in Edmonton. "
bad,Dont have respect for their employees. No benefits. No days off even if you requested ahead of time whether if its a family funeral or your health on the line. I would never work there ever because I was discriminated and wrongfully terminated plus sexually harrassed which Walmart did not do a thing about.
bad,Management is very rude they talk to you like you are nothing.  They get mad when you ask questions or don't understand something.  I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"With the right management the job could be bearable to work for long term. With all the stress of constant managers ordering and breathing down your neck, it was not worth the salary I was getting paid. Sometimes they expect you to work a 2 to 3 person job by yourself at the same capacity and finish in the same time frame."
bad,"Not too crazy about the work environment , coworkers and customers included. The customers are rude and disrespectful, and the management team, minus a few, can’t do their job properly. I had to wait entirely too long for a replacement card after my Walmart deposit card was stolen along with my vape.  The only plus is the educational and the stock benefits. They will help you pay for tuition if you decide to go back to school at one of their partnered Universities ."
bad,this job is ok for high school students  working after work or working  little amouts of hours   they dont like to treat ther assoates the way they should be treated
bad,I would never ever EVER recommend anyone to work at Walmart. they work you like Construction Works for $11.50/hr. they dint even have the decency to get a dishwasher so who knows how clean the dishes really are and how much bacteria is still left on the racks that hold raw rotisserie chickens. the employees gossips all day long and yell across the store to customers/employees; and take the chickens off before their timer. don’t always use gloves or clean the slicers daily. the manger is disgusting. she’s rude and talks to people like they’re her children. I wouldn’t recommend ANYONE work there! EVER!
bad,All they do is threaten to fire you or fire you they dont care your just a number untrained managers who have no education you get treated like garbage stay away from this company
bad,"I worked two different shifts while working for the company 4 AM - 1 PM and 10 PM - 6 AM. The overnight shift I did just about everything you can think of. Having a different job or task every night. Stocking products off the truck anywhere from the food department (Grocery, Frozen or Chilled) to Pharmacy/Health and Beauty. And the AM shift I would pick items in the back and then stock the items after I was finished picking them. "
bad,Poor management. Told would get benefits after 6 months. Just passed a year and no benefits. The work is grueling and the health needs accommodation I have requested has been ignored.
bad,I First started workin here Walmart was agood company as time went on it became horrible place Management was horrible didn't care about their workers
bad,Worse place I ever worked at....the management treated the staff  horrible..I wouldn't go back their again...some of the staff didn't know how to do there job
bad,If you are in with the higher ups even when you go to theam it's your fault or you're not a them player and I think it's pretty sick you let go the good ones and keep hiring incompetence.
bad,"I was a ASM and the job was very demanding. Although they send you to a 8 week training program, what you practiced in training was noting like working at a store you were assigned to. All stores are different and the associates were very lazy and disrespectful. I was an external hire and I decided to give it a try and now I feel like I wasted my time. This was my 2nd time as a ASM  and things were worse this time around."
bad,Worked with Walmart for a couple years and no longer am employed with them so I am searching for.  Anything else. It wasn’t. A bad place to work for. I
bad,"The absolute worst company I've ever worked for.i wouldn't recommend anyone to work there.they do not appreciate their associates.you have to be ""in the group""  in order to get treated fairly"
bad,No hay resolucion de problemas y existen ascensos no merecidos en todas las areas.
bad,"No one knows what they are doing. The people in yellow vests are suppose to be helping customers but they hide or stay in groups and chat instead of working. People in blue vests are responsible to get product onto the shelves. Blue vests end up doing everything while everyone else just cracks the whip at you if you don't go fast enough. Most likely you will end up doing other peoples jobs because they simply don't want to do it, and management agrees its now your job on top of everything else you do. It's the equivalent of working in the Twilight zone. Underpaid, overworked, bosses WILL scream at you for any given reason. Way to stressful.. They always denied my vacation days too."
bad,"Working for Walmart was great until I was 6 months in . the store lacks management , the store lacks front end communication, half the customers are never I do mean never satisfied . I have been with Walmart over 1 year this location sucks along with the store manager and the rachet employees that don't do their jobs properly for the customer service aspect."
bad,Walmart allows management to treat employees poorly. As a previous manager needing a job I accepted a job with Walmart. I was new to the front end things and trying to learn. The store manager kept harassing me as I’m trying to teach myself the register because he took my trainer away and threw me on a register. I was trying to familiarize myself with the register and he comes up and tells me what I’m doing wrong 4 times in 45 minutes. I was not happy when he states” you have to treat your customers and associates like they are 3 years old” After that I went to another manager and told her what happened. I’m not 3 years old and expect to be treated with respect and I quit.
bad,"The management is never around, they also don't encourage or compliment any employees, If you're a hard worker management is always down your neck, Lazy workers just get away with everything, gossip runs rampant in the store cause your personal life is everyone's personal life now, pretty much everyone is clueless and they treat you like garbage."
bad,"It was just as terrible as everyone says it is. Incompetent management, favoritism, discrimination from management towards certain ethnicity or people of certain sexual orientations, and an HR department that never once helped on any of these fronts over the multiple months I spent calling and writing formal inquiries and complaints. "
bad,"You better off being a stripper! Walmart doesn’t really care about their employees, only Customers and Money. There isn’t much more I can say. Just keep your eyes on the prices and go back to school if possible, or get a trade."
bad,"Does not appreciate workers, treats employees poorly. Family means nothing to walmart. Will cut hours to where you cant even pay ur bills. If you are not a man they dont care about you."
bad,Do not work for Walmart because the management team doesn't work together and they will wright you up if you try to go to a different position in the company.
bad,It was okay I just think that they need better management and have things in order a lot of the stuff at the job was unorganized an wasn’t don’t professional.
bad,I would not recommend anyone i know to work for the Walmart company. There management team is unresponsive to the need of there employees nor do they provide an friendly atmosphere. The store manager is completely in it for her self and cares not for the need of her employees
bad,A empresa deixa a deseja no que diz respeito a ética no ambiente de trabalho.
bad,If you miss 3 days of work it doesnt matter if you have a drs not or anything if you are dying oh well you'll be replaced the next day. If your kidneys are shutting down and need to go to the hospital it doesnt matter you better be at work on time.
bad,Walmart could be a great place to work if corporate understood the people they service. Managers need to be more hands on and not be on a power trip. Stop letting computers run the business. People do have families they lives does not revolve around Walmart so they need a set schedule. Walmart is a billion dollar company and they pay the employee pennies. The turn over is so unreal. the few people that stays only stay because a piece of a job is better than no job at all.
bad,A job and company from h***. Do not waste your time here. The people at Walmart claim to care about you and your every day life but they do not. I can assure you of that.
bad,"If you're just starting out with work, I would recommend Walmart, but do not hope for Walmart to ever benefit you in any way if you work for them. Do not think of this as a long term job either, if you are loyal to Walmart, they still will not be loyal to you."
bad,Worked as a customer service supervisor for 6 months and I almost wanted to kill myself because I was doing everything by myself at the closing end 4pm-11pm with a good for nothing co partner that would go outside and push carts. Management did not care at all. I got barely a 30 minute lunch cause it was required and that was it. No other breaks and when I got back it was always a mess. DO NOT WORK FOR WALMART
bad,Terrible place to work there were no benefits they have no respect for their employees they have no respect for their bosses they are not helpful their is no consistency
bad,Walmart is one of the worst jobs I’ve ever had in my life never in 1 million years would I tell someone to go there and work or would I ever go back to work at Walmart
bad,Hours get cut and if you dont work Thanksgiving they will just stop scheduling you all together. You have people that have worked together for a while and dont like anyone new coming in.
bad,"walmart was one of the worst college jobs i ever had. they would have say 6 people scheduled in your department, mine was lawn and garden and then proceed to take all of them to other areas and leave you alone at the register and no one would come to help, you would have a line of people waiting to check out most coming from grocery to ""avoid the lines"" yet they were as bad or worse in lawn and garden and another waiting for actual help in your department, dont bother calling for help or management, they never come so you get stuck going back and forth between checking out and helping people and cannot do anything all day. then get yelled at for it and they wonder why everyone leaves."
bad,"Walmart has never been so disconnected with its employees. Every new program they roll out harms its staff and ruins customer engagement. It's position in the retail sector has giving a leeway that no other company can compete with, no matter how awful a decision is customers will still shop their due to their prices and stranglehold on the retail market."
bad,"I've been with Walmart over 5 years and I'm still at their minimum wage $11. They keep unproductive people and demand from those that work. Favoritism alone will get you ahead, not performance. In my store and the one I transferred from, good and fair management is rare. They schedule you such that a second job is impossible, unless you go part-time, so we stay poor."
bad,"I rather die than work for Walmart.  It is a very stressful job with horrible pay. It is not worth you stressing over this job for the little pay. They are always talking about ""picking up the pace"" , well how about you pick up the pay? No wonder walmart is the second retailer under amazon. So much improvement is needed for this company that they should open a position w to improve it."
bad,I really think Walmart is a bad company they really don't care how they treat they're employees. The employees that do there job they make sure they use them until they are used up and then they use them some more if they are able to. The employees that dont put forth the effort in they're job and task dont get held accountable and the workers that they used get used some more to clean up or fix what the other employees didn't do. If you wanna be a slave come to Walmart. That's how they treat the employees that really work and take pride in their job.
bad,Was put in a group in produce where i was doing everyones work. Had to work on my days off. No raise and no praise. It sucked wouldnt recommend working produce.
bad,La empresa no es tan mala sino la gente que labora ahi es la que mediente favoritismos les da mas prioridad que al trabajo de los empleados
bad,I worked at two different Walmarts leaving one thinking it would be better some where else I had an anxiety attack and got coached because I had to leave the register and started throwing up at the first Walmart II Walmart the store manager was sleeping with half the employees and impregnating them so he was kind of bias and allowing his managers to yell at employees in their faces
bad,Walmart is not a company I would recommend.  Unfortunately the support and care for their employees is not shown. Many people that have put in years have been let go because their positions were eliminated and they were told to reapply in other areas but there were no open positions.
bad,Save yourself the trouble and look elsewhere. You get underpaid for what you have to put up with. You will love the job at first but quickly realize the reasons to leave.
bad,The store manager told me that the company does not care if we want hours it only depends ion costumers only. I kept losing hours I will never ever go back to Walmart
bad,"Do not work at the most soulless abyss in America. Literally collect roadkill on the street for cash or sell your kidney instead. There is no career here. Random hours. Enjoy working 12 hours until midnight then randomly without notice being expected to show up at 5am the next day... without notice. Why can't they just GIVE YOU YOUR DAYS IN ADVANCE?"
bad,"The work was abysmal, management didn't know up from down half the time. If you had an issue with a customer they'd laugh at you and walk away leaving you with a very angry customer. Management constantly asked me what I knew how to do then eventually tried to put me on the backroom truck team, when I said no they tried to put me in clothes for a $2.00/hr pay cut and overall hours cut. Shop here if you want, definitely not a good place to work.."
bad,The health care you pay for is almost non existent. Be aware of how your treated and know your rights as an associate. There are definitely more cons then pros.
bad,"Graduated Walmarts support manager academy, which was cool. Also certified as a trainer on PLE which was a great "
bad,"i'll say this place is ok. not the greatest place to work at, some location yes but where i was at no, I've asked the manager so many time for a partner never happen. It's very stressful working alone they managers walk all over you."
bad,Bad environment. There no balance between work and school life. The mangers are rarely there and if there really doesn't care about giving a hand.....
bad,Walmart wasn't that good to work for they played favoritetism . The bosses treated you like disrespectful. They got away with to much stuff. They are rude people there.
bad,"Its who you know not what you know."
bad,"One of the worst jobs I ever had. Customers treat you like garbage because they act like they are better then you. They rarely promote from within, they hire a lot of outside people. If you do get promoted it’s only because you suck up to management. Was there for over 4 years and never got full time even when I asked for it. New people would start and get it right away. Don’t work here."
bad,"Poor customer service Poor management, retaliation and the list is too long. No flexibility in the schedule, no raise no benefits and no respect at all"
bad,"Would not refer anybody to work there. They degrade people, I don't ever want to go to a walmart again. I spent six years at that company and got two 22 cent raises. That sums it up!!!"
bad,"It's Walmart. No matter how much propaganda they use, the work culture is shot and the managers can be rally rude and inconsiderated. I broke my arm working here and they were close to avoid my medical bills."
bad,"Unprofessional"
bad,you stood at the door for your entire shift while people came in and out. management picked on people and made them feel really bad if they did not do as the manager wanted instead of being able to help the customer.
bad,Worst management I've ever dealt with. Unfairly treated & no management cares how other managers treat you. Overworking employees on a daily basis wondering why certain things dont get done.
bad,"Walmart is the worst place to work, as they take away most days on your schedule for no reason, they are unprofessional and all of the supervisors have favorites."
bad,to commit overnight for a year.  The managers work harder than the people they manage.  They treat you like a slave and you can never leave until you finish your notes.  It's a place where no one is professional including management and managers are consistently being put down.
bad,The Walmart I worked for was horrible! Management was rude half the time or just simply didn’t care. Only 1 out of 2 HR people was decent. Once you’re hired your are forgotten they could care less about you. Shame on this establishment.
bad,"The first week of working for Wal-Mart was alright, the CAP 2 position was labor intensive but not hard. After about a month of working here managment began treating me poorly. I honestly wouldn't send my worst enemy to work for Wal-Mart."
bad,Walmart at least were i worked didn't care for their workers just cared if you did the job right and if it was good to be shown to a customer which i didn't like
bad,"Management at Store 412 is atrocious! They create unrealistic expectations and when those expectations were not met, the store manager would belittle you to the point of emotional and mental exhaustion. Would not go back there or recommend anyone to that store even if it was a last resort"
bad,Managers are not loyalty they are not reliable. The have poor managenent skills and not team players at all. Employees are under paid for their with ethics.
bad,Remodeling It sucks to work for Walmart because you applied for one thing and then they make you reapply for another so what was I applied for remodeling thing that sucks so bad we had to carry this big on the metal thing would suck!!
bad,Honestly it was the worst place I’ve ever worked. Inconsistent schedule. Could be short people but won’t put you on schedule to work. Managers are just there to sit in the office and only do something when they get in trouble.
bad,"- Terrible scheduling that serves the company, not you. Your hours may be cut or changed on a whim to save the company a buck."
bad,"Always busy, short staffed, not enough pay for the stress and work load. Must be able to multitask every day. Changes every other week. Most changes make work harder and not simpler"
bad,unfair hours favoritism made to work holidays not family friendly couldn't get hours managers where races and lazy. I would not advise anyone with a family to work there
bad,I suggest you find another job; Walmart will cut you out if it means saving a few bucks. I never once felt a sense of security while working there. But the work was fairly easy.
bad,If you aren't part of the popular kids you get ignored and made fun of. They make you believe that you will be part of a team but its far from the truth. Employees spend more time talking about each other then working. Very toxic place to work and management is tied up in the drama as well.
bad,"They don't care about their employees ,quick to fire someone instead of talking and working out , mangers don't care and when you do something for them they take the credit for everything"
bad,"go in work freight do outs assist customers "
bad,This is a horrible place to work for unless you’re only there for a short time. They don’t care about your families or emergencies! Only way you’re getting promoted is if you’re a favorite and suck up.
bad,You are over worked and under paid! Short staffed and expected to do more than your share. If you are trying to support a family I suggest you look for a higher paying job.
bad,Overall it’s an okay company but there is no support and your always doing someone else’s job I work in a hostile environment and it’s so bad I don’t want to come to work most days
bad,"It is poorly ran. The people who make the decision are idiots with no idea how anything works all they see is numbers and want to rise them while cutting pay, staff or hours. Once I leave I won't even shop there again."
bad,Horrible place to work. Absolutely no way to have a home life. No benefits because they won't allow you to be hired on full time. Management is worse than the customers ever thought about being.
bad,You know that saying “if it’s not broke then don’t fix it”? Yeah that’s what Walmart is doing. Trying to fix something that wasn’t bad to begin with and make it difficult to work there.
bad,"It is all about appearances, and you'll be working with Managers standing over you telling you how to do everything down to the smallest detail. Point system is not fair and you will lose your job if you are sick or have to go to the Doctor; even if you call in."
bad,In the store I worked in it was always busy. Most time management would not schedule enough people. They hire you in part time then work you full time with out the benefits. They scheduled for 40 hrs/wk then drop you below every few weeks so you don't qualify for insurance! Pay door scanners more than cashier's whencashiers do 10 times more stupid! They promote based on who they like and are friends with. A girl that there less than a month got promoted and I was there 8 months and still stuck in the place. They also could care less about their employees.
bad,"Job wasn't too bad, we did a lot of work as cap 2 associates, unloading of trucks and stocking of shelves. Physical work. But the greeters and people that just stand there at self check-out got paid the same as us which was unfair I'd say. The management in that store was absolutely terrible. They did not know how to talk to people and there were so many of them that you never knew who your boss was in the first place. Awful experience. I was so looking forward to working there but it was disappointing."
bad,"Lots of turnover in management and work force. The store failed its last two visits. The store manager has one foot out the door and the store reflects his cavalier attitude. "
bad,Management sucks. They blame there short coming on lower employees. Walmart allowed a co manager to alter my info and never fixed it. Store manager was aware and allowed it.
bad,Very disappointed in management and how they treat people  they don’t care about people  bad work environment to work in  no room for advancement  won’t let you leave department
bad,Busy stressful at times they taught me how to stock and do inventory the hardest part was standing on them hard mats all day they hurt your foot after standing along period of time
bad,"This place is not worth it, look some where else for work, store manager don’t do anything but sit on her butt or tell someone else to do it, but it’s ok I’m putting my 2weeks in"
bad,As long as the manager wasn't their the days could be less stressful. Did not care if you had a family emergency you were expected to be there. I broke my foot not there but was expected to stand on it for my full shift
bad,Misbehaving supervisors and it's not at all advisable for someone who is educated enough to get better jobs. Even the lunch breaks are unpaid. I would not recommend this job.
bad,"It's a place that allows managers to bully its employees in some cases to a point of them having anxiety attacks in the store! Work morale is poor! Everyone in the place in constant fear and walking on eggshells on a daily basis! Very sick workplace, firing people for even the smallest things also half their reasons were for their own personal issues with the employees they decide they don't .llike for what l"
bad,"This is not a place you want to work. You only get 5 occurrences now. If you call out on a holiday, in which they don't pay you for any of them, you get 2 occurrences.They cut hours drastically and don't care if you have kids or if you are sick. I'm part time and I went from getting 33 hours to 25 hours to 9 hours a week. You can't make a living off of that. Walmart doesn't care about their employees. . The scheduling is horrible which explains why there is rarely any associates available to check the customers out."
bad,They have very poor management skills and they don't communicate with one another. You will always have two different managers telling you to do two different things. They don't care about you they see you as being replaceable.
bad,Temporary job setting if you are trying to get back on your feet. Nothing very permanent at this company as most management do not view as an asset but more of a pawn.
bad,The worse place to work management dont care about any associates always short staffed  managers dont say a word to you beside demand work never hear them greet you so sad its suppose to be family company but sure dont see where  they dont deserve  not 1 star
bad,benefits too high to purchase too much favoritism to certain employees only get 10% discount but not on food can only get that in November they don't care about their employees
bad,"The only review I have with Walmart is the people I work with and the customers."
bad,"if i can get a good boss then u will be fine if not it sucks everyday"
bad,I hated that job the store manager gave a a attitude problem ... the managers all messing with EACHOTHER it’s all bad in there .. so glad I’m gone .. I hate it there
bad,This Company is about making money off your broken body that they have created through over work and under staffing on purpose so the top management get there big bonuses quarterly.  Less payroll more money for them. Do your own research on reviews for working for this Company I wish I would never have gotten a job at Walmart you are just a #.
bad,"Management doesn’t treat people with respect or any dignity. They slave you when you do work and you will not get many hrs due to self check outs and tax payer aka government subsidized foreign student employees.  Everyone I worked with have pretty well quit due to not being able to survive. My advice , find a better job."
bad,"Not a great place to work for, I don't think they know what are doing, its always about making money I hate the holidays no time with family, they should close the store for the holidays, management needs to be more respect for the employees and they don't, like I said before it all about making money"
bad,"Minimal pay, unrealistic expectations and not enough people scheduled to cover shifts. Conflict of interest between managers-trained the “best way” but don’t follow that! "
bad,This place doesn't care about you. You are just there for the job. Nobody that works there is friendly or have any interest in talking to anyone except the customers is they need help.
bad,id advise you to seek better employment. As the walmart team is meant for none other than crazy people. Trust me you are better than this. Anything is better than this
bad,I felt that mangers from the front end favored certain workers and they treated certain workers better then others . I felt like I couldn’t be myself there
bad,Management was all over the place and not cohesive at all. The different managers would pull me to different areas constantly and I could not ever take care of my customers for my area nor keep up with my area. Management would always try to put me on the registers even though I had a doctor's note saying not to do that because it would cause my social anxiety to act up and I would have constant panic attack's when put on the registers. As for my typical days at work I would get to work early like normal and clock in on time and I would go ahead and start trying to organize my area and get stuff done in my area like my department manager wanted me to but about an hour or so into it the other department managers would always pull me to their sections because they can't find their own workers do to them skipping out and of course I would always help out because that's how I am but they would do this every single time I worked which would always constantly cause me to be away from my area for hours on end and if I had customers I had to practically run from one side of the store to the other just to get to the customers and by the time I'd get to the customers they would be mad and of course I would explain what happened and they would usually understand. All I learned was to barely work the pricing gun and that my section of the store did not matter and that I pretty much had to be a dog on a leash for the other managers otherwise they would end up trying to write me up. The workplace culture for this particular Walmart is completely toxic and unworkable because all of the managers
bad,"The Customer Service Manager is responsible for providing a productive and motivating working environment, and addressing any issues/disputes from customers or clients. A Customer Service Manager job description generally includes: Delivering a comprehensive service to enquiring customers. ... Managing customers' accounts."
bad,"Working at Wal-Mart was not a very good experience for me. The managers, if they.dont like you will find ways to write you up just so they can fire you.  They will even tell lies to keep you from getting your unemployment insurance. I ought to know because they kept me out of my unemployment insurance by telling a bunch of lies. I even fell and I never received any help."
bad,"Walmart is trying to replace all of their staff with machines majority of the managers I work with I enjoyed working with but there are some that got away with making verbal and physical threats And racist remarks to both race gender sexual orientation ETC, And got away with it So I would not  Recommend anyone working for Walmart"
bad,I only suggest you work here if you absolutely have to. They will keep you as a part time employee at 39 hours per week in order to keep you from qualifying for benefits. The management is all moronic and are forced to force feed you whatever the corporate overlords have decided the flavor of the week is.
bad,I hope never to work there again my manager was the bomb but the store manager has no skills false accusations and he will not listen to anything u say and beleives u lie
bad,"Management sucked! If you asked for help  they made fun of you. And you could hear them arguing over the radios on who would help. It reminded me of high school and the ""open door policy "" is a complete joke! I had to call the higher ups because of discrimination and that made it even worse for me. I will never work for for Walmart again"
bad,Pay was trash and hours were all over the place. Managers and supervisors was not good at their jobs. Hard to move up. Tried to change my schedule and they told me no.
bad,"if you were not young, cute and hispanic, (at least at my location) you had no chance of advancement. Worked for the company since 2004 and didnt get paid more than $12.00 a hour. They ask you to give them the time your able to work and punish you if your not able to work anytime they wanted to schedule you. when I left I was only getting 10 hours a week. They can care less about your family obligations."
bad,"Awful management only get 3 off days for the first 90 days or you get fired doctor's excuse aren't acceptable. Awful work conditions awful"
bad,This place is a joke poor management who care nothing about there employees. They like to run you in the ground and when your short handed instead of helping out with the work load they will complain and tell you to hurry up and then just walk off.
bad,I worked at 4601 in las cruces for the walmart on rinconada. I would make sure not to work at this location the store manager deanna leyva is ridiculously rude and disrespectful. I dont know how walmart can hire someone with none of there value's they supposedly go by. Even the district manager rey is corrupt. How do they make someone thats been to prison be the district manager. Very shady stuff going on in las cruces Wal-Mart's.
bad,"not a bad place to work, decent management, decent pay, long shifts, not a lot of overtime if any at all. dealing with the public will be your biggest concern."
bad,"A typical day at work was getting there at my normal morning start time. Working for two hours and usually getting my break really late, then working two more hours to get my lunch and hour or more late, and finally getting my last break on time and never getting out on time. I learned to check people out at the register, layaway, OGP, jewelry, self-checkout, and check out with me. Management is absolutely ridiculous. They were horrible, always had a bad attitude. The managers act like they were too good to have a conversation with a normal associate. Was involved in two different occasions, one being assulted on the job (the person got a slap on the wrist) another a manager was harrassing me."
bad,"OK job, fast paced, heavy work expected to load 50lb boxes every day. Managers expected more than you can do in a work day. Job was extremely stressful and they expected more than what you can handle."
bad,I did not like working some where for if I have flu where I have not job. For I ne at work on time and ever late. I all way tell the truth. I believe be I g a good cashier that customers come thru my line where 😃 when then was sad. I help them feel good shopping at Wal-Mart for if I feel that Wal-Mart can't be thankful for helping customer enjoy shopping there then this not place for me and other.  good worker I do know Love make other feel good shopping for. Companies.
bad,management lacks the ability to properly manage people  they just don't care  it baffles the minds of normal people how a company can hire such idiots for management and still succeed . They treats staff with utter contempt .constantly adding new tasks to be completed each shift so has to not have to hire more people .
bad,"The company overworked me to the point that I was sick every day, punished me for being sick, then put me in a position I didn’t get training for and got fired over a mistake"
bad,"Poor place to work. Poor management. "
bad,Nothing special about it but low salary. It will not help your cost of living to be fair. It is below salary and harder for you to pay bills on time. More people quit it and look for better salary
bad,i was fired for calling off because i had to go to the ER and accumulated to many absense/tardy points for their policy. absence/tardy policy is why they have such a high turnover percentage at the end of every quarter.
bad,"The place sucks, management is rude, pay is to low, they lie to u all the time about important things. The expect u to kiss butt to get anywhere, and when ur being harrassed by another employee nothing is done about it."
bad,"It isn't a very good place to work for, they don't treat their employees very well and allow favoritism and retaliation to happen in the workplace. its just a bad place to be overall."
bad,Stay away from Walmart!!! They treat you like robots. Not worth it. Mean management. Unfriendly people. Stay away. No benefits. No paid sick time. Poor management.
bad,Shows a lot of favoritism all rules doses not apply for all didn’t feel comfortable talking to HR they tell who call then the mangers harass you until they can fire you
bad,"Management is sneaky and disrespectful I wouldn’t refer anyone to this store , everyone move wrong and it’s not a good environment. The mangers and staff can be very cruel ."
bad,Walmart not a good companies to work for it has no concern or interest in their Associates it is all profit-driven for the bottom line for the store no respect for employees privacy
bad,Walmart does not care about the employees.  They cut hours and benefits.  No compassion for family or yourself.  They don't care how hard you work or dedication.  Your just a number.
bad,"I have worked at Walmart for 8 years and a lot have changed in that 8 years. Like we use to get paid vacations, now they have pto hours. Witch you have to work up to. I work 8-9 hours per day for 5 days a week and it takes a whole month to work up to having 13 hours of pto time off. They use to give annual raises and now they give you nothing. If your store is doing well then you may get a $50 bonus. but that’s it."
bad,"If the management does not like or favor you. you go no where.I finished my cbl,s and my management assessment test and ,AND passed the 1st time.yet management put 5 people before me,and test were still active.and I know of at least 4 people didn't pass the test....need i say more.store 2366...n.attleboro ma,"
bad,It sounds crazy to say but one if the hardest labor intensive job I've ever worked and the management is very rude and will not work with you no matter what.
bad,"Management has no Idea what they're doing"
bad,I left Walmart because the managers weren't good at all. they were always yelling in peoples faces. and never to be found. I was pregnant and they weren't understanding that I could lift anything really heavy.
bad,"I gained a lot of experience working at Wal-Mart. But overall, the job was pretty miserable and the poor management made it almost unbearable. I felt very underappreciated, considering all the effort and energy I put into doing my job and helping customers."
bad,For the amount if work you are not payed what your worth. Managment sucks. If you're there for 4 years expect to be paid the same as a new employee that hasn't even gotten license.
bad,Terrible management. You should be able to ask a manager for assistance without them responding with an attitude and huffing and puffing. You also shouldn't get directed to supervisor to supervisor because they're not all on the same page and neither of them know whats going on.
bad,No appreciation for their managers they will work you to death and then fire you for grabbing someone’s arm because you were concerned. 5 years of dedicated work and they just let me go
bad,"It was an ok place to work. Just could be very stressful most of the time. Easy job, just not the environment I need to be in. For someone else it could be a great job"
bad,"High turnover rate, bad management,  nobody's on the same page, only apply if you REALLYYY need a job... easiest job I ever had, worst managment and environment I ever been in"
bad,If you don’t fit in with the store management you don’t do well. They try to get rid of you. Store management micro manages everything. Stressful place to work and the money they pay isn’t enough to deal with the problems. Told that you can’t stay in your store for a promotion while others are promoted in the same store with no experience.
bad,The store that I work at is horrible. Management doesn't care about their employees. All they care about is themselves. I would not recommend anyone to work at this location
bad,"Family working under each other. no advancement unless you are part of the click.  Fighting, gossip, retaliation for reporting abuse.  Favoritism,  abuse of power from supervisors, not enough staff to cover any shift."
bad,Walmart has changed a lot since I have worked there! Walmart is always changing. They are currently in the process of reformatting their Structure in a “team environment” getting rid of store middle management and salary management. They hire part time now with little to no chance of full time and they expect u to b available all time. They recently rearranged their vacation and sick/personal accrual. If you call off u lose ur incentive bonus. It’s a joke anymore! Not worth working!
bad,Walmart doesn’t care about you in the past two years it has gotten worst I hated going to work they showed favoritism between management I would never want to work there again
bad,The store manager at the Hammond In location Cabela Drive suck he feel he can talk to you any kind of wat and when you stand up for yourself he have other managers fire you if your not a yes man no man person he has it out for you
bad,When I first started everyone in management seems okay. After being there almost two years and seeing the turn over of associates it was ridiculous. Management Always blamed my cap 2 team when the back room looked bad on a two truck night. When the team was so little and the Trucks were so large. There was never enough people to cover  all locations and they complained about stuff out of our control. I Don't recommended working at this store if you want a cap 2 position
bad,"Unless you like dealing with alot of racial-bias company bs, then I would highly recommend you not apply for this job. You won't get anywhere unless you the ""right skin colour."""
bad,"First Off, Walmart is not this great place that they claim to be. 2. Upper Management and Lower Management is a joke, it would be better if they were Business Savvy. Short staffed and unrealistic expectations!!!"
bad,"I only stayed that long for the customers, and after I got full time they made sure I so not work over 32 hours a week. Its just what you hear and see, Walmart is just about their money not about the people"
bad,Get 3 absences and tardiness and you were let go.  Did NOT take Dr excuses on why you were out. Even if your contagious and nose running they want you to come in. They say wear a mask. I thought that was awful. Even you were in the hospital or surgery.
bad,I was an overnight stocker and they decided to move my team to days where we have to deal with customers and a paycut they also expect you to work harder and not take lunch until 2 hours before your shift is over. My hours were also cut.
bad,"I worked on the volunteer parkway Bristol Tennessee in the Deli no matter how hard you worked it was never enough. We were always under staffed and if someone called in they expected you to do it all. Cut the meats cook and then clean the entire deli but did not want you to get overtime"
bad,Management is careless and only cares about what corporate has to say. Corporate doesn’t even step foot in the place unless it’s time for an Audit. CSM’s are against the cashiers and are terrible at coaching/training individuals. May I continue or does this seem like the dream?
bad,"The worse job I ever had. They stress you out and want you to do so much physical work by yourself and get mad when you. Then treat you poorly if you don't finish on time. Had to stock 7-10 plus pallets almost every night by yourself. And they hound you every hour to 30 minutes"" if your done yet"" or "" how much more"" ""you""ythiabout of time"
bad,"Store 170 was an awful experience. Our store manager blamed department managers and staff for his mistakes and let us face the consequences. Corporate didn't care. I ended up leaving because the environment became so toxic I would puke before walking into the store from anxiety alone. "
bad,For people not wanting to think for themselves. Careless management and unprofessional supervisors. Decent pay but not worth it. This is not a place to settle.
bad,The companies commercials say they are about family but that's not the case. They don't care about their employees. They are slave drivers that will threaten you with your job if things don't get done no matter the situation.
bad,This company treats there associates like slaves there is no incentives for associates there quarterly bonus should be automatic not based on how much the store makes a quarter. They should pay associated more hourly than the minimum wage . There should be be 5 days sick pay instead or accumulating PTO... just sucks working for a company that makes BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YR
bad,Only work here as a last resort or if you are in high school.  This is not a permanent job even if you work at the home office.  They regularly lay off their employees or change their schedules to one that the individual can not work.
bad,Management was rude except to much in time give don't take into consideration how busy store gets store manager was rude and very disrespectful towards employees
bad,"Everything about this place is horrible. The management from your market managers to market human resources is a joke. The store managers are horrible and they are disrespectful to their associates. They just started paying at a decent rate, however they verbally abuse their associates daily and it's an accepted culture. That's why there's no customer service at Walmart and the associates are horrible. The management team is chasing numbers and not working on the culture of their store."
bad,It was a good company to work for but they just need work under New Management. I felt that oftentimes management would ignore problems and fail to resolve them and a professional and timely manner.
bad,"The first moment I walked into Walmart, I noticed that the long time employees would not make eye contact and seem to be like beat down dogs. All they would do during lunch and breaks is sit around a table and complain about all of the benefits Walmart had taken from them.  Any employee over fifty appears to be crippled in varying degrees from hours and hours of standing on the concrete floors. In two weeks, I began to feel pain in my knees from standing all shift. The cashiers in California had to sue Walmart to get chairs at their checkout. I did the Asset Protection in which you rescan the Valued Customer's groceries coming out of the line. I had several Valued Customers cuss me out, accusing me of accusing them of stealing. For the most part however, the American populace are like sheep and go with what ever they are told, as if it will benefit them in some way. The only people that it benefits is Sam Walton's spoiled, greedy children. By doing this, they are trying to make sure that their cashiers are not sliding merchandise without scanning and charging for it. Seems like to me, they are jumping over dollars to save dimes. Overall, it was a sad experience that only seems like a short, bad dream. I was there only a month. The managers get huge bonuses if they keep payroll down and profits up so, as a lowly associate, you are merely cannon fodder for their higher aspirations. If that is what you want to deal with, have at it, but I love myself too much to have these lame misfits cause me any grief at all."
bad,They are prejudiced only Spanish people they hire very little white and black is not very store to work bad management. I wouldn't recommend any one to work there unless your Spanish
bad,"Worst place in the world to work for.. "
bad,"Flexible working hours contract only. No paid breaks. Must work bank holidays/christmas/new year. Dismissal for 3 times off sick in a 6 month period. "
bad,"Bad management, poor staff,no communication at all. Over worked under paid. Managers don't help with customers. They hide in office. You get cussed out assault no help"
bad,They work you like you are suppose to live there 24/7. You have no work/life balance. Upper mgt. Verbally tear you down & expect you to perform more when you are down in mgt as well.
bad,"Company does not care about rules and regulations. Sadly its all about the money. One day the rules will be strict, the next day its something completely different. constantly getting yelled at for no reason at all."
bad,"Management is literally inecperienced in terms of how to tackle with associates."
bad,Only a few managers are pretty good at their jobs but overall they r horrible. Mean with no respect for fellow coworkers. Bad mouthing customers cutting hours changing scheduls without notice. Horrible.
bad,"Management didn't care about employees, I go to school and asked for less hours and I never got my hours cut. Management is also very rude and will over load associates with work making it impossible to finish a work day correctly. They made me, a new associate, work the jewelry and fitting room while everyone else went to lunch. I got fired because of a hurricane coming through,  didn't have a way to get to work for a few days so They let me go"
bad,"Floor managers don’t like you or your not willing to do every  thing they don’t want to bend over and do themselves your on there list."
bad,"Bad Management, not enough hours , other employees are always wanting in your business. They are suppose to have an open door policy well good luck with that and if you do get to talk to management the run straight to the person you went to them over and tell them everything you said"
bad,worst management  i have ever seen no holiday pay only overtime when managers are in trouble they don’t care about associates at all i would suggest firing every manager
bad,"Stressful not enough employees and too much work, no benefits, workplace culture is terrible, there is a lot of preference to some employees. co- workers are abusive"
bad,Terrible job don’t work their! Walmart could care less about you and you’re families wellbeing! Just a horrible place to work! Won’t even go back their to shop!
bad,Working at walmart is a joke...Sucks. Management is a joke.The pay sucks for the amount of work performed.Management has no idea what there doing and most if not all stand around with there head up there butt thinking of some stupid idea to come with next
bad,May be good for some people depending on your own personal life situations . For some it may pay enough for others the pay rate is Way below standards
bad,Been with the company over six years and has gotten worse every year. Would never recommend anyone to work for this terrible company. Honestly regret wasting so much time with the company.
bad,Just dont get treated very fairly and they dont give you the opportunity to advance even though you have done everything that you need to in order to advance.  They pick favorite
bad,"The hours were never consistent, you never had 2 days off together.  Management was poor, the shelves were never stocked, the customers just tore the store apart!"
bad,wouldn't reccomend minot walmart management was very rude and i hated every minute of being there but would rather work at a california walmart to see how it is .
bad,"please dont waste your time place is horrible to work for. would hate to see anyone go there and waste there time. wont let excel or anything, look elsewhere first"
bad,It was poor and they had terrible management. They made me wait a whole month before my check cleared through there system. Then they fired me because i was off Tuesday and i went to the hospital because i was pregnant and they said i needed to come in on my day off but i was extremely sick due to my pregnancy.
bad,Was the worst job I ever had besides Lowes  They are the very worst. Plan on no life  and being bounced every shift to different departments to suit their needs   don't plan on a life and never get two days off in a row.  Turn over is bad and they make u work mandatory holidays or be fired
bad,"No appreciation from management for all the hard work completed, no pay raises."
bad,"Don't do it !!!! Favortism, poor managers, this company sucks the life out of you, empty promises,  90 % of the staff are miserable but have families to feed so they stay, could just be the one I worked at but seriously doubt it"
bad,I hated working there.  I hated working there.  The worst job I've ever had.  I wouldn't suggest anyone to work there.  It's the worst job out there...
bad,"My review is very short. They treat you like a school kid. If you take a day off, doctor's note ands all, you get a POINT - 5 points and you are fired. My wife needed a pacemaker put in and I took 2 days off and got 2 points, then was asked to resign. I wouldn't work there if my heartbeat depended on it."
bad,"There was no air up front.  We had a customer trow up and pass out, had to call an ambulance.  I am a type 1 diabetic, but wasn't allowed to keep juice at my register.  I had to have a ambulance called for me.  My sugar went low then I had a seizure right at my register.  I loved my front end people, but do not like Wal-Mart."
bad,"Every manager had their favorite employees that would do nothing and get away with it while others got yelled at for not picking up their slack, if you did do more than what you were supposed to they'd say ""that's how it should be everyday"" as opposed to a simple ""good job""."
bad,"Awful inconsistent hours"
bad,Terrible place to work.  I took the job after retiring fro a long term social services career with the provincial government.  Thought it would be a good place to work part time in my retirement.  Was sadly mistaken.  I was eventually fired and a black mark was out on my file because I didn’t answer my phone from my supervisor while I was in a courtroom.  They put in my record that I was unethical.
bad,I have never worked anywhere else that had such poor management don’t work there it’s the worst. I wouldn’t recommend that place to my worst enemy I don’t know how anyone work there willingly
bad,"I think I should get hired back at Walmart  There are a lot of favoritism . Managers, store Managers are not being fair. It's all about how are gonna change"
bad,"I worked with a lot of unfriendly people, there were favorites, too much training every month you had to be on the computer for more training in departments that you didn't work in"
bad,"You get no training or directions of what to do. You'll be left on your own to figure everything out and you're expected to magically know what to do.my  manager don't want to be talked to and she made sure I regret it if I ever had to talk to her for whatever reason (snappy, condescending, rude ,disrespectful and no help at all times) she's very passive aggressive, arrogant, nasty and treat her staff like garbage."
bad,leadership outside of Home Office Area is very poor. Work environment is not conducive for family life and the pay is the minimum it can be for salaried positions. Company wants to make the assistant managers work more hours and have greater responsibility because they do not pay the assistant managers as much as other leadership positions therefore putting MORE money into the company's pocket on the backs of the lower leadership positions.
bad,My wife was having health issues at the time going to chemotherapy in they would give me are hard time about leaving work to be with her it may have been just the store I worked at but it was an toxic environment
bad,I would never want anyone to work at Walmart because of the frud they have commit in my name.have taken money from my banks  .and  have stolen to many hours.
bad,"Everybody is so nice i really loved working there. I really liked all the customers you get so familiar with them, and become like family  , same with the employees."
bad,"It's not a place I would ever want to work or recommend working, but sometimes you just don't have a lot of options.  I've never had a worse job and it would be hard for another to compete."
bad,"The hours are awful, the pay matches. The people running the store i.e. managers are subpar with nearly no experience and it shows. The schedules are constantly changing week to week."
bad,Good retail experience but that's it. Horrible management and absolutely no team effort in the foods department. Got fired for being a type 1 diabetic and having low blood sugars on the job while being understaffed and over worked.
bad,Never see any of the managers unless you are getting documented for something you did wrong.  This is a very corporate mentality management style.  Everything seems to be decided above the general manager.
bad,over all dont work there unless you are desperate. Bechtle ave. job is terribel place to work. people really dont care. treat you like cattle. dont care at all. dont work there.
bad,This corporation spends more money on internal p.r. to convince employees they have a good job than they do on making it even a decent job. Employees are completely replaceable and disposable. They do not value their staff at all. Regional management literally told us if we don't like something about our jobs we should just go someplace else.
bad,didn't enjoy working in the cold thy treat employees as if they cant find employment else where.  Managers needs better peoplr skils.  And that thing about not taking doctors excuses is a joke.
bad,This company was very difficult to work for. The environment was terrible and the management was poor at best. While wages were ok they cut my hours from 35 to 0 per week which forced me to relocate.
bad,"one of the wrst places i have ever worked, everything is harded then it needs to be, you will written up for just about eveything, they dont tell you anyhting, just a awful place."
bad,Very poor management run us up to the sixth hour registers locked us out kicked us off the time clock.  Company in all sucks would never advise anyone to work there.
bad,"I worked for various sects under the Walmart name, both in-store and call center related jobs.  While in store I had several issues with various managers including the store manager. I was being asked to perform duties that were not a part of my job description, not given credit when completing them, as well as, performing some duties that were not safe for one person to do ,or were not safe in the conditions in which I had to work.  "
bad,"Working as a tech in the Pharmacy that I was specifically hired in, considering that it was my first pharmacy job, I don’t believe was a very healthy job or environment. Shifts are rarely rotated so I was closing every week day till 9, usually by myself or with one other technician. The stress was beyond its control and starting to cause health problems which didn’t seem to concern neither my manager or the technicians that said they can only work mornings. So i would not recommend working at a Walmart Pharmacy, especially now that they cut hours and started laying people off."
bad,Is bad when you work for a company and the people are not the problem its the company people that they hire that you don’t wanna work for who takes control over and beyond their heads management everywhere is horrible they’ll let you get fired before they try to help you
bad,"WalMart is a multi-billion dollar global corporation, but they are nothing but suit case pimps. They only want to use you where they see fit and however it benefits them. They hire you under false pretenses. They hire you and schedule you for one position, but want to cross-train you and place you at various positions without increasing or adjusting your compensation. Nothing but a bunch of insincere, nasty crooks. 🖕 🖕of"
bad,"Recently applied for a part time position. Got email invite to an interview for advertised position. Arrived and was told this role (there were 2 actually) had been filled! So why was I even there?? I was convinced to apply for something else, which I wasn't too keen on as it wasn't really a job I was interested in. I went home and thought about it, deciding if I was selected I would just decline. Two days later I get an email stating that I had been hired - for the position I'd ORIGINALLY applied for, so I was quite pleased. Went through the necessary background check and chose my Orientation date. I arrived for that and was told that I actually DIDN'T get the position I thought I had (all the emails I'd received said I did), but I had the one I wasn't too keen on from my interview and had planned to decline!  Talk about a huge let down. Very messy and unprofessional way to hire people."
bad,"no moving up"
bad,They don't even pay good they work u till they don't need u then take days away from u .u can be the best worker there but if u get 5 points just for come in late like 3 min they well let u go
bad,Walmart is ghetto. The workers are rude to the customers. The CSRs will tell you to give the customers a discount if they say the cost of a product is different but in the long run it hurts you and will get you fired.
bad,Nothing promised is ever done. Lies. Did not care about anything but how much money you spent. The management was horrible and irresponsible. Talked about you when walk away.
bad,The work environment as well as scheduling inconsistencies made this a difficult company to stay with. My schedule required open availability around the clock even after the probation period when they assured it could be changed.
bad,"I have been in orientation for 1 month and ive never had my manager check on my progress, ive asked multiple times to talk to her about my schedule and she keeps alluding me. She"
bad,"Depending upon how your typical walmart store is run, ( the store i worked for should be renamed, FOREIGNERMART, or RETARDMART ) people as in employees have no clue of what they are doing, no knowledge of the products or very little if at all, no work ethic, managment cannot be trusted, they lie about situations, bear false witness against you for their personal gain, the system put in place by sam walton is a smoke screen ,these people at corporate headquarters  dont care one iota about their employees despite this ad campaign for family atmosphere, dont be fooled greed and personal  gain is what runs walmart, workplace is  an unsafe, safety hazard osha violations everywhere, but no  sanctions  or penalties. from so called agencys?  harassment and vendictive retaliation from  assistant managers runs  rampant, hipocracy is a large factor of this store, employees are very unsettled about everything about this store and their future, think very hard about working for a company such as walmart, dont know how  a normal person could act or treat anyone with such disrespect and lay your head down on a pillow each night knowing that you are a hated and despised entity. remember the days when you worked hard and were commended for it , good job miss/ mr. no integrity, feelings or ...respectibilty..this greedy self- absorbed  company is  an  embarassment  to  honest hardworking americana."
bad,it may be a good company but the management sucks they have showed no appreciation out of the hardware people do they cut your time and make you feel like you're feeling get fired
bad,"They promote without experience and it falls on the team to make up for the lack of management. poor work environment, terrible attitude and leadership skills from management"
bad,Dont waste your time working for this giant company. Help out your local neighborhood stores. Walmart does not value their associates you're just working to make someone else look good without even a thanks in return. They want their work done regardles of what you can and cant do and yo3y as an associate ARE expandable theyll replace you in a heart beat. Find someone who values you as a human being and not a working tool.
bad,"Walmart is a very racist based placed an they ( management ) will lie on staff to cover they trail. I did a full day's work an got coached could run the cameras back.   Next day I'm at work all day doing what I'm supposed to do an I get fired bc destiny the white newly made suporvisior who doesn't know what shes doin lied to the head of the store which was a new guy who been Thea 1 day Kno his workers,dude thought I was there a week an I been working the going on three months.. she told him I cursed at her an wouldn't run the cameras back to see the truth ... They target employees"
bad,I don't like it Walmart very much it is a horrable place to work .I need a new job please help me to do that. I do not know how to tell you how bad it is.
bad,Job is easy there are times when you have to work by yourself from 4:00am until 1:00 pm management will not send any help. Poor equipment lack of freight
bad,"Just don't do it, it's not worth the stress and anxiety. Management is horrible, and the workload expectations are way too high for one person to do. Grossly understaffed as well."
bad,it was the worst company I worked for. they punshish the people who work hard and the ones that just slack off get slaps on the wrist. I had applied to five different postions and got denied everytime and was give dumb answers as to why I wasn't chosen
bad,"Flex schedule means work when you are available but they only schedule on days/times that you aren't.  Then they say it's your responsibility to get those shifts covered."
bad,"Soul crushing, brain deadening, and generally depressing place to be.  I was only working here because I was on the down and out.  Some people don't mind the work.  I was not one of them"
bad,rules change every time management change poor training no loyalty to employees no respect for long time employees the work very fast paced at all times
bad,Walmart is a terrible place to work. Yeah they pay more but good luck getting hours. They’re a joke.walmart does not care about its employees. They will lie and tell you you’re full time until you’re hired on and then they tell you you’re part time in the system so no benefits or bonuses and 18 hours a week or less.
bad,"Management was surly and unhelpful for new employees. When I asked were I could find certain shelves for our project, was told to ""Go and find them"". Being new, I didn't know all the storage areas or even where the shelves were kept. Senior employees just standing around on their cell phones ignoring customers....I was embarrassed to work there."
bad,"Management can seen to get there stuff together there and some people that work there are on drugs, this is a bad place to work, they won't give you house to eve add up."
bad,Working at Walmart there is a point system for your tardiness as well as your call offs you can only call off five times and after that you will be fired
bad,Managed do not care about your well being just want you to work. They do not respect availability nor do they explain all the benefits that you have. It is ridiculous. Great entry job but you will be very quick to find another job.
bad,"Got hired as a cashier. On the very first day of orientation, the manager jumps right in (skipping the ""hello, welcome to walmart"" and all that) and says ""So, I'm sure you've all heard that Walmart doesn't treat its employees very well. Moving on."" WHAT???? What kind of first impression are you giving a new employee by saying THAT?!? I quit after a few months because, like that manager said, the employees were treated horribly. No consideration for emergency family time off, no interest in how your day is going or how you're feeling. No personal touch at all. Go find a Target or a grocery store to work at.... Walmart treats employees like dirt."
bad,"Beyond terrible place to work. I worked there for 9 years and I was fired for making a threat towards my co-workers. They hire worthless people who will do anything to ruin your life. Being harrassed by co-workers, made fun of, picked on. I couldn't just be left alone to do my job. Was trying to get off of 3rd Shift and they refused. They refused to promote me after working there for 9 years. Everytime I requested vacation time off, they refused. I went above and beyond helping everyone including my co workers and I got stabbed in the back. Most management are also terrible human beings. They have no brains, no college, just other worthless peoplep. STAY AWAY! Your life and happiness DEPEND ON IT!!!"
bad,"I was a Cart Pusher/Stockman here for about 4 months. I quit because of the way they treated me and attempted to deny my 1 hour lunch break which is a violation in FEDERAL LAW. "
bad,Redding Walmart is the second busiest in the entire state of California.  The problem is that 1.  It is too big  2.  There are three entrances and exits  rather than like Costco or Target where there is one way in and out.  Thus shoplifting abounds. 3.  Target sells the same stuff but the store in laid out to actually look upscale.   Walmart is walmart.  But they have good prices on a few things like toilet paper and coffee.  I just got tired of freezing standing out side in the winter guarding the Garden center gate watching people steal stuff.
bad,"My managers never have time to answer questions or help you with situations the managers are never there are always gone or can't take a call"
bad,"No recomiendo trabajar aqui, trabajas mucho por muy poco, no respetan tu rol de turnos te dejan más días de cierre que de apertura por qué le dan prioridad a jefes y a los amigos de los gerentes"
bad,This company always exspected to much from there employees and didn’t want to pay them the right amount of money for all the hard work that the employees would do. Also the managers didn’t even know that there employees were type 1 diabetics
bad,This place is the best paying job in this area however they do not pay fairly for the difficulty of the work and the constant increases in production. The company will constantly raise your production goal and write you up if you don’t meet the goal but they don’t raise your wage when you have to work twice as hard because they keep upping it
bad,"A long time ago, Wal-Mart was a satisfying place to work, however, it is not an enjoyable place to work anymore!"
bad,"Management is terrible, Good employee's are verbally degraded for not going faster when they are the fastest of the shift. They push unreasonable expectations."
bad,the treatment manager would treat u was not great.  the work they put on you was always to much and had to get it done in certain time was stupid you could not get it done.  the list goes on I could write a book with Walmart.
bad,"Walmart is trying to catch up with Amazon, but from what I saw they have a long way to go. They use Microsoft Cloud Azure. They have a significant turn over in staff, probably due to the poor managers. In particular, my manager knows how to say all the current buzzwords, but he has no clue what the words actually mean."
bad,"Management is terrible"
bad,"-New hires earn more than you"
bad,"This is going to be a long story, so I'll add a summary at the end of it all. Please bear with me."
bad,Cons far outweigh the pros at Walmart Distribution. Extremely poor management from the GM and down. I've never seen a company so unorganized and without good direction. I'm left wondering if they're trying to run the business into the ground.
bad,They have no professionalism if it hit them in the face. Truly disrespectful and pretend to care about you but don't. They are so short staffed because the way management treat employees. I don't think Walmart knows what customer serivce is. The only reason people go there is because it's cheap. Need to have high standards and management is low of the low.
bad,"A typical day of work consisted of unloading trucks and putting stuff on the shelf. I did not learn anything. Management treated everyone like garbage, expecting you to do exactly what they want or you would likely get written up. The workplace culture was immature and unprofessional. The hardest part of the job was trying to be on the nice side of management. The most enjoyable part of the job were the longer breaks."
bad,Concerned about the companies over reliance on automation instead of face to face human interaction. Maybe one day the company will remember that is was the people that made it what it was.
bad,Walmart was a slow paced environment to work in with very poor managers who did not seem to care very much about the work that they were doing. I hope to not work here again.
bad,"I was hired for a personal shopper role ,  at time of hire they was aware I couldnt work weekends and agreed to my set days.  Well after 3 weeks in I was no longer on the schedule and the mgr kept telling me she would look at it,   then she said well if you can work some weekends I can get you on the schedule"
bad,This job isn't for everyone. Get on someone in powers good side and stay there only then will you make it for any length of time. They arn't fair......
bad,It was awful working here the management was always rude and didnt care about the employees at all. Our breaks were always messed up. An the way they messed with our schedules without notice.
bad,"na There are things that could be done differently. Higher Management are not great with customers or employees, It is not organized and it does not follow."
bad,Walmart is not a good job for those who want a first job. Yes it pays good but its a horrible place to work. The people are so rude and if your still in school they dont care about that they will work you until you cant work anymore
bad,Bad management from the head down to the shift managers....unless you are family or kiss their butt hey will get rid of you and when you ask for proof from manager lies they say no. Even the assistant store manager said no
bad,Literally the worst place to work. The pay sucks and is every other week. The managers are all under the age of 25 so are complete idiots. No experience in the job or even in life. They cannot seem to get on the same page if anything depended on it. The customers are needy and rude. Always in a rush and expect to be catered to. You will never be treated fairly or with any respect.
bad,"I wouldn't suggest this company to anyone. Managers are all over the place, hard to keep up with demands, and no one seems to know what's going on. Held two different titles, enjoyed the work I was able to do."
bad,"Dont work here if you can avoid it. I was a cashier and they kept cutting and changing my hours. If I didnt work weekends they would punish me by dramatically cutting my weekly hours. "
bad,If I could get a chance I would ask to see what has been done and what hasn't been done from the other employees but sadly I usually would get yelled at for talking to another employee by asking once I finally got that little bit of information but finally I'll be able to get I needed to be done
bad,Not interested in ever working at walmart again they dont care about there employees i rather sale by body than work there againn. Was a awful    Job to work ar
bad,"Working for Walmart is quite difficult. You are never expected to get sick or you will be punished. Management is very disrespectful. You are expected to do all positions in the store with no extra pay. Your well being does not matter. Family emergencies will cost you a point if you must leave or miss a shift. If you have an injury, even something small, you cannot preform light work, you must file for a leave of absence with no pay."
bad,No hours at all never have enough money they suck the management don't even know what they r doing it's crazy how somebody could just Be like hey we don't need u any more and just fire and then not have any hours and still hiring people in
bad,"beware terrible place to work, managers are selfish liars, do as your told and do it fast or your out. not worth the effort as you will never be done a favor, no matter what you do for them"
bad,There is really nothing to say about it. Management is strict and very uppididy. Rude and disrespectful. They act like they own you and that you are below them. Most of them are very high school acting.
bad,They do not work with school schedules. They do not care for their workers. I needed Saturday’s off for a month because of school and they refused to give me saturdays off with the excuse that I “work retail and I should have not picked that class”
bad,They were always understaffed and did not train you on the products that you stocked in your area. It was sometimes difficult to help customers due to the lack of training on the products.
bad,"Very  bad "
bad,I was a cashier they always worked me against my availability didn't pay me for my first week of training. People that trained me weren't helpful long hours away from your family
bad,Not a place to work and try to raise a family. You work hard and never get a positive response from your boss. your treated like a number and you will be told that.
bad,I hated every second at that miserable place. Here you are nothing but a coorperate slave. You are just a number and nobody cares for anyone. Management always acts like they are better than their enployees and never take the time to listen to the employees opinions on solutions to problems. I would rather die than work here again.
bad,Stress to the max no help 20 registers only 3 open tons of people standing around wanting to be security and not wanting to do there real jobs. The bosses are usually horrible just some person to try to run a single worker in the ground from lack of help. Just a nightmare.
bad,"Walking into Walmart i came in with a huge smile, and while i had great customer relations, management, and other co workers created a hostile environment, and when i left i left with a huge smile on my face, not because i left happy because of Walmart, it was because i was over joyed to leave the environment."
bad,there is no communication. management lacks professionalism. there is no space for advancement. lack of training. there is no teamwork if you are not from the same community
bad,"No benefits worth mentioning.  Poor management and extremely unorganized.  Co-workers were also very unfriendly and hard to work with, and customers were always dissatisfied."
bad,"Management and supervisors are poorly trained. Hourly Employees are a commodity and are treated poorly. Very low pay, difficult to get needed time off. They do not work to build a team mentality or loyalty amongst the employees. They may be the largest retailer in the world but it is poorly run. Sam Walton would roll over in his grave if he knew what was being done."
bad,Walmart has mastered the art of legally screwing there employees over and their benefits sucks. They advance people more so on favoritism and not on work ethic and skills and they don't accept doctors notes as an excuseand continue to create new rules themselves to consistently have one of the highest turnover rates in America.
bad,The store manger hey Thanisha was very unprofessional. she made everyone know that if you were not one of her favorites you were basically the scum underneath her shoe. i asked for help many time being a CAP 1 associate and my mangers were to busy trying to sleep with the sales associates rather than help me or answer my questions.
bad,They changed policies and don't tell people and management is a complete joke at selinsgrove Walmart. The management at this store needs completely replaced they forced me to take a position I didn't want and when it didn't work out for me they just made an excuse to leave me go the company says they stand for higher standards but they don't care at all
bad,"Worst management ever!! They are fake and never help their employees. They don’t care at all if you’re drowning in your work. Oh, if you don’t mind not having a life outside your job, then by all means work at Walmart."
bad,Management is horrible at store 4545. They don't know what there are doing and they hold you accountable for their mistakes.  I would not recommend going there they are not appreciative of there employees at all.
bad,I work hard for Walmart went to work everyday on time neatly treated the customers with respect always got compliments was never told about the complements by Walmart customer used to come back and tell me how they told Walmart about how nice I were I quit Walmart two years ago and customer still tell me how they wish I was still working for Walmart I was never appreciated at Walmarts I took sick and had to leave Walmart I got sick and had to leave got sick and had to leave
bad,"6 months has 1 week vacation "
bad,Don't work here. EVER! They are always short-staffed and then they ask you to do WAY more work than you can handle. They will ask you to do someone else's work and then complain that your work didn't get done.
bad,you can not get a head only if you are buddy buddy with the manager of the store. they are not fair to everyone. Its terrible how they treat their employees
bad,"This would be a ideal job for a kid just getting out of high school that needs money fast. Other then that it is not a place to look for a career. The managers talk down, make fun, and call the associates names to their faces, They will pick favorites, treat their favorites great, but when it comes to someone just doing their job and not kissing butt they will treat worse then dirt. They do not care about personal things in your life, like having a emergency (you will get wrote up for) you will get in trouble and possibly fired for getting hurt even if it was a accident. the general manager aka the big big boss will treat you like you are nothing unless you work in his favorite area which is pfc on days. other then that he wont like you. The ops managers will treat you worse then the regular managers. but all in all this is the worst place to look for a career. unless you need fast cash."
bad,"Kind of hard to get work done from the employees especially the ones who have been there for 25+ yrs. Have to be very tactful."
bad,"Lack of communication between managers. Regular employees are pulled 5 or more directions. Then at the end of the day, you're looked at like you didnt do any work at all when in reality, you were never given time to finish any of the tasks they gave you to do. Management sees you as expendable and will literally tell as much. Moral is nonexistent and management will blame everyone but themselves for the lack there of. Don't work for them if you can help it."
bad,Work experience totally depends on direct supervisor. Very little room to move around once is position. If you are good they will keep you in tole as long as possible.
bad,Lying rotten conniving managers that break their on policies. Showed favoritism and did not adhere to policies for certain associates.  Embarrassed the manager was so horrible.
bad,The worst place in the world to work. Just a bunch of money hungry people and they could care less about your family life or you. Just slave drivers with little pay. No respect for individuals  in Omaha Nebraska
bad,"Revolving door. Not a long term financial job. Favoritism and white people are under minded. Bullying, empty promises, felt like highschool all over again."
bad,Do not like it. I hate working night shift. No good management. No security at all at night.  Not very nice workers no time off and you will stay part time no full time.
bad,They treat their employees poorly. Supervisors and managers do little to support their subordinates. Employees are over tasked.  They expect one person to do the job of 3. They do not care about their customers. They only care about the money.. .
bad,"they dont care for the workers, they just want you to work harder and harder with the same pay. by the time i resigned us workers work expectations were doubled easily."
bad,I honestly hated working at Walmart they’ve management system is 100% discussing and unprofessional as it can be oh and it’s always the workers fault. Never the managers. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT.
bad,mangers are not very good most of the time they stay in the office and will give you bad hours they have a buddy system if your not apart of it you wont advance and will be treated like badly
bad,Being bitched at the entire time you are there and unable to complete your duties because of management. It sucks working at a company that has no family priorities
bad,"They promise you benefits and the thoughts of going up the ladder but when it comes time for someone else to step up, they choose the rookie instead of the veteran."
bad,Walmart is not a place I would suggest anyone should apply to .  The management is extremely poor and untrained as well as incompetent . Management abuses and victimizes the employees  and creates a poor work environment.
bad,The overnight management would harass me and made it very miserable for me to work there so i quit. It was not a good place to work although i was outstanding at what i did working there.
bad,"Workload in the dairy dept is overwhelming the more you do the more they want,very stressful to get everything out without management breathing down your neck,and be prepared to pull 1000 lbs of milk every wed you have to rearrange the cooler to fit it ,not worth the pay"
bad,"Its basic retail. Everything you'd expect occurs there to poor management, lazy workers, poor pay, lack of advancement, miserable work, etc. Not a career just a job if you're really desperate for money."
bad,"Although I loved working at Walmart, the management team is horrible. They are unprofessional, rude, and hard to work for; I was threatened by a member of management and the store manager did nothing. I wouldn't recommend that Walmart to anyone"
bad,"I excelled at the work I performed at the customer service and money center desks, but I never received any recognition for my efforts, was constantly hounded by my supervisors even when I was always doing more than what my job required me to do, and was always stiff armed by upper management every single time I tried talking about a promotion to a management position. Toxic environment."
bad,completely unprofessional! management it awful they pretty much hire anyone for any position. i wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. too many problems.
bad,The management there gives you a really hard time about having unpaid days and won't approve sick time even with doctor's note. The scheduling isn't good. They don't work around your schedule if you are a parent. The pay is really bad and they treat you really badly. They want you to figure out their scheduling issues but don't want to give you anyone to help.
bad,"DO NOT WORK AT WALMART. The management is terrible all they do is watch you on cameras and follow you around the store. And then when you want to take a quick break accuse you worked so hard, you get called into the office for slacking off. And then if you wanted to take a day off because you were sick or someone in your family passed away they make it seem like a big deal that you called off."
bad,No matter how much I did if I stayed overtime and got everything done faster then anyone I never got paid fairly and never got paid for overtime even tho i was a hard worker and fast worker that worked faster then anyone I was the only one who wasn’t treated fairly was criticized because my color and because i was a single mother as a single mom is hard because u have double work
bad,"as a front end cashier, you come in and immediately get sent to a register, you have to fight to go to the bathroom when on a register, also breaks and lunches are almost always late, the csms are always rude, and have a super ego almost, you get an hour lunch which is nice and thats about the only thing that is nice. management doesn't care, they belittle you and act like you dont matter and are always sitting in the back on their phone. when i say this is one of the most awful places i've worked, i mean it. i do however miss my cashiers that i worked with, thats about it."
bad,The experience wasn't completely awful but it's definitely not something I would do for a career. The management was crazy awful. Never cared what you had to say. Had unrealistic expectations. There's no flexibility. And what's even more ridiculous is they would work you to 40 hours but still keep you at part time so they wouldn't have to pay out any benefits.
bad,"Walmart is not a good place to work unless you only need it on a short term basis. The company is very disrespectful, and will easily replace you with some high school student, given the chance. They won't give you the promised wages until after six months, during which they will likely replace you, rather than pay you more."
bad,"Upper management is great, lower management need some more training on running there shift. The company doesn't care about their people.But, there are amazing people that work there that keep everyone encouraged, and they are the reason people stay and stick it out."
bad,"This company doesn’t care about their employees, management is horrible,  unorganized, unfair , I pray I don’t every have to go back . Working for this company led me into a deep depression"
bad,Unrealistic expectations from management.  Continuous infighting between co-workers.  Not enough coverage at times or too much coverage at times. Poor management.
bad,Horrible disrespectful management. Management acts like you are beneath them. They do not care if you are in college and will schedule you when you are unavailable and refuse to change your shift. They never give weekends off ( I had one scheduled weekend off in 3.5 years). They expect you to still be at work when sick and will threaten to write you up even if you have doctors excuse. Don’t even get me started
bad,"Management didn't seem to have your back when it came to customer issues or issues between associates, they definitely had favorites when it came to employees, if you weren't a favorite then good luck on your own. Had to quit after three girls threatened me in the pharmacy about their controlled substance. Looked to my manager(pharmacist) for help with the situation, instead of help she asked what I did to make them mad."
bad,"managers didn't care about their employs at all they over worked people with such little pay and very mistreated by every manager, employ, and customer"
bad,I worked there for 6 months and this was the first job where they dont accept hospital or doctor notes and i when they need someone to stay late up until 4am i stayed and i got in trouble for that and never got paid my overtime that i worked. It was a waste of time! The only raise i got was when minimum wage went up. There is no chance to move up in your position unless you know the manager personally.
bad,"Was a poor place to work. Never cared about there employees, they would give less hours to those in school and didn’t ask if the high school kids wanted more hours. They were rude and mean."
bad,I would say that things could easily be improved based on the basic fundamental needs of every person. I think that there isn’t enough attention paid to the basic jobs and I feel like a number rather than a person
bad,"They don't care, you are a warm body to do a task, that's it. No support, no advancement or raises worth anything, and upset management often abusing power to give themselves back some tiny feeling of control to offset their own despair."
bad,Hardest part of my job is keeping my mouth shut. I feel very strongly that i as an employee I've been a victim of discrimination and subject to harassment  from my employer going on  over 3 yrs I have never in my life worked for an employer as bad as Walmart in house store behavior and favoritism miss management.
bad,Worst job experience ever totally dog you make fun of you gang up behind you back..and did I mention this is managment will find ways to fire you at every turn if you dont kiss up if your a free thinker or like to be yourself not the job or place they are racist and will infringe in your rights
bad,"I felt the specific location I worked at was very disorganized and stressful.  I was not there long enough to receive any benefits or discounts. My brother passed away while I was working there and I felt one of the managers was unsympathetic and unprofessional. Also, they asked for funeral service information to send flowers and they never sent any flowers."
bad,"I hated working here, I was always in pain, always stressed, and none of the CMs seemed to care. If there was an issue, I couldn't talk to the correct manager like it s required, so I always had to go straight to the top, the store manager."
bad,Management needs to be fully gutted. Pretty sure the manager is corrupt. How are your employee's asking for hours when you're pulling up in a Tesla...
bad,"this was not a good job  the managemt was overworked, and under paid,  the expations were unrealistic. the ability to move up is not a possibilty.  not a good company"
bad,"Lousy working environment..very toxic atmosphere."
bad,The management sucks in my area they dont care about nothing else except making sure we work they have attitudes and arent flexible with schedules at all
bad,"Don't apply here. Short staffed, store is always trashed, management is a joke. Worked my butt off to Only get a 15 cent raise after a year. Just don't do it."
bad,"This is not a place you want to work. They don't care about their employees or customers. Nothing is ever stocked completely or correctly. EVERYDAY there is a truck coming there to keep overstocking the shelves with stuff that has no barcode to so you have NO IDEA where it goes for a month until out of nowhere the manager asked if you stocked something that had no spot to be put in so THEN they plug the spot with that product and sell it for same price or whatever shows up when scanned if people dont make it a hassle. Small Walmarts shouldnt have a truck coming in everyday. Nobody there does their job. They walk around making sure new people are doing stuff for them while they go into the employee lobby and play uno, eat, or watch tv. The one manager there does everyones job for them and cant keep track of his employees to know if they need help because they are new or need help because they truly need it. Its always a hassle to ask him for help."
bad,"Good for short time only. Not for long term. The place has a dull feeling behind the sales floor."
bad,Ok but hours sucks no real home time or schedule csm don't help you and after two days of training they let you sink or swim hardly any down time or real training
bad,"Walmart is the great American Scam. Almost everyone that I know that has a kid is on government assistance. Almost everyone starts at $11 an hr part time, but they want people to have open availability. "
bad,I guess it depends what department your in while working at Walmart. Being a middle age women working produce stocker on 3rd shift is not a good idea. I had alot of heavy items to unload by myself and I ended up hurting my back and neck because of it.
bad,"It not a good company to work for. They do not care about their employees. You are not allowed to have situations that come up in your personal life. They do not care. The company does not handle employee bullying like the should, they completely look the other way and just choose to move you to a different department. They do not care that supervisors and managers use fowl and vulgar language in front of customers and they don't say anything about an employee treating a customer badly."
bad,I never enjoyed working for the management of walmart. They need less people in charge and more coaches to better employee morale. They allow managenent to mistreat employees. And are very inconsistant with the breaks and lunches.
bad,"Management is poor and lacks organization. Do not count on a raise or a good review on your performance, it’s a lot like highschool and a click. The overtime is good when you can get it but at any moment they will cut your hours and leave you wondering why."
bad,Don’t work for this terrible company. You only get a 2% raise every year. I’ve been with the company for a total of 17years and make close to $16. The only reason I’ve stayed is because I had to work due to my children and bills like everyone else.
bad,Horrible management with no regard to personal life issues. The people who work there are mostly great. You are required to sell your soul for abusive treatment.
bad,Very unfair in the company they just assume thing s and do not allow you to explain a situation. They also have no care for family emergencies or other family matters. They also never consider requested time off!
bad,"Don't waste your time working there,they are not a family friendly company as they advertise you are just another sheep for them to herd and slaughter"
bad,Out of the whole store i feel i was the only one being picked at for going over hours smdh they suck they suck they suck they show favortism!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,"looking for better job , been there 5 years no increase ,  management is very poor , employees are being over worked or being forced to work pass shift ."
bad,Managment walked all over the associates and treated us like a piece of dirt. Wouldnt listen to the associates. Was late to help customers poor integrity.
bad,"The company no longer knows how it wants/or to operate. Management at all levels are only in it for big paychecks and bonuses. No customer service, just lip service about it. They have turned their operation into an extremely complicated mess to run off long term employees, and serves no other purpose. If have no other options go ahead."
bad,No reviews at all they are very unprofessional at Walmart can’t find a manager when u need one they are rude to there employees and work them like slaves
bad,This job was very stressful I did not like working in grocery it was always cold the managers were very rude and mean I did not like working overnight
bad,"Dont apply at Wal-Mart on Boulevard La Gappe Gatineau Quebec Canada."
bad,Horrible job. Management is useless. Avoid this job. You are never appreciated for anything you do. Pay is terrible. Management is clueless. Like working in high school. Backstabbing is the norm.
bad,good place to work to meet people each store is different as is the management I've been to 3 different stores two of the stores treated there workers good the last store they didn't care about there workers
bad,"Working as a cart pusher, the people you will encounter in the parking lot are rude, disrespectful, and lazy. They leave soiled diapers and clothing, trash, as well as other biohazards in the carts. There is no procedure for cleaning or sanitizing them. Just back into rotation for people to put their groceries and food in."
bad,They are very rude and mean to the workers. They don’t care about what you have going on and they don’t pay you nothing forreal. I would never go back to the Walmart in East Gadsden.
bad,"They told me x amount of hours and x amount of $ for my wage, when hired the contract was way less for salary and hours. They said they'd send another contract, they sent another one with no changes then expected me to sign it. Sorry not sorry you need to put in the contract accurate figures as to what is promised in the interview."
bad,They never scheduled right and had favoritism and if you quit they'll hire you back if you were one of their favorites didn't care about their employees just about the money
bad,They don’t care about the employees at all. They pretend like they care when the market manager is there. They completely ignore anything you say. The store manager doesn’t even want to help the associates.
bad,"Walmart is one of the most corrupt companies I've ever worked for! They attract people with their $17-$25 an hour starting pay but don't tell them that they will only work 3-4 days a week and at any time they CAN AND WILL cut your hours in half!"
bad,No one knows Walmart policy nor are they trying to learn it or care about it . I like helping people that is the reason why I was there but the bad attitudes and the poor pay also the very very very heavy work load was tooo much for the peanuts they paid me .
bad,Used to be a great company 25 years ago. They sold me out to a 3 rd party. Not the same company. Very stressful toxic work environment. They don’t drug test anymore associates are weird they hire anyone now.
bad,Toxic work environment. Would strongly recommend you try at another grocery store before this one. Management doesn't do much when problems arise. Not worth the stress.
bad,"I do not recommend working at Wal-Mart , the employees are more concerned about others then they are about working && the customers plus the pay isn't enough"
bad,You dont get dull time hours even if u full time the laziest oldest people get the hours they want and work way less harder th ed n u and most likely  only have 7 hours a week
bad,"workers where uncoordinated, managers was horrible at their job, the work that was forced on everyone was gross, and the favouritism there was horrible! you could tell the managers kids where never in trouble even though they where causing most of the problems."
bad,It was a seasonal job so it wasn't permanent it was just temporary at this job I mostly learned about the RF scanner which was cool it was stressful because I worked holiday season
bad,"been there for 6 years stocking the worst I've ever experienced!  They take advantage of there employees and pay is poverty level, It took me 5yrs to make an extra $1.00.  How pathetic is that?  But, I was foolish enough to stay for that long.  Worst bosses ever .......... don't go to Walmart for a job as they could care less about the employees that work there.  It has been on the news sad to say but all true."
bad,Management doesn’t care about their employees. Work you to the point of mental/physical exhaustion. Definitely not a good place for someone with bad anxiety.
bad,"I would NEVER recommend for anyone to work for Wal-Mart.  I worked from 1988 until 1998 then quit and came back and worked another 11 years.  The company has deteriorated so much, management, co-workers, and the general public are thoughtless, self-centered, rude, and thieves, with NO RESPECT for no one!  I don'[t shop there anymore, I shop at Big Lots, Target and other establishments, but NEVER at Wal-Mart."
bad,"No-one ever knew what they were doing. they tell you to do it one way and you get used to that, then its wrong and then you have to start all over and do it another way."
bad,A typical day involved getting yelled at and sometimes spat on.  The management were not really involved in the day to day activities.  The hardest part was having to stand all day.
bad,The Walmart culture is toxic everyone constantly tries to put you down in order to get up in the company even if you don't want to move up. The ones who do move up find themselves miserable. They treat everyone as if they are children.
bad,it was nothing to love about this job the most stressful job that I ever worked I do not recommend anyone to work here. the customers are rude and the management team sucks
bad,"I honestly hate working here now. I've been with the company for almost 2 years now and nothing has changed. All the managers don't care if someone is hurt or not. They make obviously pregnant women pick up things that they shouldn't be picking up"
bad,Wal Mart dismissed 70 percent of their full time staff when I worked there. I was told they were going to do that about a year in advance. They began cutting staff and treating their employees contemptibly. It became intolerable and the work load and demand for higher and higher perfection of work performance became rediculous. Screaming at and belittling employees by management became commonplace. Threats and being called to the office for reprimands became more and more frequent. I watched as one by one our team of 15 deli members were whittled down to about 5. The work load of 15 was put upon those remaining. I am glad that I was released from Wal Mart. I had a breakdown because of the work schedule and job pressure. They scheduled people to close until after midnight and then come into work at 5 am. Very unfair and unhealthy. Do not work there unless you enjoy this type of treatment.
bad,I was threaten and yelled at alot and was not treated very well but my mother in law was telling me about biglots I am hoping for a change in job I am looking for good team work and good management
bad,"The new store manager creates terror in the store until people are leaving by 2 or 3 in a week. and customers complain about the time they are waiting at the checkout, workers are not happy at all. the store manager throws people in an impossible mission and coaches you for not get your stuff done on time. he assignments managers 5 pallets between 7am to 2pm and sent them to help to the checkout, to the customer service and other duties and at the end of the week, he writes a bad report about their productivity. Just like he want to fire them anyway. The store manager threatens people during morning meetings ("" None is irreplaceable, either you work as a team member or the door is widely open. . . ""). None want to work there because of him. Even Assistant managers are leaving. And he has a relative in the corporate. So if you looking for a fun place to work avoid Belleville Walmart."
bad,The managers and store manager don’t care about you one bit but you have to busy your butt off and then they want more from you. They should let people who been there around for a while and give them what they want and the hours they want to work. There should be enough people to work in a store to cover it.
bad,Bad place too work for they are  cutting  hours again so you  will have to still work at another job too make it management  is a joke and they treat the employees bad
bad,U work really hard for little pay you do management  duty's  and not paid for it   if they don't like you they can let you go  even if it's for there own personal reason an  the head mgt don't even bother to ask he  just do what his assistant say like he is scared the sad thing is if the head mgt is scared of his own  assistance  who do u have to protect you  if your scared of them an there bullying you when you work there  they don't do any work an slave me sorry  it's not a good place I lost my home  because of 5382  new store mgt I was working there for  for 5 year an he did care if they abuse me or my coworker s😥🤐
bad,"If there was option for zero stars,! I would give them a zero. The company continue to charges everything .. they do. They never have enough products on the shelves."
bad,"As someone who was struggling to find work for many years after college, I was at first excited when I got the job opportunity at the new Walmart Neighborhood Market that was opening up. People seemed friendly and like they wanted you to go far. However I soon realized it was sugar coated where favoritism was alive and well and it wasn't how well you did, it was who you knew and how you worked the system."
bad,is a fun cashier job lots of fun great people and making friends with customers and coworkers is nice anytime I enjoyed not moving up in the company a
bad,there is the right way to do things then there is the Walmart way to do things. it was a very stressful but slow workplace. the pay isn't worth the job
bad,"I worked with Wal Mart for a year in the bakery and deli. I enjoyed what I did, for the most part. I like to bake and I had tons of experience with food so it came natural to me, but there were several things I didn't like and they mainly revolve around management. The department managers half the time didn't know what they were doing. I was always being accused of doing something that I didn't do and threatened to be written up for it, but in my opinion that was just because the managers were too lazy to follow up after each shift to really know what was going on. I was expected to work like a robot. The fact that I was only a human, and one person at that didn't matter to them. Everything had to be perfect all of the time and we had little help. Not to mention the way they talked to us was less than professional, and I can say this because I have five years of management experience under my belt. In my opinion, overall the management sucks and it started all the way from the top, the store manager."
bad,Work home life sucks ur there more than u are home was told I’d work weekday mainly but since I’ve started I’ve worked mainly weekends I would not recommend
bad,"i dont mind working hard but equal pay equal work doesnt happen here it has to be the most difficult place to get up to another dept and to excell and move up,full time is almost impossible,even if you have an degree it is still hard to get hired in as a professional example i have 19 years of clerical,additional 10 years of retail,as well as actually being a store manager,leadership skills and walmart knows this and i am in a position where i am not happy and would like the opportunity to be in a  management role,always drama,youll always get blamed,its the blame game,always an occurence if your late,if you call out,dont pass your fifth hour for lunch or youll get a write up,low pay,aweful hours,old equipment,system is out dated and always fails the hand held devices are junk old and dont always work,no one says hi no one seems friendly,you have to be in the in crowd,recognition maybe at first after the honeymoon your not recognized,only management gets full time,they will work you any schedule they want you have no say so,mean while the walmart family goes on cruises in their king size yachts their planes their million dollar properties they care for no one you are only a win number sad but true management walks in to your store the upper management district managers dont say hello dont ask how you are nothing,its as if they are above the law"
bad,All of their policies are ridiculous and they're all brainwashed to make you think its the happiest place on earth. Don't fall for their lies. Most of the management don't even fully know the policies in place and have huge power trips when anyone disagrees with them.
bad,Walmart was a good place to work but the pay is bad and the work is hard. But it’s a fun place to work if you have the patiences. Good co workers and.
bad,they suck there i advise no one to work there they mistreat employees and they don't hold customers resposible for anything that company is greedy and money hungry eff walmart
bad,Modern day cotton field. Will fire you for the smallest reason. Difficult to get them to work with your availability. Will work you more than 7 days often.
bad,"It does not matter how much you do, it's never enough and you are made to feel like you are not doing your job. They ask you to stay to help, then they do not want to give you overtime."
bad,"Short breaks,staff doesnt care for you,mandatory overtime all summer,if you're 1 minute late you get half a point and 4 points you're fired,attendance policy is horrible,and not to mention managers are absolutely horrible and are very uneducated"
bad,"I always said I would never work for Walmart because I knew what I would be getting myself into however, I needed to move and this is the only job that came through for me. Walmart is a company that demands so much from you and you don’t get anything in return. No respect, honesty,  or anything else. They will work you to death and not show you any appreciation for the work you did. "
bad,"Empresas muy malas tato con los empleados como los salarios "
bad,"I worked for Walmart for 21 years. Up until the last 2 years we got a store manager who is nothing but a bully and runs his store like its high-school. He is rude, arrogant and it sickens me that Walmart wants someone like that to work for them. He plays favoritism an if he didn't like you, You knew it and got bullied. There for they found ways to do things and blame them on me and then eventually they fired me after 21 years."
bad,"Pro:"
bad,Every manager was corrupt I didn’t really like it they didn’t let me switch my position they didn’t let me do nothing I wanted to do after my six month was over
bad,It was an awful place to work for. I was treated unfairly and verbally abused please I beg you don’t ever work there. I was told repeatedly that all of the sudden after 7 years of working there and many years in retail that all of the sudden I didn’t know how to do my job. I went from never being called to the office to repeatedly and being accused of things I didn’t do on a regular basis being called to the office
bad,"Really sucked, manager sucked, ran me like a slave, was total corporate America bs in the worse possible way. Really lacked humanity, hated my life while working there."
bad,i worked there for many years  i met some really good friends throughout the years  the discount card helps  the company isnt the same as it was when sam walton was alive
bad,"Fast paced, high pressured environment.  Employee turnover is extremely high, so you must always do everything you can to protect your employment.  Do not expect to make a lot of money here either."
bad,"Management plays favorites and gives certain employees special privileges."
bad,"Taking almost anything that walks and talks english.  No training, they will just throw you out there.  At orientation they inform you that what you put down for availability will be what they use for the next month, no changing it.  Training is on a computer and even the assistant manager was unable to help me with the question I needed answered.  When you are up on register alone, takes 5 minutes for the CSM to come over and help you, which makes the customer upset and they take it out on you."
bad,"Walmart was a terrible place to Work. The management is absent and abhorid, the employees don't work together, the environment is always stressful and dirty. Not a good place to work."
bad,"Walmart.  What can I say.  It is the management, or lack of that gives Walmart the bad name.  Poor management and zero communication. "
bad,Extreamly Unrealistic expectations of work in the small time frame they give you.... extreamly unreliable hours... you find the odd good manager but most are on powertrips .... every manager has a different way they want the job done and they all exspect it to be done there way ...they play favorites and only promote the favorites ....full time positions basically do not exist...
bad,Not a good company if you have a mall kids... management is horrible... the store manager is the worse... he stays in his office and tells about zoning
bad,The managers are the biggest liars and they play favorites. They lie to new associates and they also harassed me every single day for no reason at all.
bad,It's not managed properly and they don't have proper training for their associates. They just put associates anywhere when they need coverage and expect them to know what they are doing even if they have no experience. The pay is poor they don't pay you enough to deal with the stress that comes with working there. They have a department manager that over half the staff doesn't get along with and they allow her to continue working there and make other associates quit. I could go on about how bad of a workplace it is but I don't want to waste anymore time on it.
bad,I hate Walmart. Dont work there. They want to keep you part time but work you full time hours so they do have to give you benefits. They need to give us a raise.
bad,Unless you suck up to management you're not getting promoted. You are replaceable and they make you know it. Hated working for Walmart. Horrible management. Same thing over and over again you feel like a machine.
bad,"I’ve worked for Walmart sams club for over 5 years an I only make $13. I feel like I do so much for the pay . I open memberships sales credit card applactions , Credit card payment, returns , an closing duties"
bad,"I had just had a baby when I went to work for them and was nursing. So I needed to pump 2x a day. They only let me pump once, on my lunch break so I couldn't eat. At first they put me in a dressing room behind a door that locked. Then one day they moved me to a storage closet where I had to pump next to dirty mops and buckets behind a door they had rigged to not close or lock. I have a physical disability that they refused to accommodate which lead to me being in so much pain that I couldn't work anymore."
bad,"Don't work there the point system is dumb"
bad,"I was a csm for 5yrs. The job was bad because of the upper management, not because of the customers. The customers are the reason I stayed so long. Management uncaring, unsympathetic, lazy, selfishness is the reason I hated it from day one and ultimately left."
bad,"I don’t recommend working there at all. Management is awful and a joke, lack of training and workers makes for a very hostile work environment. You end up doing 5 people’s jobs and get paid for 1. They are very unappreciative and expect you to do so much with very little time or help. It’s a nightmare."
bad,"Unless you need a job like yesterday stay away. Run this place treats its associate awful. And if have to take a job here do not stop looking, get out as soon as you can. Management does not care about you they treat you terrible."
bad,"Unfair higher management, bad immediate management, was fired because I was injured and they wouldn't help accommodate with my injury. Terrible scheduling."
bad,"Let me be frank, Walmart will grind you into dust. They will use you up and spit you out."
bad,"Honestly worst place to work at yes you get paid 11.00 dollors an hours , mangament is horid , no listens when needed. I wouldn't work here..Wrongful."
bad,"Management and Regional Management are truly corporate robots that focus on demeaning associates and passing the bully/blame game on to the next lower level individual. Raises are not possible unless a promotion is given, which is based on favoritism. This place has not 1 thing good about it. Walmart runs off slave labor and exploitation of children and people world wide."
bad,Maybe 2 fans on the production line so it was miserably hot all the time. Extremely hard to make production. Management did not care if you got your production. Very unprofessional managers that yell and scream. Very stressful place to work.
bad,"I don't think that management... corporate, most managers have a hard job dealing with the expectations that are not easily accomplished.  WM upper Mgmt does not care about people...only $$.  I was sick and had a doctors note.  I was terminated due to being sick and calling in every day and sending my Supervisor multiple texts and voice mails.  They moved from 9 days of sick days to 5 while I was out sick.  Nobody called.  Nobody cared.  It is a blessing that I was terminated... WM is a corrupt company!!!!!"
bad,if your'e not perfect or on the ball they will give you a point. if someone passes away in your family and you need time off they will point you for it. management is awful terrible scheduling they dont care about your avilability its only if it suits there needs not yours. hardest part of the job is the down talk you recieve from all management.
bad,I was there for 7 1/2 years as a supervisor and was terminated for taking the same path as an irrate associate trying to get them to go into the office. Upper mgmt do not go by the book and do not treat their employees fair.
bad,Allow worker spit on employee allow employee throw freight at people holler cuzz at employee n customers rude management they fired good hard working employee but kept the ones who assault employee
bad,The one I worked at was very poorly managed and did not care about my availability at all so I had to leave I do not wish to work at the resolution drive one ever ag
bad,They want less people to do more work. Their day to day processes are unrealistic for the amount of volume our store does with the amount of employees we have. Its VERY VERY STRESSFUL. They do start out at $11 if you can actually get enough hrs. They are pushing their longtime associates out.
bad,"The whole assistant manager team needs to be changed. No guidance or support from management. Fulfillment associates are treated like animals. 2 hrs to unload a truck, 2hrs to work freight and still get overnight freight to salesfloor. They say 8 hour shift but its not after you take 2 x 15 min breaks and 1 hr lunch."
bad,"HORRIBLE, workplace culture is negative unless make friends with a group that you car comfortable with, some associates are very negative and cruel to you"
bad,"EVERYDAY was like attending a funeral!  The employees were are gossipy, rude, miserable, disgruntled, and back-stabbing."
bad,If you want consistency in hours and pay and respect from managers and coworkers. Not the place. They cut hours and give no explanation.  If you are sick they tell you to go through their PTO place Sedgwick and that screws with your job then they fire you for their misleading information.
bad,"The company makes billions of dollars but chooses not to give you any hours. They also terminate you without your knowledge. Most of them are jealous, so if your pretty you will have a lot to deal with."
bad,"They weren't honest with me at all about what the job was like. I was hired for cap 2. I tried to transfer to another department but they didn't really take me seriously until I turned in my two week notice. If you're young and fit, and like to break your back for $11 an hour, this job will be perfect for you. If not, don't do it!!!!!"
bad,"Walmart prides itself in ensuring the majority of its senior management hires are internal and as such the people promoted know how to run their respective departments but unfortunately are not good leaders or managers. The managers are only interested in advancing themselves and will walk all over their associates to ensure they stay in the store managers good books. This means your needs are never put first. To stay in Walmart there is phrase ""you need to lick to click"". It has been a very interesting experience but after working there feel that one could do so much better in terms of career and job fulfilment."
bad,terrible place to work they dont care about their employees and will schedule them to work anytime doesnt matter if you worked less than 8 hours before your shift
bad,Don't go to Walmart they over work you and under pay you they have bad management and it's not a safe place to work they need security over night at Walmart
bad,Was very hard on you and always on your feet and pushing heavy stuff all the time. We barely had any break time to relax a little while. They was always pushing us.
bad,"Worked there two years only to be terminated when I had to go to the hospital for depression. Store manager promised I'd have my job after my release from hospital. Was a lie. Everything is a lie. Don't let them fool you. They are robots, they will put everything on lowest associates hoping higher ups approve of store conditions. Terrible people tell you what you want to hear instead of being upfront."
bad,I would not recommend to anyone to seek employment there.  I am a highly motivated and intelligent employee.  They should be thrilled to have an employee that is so diligent and has far more integrity than most of the work force.
bad,"I liked it at first, but then it went down hill. The management sucks, and there’s too much drama that happens there. The pay is alright, but they cut your hours."
bad,"I learned alot about Walmart and the resepect for the individual. I was always willing to give a helping hand where ever needed.one day had a customer that was handy cap. And couldn't shop by herself. She approach me and ask me if i could help her, of course i said to the lady ,we started going down each and every aisle, by the time i got done with her and loaded everything in her car she gave me the biggest hug and said God bless you and i said to her mam he already did"
bad,"They make it sound like an amazing place to work when you go through interviews and the orientation. But, once you get out there it's every one for themselves. Their points system is ridiculous if you get sick, which it is very easy to do there, considering you're constantly touching dirty stuff. You have about 6 people yelling at you, all contradicting themselves. For example. Part of a cashier's job is to zone the register, make it look pretty. One person will tell you to clean the belt, the other one will tell you to zone the area, then another will tell you to redline (stand out front) then another will tell you zone the area and redline, but then they get mad if your area isn't neat. I would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,I’ve never worked for a place like Walmart. It was ghetto.Nobody did anything. Employees did whatever they wanted to do. Omg Management was the worst.
bad,Tell everyone not to work there.  They don't care about there employee's. To managers one tells to do this then the next one yells at you for doing it that way.
bad,"Hired in working mon-fri 4am to 1 pm. after working approx 3 months there the new assistant manager started bullying people, after my one year anniversary it got worse. If things are working good dont come in and mess it up. I wont even shop there anymore! I was a hard worker, dependable, and to be treated the way I was is BULL! management setting people up so they can fire them, what is that? they did it to two employees while I was there, and are doing it now again. This is why walmart gets a bad name, they are dirty. If you want good employees you need to treat them good, I was treated Horrible, walmart says they are flexible- apparently not, after me working there for a year, again as a very hard loyal dependable employee the new assistant manager is gonna come in and start throwing his weight around. very sad that a company would let a management employee treat other employees like this. shame on you walmart."
bad,"managers treat you like a not family, that you like a poor people, treat you your not doing good even if your good, they give you a lot of work, you have no rights to explain your side. so poor."
bad,"DON'T DO IT!!! I would suggest that if you can, avoid working at Walmart at all costs... Managment is lazy and shows favoritism. It's nearly impossible to make a good living when they constantly cut your hours."
bad,"I spent over 40 hours a week at Walmart, was barely paid dirt and was definitely treated like dirt. I ended up putting in my two weeks and then walking out. Management wasn't even aware I walked out because they had completely left me alone on the floor to go chat somewhere else. There is zero concern for employees. They often messed up on bonuses and had to ask them to correct that several times. My self-esteem and mental health dropped dramatically while I was here. I really wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Please let yourself find some place better."
bad,"I would only recommend working here if you have nowhere else to go or the alternative is worse. Walmart is a toxic work environment from the bottom level associates all the way to the CEO. These people are fake smiles and have no fears about throwing you under the bus. You might have some good experiences, but for the most part, they're all bad. I would never want to work here, but as a college student that needs a flexible schedule, this is one of the many places that offer that."
bad,Poor management they never stay on the correct people that don't do they jobs. They only stay after the ones that do their jobs correctly. They are racist .
bad,"Save yourself the stress, time, and energy and apply at a different store. Everything about this company and is terrible; the customers, co-workers, leadership, etc., are the worst I've seen in retail."
bad,the walmart I worked at most of the other staff were great I made life long friends but the management was really one sided and never listened to any of my concerns
bad,I worked there for 15 years and it gets worse and worse every day they cut hours with no warning and don't care about their employee. I don't recommend it to anyone who wants to work in an environment that values their employees.
bad,"typical day at walmart,very stressful,managements expectations and what you can deliver are worlds apart,very little to no training,they throw you into different situations and expect you to be able to do them to perfection even if you have never done them before,most times you are on your own with no help,ask management for help and most times they are clueless,turn over is rampant,its a revolving door,no respect for you.no holidays or holiday pay and you work all holidays except Christmas eve,benefits if you want to call them that are not worth what you pay for them,favoritism is rampant,little to no chance for advancement unless you are on the favorites list,this is a last resort job if you can't find anything else"
bad,"They don't care about you, they'll overwork and underpay you, and the culture there is miserable. Management is notoriously awful. It isn't worth it. Work literally anywhere else. I wasted a year of my life here."
bad,"Fast paced and always pushed to do more no matter what, super early and long hours with overtime that you basically see none of, Also management was poor."
bad,The management and co-workers are not team work compatible nor care if you become hurt sick or have family issues. For example a child Ill and dying they count it against you.
bad,"Walmart doesn't advertise it ,but they only looking for part time workers, so they don't have to pay for health insurance.  Can't believe world largest brick and mortar retailer is greedy with their profits and don't want to share it with people who made them profitable."
bad,"Working at walmart is a nightmare! They work their employees to the ground and they don't care. The management system is horrible. No one wants to stay at walmart for too long, sometimes I even wonder how some employees have been there for 23 years. It is a decent paying job and all but it is not worth it! they would constantly screw you over with promises they don't fulfil, if you don't have your availability open you wouldn't get any hours, and even if you do have your availability open you still have to constantly fight for hours. This place will make you so miserable.... but thank goodness for amazing co workers who love and support each other."
bad,They say there family oriented and will work around what ever. We were always trained to say that in orientation this isn't true. If a associate asked for a day off in a emergency we were told to tell them we have a business to run and to call in and take a point this is absolutely not a job if you have a family
bad,"I got injured on the job and then they fired me because my PT took longer than 2 weeks to fill their paperwork out. I now have a chronic back problem because of Walmart and I’m not even 30. "
bad,Working at walmart is very easy and has no challenges what so ever. Walmart does not care about the workers and treat them like you owe them. your just a slave there.
bad,"I’m excepted to handle three different areas, and be called away to help do other people’s job and them get yelled at for not have my area done. I get pulled to work at cap team or push carts. The management couldn’t care less for your safety as I learned when I was sent to push carts during a lightning storm and told that my job description let’s them send me out there."
bad,"Walmart management is not fair with there hiring process. They don’t promote from within base on work performance."
bad,"Some of the management team for the two stores I worked at were a joke. A lot of them didn't seem to know how to do my job, but yet keep saying I was doing it wrong even though I knew how to fix a lot of the down equipment or having to remind them of company policy. A lot of the time when I asked for help when it was needed or informed them about a being short handed for a service area they just seemed to just ignore the issue out right."
bad,I hated working there it was too much drama and I had to deal with people trying to bully me and start drama with me. I also had to deal with rude and disrespectful customers and my job was boring half of the time my department didn’t have work to do so I felt like I used to come to work for nothing.
bad,"Te hacen que cheques tu salida y te regreses a trabajar con el pretexto de la regla del atardeser qué según es no dejar nada para otro día , no les tienes que decir nada porque ya te están asesorando y así te tienen esta que te corren y te dan cualquier cosa dé liquidación tengas los años que tengas"
bad,"Management is horrible, they don’t care about their employees. Got a point because they sent me home for having strep throat AND told me doctor’s note doesn’t apply. Walmart changes you slowly, but people will see the difference it makes and not in a good way. I worked for Walmart for 3 years."
bad,"I’ve worked for Walmart for a good bit of time and they don’t care about their employees the Managers don’t answer when you need help and their micro managers aka the csms always run off or hide, the technology they use for registers and computers are out of date and everything crashes and they wonder why nobody hires just not worth the time and headache"
bad,"I specifically told them that I could not work on a specific day of the week but yet they continued to try to schedule and THEN gave me 9 points for it! Even after I explained the situation they still refused to take off the points but instead tried to insist I was ""late"" a few times which also racked up some points. On top of that I worked in the back and they repeatedly stuck me in the truck pushing heavy things up the line FULLY AWARE that I was in my first trimester of pregnancy and was NOT supposed to be pushing, pulling, or carrying heavy items. When I was stacking pallets, a co worker continuously came over to my pallet and kept stacking it wrong and no matter how many times I would explain that it was not me I was still the one who got reprimanded for it. And if all of that wasn't bad enough, as I said they were 100% FULLY AWARE that I was pregnant but yet proceeded to get angry when I needed to take time off for drs appointments for my pregnancy. Years later I discovered I was among a group of people who had similar experiences in totally different Walmart's. I am in no way shape or form trying to bash Walmart because I do shop there but working for them was in my personal experience a nightmare I never want to revisit! I know people that work there and have totally different experiences so I don't think that my opinion should really affect anyone else's. This was years ago too so the staff could of changed."
bad,"Worst job ever. I would rather scrub motel bathrooms with my own toothbrush than ever work for this crooked, money hungry, unprofessional company ever again."
bad,Just don’t work here they don’t treat you right I’ve had stomach problems and my car blew up so I couldn’t make it and I called in every day that I really couldn’t make it and they fired me
bad,"One of the worst place to work as a pharmacy technician in Richmond Virginia, Manager does not know how to do her job. Pharmacists are extremely rude at short pump WalMart. Never feel appreciated. I have got to know after 1 year of service that I am not eligible to raise because of poor performance review. The real question is do not even know when someone performed my evaluation. Do not get 1 cent raise after 1 year of service. Do not expect anything from this company. It is all about unethical workflow. I was stopped using the bathroom where else other employees never stopped. I have been working 10 years in the pharmacy technicians field and I was never being treated this way from upper management."
bad,"Sylvan Lake Walmart used to be a good store but now it’s a dump.  The current store manager is absolutely horrid. She constantly lies, hides from staff and customers and plays favorites. Absolutely appalling management “team”.  If you have another choice DO NOT work here. Never take a ‘flex’ position. Flex just means part time with no guarantee of hours."
bad,This job sucks. The managers do not allow you to move departments. This job will crush you so much you will not want to be here at all. Hate it so much.
bad,"Not a great places to work, they will treat you horrible, if you have family, health, or even personal issues they do not care about it nor will they try to help. They will also put you down as non re-hirable even after you put your two weeks in and decide to go ahead and quit because you start your new job within those two weeks. You will not get the proper training you need to work here."
bad,"Favoritisms and politics play a big role in the Walmart work environment advancement has nothing to do with hard work knowledge of the job or experience, As long as your friends or family with management it doesn’t matter about performance that’s what matters. Policy doesn’t exist unless it’s time to get rid of somebody. Your loyalty to the coy or time with them does not matter... they can replace you"
bad,Worst company i ever worked for. All promised on the way in the already know won't happen. Management are all complicent in the same lies told to employees.
bad,"Be careful, they are all about profit and will say take this job we wont change your schedule then they do... lots of changes and no job security..... especially in a right to work state"
bad,Their Management is ruining walmart reputaion. They only talk about how valuable family is but they do not care. Walmart used to be the happiest place to work for but now its the opposite.
bad,"constant rule changes, horrible benefits, poor management, loss of vacation time, unreachable production requirements, very hard to schedule time off, very hot and sticky environment in the summer and very cold in the winter, rarely fixes any equipment"
bad,I hate Wal-Mart. Years of lifting heavy merchandise caused me to have a severe back pain and can no longer lift or stand or walk. They work u like a dog and not enough help or communication. You should get paid $20/ hour not $10.
bad,"Don’t work for them, It is the worst place to work.managment!!!! Is HORRIBLE!!!  Walmart Honestly needs to be closed down for ever !!!!!  MAJORITY!!! OF WALMARTS Never GET A  DECENT BONUS!!!! GUN SHOOTING S  are always targeting Walmart!!!!! You are not safe at all working at walmart!!!!"
bad,"Terrible pay and I got held at knifepoint by a customer trying to steal. That was a typical day, they didnt even call the cops until the day after. shows you how great walmart is and how they care about their employees."
bad,Empresa precisa melhorar muito com desempenho com funcionários
bad,"Ungrateful management, have you literally running around doing their job and at the end of the day it wasn't enough. Did not care if you were hurt on the job, expected you to do everything and then some no matter how much pain you were in. Extremely understaffed most of the time and expected the work of several people for the same pay. Mentally the worst job anyone could have, if you like to be constantly stressed out and have no outside life then Walmart is the place for you."
bad,They treat employees reaalllyyyy bad at the Yukon neighborhood market. The assistant manager and the store manager are obviously prejudiced. They treat everyone with disrespect and like to yell ay you in front of everyone including customers. The love getting people down and to make them feel like they are worthless.
bad,I will never work at Walmart again nor will I ever recommend Walmart to anyone. They do not care about their employees and you will work yourself to death to get nothing in return.
bad,This is the worst place to ever work. They discriminate and treat you like slaves. No room for advancement and they're always breaking the law. They treat disabled veterans like they are a burden. I couldn't bring my service dog.
bad,Working here as a manager has been the worst experience for me. Worked my way up from overnight stocker. As an assistant you are responsible for everything. Nobody helps you. Comanagers and store managers leave the premises daily for hour and a half lunch breaks. If you stay your lucky to get 20 minute lunch break  you get blamed for everything. And when your finally burned out they wont let you step down.
bad,"Co workers were not friendly. My supervisor was always threatening "
bad,I have worked at 2 stores in 2 different states and none of the managers know what they're doing they are to worried about getting fired and no communication what so ever
bad,"The whole place is unorganized. You can never get direct information, you are bullied in more ways than one, you are treated like a worker without a soul and they give you no benefits until you are full time. Not the best place to work because they do not value you. You walk on eggshells everyday with Walmart. Very unstable and unreliable."
bad,Sucks really bad. Management shows favoritism. Horrible open door process and ppto and PTO policy's suck. The building is very clean I will give them that
bad,The management is inconsistent their call out system causes confusion the Hiring staff does not know how to properly screen new hire candidates.......
bad,this company has no employee loyalty and they dont want full time help they prefer part time people they expect you to triple your efforts while they offer no help limited staffing an many company biases.
bad,"None of my fellow employees, nor did I, enjoyed working there. The employees know more than the supervisors and managers. Everyone is all over the place at all times and there is not order of any kind."
bad,if you get the cap team job they will treat you like slaves they'll rust you and force you to work past your limits. if you get hurt that on you. the copperas cove store is the worst for this. if you end up needing to take a medical leave they will refuse to give it to you and if you dont call in when they tell you not to come to work then they will fire you. they dont care for their employs or their customers.
bad,Management is really terrible. Store is very lazy and doesn’t respect employees. The store is very dangerous. Effortless management and personal office.
bad,"Walmart sucks poor management, they treat employees like trash. They rely on cap team 2 for everything they criticize us for everything we literally do all the work and all the other associates gets the credit for cap team 2 work. There’s no motivation being there they don’t respect you , always threaten to fire someone and most of all it’s poo decision making by management"
bad,"management was awful and corrupt, couldn’t get a promotion for anything. hours were inconsistent and if you’re sick or have an emergency, then forget about it! co-workers were mostly good people, though the occasional one made work insufferable. be prepared to be berated and screamed at by customers, and have no support from managers about it! goodbye mental stability!"
bad,"They don't care if you work 6pm - midnight, then come in the next day at 6am with only 6 hours to sleep. They don't think about schedules as far as having 2 days off in a row."
bad,"Very toxic place to work , hard working people have to work even harder because managers don't get it , they don't weed out poor performance coworkers. They allow them hide and walk around store and as it wasn't happening (turn a blind eye)"
bad,Terrible company to work for!!!! They are constantly changing policies in ways that take away your bonuses. I missed out on a bonus because they marked me absent when it was excused under a leave of absence and the bonus was for the previous quarter when I worked extra hours to cover shifts and missed 0 days of work. It was considered an unexcused absence when I left work in an ambulance!!!! Always short handed and management doesn’t help or try to fix being short handed. They do whatever it takes to cut costs!!!!
bad,They will tell you that you get a 30 minute lunch and 2-15 minute breaks but you won't. They will work you the whole 8 hours you are there.  If you ask for breaks they will say they will have someone come but no one will.
bad,Walmart had left behind the moral and ethical core of who they are. Their founder would be of the mind to find a new team of people that believe in being honorable.
bad,Company doesn't take care of long term associates. It's all about who you know and not your work ethic. Management will turn on you! Hardworking associates do more while the slackers skate by. No accountability for some associates.
bad,The store dirty and people mean your coworker dont care because management doesn't care. you're better of working at retail with a respectable company
bad,Management is a joke. Dont recommend nobody to work for them. Favortism is wat gets u ahead not your work ethic or ability to do the job. They talk to u any kind of way and if u speak your opinion then they really have it out for u. We had no scanners to work with but they didnt care. For our team it was impossible to set sections without scanners Modular team couldnt work as a team they split us up.
bad,Too many politics going on at Wal-Mart. Too much drama too much favoritism. No professional at all in any way. Employees are lazy and just make the new guys do everything.
bad,"This was the worst job that I worked. No support or assistance when needed, no stability in the policy. They look at the dollar before they consider the person"
bad,"A poor place to work. At interview they never tell you about all of your responsibilities."
bad,This is the most messed up and backwords place i have ever worked! No one is on the same page and management is a joke! Run as fast and as far as you can away from this place!
bad,Do not apply don't waste your time. For the amount of work they want out of you without the pay to back that up it's not worth it. They don't even have a human resources department. Don't believe me?Call and ask. Worst job I've ever had.
bad,The management is disgusting they don’t work with what’s going on in your life they want the impossible even though they know issues and refuse to adress them
bad,"The job sucks, management dont care one bit about their employers. They work you to death but dont want to pay you the right amount of money for the work you do! They rush you but never try to help. If they see how good of a worker you are they will put twice as much work on you and rush you to do 13 1/5 hours of work in 7.5 hours !!  Th"
bad,"I worked at the register, greeted guest, scanned and bagged items, stocked  nearby shelves, assisted with shopping carts outside, did carry outs, clean restrooms."
bad,I been there 20 years and the co. poops on the long trem workers youwill learn stocking and helping and have several opptions to move with in the company
bad,I can honestly say the year I worked at walmart was the worst year of my working career. I have nothing good or positive to say about the time I spent there other than I'm glad I moved on to better jobs.
bad,Management was very difficult to deal with and extremely unsupportive. The job requires long standing and repetitive arm motion that may not be suitable for everyone
bad,They treat good workers bad and let bad workers by with everything. Won't work with their associates when they want Certain days off for religious reasons. But let people have those days off do they can watch football
bad,Place is a dump joke.scummy everyone who is a supervisor thinks their the owner worst place ever you couldn't pay me $50 an hour to work there its the biggest mess I ever saw
bad,"If you like a job that pays low, is not flexible with your schedule, overworked/underpaid, management that schedules horribly and management that yells, poor scheduling and planning, the list goes on.  If you enjoy all of that then this is the job for you."
bad,In my opinion some management create a hostile work environment as do dept managers. If a dept mngr doesn’t want you in their dept they will do anything to get you out of it. Also I feel some asst mngrs look the other way when it comes to racism.
bad,In almost 3 years of working there I recieved 30 cents worth of a raise. The only way to promote since they say seniority isn't a thing is to have a salaried manager be your best friend. Otherwise say good bye to any promotion.
bad,no fans in backroom  had wear pants in 100 degree heat  for 11hr  I work 1 to 10  not allowed to take lunch til trucks wear unloaded  never shown how to do it everyone was in for themselves  no security at all if there was a call brown  i had ccw n got fired for having it
bad,12 years I gave them and every year something was taken away like holiday pay raises and your dignity the pay was so bad I couldn't support myself anymore had to go elsewhere
bad,"Safe working environment, no safety issues at all, friendly team members and few supervisors and managers but your working area is distinguished by your skin colour. Managers are still in 19th century."
bad,I had to move do to family issues however 2018 I applied for Walmart in Fairfield and I didn’t get hired while working in suisun it was good however Fairfield Walmart does not have equal employment opportunity
bad,"But the bullhead city az store's salaried management are atrocious.  (Save for two) the rest are selfish, inept, and truly sociopathic. The higher you go the worse it gets. They lie they try to physically intimidate employees. When this was brought up they swept it under the rug and fired anyone who spoke up. All in all I wont spend my money in that particular Walmart. I wont help those terrible people get a bigger bonus.i worked in this same store before and it wasnt nearly as bad.."
bad,Una empresa que sobrecarga a sus trabajadores tiene malas gestiones administrativas de recursos humanos y un pésimo trato de los jefes encargados a sus trabajadores
bad,"Want you to function like a robot. Revolving door of staff.  Management constantly yells at people and rarely see the good in a person job performance.  Give upper management enough duties for up to 3 to 4 people and expected to get done.  Highly stressful.  This creates a moral problem and place is negative environment. Horrible front end management.  Cannot get money to service customers in timely manner.  You cannot do your job efficiently because waiting on money, price checks, price differences, some hostile customers and nobody gets help and do not answer calls for help.   Creates chaos that you have no control over.  This gets scary.  No action taken.  When you want to speak to management it is like speed dating.  You have to get out what you want to say real fast and do not know if listened to because action is rarely taken. Usually on the floor and never an office.  Always a quick discussion. I have been here for awhile and things have changed for the worse.  You can work 40 hours one week and 10 the next.  Not a very good job for income and pay raises are not good.  You all get the same no matter if you are exceptional or poor performer.     Insurance loss due to short hours.  Unless in management the world is not yours.  Management even struggles and creates the negative environment.  When people call out you can work by yourself for up to four hours alone and no help offered or call people in.  That is a lot of people to service by self and constantly yelled at for things the cashier has no control over.   I love the people that shop there and that has kept me there"
bad,I have nothing to say. It was ok to work there but if wasn't for me.so I don't have anything to say about Walmart it was cool for a while but it has to much going on.
bad,Customer service is a priority and the main part of every job there.  Walmart taught me how to use a telxion to perform inventory functions.  No leadership whatsoever from department to store level.  Communication from management to workers is horrible and at most times non-existing.  Workplace culture is not balances for all shifts.  The most enjoyable part of that job was making friends with other Associates.
bad,"just work hard, stay positive and try to work with the crew. But other then that theirs been some great employees i worked with as a team but other team members would try to encourage segregation among the team and rumors and it felt a lot like middle school to be honest"
bad,they do not care if you get hurt outside of work and will deny you leave of absence when you are not able to work. management will give you the run around and i will never ever apply there again
bad,"The management is very poor. the work experience is so poor there, that they do not know who to schedule their employees correctly. most times the CSMs are always lazy and never go to help the cashiers when then need their help with needing extra money when running low in the draws."
bad,the managers were extremely rude and the other coworkers didn’t do any work. so i had to do mostly everything myself.  no one cleaned anything except me and they would leave old food sitting out to sell.
bad,Don't work here if you don't have to. The management sucks and have no clue as to how different departments work. Raises stink because they cut the amount back and they also took away holiday pay. You are forced to work holidays
bad,Too much drama negativity as well as not so nice atmosphere. Needs improvements on management and employees. Nice job to start off with but not full time
bad,"Overall, we have a difficult time to get manager to come to garden for help the customer to prevent carrying heavy boxes, getting breaks and getting changes. "
bad,"Lawsuit is pending for wrongful/unlawful mismanagement, of false reporting, against me, harrasements traumatized<and abused<slave labor practices in fitzgerald ga."
bad,"Chefia completamente despreparada, encarregados sem senso de liderança, problemas pessoais trazidos para o trabalho e descontado nos funcionários com cargo inferior."
bad,Management poorly trained had big head egos they had their special clicks didn't listen to the associate two face liars out for themselves only no training
bad,"Management is terrible. Employees are treated poorly. No acknowledgment for good work ethic, just for brown nosers. No time off for sick leave or sick family members."
bad,They are slowly reducing number of workers .Most of the managers have a chip on their shoulders. The workload has increased since the reduction of staff. Salaries have not increased
bad,"fast pace plus  garbage pay  on your feet most of the day manager told us we couldn't go to lunch til trucks were finished unloaded  no benefits on part time til a year of working there ,you cant never grow there unless you know someone higher up   they hire you when they need you then fire you  when they dont"
bad,"Worst place I have ever worked in my life!!!!!!!  Store manager is all about his bonus, plays favorites and doesn’t run the store properly or have nearly enough people to staff the store!!!  Csm’s and Asm’s are overworked and horribly paid and treated terribly. Store manager speaks poorly to their management"
bad,This company it's a mafia if you dont known somebody in the management you dont go anywhere so be careful if you gonna aply here I wasted 5 beautiful years of my life
bad,"Absolutely hated working there. Management doesn’t know how to properly talk to employees under them. Rude, undermining and careless would describe them. Underpaid and overworked."
bad,"They don't pay you a livable wage, they expect their associates to do the job of two people so that they can have less people employed at a time and they are getting to where they will not work with single parents on the hours that they need."
bad,"Understaffed, bias in management and corruption preventing effective work, unfair work practices and no room for advancement, work every holiday, no overtime. Generally a greedy corrupt company who punishes grievances and rewards management for abusing their roles."
bad,Won't feel safe till they step up security. They need to step it up with security. Security needs to be stepped up because all the shootings and stuff
bad,"I would rather not say anything cause it would be all terrible things about working for Walmart like I said I don't have anything to say about Walmart there management is very poor customer service is poor, just everything about Walmart is poor not a good experience"
bad,Empty promises for good work even from market managers they are there to feed you lies and to throw you under bus when they’re boss comes in the stores
bad,No work life balance managers are treated poorly.  The district manager was a bully and very rude for no reason.  Always have to worry about losing your job. Favoritism is a problem.  Pay is not to bad if you only work 5 days but you end up working a lot more than 5 and more than 10-12 hrs daily.  No matter what you do it’s not enough this company will run you in the ground!!
bad,"They don't care about you. They just want to make more money than any other place. When you have something serious to talk about they just laugh it off, walk away and do nothing. I had a serious problem with some of the people I worked with and management did absolutely nothing to help me. One of the problems I had with my coworkers was they didn't want to do there part of the job so I got stuck doing everything.I also got bullied by the same people among other things, Etc. I would never go back there ever."
bad,Nothing. Not a great company to work for. Always change schedule and availability without asking.  Change hours and shifts without notice.  Short unprofessional interviews
bad,"If you wanna work here, you have be a favorite of the recruiter & management etc... They don’t care if you are sick, family members sick or whether your children are sick. You get 2 or 3 occurrences & work as a temporary and again not a favorite then you will not be hired regardless of who recommend you."
bad,Management makes this whole store suck. I was fired because I had to keep calling in because they would schedule me when I had school even though I kept telling them my school schedule. All the managers are rude and make sure you know they are the bosses and make you do their dirty work.
bad,Just don't do it. Not worth the stress. Walmart will not properly train you and just throw you to the wolves. If customer issues arise management just sits in the office and calls your extension instead of coming to the floor to take care of the situation.
bad,Never work for Walmart. I worked there for a year and a half and I regret most of it. The management are so afraid to lose a single sale they will throw you under the bus for anything. They expect 40 hours a week for part-time status and refuse to give full-time. Woeking for Walmart was a soul crushing and depressing experience.
bad,The management at kimball Walmart is ridiculous they need leadership classes to train them how to respect and talk to workers like human beings most days they just yelled at us for every little thing that was wrong from food being broken on trucks we didn’t drive to not stocking a whole isle in the 1hr 45mins they have regardless of how much product there was. Also as soon as I got pregnant with my second child they fired me for standing on a purple pallet they don’t have purple pallets
bad,"The managers,starting at the top, were racial biased and played favorites. African americans were started at higher pay than everyone else for the same positions. The store had way too many managers and could not keep quality employees. We set up a store in the summer in Texas with no A/C and were not allowed to have any drinking water on the floor with us only on break! Horrible"
bad,Do not work here longer than two years. Competitive pay but it will cost you your health and integrity. All non Managers are ruled by unreasonable production demands. You been warned you will be treated like a forced laborer. Unless you kiss the butt of floor managers and upper management you are destined to be demeaned and dehumanized.
bad,"The manager of the pharmacy is uncooperative, sexist, and racist. He changed the schedule without my knowledge and then text to see if I was running late for work. He hired me knowing that I had no prior education or training on the position. However he did nothing to provide me with anything to study, nor did he want to answer my questions. He fired me right before someone was supposed to come back from maternity leave. He didn't take me seriously as a trainee and an employee. I would not recommend anyone work at this pharmacy."
bad,I worked for this miserable company for 5 years part-time trying hard each week to get 40 hours. Do not work for this company! Management is very inconsistent and nothing is ever organized.
bad,"I was scamed and harassed  by a store mgr who was coming to work  intoxicated  .Then tranfered to a new store and fired for drinking. Since has passed away from alcohol  drinking "
bad,"Management was a joke. Employees under pharmacy manager we're treated like garbage, especially by the Pharmacy Manager. The work crewwas snobby and clichish. Never Again!!!"
bad,"Together fired me and not getting interpreter for my work in need or any emergency and it doesn’t help me a lot at all, Walmart need to change it soon"
bad,"The management is a joke.  The use a threatening type of management style and definitely play favorites.  You are worked like a dog, and often treated like less than a person.  At the location I worked; the disfunction began with the Store Manager and worked its way down through the ranks.  Walmart pays you more than minimum wage and then (attempts) forces you to work holidays and no holiday pay.  They threaten termination, but do nothing to the same habitual violators of the policy as long as your ""cool"" with the right person.  This by far was the worst experience ever in my life."
bad,"I turned down a higher paying job because I had gotten this job and was promised that I would get 30 hours a week up to 40 hours a week. Within 4 weeks of being hired, my hours dropped to 12-18 hours a week while everyone else in my department was working 30+. I never got a locker because there werent enough lockers for the associates and was told not to carry my phone with me on the floor but had no where to lock it up. The manager was breathing down our necks about customer wait times (for Online Grocery Pickup) but refused to get the door fix which would've decreased wait time because we kept getting locked out due to a malfunctioning dispense door. Just like some places, half the other employees are lazy and want someone else to do all the work so generally you have to pick up everyone else's slack. I had gotten irritated because the managers at my store didnt know how to just let people work and constantly walk behind associates to make sure they are working. I didnt like the fact that I was one of the few actually working and they acted like I wasn't and constantly rode my backside about everything. Literally walking by me every 15 minutes asking what I was doing. Managers need further training to identify ""problem"" employees and let working employees do their job. Another thing that was irritating is the managers take people from other departments and make them work in other departments even if they haven't finished the job they were doing yet. For example, I worked as a personal shopper and managers constantly came to our department and took our employees to go stock"
bad,It was a ok place to work management was a bit unprofessional and didn’t really care for the workers I didn’t feel apart of a team here pretty much by myself
bad,This company is crooked. Hope you don't get hurt on the job because they will find a way to fire you. It's happened many times to many people. There was also racial discrimination in the store I worked at.
bad,"They do not care about you, you are just a number,  I have went to management time and time again for hours. I am a single parent raised two kids alone.  I give my God al the credit. He is good all the time.  He is faithful and He will meet all my needs."
bad,"Low wages, poor management, they don't care about your family life especially around holidays and absolutely no overtime. If you have small children and don't have a built-in baby sitter this job isn't for you."
bad,Terrible place to work. I would never recommend this place to anyone. I would've have rather worked for minimum wage at McDonalds. You can give everything you have and at the end of the day you're still not worth a darn thing.
bad,"Work here for no longer than 6 months actively look for something else. Store are ever changing, managers are incompetent, the customers are... god awful."
bad,Turnover is bad 👎..managers clueless...lots of theft and vagrants begging...store never is clean..bathroom is always nasty and trashy.....managers are lazy and never help.
bad,"This was literally the worst place i had ever worked at their attandance system was unrealistic there was always drama with the coworkers trying to get a position change was like pulling teeth"
bad,i worked in automotive dept. the manager had a short temper. at times very rude to customers.  i hit my head on accident while changing oil and the manager was saying that i was supposed to be written up for it!??. Written up for doing my job the way i was trained.  walmart in Lincoln illinois needs to do an episode of undercover boss. it would really open their eyes.  thats if they even cared
bad,If you plan on working for Walmart make sure you have no life outside of work because they give you no time to spend with family or no time to do anything outside of Walmart without completely wearing yourself exhausted!!!
bad,Worst management I’ve ever worked for and company for someone to work so hard and learn everything there is to know about a department and they get passed up for 6 years for a management position
bad,"I hate working at Walmart management is terrible, cut hours at anytime  they don’t care about employees at all they are inconsiderate of your life & problems"
bad,wouldn't go back - management isn't fair - slackers get all the praise - hard & dedicated workers get the shaft - very underpaid - management is never satisfied
bad,it  was a stressful job at times the management was poor they don't care about people in general they cant keep good help high turn over  the company goes threw so much help
bad,Trash It was trash management dont do nothing but walk around and fu*k employees they have horrible communication skills talk about you and down on you
bad,Worked hard all shift just so store manager comes in to gripe about everything.  It was nothing to see him yell and throw a fit about something.  Assistant managers were just as bad.
bad,I loved working there but the management in that store are racist and they are always behind the Hispanic and is hard working there with that environment. In addition the policy of the point are not fare because if you have a health emergency and you bring them the evidence they put you a point no matter what. Management always find an excuse to fire people even it wasn't their fault.
bad,Worse decision I’ve ever made in my life. Only benefit is the weekend shift so I can go to school during the week. Pitiful company to work for...smh..
bad,"a typical day consists of dealing with hundreds of customers usually in a poor a mood."
bad,Management sucks associates are over worked and under paid. They like for you to work past your scheduled work hours and then they take the over time back. Talk to you with no rexpect.
bad,"Management were not compassionate,Management had favorites. Management is discrimanitory against older workers. They only advance young people under 30 and work the older workers until they dropped or quit. The faster workers moved they wanted faster. They yell at workers."
bad,Poor management. Not enough hours or money to keep up on your Bill's. They don't manage their hours or shifts efficiently enough between all of their employees.
bad,"Not worth the time to talk about the company, Walmart will not allow you to have time with family. If you do, they make you feel guilty because you weren't there at work. They don't pay you what you are worth and if they do,they pile the more duties  making it harder to keep you customer oriented"
bad,I love working whatever job I have. Whether its fast food or retail. Im just trying to expand and have growth in my life and my job. I want stability and also to be able to provide for my family.
bad,When I was there the management that was there at the time would lock us in the pharmacy after our shift was over n after hours.Would scream and yell at us throw stuff pay was NOT like it says and no breaks and if we complained to outside manager we would get wrote up Walmart was a joke I feel SORRY for those that work for that company
bad,I have no review for this company at this time. I do not plan to go back there as an empolyee. Some peope may like working for this compay others might not
bad,"Walmart has been the ultimate curse to me and my mental health, i would not recommend anyone work there unless you're over the age of 45, you will be ridiculed if you are not a republican or use any kind of swear word, you will also be harassed by your supervisor and get ridiculed for wanting to talk about it or get moved, possible the worst ethic department for the company as well seeing as any report will be gate kept by the co managers,"
bad,I rarely ever got my breaks on time and the managers would take their bad days out on us. We were over worked. I never felt appreciated. The customers are rude. And some coworkers can get away with doing practically nothing whereas others get yelled at if they have one off day.
bad,Wal-Mart relies on the minimum wage employees to be the main work force of the store to improve the profit margin and in doing so the management does not actually care about the employees but only pretends to.
bad,"Probably the worst job I've ever had. Company makes billions per year but give their employees a $0.05 to $0.15 raise if you satisfy ""Their business needs"" which demand you do the job of 3 to 4 people with no overtime and get belittled and bullied every day by management and customers. Do not recommend."
bad,Horrible place to work. You are not treated fairly and your opinion does not matter. Raises are few and far between if even at all. They do not care about you or anything about you. Walmart is the only thing that matters there. I do not recommend.
bad,"Somos humilhados e destratados diariamente, tanto por clientes, quanto por gerência e parentes de gerências de outras lojas."
bad,I did not like working at Walmart. They had me doing a job that two employees should have been doing. They treat all of there employees like that. i don not recommend working at Walmart to anyone.
bad,"Horrible Management, horrible training, SLAVE WORK!!!! DO NOT WASTE your time !!!! Cordova ,Tn store is the worst. The management is Horrible. The work is slave work as cap 2 worker. Smh"
bad,"I was fortunate enough to not be dealing with yet another understaffed group. My position was Cap TEAM 2.... and my personal advice to anyone reading is to find another position to work with within the store (or to not work there at all if they aren't offering anything else!)"
bad,"*Work day-Challenging."
bad,i hated my job and life at Walmart ever since i quit i have been happier. The pay is nice but so not worth it. They are bitter and only care about themselves. And if you’re a girl. good luck they’ll target you and make you feel bad about yourself and follow you around to make sure you don’t mess up.
bad,Not somewhere I’d recommend to someone it’s not a fair job mangers don’t work with you and they say they’re gonna change things but never do all they do is lie.
bad,"I worked At Walmart for almost a year , I was helpful as far as moving to other departments as necessary (which was all the time) and going up front to a register (which they just throw you on) and in the end I was always treated awful and the drama there is ridiculous!"
bad,"Worked for this company for 4 years. I was a manager in a department for 4 months and they refused to give me manager pay so I stopped doing the job, they Play favoritisms, management is too busy trying to cover themselves from any issue that may get them in trouble, they lie to cooperate, they will cut your hours by sending you home early, and that’s just the sprinkles on the issues they have going on."
bad,"Awful company to work for. Management refuses to follow Osha laws and basic safety rules. Good workers are expected to take up slack for other employees that spend all their time walking around, headphones turned up so loud everyone can hear the music,  playing on phone, not following proper  rotation procedures,  poor customer sevice, etc. .."
bad,You only have two unpaid holidays off  a year .management in poor  they even have a high  tune over rate (in the past 1year we hve had over 12 managers that hve left along with people that's been there 13 + years that also hve left the company. Walmart is not family  Oriented at all )
bad,Needs to be more parent and family friendly for associates..  Management acts like they are better than everyone.  Management never has your back in any situation.
bad,"I really did not liked to work at Walmart, the pay wasn't that good for all the work we had to do, I don't know if it was in that Walmart, but it wasn't a good experience."
bad,It sucked!!! It was poor management who didn't care about employees .no work life balance and pay sucked.target even pays more.ill never work here again
bad,Do not waste your time if you’re going into a Walmart that is in a terrible neighborhood. The clientele is what determines the environment. The managers are terrible.
bad,"A typical day a""Walmart:, was being exploited by racist management, and given lots more responsibility than I was paid for, Their ""HR"" Department is there too ""Protect"" their ""Corporate Structure"", from LAWSUITS!"
bad,Garbage garbage garbage worst company in the world by far.. they don’t care about you your family or even the environment.. this company should have its doors forced closed for good they are literally killing this planet do not shop their ever I get a discount and still refuse to shop their..
bad,"No one actually listens to suggestions or complaints management has favoritisms "
bad,"This place was awful. I worked for them during the remodel in 2018. I had my supervisor tell me (after my car accident that afternoon on the way to work) that the accident was NOT the reason I was slow that day and that I just needed some food, or better sleep. Treated us all badly and they favored the ones who licked their boots!"
bad,Management is very biased towards blacks and young people. There are never enough people scheduled to work and most of them are only there for a paycheck not to work.
bad,Walmart says they value employees but it is false.  They fire injured associates that can’t perform 100% after being injured in their warehouse. The management from the GM to the HR manager violate ADA rights for associates.
bad,"The store manager was rude and disrespectful to employees! Definitely didn't follow Walmart's ethnic ! Racist against individuals culturally, spiritually and morally ! Wasn't a nice person at all !  Had a click which follow his suit co-managers and  assistant managers!!"
bad,"Dont care for their employees. when there was a storm and employees couldnt make it to work, they got wrote up. they treated the employees like trash. some stole money to take care of family and medical bills, due to not being paid enough and no insurance. Its not right to steal but they couldnt figure out another way"
bad,I felt like I had to meet all of walmart’s Needs. They tried to dictate my life and schedule. If I couldn’t be scheduled on the days they needed me available then they wouldn’t schedule me at all. They reduced all our PTO and other benefits based on our work attendance with unrealistic allotted work attendance days/hours. I do not feel like I have job security at Walmart.
bad,"It was really bad working there. No one cared. There was low morale and would be miserable working there. they would make people be part time and make those same people work more then full time. They took away paid vaction, so the only benifit working there was a discount cared."
bad,The managers sucked and they never had your back and always let the customers verbally abuse their employees. They never defended you even if you were in the right
bad,"I worked at Monticello Walmart for 1.5 years and had to quit because I had a nervous breakdown. I worked in the Online Grocery Pickup department. Most weeks I worked 60 or more hours per week because we were so understaffed. A slow week for me would be about 50 hours. It was constant overtime, 10 or more hour days. Some days even as long as 16 hours. This is one of the most stressful jobs I have ever had. Making sure that 100+ orders are picked and dispensed to customers correctly in a short amount of time with very little staff is next to impossible."
bad,"nothing to say except the turn over rate is very high"
bad,"every day i came to work i was threatened to be written up when i couldn't do my job even though there wasn't enough supplies to complete my job. i learned how to work better with others. management was incompetent since they never did their job. the workplace was miserable since everyone hates how management doesn't help. the hardest part of the job was the weather and the lack of help from others. the enjoyable thing about the job was doing the job in cool weather, and slow days."
bad,When I first started working at Wal-Mart the customers were amazing and some of them loved me. I was always looking forward to work until I found out the Management doesn't listen or care for the employee they say the Customer is always right and they don't back up the employee.
bad,"It is my opinion that the advancement ratio seems to be exact inverse to that of ones' Intelligent quotient level; It's a good temp job as you look for a real one, but don't expect to be treated well by upper management (the few standard cool guys/gals aside)."
bad,"They have horrible management, they treat their employees unfairly. They did not give me the hours they guaranteed to me. I would not ever work there again."
bad,The management of Walmart is unbalanced. They only want you to be their stocker. Nothing more. They also always change policies for hard working employees and try to claim that it's a fair policy and that you either follow it or lose your job.
bad,"As a current employee, I won't claim false allegations as it did provide an opportunity to advance into management, but I wish I'd known what I was getting myself into."
bad,It’s Walmart. There’s not much else to say. Management was awful and fires you for being in the hospital even if you are on FMLA. Finds any excuse to over work their employees. The whole place is ran by crackheads and emotionally unstable kids. Not one employee cares about anything no matter what level in the company they are.
bad,It wasn't what u would call a great job u had to do a lot of things a once an if a customer wasn't helped fast enough u would get writing up all an all u could never get any help
bad,Poor management. It’s always about the number. Poor customer service. They treat there customers and employees bad. They are very rude to there customers and employees.
bad,managers will use their position to make less off you work you  to death harrass you managers talk down on you expect 1000% but wont work with you at all
bad,"Pay sucks, customers are horrible.  Staff is over worked and underpaid . I loved the fact that I never really had to bring a lunch. co workers were cool we"
bad,Management wasn’t so great especially since it’s a really big company. You really don’t get recognized for all hard work put in. They are very unprofessional.
bad,"So many lazy,slacker employees kept on for years who are basically just worthless, while hard workers are let go because of some gossip or bull story."
bad,Pay was not worth the stress and awful managers . People are horrible they make you feel like you will never please anyone . The turn over rate is always 100%.
bad,Horrible  Horrible! Upper management is a joke. Employees or processes dont even exist only the almighty dollar. Everyone is screwing everyone including management. It's a circus!
bad,"Everyday is a struggle, the goals you are given are unachievable and you go home feeling unfulfilled. When you go home and you have been able to get the minimal amount acceptable done, you are off for two days come back to find your job has not been done for ...two days so you are expected to get caught up and your daily work done also (three days work in one).  Obviously it's not possible but they expect it."
bad,"Horrible don't work there at all when they offer me the job they told me I was going to be working 32 hours weekly they will give you 12hr. 8hr. Or 6hr. Weekly they just don't care."
bad,Hardest part is the drive and showing up. Punch in time clock. Start up meeting. Management doesn't acknowledge associates. No more job security due to a lot of human cuts for computer automation.
bad,I think this has to one of the worst place I ever worked for they don’t value there employees and they lie this is a big company and should not be allowed to treat us like💩
bad,Do not work at Walmart.Customers will treat you like garbage for low pay.A typical day at work was restless and we had to move as fast as possible. The management favored workers who had been on the job the longest.
bad,"Poor leadership, poor management , untrained hr manager and staff not aware of there policy’s or of California state laws. Reported alot to ethics and have been dealing with retaliation for months!"
bad,Worst place I ever worked in my 40 year career management plays favorites and if you are not a favorite watch out split days off all the time they only care about the numbers not their employees biggest turnover  in employees I have ever seen
bad,"favoritism at full effects, management has no respect for associates, customer treat associates with no respect managers back up customer disrespect to the associates, managers are disrespectful to associates"
bad,Managers never appreciate the work you do the raises are bad 20 cents every year on evaluation day I'm sure theres jobs that give more then that a yr that's ridiculous that a franchise company cant afford to pay its workers more and they never move the hard workers up to a higher position they tell u they will and then they promote someone else for the position my opinion dont make Walmart something long term think short term
bad,Management does not CARE it’s a terrible job to have . They don’t care about your personal life or your availability. They are extremely rude and have no respect for any other associates . They are also lazy
bad,"They work you to the bone and then complain about your work speed being slow so you work EVEN HARDER and they say the same. Pretty mad, they have really incompetent management, wouldn't recommend applying."
bad,"If you value your Work/Life Balance, Walmart is not for you! Sociopath HAS to be a requirement in order to become manager at Walmart, and they will work you to the bone. No sympathy for their employees. 0/10"
bad,Walmart wants all ur time u never see ur family and they never give u raises they want u to bust ur tail and never give u recognition that’s the Walmart way .. and they lie all the time
bad,"I would not recommend anyone to work here. They treat their workers like dirt, show favoritism and drive pregnant women past their limits. They fired me for my disabilities."
bad,Management is unprofessional and treat you like dirt. They constantly change your schedule and don't tell you. I was lied to about a raise and ended up quitting. I won in an unemployment case.
bad,"Walmart is exactly what people say about it, don't expect anything from them unless they like you and don't expect to get treated fairly cause favoritism is everywhere also their retaliatory  And often create a hostile work environment"
bad,A typical day at Walmart you walk in not even on the clock yet and management is telling you what to do. Throughout the day they throw multiple tasks at you not letting you complete any one first. Management does not help you with anything but expects you to make them look good. I have been working for this company for 12 years and seen a great company become a disgrace.
bad,"Management either has barely any experience or they just don't care about doing things correctly--constantly taking shortcuts! Which leaves all the work for the Department Managers to do! Constantly doing your job and everyone else's job as well. No one is held accountable for not following policies/directions, which makes more work for the Dept Mgrs."
bad,"process data, how to adopt to change, team, not knowing you job because upper management did not know the work. I had flexible hours  and pto time to take off."
bad,Managemnt doesn't care about it's employees. Only the customers and even then... Very judgemental employees and employers. Would not recommend a job there to anyone.
bad,"mean, nasty managers and supervisors who don't understand how to properly run a store, continuously overwork their employees, and expect tasks to be finished in an inadequate amount of time. poor benefits and extremely low salary compared to the work you're required to perform."
bad,Walmart was not a good place to work because there was constant pressure to finish things and we would end up working overtime to ensure things got done.
bad,"The management and overall structure that Walmart has is the worst I’ve ever seen. There is no room for advancement and favoritism is the only thing you need to get anything from them, regardless of how hard you work. The benefits are terrible, they don’t schedule enough people, and upper management is terribly disrespectful to their associates."
bad,You either suck up to managemnet or they get rid of you any way possible. They play favorites and it's horrible. Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this company ever unless you want to spend every second of your work day kissing butt or being miserable.
bad,"I mean it its for your own good stay away from wal mart it suck bad, horrible place to be & work really really bad any other place would be better, think about your happiness & mind, dont work here"
bad,"If you want to work for managers that dont care, low pay, work 6days a week, and get thrown into a job you've never done before with barely any training, this is the job for you. When I started at walmart the only real traning I got was on the computer after I was thrown to the wolf's to just figure it out. We were always short. One day I was left by myself for over and hour to take care of both fryer and slicer side with long lines on both sides(I probably had only been there a wk at the time). Mind you I called for managment several times to come help me and no one came. They want you to take care of the customers but also want you to do several other things that require you to leave the customers and go to the back. These people just could care less about you. Dont work there that's not suggestion."
bad,"Overworks employees and provides very little career growth advancement."
bad,"Worst place I've worked, hands down. Management always pick favorites and are so unorganized. No one gets lunches or breaks on time, that's if they don't forget about you entirely! They lure you in with $11/hr but don't give you any hours. You're better off working a minimum wage job that will give you 40 hours a week, the checks will be the same."
bad,"No career advancement if the managers don't like you for any reason. They refused to get our department supplies ordered on time, and then threatened to write us up for not doing our jobs. They wouldn't get the proper equipment in, and what they did get for us was ALWAYS breaking down. Then it would take them weeks to get it fixed. When a department was short handed on workers, us, the maintenance team was told to fill in. BUT, when our department needed help, we never got any. We were treated like 3rd class citizens. I worked my way up in 9 and a half years from 7.50/hour, to 10.95 an hour, BUT then they made all new hires come in at 11.00/hour, so I got a five cent raise for a whole year. Then the following year, I got only 19 cent raise. Before, I would earn a 50 to 60 cent raise, based on my job performance. Not anymore. They took away a lot of our discounts and perks."
bad,"Walmart managers don't seem to know how to do their job properly unless it's to coach and write up an associate. They don't follow policies and are more concerned with giving the customers whatever they want, even if the customer is lying, than doing what is write by the company and by their associates. They don't even protect their associates from disgruntled and belligerent customers."
bad,"No matter how long or hard you have worked for Walmart, the second you cannot offer whatever they expect of you they will kick you to the curb. I had a work related injury and was forced into unpaid leave which led to me losing my house. If you must work here, be wary of the reality that you are expendable no matter how dedicated you are."
bad,"That’s not a good place to work. "
bad,"Wal-Mart is the worst place to work. They over work you under pay you only want to offer to part time. Management, customers, the CSM's most of their store managers really UGH. Walmart don't give a UGH about their employees or their customers. Walmart is full of UGH."
bad,"Horrible place to work. They don’t care about their employees at all. They’re only worried about the money that’s coming in, nothing else. Wouldn’t recommend working here."
bad,"They treat you bad and don't care if you have a family."
bad,Promotions happened at random.  Often open positions would be unfilled for a long time.  The most qualified person rarely got promoted.  I always felt powerless in a dead-end job.  Even the manager of the store isn't allowed to decide when to turn on the air conditioner in the summertime.  That was controlled by someone hundreds of miles away or at least that was what we were told. Things broken or worn out in the store stayed that way for a very long time (years).  Sometimes in the middle of a shift there no was no managerial staff around to resolve customers' problems.  New rules would come from the branch manager then 3 weeks later they were forgotten and not taught to new employees by lower management.  A lot of turnover. Lots of low morale.  I tried to get promoted more than once.  The first time an Asst. Manager told me in interview I did well then said he already chosen someone else but interviewed me anyway because Walmart required 3 interviews for each position.  Everyone I worked with seemed frustrated with Walmart's confusing and sometimes pointless rules. Unless you are desperate for a job I don't recommend working there.  Save yourself the drama.
bad,"The management team at my particular location was absolutely horrendous. They fired good workers who showed up every day and worked, and kept attractive ones who they were sleeping with and give them more hours so they could see them more. Its a sick rumor mill that even the management team gets involved with as opposed to actually doing any official managing; this can be seen by checking their quarterly reports and seeing just how often the employees received bonuses; as they are dictated by work done, and an arbitrary score assigned to it."
bad,"Things done during the day time shifts or actually not done during said shifts was constantly blamed on the night shift. No one took responsibility for their mistakes, and things were always blamed on lower level associates."
bad,"This was one of the worst companies I've ever worked for. The staff was horrible, the people were horrible and treated you like nothing. The hours were horrible and non-flexible"
bad,Walmart have stores all over the world and you can't pay starting pay 15.00 an hour. ALL YOUR GOOD WORKER ARE GOING SOME PLACE ELSE TO WORK BECAUSE OF LOW PAY. HOBBY LOBBY pay 14 an hour. IKEA pay 14 hour people work were they can afford to pay their bills. You train the employees and they go somewhere else to work. The manage is all for thim self. Mybealltgood
bad,Don’t try to work at Walmart very bad place to work on it too many confusing orders no info about your job limit they want you work every thing by your self
bad,I have never been treated with such disrespect from another co-worker(dept mgr) in all my years of working.  It was dispicable to be treated by this person and management ignores these issues.
bad,I would not recommend working at store 1313 managers are bad and won’t help you with anything. Only mangers that help my were chad and marry. All the other managers just scream and yell at you for no reason
bad,"I worked at the automotive department in WalMart as a service writer. I was forced in the summer to stay outside in the extreme heat on asphalt that just made the heat worse. The management at the store I worked at really didn't care. Besides that, for a company that makes billions of dollars a year and pays management and corporate ridiculous amounts of money and bonuses. Giving only a 22 cent raise a year is just a slap in the face."
bad,The customers are very very disrespectful there is no safety for the workers customers threating the workers something serious management doesnt do anything. A customer can threaten to shoot you and management or security no where to be found. I HATE WORKING THERE ALL I CAN SAY IS APPLY AT YOUR OWN RISK.
bad,first day after working on the computers i got pulled to bring 2 and a half pallets of frozen item on the floor and what didn't fit back in the freezer to be put back into bins. had a hour and a half to do this all on my own. Management made it clear they didn't like me except for a few and if i tried to have a conversation with them they would be short with their answers. i would get pulled to go into departments everyday i didn't even get hired for there but they didn't care if i was the only one in my department and they made me go back and forth to each. a co-worker and a good friend of mine got verbally harassed by the department manager and nothing happened to him when we brought it up. there is so much more to talk about but this is already long. DONT WORK HERE PLACE IS A JOKE AND RAN BY CLOWNS🤡🤡🤡
bad,"Worst management culture ever. Most condescending is how anytime a manager would pass they'd acknowledge you, but it was only fake and designed to make you feel valued. Great big lie. Walmart could not care less about the hourly associates. The experience left me with such distaste for walmart that I dont even want to shop there."
bad,"Like, 17 hours work gives 1 hour PTO (paid time off) after 3 mo. orientation (""pathways""). Managerial misconduct, professional ethics out the window. They worked up the ladder in that soul sucking pathetic job to be privileged to suck, so, face that. Also, sec club. Realize that. No one talks about it. The impetus of all professional misconduct is the sec culture sub culture, racial divisions in which white people are always at fault, own it. Be the cuckold (sin eater) for everyone else's, esp. management's sin. ""Clowning"" (pretending to be interested in work while interested only in sec) is the order of the day, every day. Be a sociopath, look at everyone else as your tool however that can be achieved. Clown."
bad,"You are not treated like an employee or a person, you are seen as a dollar sign. The store manager is never there, makes 100k-200k a year, depending on how large their bonus is (which depends solely on scheduling as few associates across the store as possible) and when he is there he is either too good to even talk to you, or reprimanding you for something you’re falling behind on in your Department. The only reason that you are falling behind in your department is because you will typically spend your day helping in  every other department. Dollar signs don’t get sick, dollar signs don’t have other obligations in life. Therefore when you as a person do get sick or have other obligations, you are punished. I was an Hourly Supervisor because of one decent ASM. I would suggest that you never work here."
bad,I have no comment about walmart or there staff. Would never work for walmart again based on my experience and the time i spent there working. Thank you
bad,"I would head to work, clock in, and I would get stuck with all the work and customers, and when I am doing other people’s jobs I can’t do mine, there’s no manager on board when they are they talk to the other employees and I would get yelled at by the big boss for not having my station clean or ready to go or leaving my station."
bad,All the management care about is money. Not all of them but a majority of them care about profit and making the customers happy. It’s hard to move up unless you are a favorite of one of the managers. They do not base your promotions on skill or hard work but on weather or not your liked by management. If you are a hard worker they take advantage of you. If something happens with customers they will always side with the customer and not protect there employee.
bad,"It’s a decent job if you “want” a job, dealing with customers is okay, lot of issues with management; either never around or take their job seriously, lack of hands on training, everything computer based. It’s a failing retail business that should be unionized. Pay sucks, moving up is impossible, Walmart DOES NOT promote within, I do not recommend this job for experienced people or people who have a strong work ethic"
bad,"Stressful, poor conditions, lazy coworkers. The job was not worth the $11 hourly. I was working in the back room all day, even though management lied about training new people so I could help stock the sales floor. -10/10 would not recommend."
bad,The pay sucks people who have worked here 5 plus years make the same as those that just start out.  Those who get promotions are the ones who have no experience on the job or life experience. Promotions are based on the buddy buddy system.
bad,They always hire and promise a career plan but it never happens. Toxic workplace with managers fighting against each other to keep their jobs. If you do not approve of the GM the group of managers bully you until you quit or they fire you. Almost every one goes on stress leave.
bad,Probably the worst company I have ever worked for.  The management have favorites.  The hours sucks. The pay isn't good.  Management treats the hourly employees like trash.  They are always screaming at them.  I worked in the backroom as a receiving associate.  They dont care if you have a sick family member.  In their eyes you belomg to Wal-Mart.
bad,"All employees are over worked, underpaid and no insurance. High turn over with employees quitting because of the bad work environment. Nasty customers, not enough employees to do all of the work."
bad,Managers put their frustration on you no matter how good youre doing. The managers know they can get fired in a snap but instead of getting better jobs they just get angry at you for not working fast enough. They expect one person to do a 5 man job in one night and get mad and threaten you to stay overtime.good luck with the ridculous rules this place has. Walmart doesnt care about their employees bc in this walmart they dont allow sick days The coworkers that have worked there longer are super entitled and take their jobs WAY too seriously like you can tell some of these people barely got lives outside of walmart. The upper management like (co managers amd store manager) is are picked based on who can be the best booty kisser customera
bad,I only worked at Walmart for a fe months. But in that time period they scheduled me to close one night then come in and open the next morning with only about 8 hours between shifts. That gave me no time to relax after work. They did that multiple times.
bad,The job it's self is fine but management is really bad. Someone else who everyone sees doing wrong gets away with everything but someone who actually works gets wrote up and blamed for everything. I ended up in the hospital for two days and get yelled at cause I wanted more hours but had to call off. They aren't nice. It's actually a very dirty place and I am starting to hate going to work now. the hours they give you jump around where you can work a great week but the next you'll be lucky to have 20 hours. The only half way good thing would be the pay but not if you don't get enough hours cause then it turns out the instead the min wage paid more in the long run.
bad,"I started out bright eyed young fresh out of high school I was stoked about working at Walmart thinking it would be a great place for advancement boy was I wrong! The Dept maNager I was assigned to was rude loud and crass ! My hours fluctuated according to how she felt, and going to upper management was no help. It’s a truly horrible thing when your dept manager comes just short of physically assaulting you"
bad,"This job seems great, but Walmart is greatly slipping on caring about employees. They just outsourced their Human Resources department. Don’t work here. It’s a lot of work and a lot of pressure without good benefits"
bad,Always coming into your shift getting pulled because things were rarely completed from other shifts. Always short staffed because of treatment of management demands.
bad,"The call center has extremely demanding goals set in place and VERY strict monitoring teams. When you are on a call they log in and watch your screen and ghost listen to your calls. Your “manager” has no control over your hours, your PTO, your schedule etc. They expect you to take abuse from customers and employees and expect you to not react like a human being when you’re being berated"
bad,Would i recommend working at Wal-Mart yes and no and i explain this company is two faced period they tell you one thing and do the opposite but if you can block out the BS and keep a mind set that you need to pay bills and don't mind begin treated like an under paid servant for the incredibly wealth a**holes that own the company go for it
bad,This company will suck the very soul out of you. If they give you a raise or bonus they will cut your hours to pay for it. You must adhere to an aggressive point system. No holiday pay except Christmas Day. No time and half if you work a holiday. Stores are short staffed so expect to be overworked.
bad,"the job was really easy, stocked salads and rearrange freezer and threw out food everyday , management is cool, coworker was all nice everybody talked to everybody"
bad,"they paid me 7.50 .25 cent over minimum wage , and i worked 5 days a week 8 hours and 30 minutes a day . it was awful worst time of my life and iwas so dedicated to it being my first job . now i just feel stupid for ever working there. ruined my life"
bad,"It was stressful... your feet hurts so bad 1 of the women that work their had surgery hamstring... only thing I like about Walmart is because I met a new friend, an the thing I hate about working at Walmart is now I have hamstring problems and pain... an you have the worste Managers an a lot of favorites going on"
bad,Working here was only temporary while i was i school but it was very unpleasant. The workers did not do the work that they were supposed to do so that made it harder on others.
bad,"This is mot a good place to work, they dont care about their people. The pay is no good, the benefits is no good,  there are too many changes at walmart"
bad,"This review is going to be one among the countless and is not going to be noticed. No consideration for excelling in our position. No matter how many MasterCards we sell, more hours are given to people with no MasterCard sales or just a few. Never seen a place with almost all the employees disgruntled. HR department of Walmart is a joke if they can't identify and sort out all there problems."
bad,Slow workers don't know what they're talkin about bad managers they are always rude to customers and they'll keep telling you to do stuff when you already have something to do and if you don't do it you'll get in trouble I take points off because they don't like you
bad,"managers suck, no job security, do one thing wrong and they write you up, seniority doesn't exist, if they don't like you then you just stay in the same position forever"
bad,This company doesn't care about there employees.  Managment is horrible and unfit at the store I work(d) at. There are a few good things about this company but I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.
bad,"Walmart was supposed to be a temporary job, they treat me like a work horse. It is not the best job ive had, but it is a solid income. I reached my limit there."
bad,"Working at Walmart was terrible... A typical work day would be me coming into work and getting yelled at by either a manager or customer about something I couldn't control. A manger would yell at me to make break to early or yell at me for something I couldn't do. A customer would yell because a manager is taking to long to help at the register I was at. Management at my Walmart is both nonexistent and terrible. They are terrible at making schedules as well. Even if you asked off and you also told them. They will act like they are listening, but when you check you schedule they schedule on that day you asked off and act like they never knew you told them. The workplace is just as laughable as the management there. Nothing is ever cleaned when it should be and also people will try to push their responsibilities on you when you have your own. I learned that you shouldn't rely on management there at all. The hardest part of working there was trying to get hours there since the manager there at the time was a bit of a creep and never gave hours. The most enjoyable part was having Christmas off and working my final day there."
bad,A typical day of work is coming in at a 8 at night and working till 11 at night . On days that we had inventory there were 2 people in the department all day
bad,Upper management gangs up on anyone they deem a threat to their way of business; even though there is zero tolerance for retaliation according to policy.
bad,My 5 years working here have been a real struggle. If you want to get a stable job and move up in the company this is not the place for you. I would not wish working at Wal-Mart upon my worst enemy.. Just work for your local superstore and help them out.. Not this behemoth of a company.
bad,I had very bas experience at walmart ave b yuma az other then that thats all I could say. There are all female. Young they had other people pass there test and they hire husband.wife.brother sister aunt uncle they are very Mexican dont speak English only Spanish and the people that do. Speak English work double by translate .
bad,"Wal-Mart will LITERALLY ruin your health, mental stability, wallet, friendships, basically everything. They treat their typical employees like garbage, but continuously hire the terrible ones back and give them advancement over people who know their jobs and actually do the work. They treat any employee with a disability like they are lower than the gum on the bottom of a shoe and push them until they make a mistake and either quit because they are sick of the mistreatment, or fire them for questioning policy or standing up for themselves. Not only that, but they don't follow federal guidelines for medical equipment, and harass you."
bad,"I enjoyed my co workers.  However, the management was horrible they never came out to help.  When asked a question it took forever to get any kind of an answer.  They had no idea how to schedule."
bad,I started my career out at Walmart and it was difficult from the start.  The company has unrealistic standards and will go through associates the no regard for their well being
bad,No one cares and the one's who do shouldn't let anyone know that they do or they will get eaten by a socialist.  No one gets paid enough to care about managing others well.  Managers stand around acting like Captain America but they don't really save the day.
bad,"Accused of doing something I didn’t do, pay was good and liked my co-workers, but such a terrible place to be. Time consuming, they don’t care if you have the flu, you better not call in."
bad,The store rewarded poor performance with raises and promotions. People who worked hard got the short end of the stick and anyone who was worth anything had the smarts to quit after seeing how bad things were getting. The pay was okay but that was the only good thing about working for this company.
bad,"Being punished for having kids.  Because I will not open my availability. Poor management. Not enough good workers. Love my job but it's bad there."
bad,Walmart is a horror place to work their management is all over the place no one knows what to do there and not only that they terminate people for stupid reasons
bad,Management has a very poor reguard for their employees. Also they treat their front end staff as if they are incompetent low life pieces of garbage. The pay is not worth the stress and drama associated with their work load.
bad,The management is a joke and they treat you with little to no respect. The will see you and just walk past you. They do not help when they see you struggle and problems never get solved. Do not have opportunities to advance and the pay is horrible. Have been there for almost 10 years and I get paid a little more than what someone who starts tomorrow makes. Job is not worth the pay or stress when you know the whole area and still get treated poorly. Do not recommend this as an employer.
bad,"Store manager is rude as heck."
bad,"Wal-Mart is a toxic environment with inconsistent, incoherent, and illogical management along with store policies and procedures. Management expects way too much production and output from a skeleton staff this is particularly the case on the night shift. Wal-Mart does not learn from it's mistakes and will soon be suffering the consequences of it's horrific management and it's overall business culture."
bad,Empty promises to promote.they say you are valued but the second the human resources person thinks they could get in trouble for being lazy they will make up a reason to fire you.
bad,"Over worked, pay was horrible, managers treated workers unfairly,   my friends still works at Walmart. And complaints every day, the old employees ( works at Walmart 10 yes or more) feels the company is trying to push them out."
bad,Not a good company to work for . They dont appreciate you and pay is too low to live off of. You only get a small discount and cant be used on everything.
bad,"I always thought of walmart as the place to work until I got in and really saw what is all to it. Management at my store is horrible unfair, spiteful, and not by the book. Ranking managers are being fire for a lack of integrity and those are the same managers in control of firing you. It's a CIRCUS"
bad,I would never recommend this walmart location. The management team is very unfair and they dont care about you. Their there to only hire and fire you.
bad,This place is very unorganized. Management is not always good. They try to rush work. Very little little praise and recongnition. Little room for advancement.
bad,"Typical day at wamart is basically very inconsistent. Management is lost on everything. Your current supervisor would tell you one thing to do, then its changes 5 mins later. Basically what I learned is absolutely nothing, if you want a job that will turn you into a people hater, then this is your job. Management doesn't support the associates in no way, they let the customers run all over you, treat you however they please. There is so much favoritism when you work here. The newer employees who started after you get moved into management positions compared to someone who has been there for over 2 years and knows everything about the department and how to run it. The hardest part of the job is knowing you walk into work dreading every day and wondering if you'll have a job. The most enjoyable part of the day is your other regular associates. When you've been with this company like I have for more than 3+ years, you grow strong friendships with some of your coworkers. Only reason I am still here is because of my coworkers."
bad,Walmart is not family oriantated like they say.It is cut throat.Never know if you have a job or not.Like a rotating door there.New Cashiers training new Cashiers.Csm are always disappearing.Manager of store is Rude and acts like she is above and your dirt she walks on.Management horrible !
bad,Don’t work at Walmart unless it’s your last resort. The management sucks at all locations that’s why they don’t want a union so they can treat the employees however they want.
bad,You would get payed for 1 weeks of work when you worked 2 weeks. Everyone was a naz*i and treated you poorly (management that is) Just another number to them.
bad,"This job was ridiculously horrible. Would never ever recommend anybody to work here even if they paid more. Besides the other people who worked there, every one else was a complete moron, and only cared about themselves."
bad,I worked as a customer service manager and department manager at Walmart and I would not recommend it. All the assistant managers act like they are better than everyone else and you get no support from them when you need it. It is very hard to get fired from Walmart so they hold on to bad employees just so they have the bodies. Store managers in my experience have always been bad. They just talk a lot and say what you want to hear and nothing gets done about it. Walmart customers are terrible and rude and expect you to give them whatever they want and management doesn't back you up when you follow the rules. Very stressful environment. I know of several people who went on stress leave in just the few years I was there. Not a good place to work.
bad,"Ir was a harrowing experience"
bad,This company is the worst place to work . Managers are horrible and they don’t do what they say . Thecoay is ok depending on where you are in the store . The store manager doesn’t pay attention and isn’t very helpful when you need him to be . All the managers pass the buck and don’t really do their jobs them self
bad,"They would put too much work on you and ask you to stay late, but you would have to cut it due to you can't have overtime. Management would not help you when you asked."
bad,"They have to fix my hours weekly. Lack of communication between supervisors. They would schedule my fulltime hours, when I am part time so you work the hours without the benefits. They say open door policy, but you go talk to anyone in hr and they make you feel like they have more important things to do. In the break room all the assc do is complain. That should have been my first clue.  If I didnt have Bill's to pay I would have walked out my first week."
bad,I worked my tail off for them and was promised a promotion but they lied to me.  They didn’t appreciate all the hard work i did for them.  I always went above and beyond for them
bad,"This is a place where Customers get away with yelling at Associates and Managers do nothing to help or back them.You could be off the clock on a lunch break and Customers see you carrying your vest and still want you to help them."
bad,"I started out in Walmart in 2005. I quit Walmart for the first time in 2008, because there was a manager that decided she was going to reprimand me in front of associates in the lunchroom. I came back into 2009, 6 months after I quit, as a cashier Because I needed a job that was stable. Only thing good about my time with this company was when I got my diploma through a program they provided. But I would never recommend anyone to work for this company. With the way they treat their employees that don’t brown nose. I’m glad I left. Smartest thing I ever did"
bad,"I have been there going on 5 months, the CSM's suck, management is horrible, they keep cutting hours. I would not reccomend a job there ever it is horrible."
bad,"Walmart is a poor place to work, no paid holidays, no management, Management harasses and bullies employees. There is no work direction on you job and how to do it....."
bad,"Management sucks, pay barely meets minimum wage and raises do not happen often enough! I would never go back and never recommend working here!!!!!!!!!"
bad,"They have an extremely high turn over rate. Instead of getting all employees to do their share , they kill the hardest working person! I wouldnt recommend Walmart to anyone."
bad,The manager I worked for was very sexist the females weren't allowed to do much males had to do heavy lifting and females cooked the food. Males did basically everything else
bad,"Walmart is the worst company ever they have the craziest call out policy ever they wanted you to call to let them know that you was involved in natural disaster even when phone lines could be down. They did not accept doctors notes. They didn’t care about their employees, they wanted you to do training on the computer but never really gave you time to do it"
bad,not the best place to work all they do is take away things from us no holiday pay but 3 times the right up for not showing up on holidays and any other day they seem fit so dont plan on ever haveing a day off when they are going to be busy they have twice changed there paid time off system in my 5 years there both times takeing the time we had earned and made it basically impossible to use and forced you to start over.
bad,Walmart is walmart. pay is awful and training worse. they cater to pharmacists and belittle technicians. it is only a stepping stone to better things.
bad,Walmart is not a very good company to work at in Hammonton. They have poor management. Also it is very unorganized. One supervisor tells you do to something and then another manager tell you to do something completely different.
bad,there is no leader ship at walmart management sucks. That's at all walmarts in the country all the employees have the same complaint they hate walmart.
bad,All Management was rude uncaring unreliable allowed hostile work environment overall a bad place to work never had a stable work schedule they dont train new employee's just throw you to the sharks
bad,My time at Wal-Mart started off well.. just here recent they got a racist store manager that ruined everything. I was one of the best employees there.
bad,"company was more worried about making money for the owners than taking care of their associates, hours and staff were constantly cut which made it difficult to take care of the customer."
bad,"Management wants us to report damage, I was new to the position so of course I damaged a few things. They fired me because of what they told me to do."
bad,"Tiring work with little pay, you have to do more work than your role is and you end up doing the work of others with no appreciation. Management is terrible and consists of people who want more pay but don't want to do the work for it. The hardest part is having to deal with unruly customers, for the obvious reasons."
bad,This place is horrible to work for! Call out sick with the flu and end up receiving 4 attendance points because of it! My HR basicly told me to file a leave of absence claim that was denied! I was terminated after that. 5 points in a 6 month period and your gone! They make it so easy to gain attendance points! THIS PROGRAM NEEDS TO BE FIXED! Walmart also needs to accept Doctors notes! I had one stating I had the flu and they would not accept. Spoke to my manager and she didnt care basicly said I was replaceable. Walmart fix your company and teach management to care about your employees because clearly we are all disposable pawns.
bad,"They said there was an open-door policy, but that's untrue. Went to the Manager with a problem and was then fired a few days later with no warning. The reason was not true either. They messed with my clock- in times and made it look like I was late and left early! I could never get all my work done because I was always asked to help other departments. The store was always a mess!! No time to clean it up.  And If you worked overtime to get your work done, you were asked to leave early on Friday. I was once asked to leave 2 1/2 hours early!!!  The department managers were a joke as were the support managers. They stood around and chatted, never giving any support or help to anyone. They just had a meeting at 6pm and told everyone where they needed to help out. It was usually not in your department. "
bad,"Fast paced, productive, safe and flexible environment that allows room for growth and learning. I have learned time management and advanced my customer service skills."
bad,"Trash, Walmart is trash. Management behaves like children and stars up drama among fellow employs. Management is trash. Walmart is trash. If you value your self at all don't work there. Because it is trash..... To Walmart, you are not seen as a human with a life or feelings, rather you are a money making robot whos life is nothing but Walmart. WALMART IS TRASH! Good luck in the job hunt everyone!"
bad,Because of snow & sleet had to really slow down & and stores didn’t have enough help to unload because I was 10 minutes late I was fired. Most of the time loads from the warehouse was late that was never improved and the GTM was never around they put us in orientation and 90% of the time no one was in the class room no agenda at all
bad,"I did a lot of peoples' jobs because they refused to. Out of 5 other associates, (technically overstaffed to them) and I was doing ALL the work alone. If you have a problem don't expect help  from  the management, all they will do is use it against you."
bad,"Good place to shop, but worst place to work. Too much favortism. If you have so many points whether its an emergency or not, your fired!!! Never again"
bad,Run far away... and when I say this I really mean if you like to be treated like a human no matter how hard you work unless it’s for a management position run even then run!
bad,The People Greeter job is the worst job ever don't ever do it. All you do is stand at the door and say hi to the customers and the time just drags out.
bad,Been with the company 11 years and it truly get worse every year. I will be out a job in September because I can not open my availability for them! Sad what walmart is doing to us.
bad,Management is horrible it was awful. They are rude and they don’t train you or even make sure you have proper supplies. They don’t always give you your 15 minute breaks ethier
bad,Company doesn't care about employees or customers.After years of working for this company nothing as got better only worse everything is centered on what management wants.No team efforts or compassion for employees or customer
bad,"Worked there for 15 years and overall it was just a joke of a place to work. Great people, terrible managers. They treat you like a dog and when you excell in your job they still treat you like trash. And when the bonuses come out the managers will either choose to give you one or not give you one."
bad,They will use and and abuse you. Work you to death. There is no life balance. They have favoritism for poor performers and reward based on meeting quotas.
bad,MANAGEMENT IS HORRIBLE. The assistant managers and the store manager treat you awful. They also will not provide you with any Gatorade. They don’t care if you get too hot either you will still get yelled at.
bad,"they didnt care if you had emergencies, you do get a lot of hours. but no paid vacation or sick days. it was a stressful job, for the pay you got. its hard to advance at this job, unless youre friends with management. they advance lazy people because theyre friends. verses someone who keeps to themselves and works hard."
bad,One customer threatened my life. Another one pulled a gun out in the store in front of everyone. Management did nothing. I thought he was going to kill me.
bad,Herasment is heavy i am veary unsaticfied on how uper salery managers treated me being herased i face herasment everyday for no reason and when i told managers nothing happed
bad,New employees get paid better then long time employees also treated better. Will work you all over the store. They don't care about employees or there families.
bad,It wasnt managed well the staff is rude and manipulative and would mix my schedule where i was piled with work i worked 6 days a week and never got a break
bad,I don't think walmart is a great place to work unless you have the patience to deal with the stress and management. It's management team is very disrespectful and does not treat you like human beings
bad,"The standards and guidelines were ignored and/or not enforced by management, numerous employees did not put the effort forth necessary to complete nightly requirements which cause additional work to be placed on performing associates."
bad,Was great but last 10 years it's all about who can make their pocket fat on your expence. If you have Ethics and Christan values you are the minority. Horrible company to work for. I would not let them walk my dog. Treat people horrible and have behind the door meeting on who to fire
bad,If you would like to be treated like the bottom of the pole slime of the earth and believe that you can put up with the idiotic single brain cell management team then go ahead .
bad,This was the most depressing job I’ve ever worked no appreciation whatsoever this company is really the worst to work for the company as they always refer to (managers) is their only concern not the real reason you apply for the job
bad,I was totally dedicated to my job and the customers that entered our store. I strive for the best customer service a person can give . My attendance was perfect and I totally loved my job
bad,the one I worked at is closed. they let NCCU have a party in there...dj set up at the paint center. it was so lit lol. now its a planet fitness. good day
bad,"nao se pode ir nem no banheiro em paz que já te chamam  no microfone , pior empresa e ainda sofri homofobia."
bad,"head Cashier, clean area, take out trash and hangers, stalk up products, cash out and bag items,  customers service's when needs, return items, clean sweep and mop, sort out items in bin, worked out in fuel station, clean sweep inside and out store, mop, cash out customers, cash out gas, clean up residue gas on ground, warm up food on display, cash out lotto ticket, more"
bad,"I worked the customer service and money center, I was also a back up cashier when it was busy which was everyday like all Walmart stores there are 20 registers and normally two open."
bad,"Without getting into all of the gory details, I would say proceed with caution. I was offered a position and due to a disability was unable to perform one of the job duties. They offered me another position because it would not  require the former duty that I could not perform to then three weeks later require everyone working at our store to perform that duty. It was a glorious waste of time."
bad,Thats all there is to say. All the things you have heard they are all true. There are few reasons to stay with walmart for an extended time. Thanks for teaching me what not to do
bad,"Management sucks. They dont care about you. Your ignored/cant even say hi to you when they walk by you esp when you just start your shift. Wont give me more hrs when said they would. "
bad,"Everything they teach you do, they, the management, ignore themselves.  How the employees supposed to d as they're told when upper management refuses to do it in front of the people working under them?  They care nothing about the employees themselves."
bad,Most of the long term employes at some point or another offered me some of their prozac of zanax. People were so proud of me when they found out I was leaving. No one really cares who you are or what you've done though.
bad,"It is a horrible place to work, got tired of being screamed at to go faster and do more.  The management is horrible.  Horrible place to work.  Always short staffed, and expected to you the job of the person away as well as yours, everyday is the same.  Not enough staff and more work expected"
bad,"This company sucks the life out of you. They give you the bear minimum . Cut your hrs and continue to cut your hrs. They focus more on the customer and not their employees."
bad,"If you want to be severely depressed and get taken advantage of than Walmart is definitively for you. If you're a great employee management will take advantage of you every chance you get, They will make you work in every other department but your own. When you say something or try and open door it nothing ever happens with it. Horrible customers and even worse management."
bad,Awful place to work....they don’t care about their employees at all. I’ve never seen a company so strict about attendance...I mean things do happen in life. It’s just not fair
bad,I worked very hard for a long time to get promoted to assistant manager. Several others were promoted over me even though I was enrolled in a program (by my manager) that was suppose to prepare me for the position.
bad,"I’ve been working on trying to get out of Walmart but my manager actually job blocks me cause he don’t want to loose me but yet cut my hours so I can’t buy food, get my much needed medication, or pay bills to get my phone back on which we use in store but not reimbursed for.  I was just written up for taking 5-7 minutes of my 30 minute breaks that we never get. Got in trouble for telling the patients the truth as to why it takes two days to fill a script. And it keeps going from there. Full time with less than part time hours."
bad,The management was rude and snarky when it came to fixing mmt work schedule due to then constantly changing it at the last minute. They also don't give you all your breaks that you are supposed to have when working more than 6 hours
bad,"As long if you do your job as told, you are fine. If you try to move up in the company, you will hit a glass ceiling based on race/sex. If you are trying to make an life from working here, don't. You can be fired at anytime."
bad,I'm very disappointed in the 5+ years I've been with Walmart. From the dishonest management and the very poor pay for all the work out into completing tasks given.
bad,"I haven’t been Able walk into that Walmart again. I hate that place."
bad,"The management sucks, there is no work life balance, and you aren't allowed to be human. I had a horrible experience working at the Dekalb location, and I would never recommend anyone for this location. The environment is extremely stressful, management is lazy, and they are extremely understaffed on purpose."
bad,not a good place to work at all the managers are racist they talk down on you and everything its a double standard at the Walmart i was working at its crazy the type of work environment is
bad,"I was fired on my leave of absence because the department manager nor the personnel or store manager followed proper protocol to ensure my job. I was let go although I followed all procedures necessary on my leave of absence "
bad,Would not recommend this place to anyone.  Horrible company treats employees very badly. Other department managers don’t work as a team. Everyone is very unhappy store manager is not a team player
bad,"night starts in good mood until nightly meeting starts. it then becomes a tossup on if night will be good or bad based on truck size vs how many stockers are present. stockers are given their asignments then maintainance. who sweeps, who scrubs, and where to wax."
bad,"I honest dont recommend working for this company, they don't care about you, if you're sick, have a death in the family, nothing. It's more what you can provide for them and that's it."
bad,They could care less about their associates. Point. Blank. Period. All they care about are numbers on the board and having someone to fill the orders they need.
bad,One of the worst places I have ever worked. Management only treats their favorites with respect. Everyone else is treated like garbage. Too much work for the little time they give you and they can't seem to higher anyone with an education above middle school. Some of my co-workers were unable to read.As soon as I find another job I am definitely leaving and never coming back
bad,"Management would pick & choose who to hold accountable for breaking rules, had wrong people (who would have personal motives) in a position of power, will throw associates under the bus to cover their lack of, thus putting employees job at risk. If you have FMLA & use it correctly they WILL turn on you & try any & everything to get you fired. if you work for cap 2 you work in the  worst conditions while receiving the least amount of pay in the whole store. conditions with the least amount of pay."
bad,"12 years I was with Walmart. It is getting worse and worse, no work/life balance. Management is unrealistic (I was even salary). If you want to be able to spend any time with your family do NOT work for them. They care "
bad,I stressful place to work at. I would not recommend it to any one with bills to pay. I hope that they can upgrade there planning on everyday daily work demands so that as a team progress may be seen.
bad,"I was not able to take vacations for one week or two weeks at the same, My manager wants me to take one or two days this week, in another week another days. No holidays paid. Only Christmas day store is close. They need more employees. People don't stay for long enough, they quit for favoritism, increase is only few cents, I don't recomend to work at Walmart."
bad,Wal-Mart has a very competitive work culture and punishing to the point of unfair policy enforcement. There were no exceptions for absences and no care about your personal well-being.
bad,Worst work experience of my life so far. The manager i worked under was awful. She would talk to her employees as if they were children. She made it very difficult to work for her.
bad,Not a very good work enviroment. No one is on the same page from one shift to the other. Its cut throat for sure.Gossip is very bad there and it hurts innocent people.  It can be a good place to work if everyone worked as a team but they do not. WalMart in other towns seem to run better and more open. Not all the stores are run the same and thats sad. Maybe if i were younger when i hired in i would think different but i was almost 60 when i was hired. There are some good people there though. Would i recommend Walmart as a place to work. I would say yes if it was the only job there.
bad,No communication between managers . Unsafe working. environment unloading the truck .No department training or help from co workers that are suppose to help train you .
bad,"Less hrs , they want you to be available with no pay , only good Walmart’s up north, very unprofessional place , managers are no good ,store managers only care for them selves"
bad,"Do not  work for this company.  They only care about the bottom line.  They are in the process of eliminating many jobs. They are not fair when promotions are available,  and many times they promote unqualified candidates with little to no training. Often times good, hard working associates are overlooked and are not listened to."
bad,Was never fair. Managers take advantage of you and aren't there when needed. You can never meet the standards required no matter how hard you try or the amount of work or hours put in.
bad,Walmart was okay at first the management became very rude and was hard to come in everyday I felt bullied and tormented it was a lot of gossiping made it hard for me to concentrate let along feel safe
bad,"The managers mock you for having a disability, the customers are horrible and leave disgusting messes, and the coworkers act as though they are still in high school."
bad,"I felt I was often being used due to my bilingual skills. Unfair 100 percent."
bad,I would say it would be better in a different department. The department I'm in now is a joke. Managent doesn't do anything to the bad employees but the good ones are treated like trash.
bad,"You may or may not receive a raise ONCE per year. This year the raise was only 23 cent. Management thinks you have no life outside of the place. The managers are lazy and literally don’t do anything. Terrible, terrible place to work"
bad,Hated working here lots of discrimination towards new workers by co-workers. Gossip and drama central.  Worst training by far two or three long shifts sitting in front of a computer.
bad,I currently work for Walmart in my home town on overnights and CAP2 is the better of my options. I mistakenly changed shifts for the pay increase to $11.72 and have worked 7 days straight. The work is easy the coworkers are good. The managers are useless and the stress THEY put on you is unbearable. On CAP2 is best either way and less stress.
bad,"Not a good place to work for, has too many issues to list. First off the management staff doesn't know how to run a store,  and the hours are cut on all employees unless you kiss but to management."
bad,How many hrs u get are based on how much wour manager likes u. They treat u like a slave and treat u like dirt. I was turned down for a rehire even know I had a rehire able on my record because of how 1 manager didnt like me.
bad,"The harder you work, the more they expect. They never recognize what you do and how you do what others should have already taken care of. You can request a certain day iff and they give you those dzys, but yoyr regular days as well. Whi can luve on working 3 days a week???? Ughhh"
bad,"Non productive, Big management issues. Favoritism happened a lot with  managers and associates were underpaid. Managers took advantage of employees all the time They also did not pay for overtime all the time . They took advantage of several good people and caused a lot of work pace injuries and lawsuits. Most male managers took advantage of struggling female associates. They have a long way to go to ever be considered a "
bad,"This was the worst job I have ever had."
bad,"Warm body hiring, if you went to college and have degree they will promote you. Doesn't matter what type or skills.don't care for the people who have been with the company for e ever.  They are more worried about diversity numbers."
bad,I worked at Walmarts for 14 months one of my worst jobs ever. Management treats all the employees bad and they don't care at all. Work anywhere else is better!
bad,"it does'n't matter how much you're qualified, you'll never move up in the company unless you totally agree with management even if they're wrong or have relations with them.. no one knows how to do their job correctly they treat customers horrible. It was a very stressful working environment to the point that I left there taking meds for anxiety literally."
bad,"If you dont look like them they dont like you and will do and will say anything to get you out of your job. poor leadership, needs a union because the HR doesn't help and their open door is a lie. Not having a union to talk for the associates is really bad because they abuse the associates badly and they dont tell them their rights. Long term associates has no value for them they want people under 30 years old."
bad,The workers are incompetent and rude. At first I wondered why. It took me over a year of working with customers that would treat you like trash to realize that everybody's dignity whom worked there was slowly being chipped away bit by bit.
bad,"Management frequently made promises, but neglects, fell short, and never followed through on them. Tasks were demanded, did not care about employees, neglected their health and personal lives."
bad,I really did not enjoy working for Walmart and felt that the work I put in there did not pay off like it should have I would consider working for Walmart again but not likely.
bad,Walmart doesn't care about their employees they only care about getting the money in and making sure they get they're bonus at the end of the month or on the holidays that are coming around.
bad,"I would say that a typical day at Walmart was not typical at all."
bad,"Worked there for 4 years, they were always playing favorites, did not care about family emergencies or if you had an emergency yourself. They cared if their call ins for the front end were below 2 people calling out.  Stressful and not worth your time to work here. They will throw you under the bus real quick and yet will claim that you're family. They don't treat their employees right."
bad,"a very unorganized unprofessional establishment, however i did like the characters that were employee's that this establishment. Overall it was an understandable experience, but the scheduling was very scarce and could have been supervised."
bad,"Worked for Wal-Mart in all my time there only thing liked was my co-workers, customers. Seen how little they care about the employees. They only care about their bottom line. Run Skelton crew so manager gets bigger bonus. Have were they try make customers use self-checkout, have no employees on the sales floor to help customers. Try get employees doing more then one job but only get paid for one. If employee going be over 40 hours for week most  of time have to cut hours they don't want pay over-time. All about finding ways around things"
bad,"There was a time when I thought I would never have to work mediocre jobs that typical teens had to when I was younger. After leaving my first job, however, I found myself in a desperate race to find another job to support my family and myself...and unfortunately it was the corporate giant no one could beat- Walmart. "
bad,Employees got trated like they were making 100k a year. total beat down by management. Busy day would not give you the suppot you needed. Would get coached
bad,"They treat their managers like a number, they coach people for things out of their control. The compensation is terrible. But hey everything will be okay if they give you a 10% discount right?"
bad,"It wouldn’t be a bad place if there was better management, they will pick and choose the rules for select individuals . Everyone is held to different standards. No matter how hard you work nothing is ever good enough for them. Would not work here again"
bad,Didn't really like it.  They were not sensitive to employee needs.  Husband got sick during the time there.  They have an occurrence system there for there attendance and they mark you down a point each time you called off
bad,Management was very pushy with mastercard applications and didn't treat their employees very fairly. The most enjoyable part of the job was finding nice co workers to get along with.
bad,Do not go to work for this company..employee loyalty does not mean anything to them. I had fantastic co workers and supervisor. I was a very dedicated pharmacist for this company met every challenge they presented to me. Today after lunch supervisor calls me into office read off some BS script saying company is restructuring. That my position was being displaced. Which is the same as being fired.
bad,"Walmart is just the worst of the worst. They are hands down the most abusive, unethical and evil company on this earth. They crush people like they crush our economy. They shouldn't even get one star, but there wasn't an option to go lower."
bad,It sucked. I got paid part time hours while working full time hours. The manager was a complete Jerk and didnt care About one elses issues but his own
bad,that place was not a place to work at... its a open and door store.. ive work there for two years and the management was not nice they pick and choise who they like
bad,"I was going to go on a rant, however, I will just simply say that I am not impressed. I felt like my job was at stake before I was even hired, ""production"" is hard to hit and is determined by what kind of trailers or freight the manager gives you. Some people sit at 96% which will get you written up, while others will be hitting 150%. No lunch, 2 twenty minute breaks regardless if you work the 10 or 12 hour shifts. They write you up for every little thing. ETC, I'm looking elsewhere for work simply for my own sanity."
bad,"Good job to have , friendly environment, especially for younger employees. Pay is good. I learned a lot working for Walmart, Great place to go further in if that’s your calling!"
bad,"Usually it is understaffed, so you are picking up the work of others. Managers are constantly just putting out fires left and right, and no real reward for it all."
bad,Very demanding management had no idea what they were doing most of the time. It was a revolving door. Promotion didn't happen to often and you had to be part of the crowd to get the promotion.
bad,"I enjoyed the actual work I did at Walmart and was very fond of the people I worked with. That is all I can say that was good about Walmart. I can't imagine a worse place to work. Management is absolutely incompetent and abusive to its employees. There is absolutely NO training for anything. It is sink or swim. Employees work in an atmosphere of being fired every minute of their working day. Employees are pushed constantly to the point of exhaustion. I compare it to being in a prison (although I have never been in one)."
bad,"The company went downhill when the policies kept changing. They don't care about you. They don't care if your sick, if you have kids, its either your nothing but Walmart or it won't work. You have No life working at Walmart. It's a slavery job."
bad,"Micromanaging takes place both physically with a manager walking the floor all night with their hands behind their back like a prison warden, to electronically with their “task” for you to log into. Management is condescending and some are “coach happy” (looking for something to coach i.e. write you up for) too demanding of tasks for your shift and pay. Job is very physically demanding and if you get hurt on the job they’ll challenge you and you would be best to get injured in front of several co workers who will back you up with written statements (they ask you and them to write incident reports). They keep you scheduled just barely under full time because as long as you are not working six consecutive weeks at 40 hours you don’t qualify for benefits. I will give them this: one particular manager was great in HR and in safety, was always concerned with people leaving pallets on the floor and not watching the forklift etc I believe she went on to become a regional manager (or something) in another part of the country. Otherwise people working there all date each other and act like they’re in high school, there is drama left and right and the type of people there are just very toxic in general."
bad,"Its good for a starter job. But learn what you can and leave asap, this place is the most disgusting two faced business that I have ever worked for. I highly recommend they nobody should work there"
bad,Such hatefull management and no place to move with in the store. Won't let certain people change departments or they will let certain people move how ever many times they want too.
bad,Very depressing working for Walmart where you feel like you don't matter to the company. If you need a little help with money this might work for you. Managers don't care about their employees as well.
bad,A typical day at Walmart consist of going in the back clocking in and then walking up front to see what register you are on . Then you go clean your area then turn on your light to start checking out costumers . Management was not very good so i didn't enjoy working there .
bad,This company with new policy that. Were. put into place does not require. You to be human they prefer robotics and screwing people in general over never would ever recommend this company to anyone
bad,"They do not care about their employees. Walmart promotes based on favorites and who sucks up to the boss, not based on performance. will work you like a dog without so much as a thank you"
bad,"The management was inconsistent and rude. There were many conflicts between employees and management to the point of many walking out. Although the customers were amazing and the store was kept clean, it is hard to work in an environment where management isn't on your side."
bad,"Management base everything on there personal feelings.  If your not there friend or a relative run cause you won't get a raise or promoted.  You will be treated horrible until you quit, or they find a way to fire you.  They make up lies about you they get coworkers to pick on you."
bad,"So I needed to emergency transfer...new manager wouldn't tell me why he wouldn't allow me to work at their store. Even though I have worked there in the past. Thus, I was fired and not told why"
bad,When i first started at Wal-Mart it was ok but then they started changing everything and not for the best for the employees. They changed the way they give our bonuses so nobody would be eligible to receive one. Then they cut the amount of days you could miss in a six month period and used that to stop giving you a bonus.
bad,"Worked 10 plus hours but never paid, had to take two to three hours for lunch or asked to leave early. Always short handed. Never came in contact with store manager."
bad,CSM's do not do their jobs.  Managers don't even care.  Only certian cashiers are treated well.  If you aren't sleeping with the CSM then nobody likes you.
bad,Got fired based on heresy. The managers are dumber than doorknobs and like who they like unlike a hard worker like myself who gave them 4 years of my time. Never stole anything never stole time like so many of my coworkers and yet I was left to find a better job whi h was the best solution ever. Walmart is the most racist and worst place in history to work. It is a oerfect starter for kids graduating high school. Most management was highly unqualified. 100 cashiers in the building only 1 on register because the others get away with hiding in the breakroom. If you are looking for a professional starter job do not start here. This job made me hate customer service and i became the most meanest person on inside and out never was in a good mood. The abuse I insured over the years I am happy it is over. This job is not for african Americans so save your time.  They also lied on my termination papers and denied me and my family unemployment. Disgusting trash. Go elsewhere
bad,They expect 1person to do a 3 person job management needs to be better no one seems to really care alot of unnecessary drama and saying something to management is in one ear and out the other it's like fighting a losing battle there
bad,"A great place for someone who has no prior skills as they are eager to train.  However, they no longer take into account prior experiences and it makes the experience dull and mundane."
bad,"When I first started working for Walmart I absolutely loved it, they cared about the employees and it was like family over yearsthings changed they striped us of all the benefits you looked forward to, its hard to advance unless you're in good with certain people, if your like me and do your job well you get stuck and they find reasons not to allow you to advance."
bad,"Walmart does not care about its associates. They will work you like a dog and pay you like one too. You only get 3 opportunities to call out within a 6 month period. No matter if you have been there for years they will fire you. Doctors notes are not accepted. The management at my particular Walmart in Tallahassee are very uneducated, racist, and unsympathetic when it comes to people of different backgrounds. There is also no job security all someone has to do is not like you."
bad,It was horrible. Worked at the Titusville store for 5 years and never saw a decent pay raise. If you spoke up you were punished. You will be overlooked for a promotion unless you brown nose.
bad,"You are overworked and underpaid. You are under appreciated, and over looked. Management has favorites, and if you are not one, than you are SOL on what you want to do and to go further up in a career that is just yanked away."
bad,They work you like slaves but don't  pay you right at all. They always cut hours during the summer so the managers can get there bonus. They treat you unfairly and don't listen to the real facts of the company that need to be corrected
bad,"I worked here for 3 months before I quit, they consistently scheduled me outside of my availability making me miss school, church, and bible study classes. They forced me to go on a leave of absence for a very minor ankle injury then, after the leave of absence was taken, denied it giving me attendance points because I “missed my shifts”. It’s extremely hard to find anyone above your supervisors in the store at any time, I tried calling in to talk to them and they were nowhere to be seen. So good luck trying to work out any problems you may have."
bad,"I was being reprimanded for things that were not in my control, such as not having walkies that rarely worked and not knowing things were being stolen. ."
bad,"never again will i work for a company that puts money before employees. they treated everyone quite poorly, training was minute and there was a lot of people that were over worked well beyond the outlined standards"
bad,Absolutely awful store management!  The Store Manager is a disgrace and plots your demise every chance she gets. She smiles in your face while getting as much evidence as she can to fire you!  The Assistant Managers are out for themselves and have no loyalty for other managers or compassion if something negative happens. Most of the employees are on a middle school level at best and gossip worse than children. The district management sets the tone for all these inadequacies and he’s really terrible!  The epitome of failure and disgrace all around!!!
bad,worked for walmart for 3 years was promised a lead position and never got it. Instead they would make me lead as a regular associate but not pay me for it. Lots of favoritism doesn't matter how hard you work you wont get promoted for that. People were getting promoted to manager after 5 months of working there and they were not qualified to properly do the job. So if you work hard do not work here you will never go anywhere with this company. If your a kiss butt though this job is perfect for you management feeds on that. Hence why half the Walmarts you go to are terribly ran because everyone in management doesn't know what they are doing.
bad,"i am a student who applied to walmart letting them know before even being interviewed and several times during my time with them that i would need to work different hours due to my schooling then what they preferred for a maintenance worker a minimum of 32 hrs a week working 4 days a week which would have been fine if they scheduled me for weekends like i asked for or to schedule me more days at lower hours they over worked me 4 maintenance employees every night and i ended up doing all the maintenace job while the other 3 stocked shelves then when i gave my two weeks notice they scheduled me for three weeks worth of work and sent me a unsatisfactory termination or abandonment of my job letter two weeks after my last day and a 4 weeks after my 2 week notice, very unprofessional  workplace constantly saw employees chatting on work hours walking through the store doing nothing for hours including most of the managers at the time especially the head of maintenance took me a minimum of an hour to find him when he was needed and over 40 mins just to go grab a broom or mop while waiting by spills in the store so customers are aware they are there none of the stations for cleaning equipment around the store was ever there"
bad,"Management and co workers were of low quality, really drains a good employees will to work hard. I would assume with a low wage they shouldn't be as slave driver as they are when they get a good employee, always seemed like the best employees were abused instead of rewarded."
bad,Do not work at Walmart on McKinney ranch to much favoritism got fired because they were after me Irma is a snake and can’t be trusted to much discrimination just fed up with this company
bad,"The HR ladies talked about what a family oriented place Walmart is, but I’m here to tell you that it isn’t. They only care about doing as little as possible for their employees."
bad,Management sucks and they work you like a robot. They think they can talk to you any kind of way and not get in trouble for. I will.never work for this company again.
bad,My time working at walmart was very good got to learn new things. But too much favoritisms and some of the staff was rude and very hateful towards their team mates.
bad,"A typical day at work depends on the hours I work that day. Those that work during the day in my department are not great to be around and on many occasion I am left to have everything put up on my own. It can be very stressful especially if I have a lot of customers coming to the fitting."
bad,It’s not a good place to work at. Everyone tries to let you down it’s just really ridiculous. The managers are super rude and they think they are something else.
bad,"Pésima actitud gerencial, no hay apoyo y sólo son un grupo y no un equipo..."
bad,"Walmart is a terrible place to work . They don’t care about their employees or their availability . Will stick you with 1-10 shifts all of the time and you will hardly EVER work in the department that they hired you for . You will be expected to complete everyone else’s work and get in trouble if you don’t complete yours as well. I work in electronics and they will make me go to different departments all of the time and sometime even have me outside watering plants . Takes 6 months to receive any benefits , 3 months to receive a 10% discount and all of the health care benefits and maternity leave are only for full time employees. They will give you full time work schedule and put you in the system as part time so that you won’t receive the benefits .They have a 5 point system to where you can only miss 5 days every 6 months or you will get fired , NO EXCEPTIONS , you get 1/2 point for being late 3 points for no call, no show & 2 points for calling off on a key event date.  All of the managers are very rude and do not know how to behave themselves in a professional manner . They also don’t honor any of your requests for time off . Walmart is overall a terrible place to work . If I had to rate them it would be 0/10 and I would NOT recommend working here ."
bad,"Walmart is the worst place to work. Unfortunately "
bad,Walmart is the worst place to work management doesn’t care about their associates! It’s a toxic & stressful place to work I would not recommend to anyone
bad,Very poor management. Can't make productivity even it busy the whole day. To many cut hours. They don't care about core values or workers anymore. No benefits or perks to being there anymore. I used to work at the store many years ago thought this was the place to be so I was told very good place and it took me a long time to get in. When I did I was happy. Then it went down hill and it's now worse than ever. Getting occurrences for everything. Even if you need a bandaid. They need a union in there bad. It's just awful. I will never go back. Money is good if you are single and have no life and kids. They mandated for all holidays even if there is not enough work. It's just not right.
bad,"honestly? management was careless and rude, did not give any care about their staff, overworked people but never paid overtime. dont waste a day of your life here. you can do better. anything is better"
bad,"The only way I advanced was being a slave to Walmart's politics,  another company only prizes profits, (thus pieogen funds) they profit if your dead or alive. This is a company that's racist and only advances certain races,  they want you to not think highly of yourself,  they want you to spend your hard earned low paychecks exclusively at store."
bad,"I was hired when I was 17, and they couldn’t find a position to put me in. I trained for over half the positions in the store and the continuously moved me. Horrible experience."
bad,"The management is TERRIBLE!!! They don’t know what they’re doing, and they treat the employees like trash!!  Always being “watched”.. you can’t even go to the bathroom without them looking for you. I loved my co workers but Walmart management is the real problem. The changes corporate made are ridiculous making everyone do extra work with no extra pay. It’s just not the time or stress."
bad,Horrible place to work for. They work the snot out of you. Pay is zilch and health insurance is horrible. Staff are rude and management is horrible. Very dirty place.
bad,"Employees find it hard to work here specially in unloading trucks with few numbers of staff. Late breaks and lunch, have to finish first the unloading. Employees easily come and easily go. Understaffed and LOW SALARY are the main reasons why I quit. This company works you more but you get less!"
bad,worst place I've ever worked. fast paced stressful. gained a lot of experience from the work place customer service wise but its definitely the reason why i would never work retail again.
bad,very flexible when it comes to student workers. but pay is terrible for the work they expect from you. can not afford to live a very good life if it were your only job
bad,"A lot of Cycle counting, Manager has favorites, Management within its self is poor all the way around. Some people are lazy, and the good ones pick up the slack. Training is poor - Benefits are terrible - You go out on LOA and Walmart will fight for you not to be covered."
bad,"They lie to staff and tell them what they want to hear."
bad,"Just done...unrealistic expectations...stressful, if you can't work what they want they take hours away from you... threaten your full time position if you can't open up your availablity"
bad,Horrible service to customers and employees. Barley did the bare minimum for cleaning or work. All around horrible management and never had the customers best interest.
bad,"Walmart treats most employees like they are replaceable because they are. They will have you busting your butt and never recognize you. You will be given part time schedule with full time hours so they don't have to give you bennifits. The job itself is overwhelming a lot of customer's are rude and will walk all over you. The management will always choose the customer over you even if they know you are right to make themselves look better. I've never had a job where i was on a ""team"" and felt so alone in my life. As soon as you get to your one year mark which is how long it takes to recieve a pay increase and some other small things they will find a reason to write you up so you jave to wait another year. I was told by many, many customers that i was an amazing employee. I had customer's call my managers to let them know what a wonderful person i was and how hard of a worker i was just to never hear about it from management. I would never refer anyone to work here. Its all corporate greed. They will replace you if you dont replace them first."
bad,"Typical day at work:"
bad,"The company abuses great employees while letting lazy ones slip under the radar. I was about to be promoted to management when I had to move and the Walmart I tried to transfer to refused my transfer due to the point system. I had points for uncontrollable circumstances that fell upon me, but it didn't matter to the new store."
bad,The management does not know how to do the jobs that are a lower paid grade for them. Many time I had to explain to upper management how to run a cash register. They don't care about your well being. i had a boss harass me all the time and nothing was ever done. I hated working there.
bad,"worst 4 years of my life"
bad,There are too many supervisors and directors that do not understand the processes and therefore when they explain information it is often misguiding. There is no communication between the levels and you can tell that many people were hired to fill seats without having the necessary understanding of what should be expected of a job.
bad,Management was highly rude and did not work with me they messed up my schedule and scheduled me on days I was not available on my application and they didn’t fix missed days that they said they would but never did.
bad,Managers are more set to make their bonuses than customer help or employee help. Stocking and trying to help customers does not work out in the long run.
bad,"I worked 10 hours at $13.00 an hour and my check was for $3.97 then they terminated me. Sorry place to work. Have proof if you would like to see"
bad,"At first, i was reluctant to even apply here. But when i did, i was reminded why. "
bad,"You have to do alot of work to meet deadlines and do customer service and cashiering. When you dont finish your, process you are reprimanded. When you try to explain they say you are making excuses."
bad,"If you’re new, they pick on you. If you are uncomfortable with something they pressure you into doing it instead of helping or working together and they cut your hours if you didn’t do it right. If there’s an a good reason you can’t make it in, no one will cover for you and if they do, they’ll make you feel uncomfortable and unwelcome in the space. They didn’t even pay me the correct salary. Rude stuck up bosses that make customers think they’re great but horrible to employees. Unless you want to end up scrolling back through indeed, don’t work here."
bad,"Absolutely no concern for employees, Low Pay, No Ownership of responsibility for employees that get hurt on the clock, will 100% attempt to weasel their way out every single time, No help during emergencies as far as days off or in terms of Sick Days, Absolute Slave Drivers"
bad,The store on Mall View Road has really bad management and they treat their employees very bad and they would like to talk down to the employees they have you work overtime and don't pay you for it
bad,"Management sucked, hours are few and far between. Could be working over 40 hours one week and work 10 hours the next week. You go home stressed, tired and sore and you are highly underpaid for all the work you do and the things you put up with."
bad,"Managers don't care about the employees, half the time they don't get breaks but managers make sure they get theirs and when asked to cover someone's break management refuses."
bad,"The company itself is a great place to work for but the wal-mart i worked at, the employees made my hard! never did i think adults would behave like the employees working there did and management have there favorites the people who get away with murder and the ones who can’t catch a break!"
bad,They work you to death management will walk by something on the floor and tell you to pick it up.  They dont oay well cut hours like crazy...... no benefits for parttime
bad,"My manager and boss were awesome and loved them and working with them. Once when a different manager transferred to my store, she just kept going after me. Quit because I couldn't take her anymore"
bad,Management never listens to their associates & you have to go to management multiple times to see any improvements. Management never holds anybody accountable for what doesn't get done. On a good day we can get all of our work done. Most days we come into leftover freight from the night before & have to play clean up crew.
bad,they will fire you for being in the hospital and will not accept doctor notes. cashiers literally do anything they want you to do. you are the most dispensable employee they have.
bad,"Hard work and garbage pay. They even instruct you how to apply for government assistance because they know you qualify, even working full-time. Mandatory unpaid 1 hour lunch break, which makes you wanna go to sleep. Eat up 9+ hours of your day for 8hrs pay just to stretch employee coverage, which is already pitifully understaffed."
bad,"Management sucks & they dont value their employees, they talk to you any kind of way and expect you not to say anything about how they talk. Wal-mart is horrrible place to waork"
bad,The company needs improvement in specific areas including on employee morale and problem solving skills. The mangers do not care about their employees and are hard to find if you have a problem or any questions. The degrade you in front of customers and around fellow team members.
bad,"Walmart wasn't a good place to work because, it's a big store and the managers are all up your behind for no reason and they be pushing you to do the most."
bad,"they used me as a scape goat to further their personal growth(asst. managers) I quit and submited my resignation to corporate. that store is now better, but I have little respect left for that company."
bad,Worked in Sanger TX for 13 years in the shop they did a mass layoff and blamed the associates (techs) instead of telling the truth or holding managers only responsible about 2 shifts and almost all the service managers and shop manager were fired most employees had 15+ plus years with the company
bad,I had a nice time at walmart although the mangement was horrible and the employees were not so great neither. I had to stand in one place for 4 hours only had 1 15 min break and i was there for 8 gousr a day no one waa nice even the customer this is no the best pace to work
bad,"management treats you like trash "
bad,you came in and had to clean up from the shift before and you got yelled at from the shifts before mistakes they yelled more then explaining things to you
bad,I spent 20+ years working here only to lose bonuses and see hours reduced to 24 hours a week. Stay away.. There is no career opportunity. All off the manager positions are being eliminated. Now hourly associates are being targeted. The company sets unrealistic goals that have to be met by the entire store in an effort to keep from paying employee bonuses.
bad,"No están cordinados"
bad,"It was stressful for me I was a associate and became a department manager of men's and boys wear within 4 months which would of not been a problem, but Walmart would give me an employee and take they to a different department within the first week of helping me. A lot of paper work with no employees having to maintain depatments, and keep up with stock and Inventory was a lot to handle."
bad,"I loved this job when i started a year ago, but now i cant even stand to shop anymore!! I no longer work there cause I wont kiss their butts anymore!! I did my job to the best of my ability ( fast & accurate) but it was never good enough.  You will never get any advancement unless your hand is in the same pockets of management!! They really have their favorites!! I'm gonna miss the few friends I did make but I couldn't take the stress of that place anymore!! To the people who really own Walmart need to look into things for real.  Shady stuff going on in your stores people!! I have so much to say but not enough words.   Just dont waste time working at Walmart until they fix the stores management and policies!!!"
bad,This company has gotten worse & worse!!!!!!! I am looking for another job!!!!!! I hate this place; I use to love Wal-Mart. But not anymore!!!!! It’s awful to work here!!!!!
bad,"I worked for Wal-mart for years and they treated us terribly, forced us to work through breaks and lunches. They never paid us fairly and always tried to work us to death."
bad,"Simple work, no advancement opportunities, management always micromanaging with no trust that the work would be done, not properly equipped or stocked. If it’s not the managers way than the right way then your at fault. Always looked down upon."
bad,"Prefer to work somewhere with friendlier management, and fair working environment, somewhere with good pay raises and a place willing to work with you"
bad,"Los jefes por delante son una cosa y por detrás otra. Solo te usan en su propio beneficio.  Pocas horas para los asociados y mucho trabajo, que no se relaciona con el pago que les dan y los millones que ganan los dueños  a costa de el trabajo de otros."
bad,They have a blatant disregard for the employees and fault and write up employees for issues that they have no control over or did. They do not follow the beliefs or guidelines that they set before people to think that its a good company.
bad,They’re are hard working coworkers that’s gets pay. So little but management gets pay more than coworkers and all they do is talk to each other doesn’t wanna help than complain later and yell at the coworkers later.
bad,"I used to really enjoy working at Walmart, in fact, at a time I loved it. Though, through the years, management has begun to care less and less about the associates that are employed under them."
bad,"Walmart is probably the worst company to work for , they don’t respect there employees or there customers, terrible place to work for will never recommend it to anyone"
bad,Corruption runs rampant in this corporation the store i worked for was part of a 7 billion dollar lawsuit for fraud. They dont care about you or your family at all and will make you work in very dangerous environments when working truck with fast unloading machine
bad,"it was an okay job. they really dont care about people health issues there honestly. the pay was ok, could have been better for the work i was doing.."
bad,over worked and under paid poor mangement poor benefits does not work with life appointments not willing to work around ur schedule very rude when u use the open door policy
bad,Managers are  arrogant and don’t know how to show their associates respect. I really couldn’t help but feel a slave mentality from them and they play favorites. The worse is they ask you if you want to earn overtime knowing they just going to cut your hours the following week to make up for it.
bad,I hated working for walmart. the management was horrible. the people who deserve to move up in the company cant because they would have to do favors first for the management before they would even consider you for a higher position. they are horrible.
bad,"Dealing with unhappy customers and not having the tools to succeed in the store environment, I Learned to invest time in my job search to understand the company to find the right for my career goals."
bad,Walmart should I say anymore. Worst company  in America. Only county not to have it unionized. You will be fired for saying you should be able to have a union and get good pay..
bad,"Messes were often left unattended and not cleaned up for an extended period of time, manager was not very organized, there is little to no support for employees and there is a lot of information you don't have until you need it and even then it's like pulling teeth."
bad,its a great start but I would never let a friend or family member work there management is trash the work is easy but its a lot they don't pay well at all and they treat you like nothing there I hated working there wont even shop there they leave food out for hrs put chips in the freezer and  put return food that sits for hrs up front back in the freezer to sell
bad,"Management is terrible, half of them spend thier time shopping the back room for clearanced out items, never enough staff for the amount of work needed to be done, and then management talks to you like your an insect when work isnt finished and you are not appreciated for work done."
bad,"I hated every bit of working here. The management, hours and pay all suck. And they treat their employees very poorly and unfairly. The job was overall stressful and they aren’t reasonable."
bad,"I's a corporate company that only cares about it's profits and not it's employees. Very stressful, lack of proper management, lack of proper scheduling, they expect you to not have a life outside of work."
bad,too much work and not enough pay no tools to work with and its left up to management to advance you and they play favorites I did 6 other associates jobs and when contacting corporate they just tell you to quit they automatically take managements side over associates I tried to advance to a management position when passing the test and they turned me down
bad,"this place allows the people who don’t work hard to be babied and the ones that work get the mouth from all the poor management. this place is absolute garbage to work for and will never be a place i recommend. if you want respect fair pay, don’t work here. all crooked people. corrupt company period."
bad,"very busy pharmacy, they really need to have at least 3 cashiers working in the front everyday, i also was paying for dental insurance that i never got to use"
bad,"Sueldo muy bajo"
bad,"If you don't enjoy working 60+ hours a week, hardly ever seeing 2 days off together, management does not get breaks, being micromanaged, a VERY NEGATIVE work environment from the market team down.... this will not be the place for you."
bad,"Walmart sucks , dont work there. I was assaulted on the job and walmart really didnt care. It goes to show a lot about the lack of standards and priorities that company holds."
bad,"I left Walmart due to poor management and poor pay. You get inconsistent hours - sometimes you work 45 hours in a week, sometimes you work 12. You never know, and you can't survive off of it."
bad,I worked at Walmart through a temp agency which was very difficult they work you like dogs also the brakes wasn’t fair one of my managers was very rude
bad,When I worked at Walmart the management were so rude and unprofessional. I learned a lot about being a cashier and dealing with money. The hardest part about working at Walmart is you have to stand up all day and work every weekend.
bad,Bad management and doesn’t take the time and listen to the employees if there is an issue. Also management is not consistent when scheduling associates
bad,They treat all their employees like horribly. Management is horrible. They complain about everything you do and retaliate against I recommend to never work there ever!!!
bad,"this company sucks to work for. I did not like working there.  the management sucks.  when I asked to go work somewhere else in the store, they wouldnt let me"
bad,"Laid back and a fun place to work."
bad,"Everyone looked angry everyday, employees and customers, no one was happy to be there, the scheduling was confusing, they held my first check for over a month without any reason. The HR lady wouldnt return my call herself, she'd have a cashier call me back with a message instead. 3 weeks there and still no locker assigned. My phone was stolen because of that fact and I couldn't keep my personal belongings close to me"
bad,Management is lazy and only there when they have to be and people who work harder are punished more than the slackers. Also they pick favorites and don't let anyone else move up. I got fired for taking time off for a family member dying. Steer clear of this place.
bad,"Trash. Managers with no experience in retail get hired and don't know what they are doing. They do not know how to schedual anybody. You get introuble if you get even 10 minutes of over time by accident. They expect you to show up every day, even when you are sick as a dog. They say they are a family friendly employer, but its not true."
bad,"You will never get full time hours. Reason: of you work full time, or have too many employees it eats into kellys huge bonus every year. Its a filthy, drama filled place to work. Management sucks all the way up to the owner. This is hells waiting room"
bad,stay away from walmart.........................................walmart bad........................walmart very bad. They work you like a dog and don't care about you as a person.
bad,"Terrible place to work "
bad,"Not the most complicated job, in fact one of the easiest to learn and utilize skill sets there are.  But the policies and management constantly changing often left lower ranking employees abused or taken advantage of.  They will illegally fire you and remove you from the system without notifying you if you have medical appointments."
bad,Coworkers did not help me get more hours like they were suppose to do and it cost me making about 150 every two weeks.That is not enought to live on at all.
bad,i come in and begin to unload the truck.  Managers being to talk down to me telling me i need to get a specific job done at a specific time.  They give a unreasonable time to get things done.  Workplace is stressful.  Managers decide to change associates schedules as they please without notice.  Managers take vacations every other week.  The hardest part of the job is just dealing with the short staff we have and the managers expected you for everything.  The most enjoyable part is going home.
bad,"the management was entirely disorganized, the organization was designed to stifle upward mobility, and there distinct anti-union scent stank of workers rights abuses"
bad,Management is favoritism to associate and trash to others  and dont care for there associate  health and work them to death they dont give flexible schedule no matter what
bad,Once you upset your management team your not safe. You bullied a lot by management. You always feel unable to finish because the bar is so high to reach.
bad,"You’ll end up doing other people’s jobs, deal with rude customers, and find yourself wishing you’d have never started. DON’T APPLY! There’s a reason they can’t keep people. Customers are more than 9 times out of 10 extremely rude."
bad,They basically don’t train you. You come in and are expected to know how to do your new job. It’s either sink or swim with Walmart. You are expected to take abuse from customers.
bad,"Milton location is horrible, the ghs order pickers are useless, they literally put one item in a tote, there is zero common sence, when you suggest ways to make it easier for the next person to do their job it fall on the deaf ears of managers. This place is like high school alover, there is a click of women who are best friends. So if you dont fit in they will force you out. I've only been here a month, and I want to quit. This place sucks as an employer. Doing the right thing around here doesnt work, except verbal abuse and if you do the right thing but writing a statement against your attacker you will be written up. Try to voice your opinions on how to make your job and others jobs easier and you would be wasting your time."
bad,I worked for a year and a half and it was way to much for me. It will either make or break you.  I found if management said nothing to you then you were fine.
bad,"Don't expect much on career advancement in this employment unless you are willing to relocate or wait until some steps down, which could take months or years."
bad,"Perpetually understaffed. Expects 30-40 hours worth of work to be done per shift unless your a favorite. Promotion based on brown nosing not performance or ability. The better you work the more peoples work you get to do. Management not only does not know company guidelines they regularly violate the ones they do know. Expect to hear ""you can't leave until you do X"" daily."
bad,After being hired I realized Walmart is not for employees they are all about their product and making sure they get their sales. Worst place to work ever
bad,"When interviewed at Wal-Mart it is quick. If you are called back it will be for a different position with that manager. If you are accepted you wont find out immediately because the manager is evasive. You will stand around waiting until someone aknowleges you. Typical day at Wal-mart is extremely stressful. You are yelled at. You are treated as a child unless you stand up to them. Management. Anyone can take the management assessment test. 70 questions takes an hour. You don't have to have skills or a personality. Hardest part of the job is being on your feet to long periods of time. Hard if you are not use to it. Lots of heavy lifting. Depending on the department you are in will depend on the weight. Expect over 55lbs. Enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people. Working for the actual company sucks. Wal-Mart is not for the faint of heart. You need to be of thick skin for the indurance of it. All benefits have been taken away except for 5 days of PTO that you have to icure over time. If you have 5 call in days expect to be fired on the 5th day. There is no credit for your work particularly if you work hard and have a work ethic. Wal-Mart wants you to work over but they will take it away on another day within the pay period so you are not in overtime. Like I said Wal-Mart is for Wa-Mart, not for it's people. They are only interested in making the money. This is why there are so many employees looking for another job that are so discouraged. In the breakroom or out of it, you don't hear anything positive."
bad,Management doesn’t care about their employees. Overworked and underpaid. Management won’t acknowledge any medical issues and push you to your limits. They discriminate and can be sexist as well as racist.
bad,I don’t recommend it for no one it’s not that reliable the pay it’s not enough for the job they provide none else to really say I just don’t think it’s a fair job
bad,"My reveiw are all one stars because of managment. I have been at two different walmarts and sams club days and on nights and all the managers had some sort of problem with me every where I went. They nitpicked me for every little thing but would let other associates slack off and mess around. I would do 3-4 times the work of anyone in the store and because i was able to move so fast it was expected of me to do that every night, and when i wanted a break or ""easy"" night off it would be a problem."
bad,"I started with this company and left within three days. I started as a CAP TEAM 2 Associate and it was the worst mistake I ever made. First official work day they threw me on the truck without any help or instructions. I was already nervous so no one helping me was even more nerve racking. I got through the day and I thought maybe the next one would be better. I was wrong. Next day I come in I was assigned to put freight out on the sales floor. Again, I was never shown how to stock, I was just told ""do this"" and that's it. No one cared about anything. I went to a manager and they could not care less. Stay away from this company, or at the very least stay away from Cap Team 1 & 2."
bad,The worst company to work for. Management sucks with discrimination. No work/life balance. Job culture is horrible. The worst company. no job security.
bad,"My mom died and I went on a LOA out of town to settle her estate. While I was gone, I was reported as not showing up for my shifts and they ""filed my voluntary resignation."" The manager rejected the extension that I requested for my LOA and didn't tell me, so when I was placed back on the schedule and wasn't aware because I was out of town, it was flagged in the system as not showing up. Totally wring and unethical treatment when I was going through a terrible time in my life!"
bad,"Or who you blow! They are clicked up if you don't look act or dress like them you are screwed.they have thier favs,and if they are trying to get rid of you they will go to what ever extreem."
bad,Management sucks and u can only call in 4 times before getting fired. They don't care about their workers. The only good thing is the people but that could just be the store I was at.
bad,"Everything about working for this company is horrible, from store managers to corporate. If you have family life outside of walmart  good luck. The benefits package getting worse every year"
bad,Spent Alot of time with promises of promotion and other opportunities but they never came. Was not a pleasant experience other team mates made work a little easier
bad,"If you are working to get out of the house work at Walmart. What I mean is, if you work to pay rent, eat, or live Never waste time with this place. You'll end up starved ,homeless and sick. It's a nasty place to be."
bad,"At the Walmart ,you busted your butt only to be reprimanded. While other employees slack off and did nothing. Then get fired only because the manager decides that you have been there long enough. They come up with some oddball reason to fire you.in the 2yrs I worked there had to be at least 20 firings. I have never seen that many people get from any where else I worked."
bad,Absent micro-managers. Poor performers are not held accountable. Priority jobs are directed to more capable persons. Hours are cut to to save on budget.
bad,Managed workplace injury and illness claims.  Mitigated claim costs and facilitated safe and early return to work.  Good work culture and management.  Work load could be heavy at times.   Good place to work.
bad,Walmart treats tge employees lime trash. We are over worked ane underappreciated. Management does not care for you and will work you so they do not have to do any work themselves.
bad,"horrible management. No coverage. Job title was for 1 department, but were required to 100% cover and run 10 departments completely by yourself. Management didnt care about any of your concerns. they act like your easily replaceable & that you didnt matter to the company, they were also rude & hateful."
bad,did not care about their employees what so ever! everyone was rude and talked to the cashiers like they were nothing! never scheduled enough cashiers for a schedule a day! will never work for them again
bad,I truly hated working at this place. Walmart treats its employees way worse than you would even expect. The only people that are happy there are the ones that literally dont know any better
bad,over the past few years the company has been going down as far as caring about the associates to management your just a number and can be easily replaced if they say jump you don't say how high there is a problem they managed with fear and i refused to manage my people that way you don't have to treat people like dogs to make them work better just be a good manager and at least act like you care about them you would be surprised how much that helps just morale alone
bad,Honestly it’s a job they say they’re flexible but if you don’t have unlimited availability you won’t get hours. Even if you do have unlimited availability you aren’t guaranteed more than 30 hours with the new schedule system. They pay $11/hr but you are given more assignments than you are able to accomplish properly. Breaks are few and hard to come by. You are cross trained for half of the store and then left to rot. If you don’t finish your massive pile of assignments you are coached whether it was a possible challenge or not. If I could give it less than one star I would.
bad,I didnt like working here they was not understanding if you was sick they didnt care you still here to come to work at all times . If you call olut they will take a point awat from you.
bad,"Clock in, receive my box a box cutter and assigned to job task. overnight stocking and also a cashier. Taking trash to back of the store. working as a team to accomplish the task"
bad,I tried to make the best of the opportunity to work at Walmart but the culture was awful. Employees had low moral and it felt exhausting at times. One positive was that my coworkers were nice and I had the opportunity to learn how to manage stress in a positive way.
bad,get to meet other people make new freinds watching families smile&enjoy their time togather the hardest part is when they don't have enough money topay
bad,"Worked at Walmart for several years. Worked in the maintenance department. Management was ineffective and created a stressful environment. No one smiles there, very few people are happy and enjoy their work. The salary and benefits are very limited and there was no growth or advancement."
bad,i personally did not have a good experience working here. i have nothing good to say. not a single employee was treated fairly. they have twisted morals.
bad,"Management sucks, very stressful not worth the time pay is too little for the slave labor. I had to quit I could not make my 3 months because of the horrible management and all of the issues. Walmart is completely a who*ehouse and only way for advancement is to sleep with the store manager or higher managers. My mama raised a lady not a who*e so obviously I had to quit or get fired because I wouldn't drop my drawers."
bad,sat you in front of a computer for 3 or 4 work days of mind numbing videos. then stick you at your station and you find out like 12 percent of what you watched was for you.
bad,"They expect you to do your job in a very small amount of time so you can do extra things that aren't your department, and have bosses that aren't trained to do the job they're telling you how to do."
bad,Walmart has a lack of communication with their employees that can have negative repercussions. I learned to advocate for myself and learned that some companies don't care about their employees
bad,They show alot of favoritism.. its ok company to work for.. if u not a snitch than they dont care nothing about you.  You get looked over for positions.... so its all favoritism....
bad,I am not  able to give Walmart more than one star.  Seems as the corporate culture is more about money than people.  The job at Walmart was also a toxic environment.
bad,I used to get 40hrs a week but since the new policy of Walmart took into effect witch is the core package it greatly affects our schedule and mainly forces people with fixed schedules to change their availability to full time and open availability.
bad,Managers very inexperienced and do not know how to communicate. Lots of favoritism. You will be lied to. Lack of communication between managers. Too many chiefs and not enough Indians.....
bad,Don’t go. Pay unfair and so is the people. Managers are mean and unfair. The point system is overly powered and ridiculous. Not worth the hassle for the pay they give you.
bad,"I tired to explain my situation to the managers, rather than listening, they just yelled at me. The job was stressful and i dreaded it and the customers would also say the place was a mess. I’m glad i’m not working there anymore."
bad,"If You have children and need a steady schedule this is not the place for you  . They will switch your days every week so you’re never off the same days in a row and your hours are all over the place. You’ll have like 1 morning shift 2 evening shifts and 2 closing shifts. It all depends on who’s doing the schedule. You get points for coming in late , calling out etc.. so after 5 points your fired! They don’t care if you did everything they asked of you , they will replace you."
bad,Just terrible I’ve never worked somewhere where they don’t like women to move up in the company i applied for 5 positions and no response from anyone of them
bad,Worked here on and off for about 9 years and have experienced bullying by management and little room to move up in the company. With being a stocker you have to be fast paced and there is a lot of pressure on you at all times. I personally would not recommend working there ad there has been too many changes to policies like the absence policy and they are not flexible about sick time.
bad,Steer clear from this heaping cesspool of a corporation. They don't believe in treating workers like they have any rights or need to exercise their rights
bad,"Management was horrible"
bad,no help. more work that one poeple can do in one day with help. no enqament . will not work will friamly. if you do not get all the work done you have to do it all the next day
bad,"Horrible place to work. You will regret working at walmart everyday of your life. The single biggest problem with it is the management. They are all horrible at what they do and will not give you the time of day. They do not care about your problems nor do they want to see you succeed. They always say they do but do nothing about it. The play favoritism with those they get along with and if your not in that group, your outta luck. If you need time off they will only let you get away with it if you have the time to cover it. You can work yourself to the bone for this place and they will not give a care about it. Your better off working for their competition."
bad,I would absolutely recommend working anywhere else in the world other than Walmart they are greedy terrible people who treat their employees like poo always understaffed and always overworking their employees they expect so much yet give you so little
bad,"It's long and stressful, I learned just how horrible the customers in the area are, management? I never saw the manager the whole time I worked there. The hardest part of the job? That would be implying that there was an easy part."
bad,Don't feel appreciated you will feel like a slave and overworked you will barely get a bonus anymore  attendance policy sucks and they say you start at 11.00 but when you get here its 10.00 no teamwork  not enough help
bad,"I have been with Walmart for 17 years. I have held the following positions. Cashier, CSM, Department Manager, Support Manager and cash office. In the last 17 years the company has had a steady decline. I barely make more than a new hire walking in the door. They took away our set schedules, they did away with the bonus system. They eliminated so many positions it is horrible. They have NO consideration for single parents that need to have hours where they can be home with their children. It doesnt matter how long you have worked there. It is honestly not a good place to work. The management is corrupt."
bad,"Management is a joke and they love to micromanage! Nothing but stress so if you love backstabbing coworkers, worthless management, and angry customers along with tons of stress than this is the job for you!!"
bad,"Walmart is really hard to work for, and stressful. I was terminated, for missing my limit of days but I was sick and had doctors notes, and still got fired."
bad,"Walmart removes your idenity as human once you enter the door, you are then a robot and expected to perform as a robot. No exceptions for any problem, no exceptions if you didnt complete 6 hours of work in 2. You will be punished for calling out for any reason , and likely fired for needing to be on leave, or pregnant, or for any kind of disability that you need a specific schedule for. They often promote you verbally and make you work a more demanding job, without making it peramant and no pay raise, and right before you work the 90 days that they would have to hire you youre demoted, they do the same thing for part time employees giving you 40 hours for weeks until you reach 90 days they cut your hours down drastically, often times during the paycheck most people pay rent with."
bad,I got fired because I got injured and they couldn't wait or me to get healed because they didn't want to work with my restrictions'. So do do not every work there
bad,"very stressful place to work for, customer are very nasty ,management is always on there site always because the customer is always right , you can not go over the customer even if they treat you bad."
bad,I wouldn’t recommend anyone to Walmart because they don’t value their employees and they never follow policy until it’s convenient for them. They show favoritism and always throwing rocks and hiding their hands.
bad,"Worst job ever as a Deli associate had no training,coworkers rude treated poorly,racist,unprofessional,had to load heavy raw chicken in rotisserie every hr burned arm everyday,then slice meat an cheese on slicer for customers,fry food using the same oil each day,keep hot bar stocked and clean,make salads an sandwich,fulfill pre orders,get meat from freezer,clean an drain fryer oven,clean an empty hot bar,recycle food in containers then freeze,wash dishes,take out trash,clean floors,slicers,rotisserie oven while coworkers joke with customers."
bad,"Don't work here unless you love to work with miserable, unhappy people. Are you miserable? Are you unhappy? Then, by all means, let me not stop you from getting 9 bucks an hour."
bad,"You were only allowef 5 days a year for absences and They will let you go if you go over. So don't get sick!"
bad,There are “clicks” of management that do not care for your well being. The pay isn’t enough for the amount of stress you will go through during the day.
bad,Walmart was not the place for me. There was no understanding of family or work life balance. Management was ok but the attendance policy left little room for sickness.
bad,"There was always to many ""want to be"" managers. And they always put to much work on one person and expected them to stay past hours(without pay). They dont care how sick someone is, they expect them to work or get wrote up."
bad,"Typical Production,stocking and general Cleaning. Management skills, and Leadership. Management was Very Poor. Workplace culture was okay. Being low on the totom pole working in Produce, had to do various other jobs. Getting off work."
bad,Very discriminatory. Do not offer employees proper training nor assistance to job related issues. Management was very poorly engaged with their staff unless they singled you out for retaliation.
bad,"The management of Walmart is very aggressive to the point of being abusive. I have never, in all the 35+ years I have been working in retail, been treated so poorly."
bad,Poor management and a lot of favoritism at the work place where the manager at the time was firing everybody for little foolishness. I'm glad that she no longer work there anymore herself.
bad,"My managers acted like I was fodder and the people I helped were entitled. If you didn’t drop the 100lb item you were carrying to help them, then you were getting written up for not helping a customer"
bad,"Easy work all you do is stock and unload trucks and it’s alright pay for making it in life"
bad,Management had favorites. No advancement opportunities. Low pay. Only allowed 3 call ins per 6 months. Underpays. Employees are old and incapable of working.
bad,Poor Management and no assistance when being harassed by other employees. HR did not stand by me in my place of employment where I make my livelihood.
bad,Worked there for less than a month. Went through 3 managers and all of them were horrible. They dont care about their employees one bit. Got fired with my friend same day because they thought we were stealing. We worked in the deli what is there to steal.
bad,The management sucks they treat their employees like slaves. They dont care for hard work they only care for the brown nosers. No moral hostel  work environment
bad,Terrible management and no leeway on balancing life and work. Management would harass and threaten associates if they didn’t comply and had no understanding of company policy
bad,"You get no holidays with family, they expect to much for as much as they work you and make you work shifts you didn’t hire in. If you work 4 days 10hrs tues-fri your overtime will be sat and Sunday night 6pm-4am and if u do get a day shift on weekends it’s 12 hr shifts."
bad,The job tasks of Walmart’s one best way changes weekly so it makes keeping a solid order of work impractical. You get blamed if people don’t want to buy products.
bad,"I was a manager at Walmart for 4 years and this may have been the worst place I have ever worked. Management seemed to not care about much, a lot of confusion, not enough people were ever at work to make the store run smoothly."
bad,There attendance policy was the most ridiculous thing. They reduced dien from 11 points to 5 points for calling out. They time ti on stocking carts to shelves. If you move to slow they coach you akd they terminate you st any time without clause.
bad,"Poor management. No team work. lack of work. Management Do not care About employees. "
bad,Management and longer term employees were bullies and verbally abusive. Had to self train because NO ONE would help you out. Extremely short staffed and gave unrealistic / impossible tasks to complete.
bad,graduate and get better money. this is a great part time opportunity but not a living wage. management was horrible and non proffessional. customers always make you ask yourself why do i work here.
bad,Walmart knows its employees are expendable and they are cranking up numbers until the only people left are those that have no choice. They are trying to squeeze out anyone who makes incentive to fill the place with people who can't hit incentive.
bad,"A lot of drugs being used there, dangerous work conditions!"
bad,"I was often called off of lunch to fill in on sales floor or register, then was never allowed to finish my lunch but hey would adjust my hours to reflect my full lunch period. I was never fairly compensated for that."
bad,"I found after 6.5 years that I was not treated fairly in wages, which is laughable, after 6.5 yrs, I still was at minimum wage, with no advancement's, opportunities, They speak of it but just empty words, I was hired under the ""HIRE A VETERAN PROGRAM"" which Walmart collected money from government for doing so but within my 6.5 years there my evaluations was always above excellence but never was able to advance, even after all the overtime coming in early staying late. my dedication was all in vain, I find myself never being able to speak positive about this Corporation who put there profits above Dedication, Reliability, and Honesty. I must say I regret working there 4.5 years to long. can't give a enjoyable time, maybe when I punch out to go home. hardest part of job being treated like you don't matter, not appreciate, always being told you are replaceable. workplace culture? favoritism, won't go into a typical day at work it is way to depressing."
bad,"Worked for Wal Mart for 12 years.  just got tired of the constant new hire managers whom didnt have a clue and the unobtainable goals they had.  They bumped up the starting pay which was nice, but they cut the annual raises to the point they are laughable.  Wasnt worth the effort to be an outstanding associate."
bad,"met interesting people, worked with a lot of lazy people and 1 or 2 good ones. Employee's always on their phones and nothing is done about it, they also shopped on the clock and nothing was ever done. A lot of favoritism by supervisors."
bad,"Working at Walmart was the poorest selection that I've made in my whole life. If you get a job as a cashier it's better to opt out yourself because the managers after a certain time would start loading you with their work too. Very poor management, no pay raises at all. The higher officials would not listen to your requests if you have any problems they would assume you are always lying."
bad,There is no work life balance for salary management. The management cant stay on the same page the lack of communication.  The steps you take to complete anything takes you twice as long as it could if the steps were simple. They dont care about their associates it's all about how much money they can get with as little workforce as possible.
bad,"Job sucks... that’s it, cares nothing for employees. Poor management. All about who you know. Worry about who like who or what the next person has, no opportunity for growth unless you kiss butt."
bad,Management sucks they expect employees to do their job.Assitant managers are the same way.They give people full time that don't deserve it.There was nothing enjoyable about the job.All around one of the worst companies to work for.
bad,"Managers are rude, unprofessional and unable to provide leadership to any level worker. Constantly threatens workers and will coach workers out of a hob for absolutely no legitimate reason. Nepotism is allowed and top level managers have been witnessed taking gifts from vendors for sale space on the floor.. I can name names!"
bad,Managment didnt care about your health. They were very unfair I would not reccomend this job. They would team up on you. You felt attacked . The accociates were very caring and sweet i felt as if I was apart of a family.
bad,"Extreme favoritism. I witnessed employee's with several years of employment let go and replaced by upper management family members at full time and increased wages. If you took time off for any reason, you were punished by reduction in weekly hours to the extreme of one day per week or maybe no hours for a week. Then you received later shifts you had never received before."
bad,A typical day at work is coming in and finding out what you need to do And do what I need to. I learned that u can learn a lot from other people and there attitudes. Management is alright.. Workplace culture is a lot of different things. Hardest part is dealing with people attitude and how they take forever to come back from break.. Most enjoyable part of my job is making  friends and learning from them..
bad,Horrible management. Half the managers dont know there left from there right hand. They dont care who works for them. Your just a number to them. Hours very by how much they like you.
bad,"I was never given satisfactory instruction and i was given few hours anyway. The hours were very few, there is no way i could have lived by myself if wal mart was my only job. I was also the only dummy to stick it out, everyone i worked with eventually left."
bad,Terrible management but that is normal for big box company whose only interest is their bottom line. Never good enough especially when you get injured. Atmosphere of do better no matter giving excellent work effort. Awful treatment and disregard by top management who don’t care about you. Coworkers are always miserable and overworked. No set schedule and only part time hours. Awful organization to work for.
bad,"Wal-Mart claims to be a family-oriented business, but clearly is not. The company has put me and my family in financial strain. Poor communication and management skills. Unprofessional all together."
bad,"I do not recommend this place, they do not have a set Pace on your hours.they will make you work horrible schedules. The hours I worked sometimes at 1 a.m. and then the next day have to be in at 8 a.m.. they do not care about the individual they are very pushy and do not hardly allow any sick days."
bad,Treat employees bad. They don’t  work with you on your schedule. It’s all about the company not the associate. I also loss money due to position being cut
bad,Ive Beem At Walmart for almost a year and its not a good place to work. At least at this location im at. Neighborhood market vero beach FL. The management sucks and their racist.
bad,"There are many in the store that deserve advancement and are always overlooked. People with disabilities are not fairly treated, the feeling that you should come to work even when your disability acts up. Many managers have favorite employees and push them through to the jobs others have the education and ability to do more so than the one obtaining the job. They have also taken away the bonus for those who work hard every day. They base them now on each persons attendance."
bad,"Terrible. the Management of the Mauamelle Walmart Automotive Center was incompetent and most days not there at all. Technicians largely had to fend for themselves with little to no involvement from management, including the replacement of tools, the purchasing of needed supplies such as wheel weights, tire patches, glue, and more. As much as i appreciated the opportunity provided to me by the company and all the experience I gained while there, the complete lack of management was too much for me to remain with the company."
bad,"During a regular day at Walmart, you can expect to be reminded of how low you are on the totem pole, and no matter how hard you work, nothing you do is good enough. You are expendable. Hard workers are rewarded with more work, and Lord have mercy on the poor soul who can't get someone else's job done by clock out time. "
bad,I signed up for full time and without my consent they switched me to part time and they almost fired me for printing too many labels the customers are absolute morons that complain about anything and at least once a week the bathroom is smeared with fecal matter it is the most ridiculous places I've ever worked in.
bad,"Employees who worked outside were not treated well at all by management inside, for the most part, the only exception being the gardening department since they were half inside half out."
bad,"Managers say they will work with you, just depends on who you are. No training to speak of. Got one hour to shadow on the register. I don't know what is the hardest part of the job, it's all hard, dealing with customers, management, and fellow employees. I learned that I don't want to work at Walmart again."
bad,Management treats workers like pawns unless workers are in management's inner circle. Management has bizarre expectations such as stockers must put a case of freight on the shelves per minute and this includes time for helping customers.
bad,"Well to be perfectly honest, in my humble opinion of course, without offending anyone who thinks differently from my point of view, but also by looking into this matter in a different perspective and without being condemning of ones views and by trying to bring objective, and by considering each and every ones valid opinion, I honestly believe that walmart is great"
bad,"instead of managers having a open door meeting they corner you and yell at you, deny letting you have water till you are sweating, deny letting you go to the bathroom, never go to breaks or lunch on time, and also get yelled at for helping customers because they don't care."
bad,Very prejudiced when you get a Mexican manager . Took my job away without letting me know . But told the person who was taking over. So made me a no show.
bad,One hand not knowing what the other is doing they are cutting out good management .saying our people are what makes the difference an in rhe next breath say coach them for performance after now giving the right number of people or tools to do the task assigned
bad,Walmart managers don’t appreciate nothing but yet want you to do all there work within your shift. Never say a thank you and don’t want to deal with customers
bad,"This place is so toxic I can't even begin to explain it. They say they care about their employees but they don't, management is some of the worst I've ever seen. Not professional whatsoever,  a lot of the management have attitude problems and are snobby with the lower employees. Working for Walmart put such a drain on my mental and emotional health to the point where I'm on meds now. The one thing I do miss is the pay but no amount of pay is worth it."
bad,"got yelled at in front of customers and coworkers when i asked to leave early when my grandmother was in the hospital dying. Thank God i left anyways or i would have never said goodbye to my grandmother."
bad,"I did not like working here because the mangement was very bad, and did not have any communication with the people who were on shift. THe company expects overtime but will not allow you to keep it , they cut your hours and take days away if you work a longer shift one day."
bad,This was the worst job i ever had and i cleaned toilets before. i got to stock shelves in the dairy department. inventory of the stock rearrange the cooler stock milk and clean gross area with rotten milk
bad,I was with the company for almost 7 months and I called out one time and I was fired for inability to perform job duties. I was on the sales floor working pretty vigorously and called to the office and terminated. Truth be told Walmart has the worst management  EVER. Absolutely no communication between mangers. Constantly got yelled at for doing things another manger had told me to do. Horrible place to work and you get treated horribly
bad,The job is stressful.  You tend to have to cover alot of the store due to the fact they are almost always short staffed. And you have to work just about every holiday except for Christmas.
bad,"Walmart is a food place to work if your going to school, they are somewhat flexible with their hours when certain days are needed off. But for the most part the store is understaffed which puts a lot of pressure on management which they let out on their employees."
bad,"Great management, awesome co-workers. I would stock shelves with product and if I was unsure of where stock was placed my co-workers or management would always be there to help. Great pay rises."
bad,"Was once a company that was all about the customer and it’s employees, now it’s ONLY about making the company richer!"
bad,They don’t care about your personal life and they don’t make sure take you take break or lunch break. Plus you call in sick or have family’s personal problems they don’t care about that. They want you to work and work and work. Evening if you injured they still want you to come to work.
bad,Easy job unprofessional assoiciate lack effort in doing work Management conspire against if they feel u are to opinonated lie and manipulate you to get u out of your position
bad,"If you are 1 minute late you are written up. Don't believe what the policies are they change daily according to the management. Osha requires 2 20 minute breaks an a 30 minute lunch, if you leave at 6.01 hours and don't take a lunch you are written up. If they are shutting down early the take away your last break. If they want to change Something they do you are expected to comply regardless of your opinions or suggestions.With the new pay policy someone who has worked there for 14 years as myself now makes less than a person who has been there for 3 years. But at least my bills get paid.The health insurance they off is pretty much useless there is such a high deductible unless you are hospitalized you pay full price for everything on top of your monthly insurance deduction."
bad,I would never recommend for anyone to work at Walmart the managers are inconsiderate they entertain favoritism there and they have really bad attitudes
bad,The upper management sucked.  They would tell you one thing than do an other.  They would lie right to you face with no problems.  Could not trust anything they said.  Everyone else was great though.
bad,"Misunderstanding of employees and needs."
bad,Management treated employees like second class citizens.  Many were rude and debasing.  It was a unpleasant environment most days and it was a great day when I left for a different job.
bad,"atuei como aprendiz de assistente administrativo, além disso exercia tarefas em frente de caixa, e outros setores da loja."
bad,People here are awful. The manager team are for only themselves and the employees are treated like dirt. I would never reccomend tonwork at a Walmart ever.
bad,My direct supervisor was a good man.i was bullies and made an example of on a weekly basis. I was told to do things that was fiscally impossible and I was looks down on by management due to my size and no matter what I did it wasent good enough.most of my time there was not plaesent at all.
bad,The individuals that are not working at store/club level have no clue as to how the associates are really treated. In addition the individual that decided to change the policy to reflect hourly associates PTO obviously never worked in the field. Why would you tell associates the new PTO is basically like sick time. If you call out and have enough time you could use those hours to remove the absence you recieved. But if it takes 6 months to receive 8 hours!!! Your associates have already lost. Turn over was high before now it will be really high. If you call out on a Friday Sat or Sunday its 2 points Holiday its 3. But let me ask you this..... why are we the only ones working Holidays while Corporate enjoys their thanksgiving Dinner?? No holiday pay. But if you call out its 3 points REALLY Walmart. Why to show how you care about your associates. Remember it takes 6 months for 8 hours. And everyone began with a 0 - ZERO balance.
bad,loss prevention dept of this this company hires stupid mystery shopper everywhere and they are abusive people work is not hard customer are okay the work is fine the employees esp hr are very very nice
bad,They are nasty  they put it old food that’s been defrosted over 8 hours and instead of claiming out the items they stocked them per word of store management
bad,"The management team is horrible,the most unfriendly people i have ever met. Every department i went to all the mangers were the same.they only care about them selves and their bonus,they talk to you any kind of way young or old and they think the world revolves around them,they don’t care if you have school,problems  with your kids NOTHING"
bad,this company is a billion dollar company and they dont want to pay their employees but want you to work long hours this was a while back but i think they pay fair but flexible schedules
bad,If you want to work where no one cares about you or anyone else and management screams in your face like a drill sergeant and customers yell and scream and throw food and drink on your merchandise and tour blamed for things that happened on your days off then its for you. Otherwise I wouldn't dare. I am completely stressed out 100 percent of the time and my health is paying for it.
bad,Worked there for for 3 Years ..  Walmart gets rid of employees based off not hitting quotas.. they don’t add the time that it takes to deliver a product to the trailers.. 3000 boxes to throw on the line sounds a bit rediculous eh.. let them explain it to ya!! Become a numb number.. after 5 years you get 3 weeks vacation tho!!!
bad,"Poor management. Poor working conditions. Everyone extremely annoyed by customers. No one really cares. Just there for the paycheck, I felt. HIGH TURNOVER!"
bad,If you get a job at Walmart never stop looking for a new job because you will definitely want and need it quickly especially when they start cutting your hours .run don't walk!
bad,"You will be expected to do the job of 4 people. And some people do nothing. If you are a hard worker,they throw tons of stuff on you to do! It was one of the worst places I've ever worked. It was high school all over again!"
bad,It felt like I was back in high school and no one wanted to take accountability for anything including managers. They allow machines to make all decisions for them and no one wanted to do their jobs in an efficient way. I saw why there was such a high turn over rate.
bad,"Place is just that Bad i would not come back ever again its  just a big joke there just to much stress with this job ."
bad,"Walmart seems to have great policies to help employees feel secure in the workplace, however they are not always enforced unless you complain to HR. Management tend to power trip and even give corrective actions in front of customers! Not very professional."
bad,The management at Walmart is the most oppressive thing in the workplace. Your coworkers are great but the higher ups do not care about their employees.
bad,"They don’t care about the employees at all, and will fire at random if they don’t like you. There is a lot of favoritism and wrong doing at store 720."
bad,"Wal-Mart only hired me for.seasonal, and they let me go around the month of November. I wasn't aware that I was a seasonal employee, I was told that I would be part time. I was also told that I am rehireble, I was told to call back to be hired again and every time I called to speak to the manager, she would never come to the phone. I was treating unfairly."
bad,Walmart is a bad company to work for. Managers do not respect there workers and expect them to do team lifts by themselves without help.  Customers are rude to employees and the employees cannot say anything bad about customers.
bad,Terrible place to work at hours sucked some of management not nice to many chiefs not enough Indians. they would pull off  of what you were doing and have you do something else..
bad,"Within the 1 year i worked for Wally World they’ve cut my hours, tried to force me to become part time or risk being fired. I was told i had to switch departments or find a new job. They fired me 3 times, and asked me to come back every time! I wasn’t allowed to come to work for an entire month bc they had me in the system wrong. Weekends off are rare for younger workers, older workes get weekends off. If you call cooperate or complain they retaliate. DOG EATS DOG CULTURE! Managers are NOT helpful, just DOGMATIC and STRESSED OUT! Cooperate is full of it and themselves. There is no holiday pay, they just take your PTO. The worst part are the customers."
bad,Wouldn’t recommend to my worst enemy. Terrible management. Only 2% raise every year. Lack of recognition. Little to no career advancement opportunities.
bad,"Major changes, double the work little to no pay difference. Poor leadership, long term full time associates have been forced to part time and to different positions."
bad,"Yeah, you know, maybe if Walmart wasn't so busy bullying their suppliers and employees equally, they'd have time to stick their sleazeball womanizer management into personality improvement programs instead of letting them retaliate against workers by dress coding them when they just don't want to drive 4 hours to work at an understaffed Walmart across the state. Interesting concept, I know."
bad,"poorly managed, high discriminatory acts, and unreasonable scheduling. Managers are unreliable and store manger isn’t present enough. Managers get bonuses and vacation, new or seasoned associates are put on the back burner."
bad,"Was hired for one department got put in another. Had to clean rat feces from under the registers. Was basically a lackey for other departments. Look, I never got paid enough to go through that ."
bad,A typical day at work is being short people & having to do more work not diving the work between the people that are there. Being overwhelmed trying to do 3 -4 things at once & not getting any help just being told to do better.
bad,It is always the blame game. Very aggressive managers. Quick to judge. Never enough hours.  They suck the happy out of you.  No team spirit.  A lot of favoritism towards what seems to be the rudest person as if that is how they want you to be.
bad,Horrible place to work management uses and abuses you I even got stocked by a manager stocked my drive videotaped it all to get me in trouble and he still has his job I was forced to quit under duress Walmart as a company did the bare minimum in accordance to the OSHA and send you on your way I won’t even shop there anymore it’s disgusting a place that size treat people this poorly after years of service
bad,"Worked with this company on and off for over 8 years and have unfortunately experienced unprofessional associates both managements and coworkers, alike."
bad,Took me off the schedule in December then said they fired me in Feb for excessive absents. I don't see how thats possible since that's my first time to work for the company
bad,Working at Walmart was like your first job where you work there to get a starting paycheck till you move onto something better in the future. It was a job.
bad,Between the inconsistent management and co-workers who were to busy standing around talking trash about others it used to be a good place to work.  The management teams that now run these stores are to busy ignoring issues and playing their own games to see that people who work hard and are trying to keep their heads about them are going to lose it.  The pay is not enough to support a single person much less people who have families.  Home office is more concerned on how to get rid of associates then how to keep them and the customer happy.
bad,Supervisors not on the same page.  Discrimination of overweight people.  Negative talk of employees to other employees not in management position.  Store manager did not do anything.  Retaliation was allowed.  Reported to Ethics and nothing was done.
bad,I had frequent mental breakdowns working here. They do not value you or say thank you. They are ALWAYS short. They don't repec availability. this place is awful.
bad,There was only one manager I can say did his job right. Other than that the managers at Walmart did not care. The job would of been great had the managers actually cared about their people.
bad,If you don't open your availability they'll cut your hours to part time even if your full time and signed a contract saying you're now a full time after 3 months.
bad,"Equipe de gestores , na qual não interagem com os associados, operações em desacordo com as normas clt, não fornecem epi, escalas de trabalho mudam constantemente, e o salario ao final do mes nunca vem o mesmo."
bad,It was a place of employment where I was used and abused. I was offered the job to work in the produce department and was trained in 7 others and most days I was a one man show attempting to satisfy customers in multiple departments.
bad,"If we get shoplifters,  that ruins our bonuses,  they make us responsible for shoplifters,  my lowering our bonuses, also they threaten to write us up if we dont get a 2 mans job done, they dont have enough help for overnights,  managers talk about employees with other associates, and they have their favorites"
bad,"worst place to work , no life only certain people could get a weekend off, certain people walk around with headphones on and managers do nothing except work the ones who do work work harder, nothing is good enough, managers think because they are mangers they dont have to lift a finger, i was threatened and degraded by a manger.under their health care you can only use their pharmacy, they want you to get your pay on a Walmart debit card to use in their store...its control control control"
bad,Walmart was the worse job I’ve ever had but I made the best of it the management team is very unorganized and shows favoritism to certain employees not a job u can move up in
bad,"It was the worst 2 years of my life. Nobody wants to work, always understaffed, buried in fright, walk 18 miles/shift, management has unrealistic expectations."
bad,"To begin, I worked for Walmart for 2 years and made the same amount of money as those that had just came into the job within the last 2 months I was there. I voiced my concerns to management, but they didnt care and told me there was nothing that they could do about that. Follow that up with management playing favorites and promoting those that they want to promote, and it was just an unhealthy, stress filled environment. Don't get me wrong, my direct supervisors were great. Then they hired a new second supervisor after that one stepped down. He had no idea what he was doing and when trying to help him he would get me coached which eventually led me leave the company. I would have loved to stay honestly, as I hate moving jobs, and I try to excel at anything that I do. Despite this, it wasnt enough for Walmart to want to try and retain me. I'll miss some of the coworkers that I had, and thats probably the only good thing I have left to say about the experience."
bad,Walmart used to be an awesome place to work but once the original owner passed on it turned into the most horrible workplace with horrible managers!!!
bad,It lots of bad management and coworkers they are lazy too.fact they schedule us full time but you part time and they dont care about us.are they care about themselves.
bad,"There is so much wrong with working here and it starts with the management. The customers are given to much even if it goes against the policy the managers 'enforced'. Also, when customers are being verbally and sometimes physically abusive, there is nowhere that any associate can turn to. Managers rarely respond when asked for. One positive is that all associates know what you are going through and will try their best to help the situation."
bad,"It's business first, employee second , they claim they care about you but inaccutality they don't , say there's ot but then they schedule you off to cancel out the ot ,and it's not about family anymore"
bad,"Didn't work for Walmart but would be happy to comment on a typical day at work, what I learned, company culture, and management, but since I was a a 3rd party vendor I have no direct knowledge of what a real employee might experience."
bad,"I would bake pastries and savory food in the morning. I learned how to manage my time and work with customers. Management was not always supportive, therefore I resorted to an employee support group. Workplace and culture was not the best. The hardest part of the job was working with my manager. The most enjoyable part of the job was decorating cakes."
bad,Typical big company only concerned with profit and not employees. Treat you like you are lower class citizens. They only want bodies there allowing most employees to do the work of the loafers.
bad,You must like retail to work for this company.  It's very competitive and is a dead end job for most of its workers.  Management loves to point out your flaws and mistakes but only tells you to work faster.  There is low morale among workers since they rarely feel appreciated.
bad,"The management is all crooked, choose favorites among breaking many laws. Absolute WORST company you could ever work for. Have managers wiping occurrences for employees so their favorites can get promoted and ignoring MULTIPLE meal violations while a manager fixes this employees time punched. That entire company is a waste of space and as crooked as they come. Mom of the management know what they are doing. From top to bottom"
bad,If you are going to work at Walmart do not work in the deli. If you do you will never get out of it. Deli managers will get you for every little thing and upper management will not listen to hear about unethical behavior. They don't care.
bad,"Poor management, stressful, over worked and underpaid, poor scheduling, always short handed, never enough help, always cutting hours and cutting positions completely"
bad,"I would never recommend this place. I worked there for almost 5 years, worked every position in the store, never received the pay increase for any of them and the management certainly took advantage of the fact that I had to work to take care of my children (who seemed to be an inconvenience to them) and couldn't just up and leave."
bad,Wal mart might be a big company but their practices are a joke numerous time i have been threatened to be fired or loose my job numerous times i have specified what days im available numerous times i have abided by their quote unquote open door policy and asked for assistance with issues with other employees and been told it will be sorted out and it hasnt dont think management goes by the book or is equal cause they are not if you have alot of appointments they will threaten to fire you they are not what they make out working for walmart to be
bad,They treat their employees with no respect and they will hire anyone as managers. There is always chaos. A workplace needs to be organized be able to be a  team and Walmart is neither of those.
bad,It's not walmart that bad it the not the sharpest tools in shed management. It's not a good company 2work for because of the bad management. If u need a job until you can better your condition.
bad,If I can ever work again I would never go back to Walmart again the management it's bad for just a number to them they don't care about their employee
bad,"In the beginning the experience working for the company was ok. Things begin to change overtime when new management is involved and different rules apply. I dealt with a lot of discrimination at my particular location. So I can’t say that i wouldn’t recommend anyone to the company, they offer great benefits and retirement."
bad,Not a very easy company to work for the job is very demanding it does not accommodate or value employee seniority nor compensate them based on evaluation people’s who are hired with 0 experience earn more then employees who are already working there and are training the new employees. Walmart does not care about they’re employees that is why they have a huge turn around rate. The jobs would be okay if managed appropriately.
bad,"I worked at Walmart briefly fresh out of high school. Training was really unorganized. My manager just flat out stopped showing up to work. The Whitehall location was and still is understaffed. They have like what over 30 registers and not even half of them had cashiers at them. Majority of the cashiers didn't want to be on the floor so they would hang out around the store and in the back area. I was told by an upper manager to put my two weeks notice in the mailbox by the office and I explained to her that I got a better job offer... So I put the notice in the box after I talked with her. Two weeks past and I started a new job. Then about ONE MONTH LATER I received a call from another upper manager asking why I haven't shown up to work. I explained that I talked to several people including a manager about me leaving and putting in my two weeks. He said that he was NEVER told any of this. Needless to say, Walmart managers are very bad at communicating and keeping their staff in order."
bad,"I worked there 5 years and Wal-Mart was a nightmare, inconsistent.  Did not care about the associates. Managers had no idea what the others were doing so you were running in circles"
bad,They want you to get so much done with only one or two people to work with and they want you to do it alone if its just you its horrible but it was a job.
bad,"They hire from the “bottom of the barrel”. Anyone worth keeping either leave because of bad management or is forced out for working too hard. I stayed until my schedule didn’t allow me to anymore we went through at least 10-15 people in the months I was there. Managers are rude and disrespectful, they don’t appreciate work unless you work to death and only the first time you do it. (Once you push a threshold of work any work you do is looked down upon unless you do better)"
bad,They never had enough people to work so we had to work twice as hard. And if you was sick they wouldn't let you take off for no reason if you missed they days they fired you with no problem
bad,Very racist company  doesn't promote from within back stabbing cutthroat groupie's couples working all throughout the company they either like you dinner
bad,"I went for part time 30-40 hours and I ended up doing 40+ hours . Management was all over the place and made me a cashier do way more than what the cashier job description was . Making me go outside in the cold and rain without telling me that I was going to push carts , I had no jacket and ended up getting sick ."
bad,"no one in upper management was interested in improving the store profits or cleanliness, sales all upper management wanted a paycheck only it was a social event for them"
bad,"Well, what is there to say? It's walmart. A huge corporation that pretends it cares. If you work hard expect to be taken advantage of. If believe in good work ethic for good pay, DO NOT WORK AT WALMART."
bad,"No incentive, not a good place to work. Low morale, and not a good pay. No benefis. No progress and no good management. You're in your own, trying to do a great job."
bad,Walmart does not honor all employees. They only cared about management. At the time that I worked there the pharmacy manager was extremely crass to all the employees
bad,The atmosphere in Walmart is very poor. Management and H.R were very slow on many issues that came up. They expected 120% from the employees but only gave back 50%.
bad,"Walmart Ardmore is not only a terrible place to work but it is a horrible place to shop. The management that was their when i was working, were rude and inconsiderate. There were people moving up to CSMs that had only been there for one month."
bad,"Walmart is really going downhill. In my 2 years of working there, I helped out in nearly every department, even changed my job title to cartpusher since they can’t keep any. Surprise, when you treat people like they aren’t worth anything they’re gonna leave! All the managers that supposedly liked me severely retaliated against me when I changed my job title since I couldn’t do things for them anymore. If it weren’t for me, they’d all be out there actually doing work, instead of them hanging out in the office together having their daily Starbucks/pizza party. Since I’ve left I’ve been back in my store a few times and it’s an absolute mess. Good luck with all the upcoming changes, management, I hope a lot of you are eliminated!"
bad,"The store I worked at rewarded those that did little and held back those that worked hard. The management staff were not real knowledgeable on the policies of the department in which I worked and would want things done the wrong way. When mentioning that the way they wanted it done was wrong, they insisted it be done anyway. I could also never have an issue resolved in a timely manner, or receive an adequate response to questions about policies. All in all, I had a real bad experience worked ng for this company."
bad,"very pore training"
bad,Walmart does not care about their employees & it shows.. Typical day is getting yelled because someone else didn't do their job. Then the work environment is so hostile. The only thing I enjoyed was working with weapons.
bad,"Walmart has a turnover rate of 95%. People are constantly leaving and people are constantly being fired. I've come to believe that they have embraced their high turnover rate, and instead of trying to fix it, they just hire more warm bodies to replace those who leave, and drive THEM until THOSE people leave. They run the store like a correctional facility. Since cracking an actual whip is illegal, they do it verbally. No worker is ever doing a good enough job. They have to be driven to work harder. Hard work is never appreciated. All workers are suspect. I've been chewed out just for going to the bathroom. I don't do it often and I don't do it to get out of work. I only do it when I have to go, like 99% of the workers. The bottom line is that management doesn't give a rat's butt about the employees. No one is happy there. They need to fix that, but they continue going in the opposite direction. I've heard it used to be a decent company to work for, but that company is gone."
bad,walmart is not very organized with management. hard to work there management have attitudes and people are not being treated fairly.I didnt like working there.
bad,Wouldn't recommend Wal-Mart to anyone to work for they treat there employees like garbage.  Management don't care or help out you have to do your job plus there job.
bad,"Works  their employees for penny's no health benefits. Walmart is one of the largest company's in America, but you would know that if you worked there."
bad,"The workers are overworked and the hours of work make it impossible for you to find better employment."
bad,They don't know what they're doing. Poor management. Refuse to work with anyones schedule needs even though they said they would when they hired me. I don't recommend working here
bad,"Do not work here unless you want to be a boot licker for advancement. Be careful who you befriend because the culture is of gossip and underhanded practices. Beware, only apply at a last result."
bad,"I really loved working here. I worked hard to excel by learning everything I could, as far as, the running of the store and overall customer satisfaction. I was unfortunate when it came to the location which I was placed."
bad,This job will have you standing up for hours with no brake or nothing ‘ they don’t care about nobody but themselves & you get worked so hard for nothing
bad,Please don't be fooled  Walmart product are killing us. The worker's are percfect people they became my family sinced I worked good and fast for the manger. Just need more workers honestly.
bad,"I worked at a Wal-Mart in the 90s.  One of the most fun jobs I ever had.  It was a temporary job but I liked it.  Just last year I started working at another Wal-Mart to supplement my social security.  What a huge difference.  This time around is a total nightmare. Management is greedy and since they gave us that so-called raise and they’ve cut our hours so bad nobody sees an extra dime.  It’s hard work for very little pay. Management doesn’t want to help you, they treat you like you’re a slave. I’m still there but actively seeking other employment. This is by far the worst job I have ever had"
bad,I think cart pushers should be paid more than anybody. they had me working in -2 degree weather without the proper work equipment and left me outside by myself for hours
bad,Os colaboradores trabalhavam muito e não eram valorizados.
bad,"I had applied to be part time with set hours, they made me full time and repeatedly adjusted my schedule at the last second while refusing to give me full time benefits. Customers were as customers are: complete jerks"
bad,"realy bad managers ,no cusomer service training at all , the hours are what they want you to work not what you are avilable for and you have to do all jobs cause everyone calls off daily,and they are only aloud to hire so many people."
bad,"Strict managers and supervisors, made me work overtime and tried to fire me when I disagreed to the work, managers with very little respect and very little understanding of associates rights"
bad,"Night shift is you sit in break room, wait for supervisors to come in and complain to everyone, go to your assigned section and then clock in to tasks and begin putting things away as fast as you can so you can finish on time. Good luck if you need help, supervisors are usually wandering around chatting with favorite employees or eachother. If youre not trained at something, good luck ever being trained at it and being yelled at every time you dont know."
bad,Overnight stockers need to be paid more for the amount of work they do. Training needs to be more thorough and more often. Mangers and Human Resources need to be retrained.
bad,Not good work u too hard for little pay always finding a way to pick with you if management get in trouble.I do not recommend this job at all. Very unpleasant and unprofessional.
bad,Worst job place I ever worked for. Manger suck people working there bad attitude. I will never work for a walmart ever in my life again. I would work at McDonald's if I was ever desperate before I ever go to that place.
bad,"The employees are not very nice to each other and there is a lot of jealousy. And the customer service is not very good, if you go in there and ask an employee for an item in their department most of the time they have no idea what you are talking about or if they carry that item in the store."
bad,"Management is so poor, that the CO-Manager of wal-mart likes to talk to his associates like they are some child and is being very disrespectful to all his associates."
bad,Do not go to work there. It’s an awful place to work. You are nothing but a number. Walmart will work you to the bone and that will not be good enough.
bad,They pay very little and expect you to work as if your getting paid an insane wage. Management will try to cover themselves rather than stand up for you. It is good if you need flexible work because your going to school or university.
bad,The store I'm currently working for plays alot of favorites with certain people. Brown nosing is a plus for career advancement. Walmart has good people who work there but management is a huge downside to how you work every day. Always expect to do the work of already 2 to 3 people everyday.
bad,"Not a great place to work.  Can I build a career here any more. Walmart is not what it use to be, only care about the bottom line and not the associate."
bad,"Again, I'm not sure why I have to do this in order to get to the questions. Anyways, Walmart was awful, especially the management. Too many chiefs, not enough Indians I heard a few times."
bad,would decline your requested days off even up to 5 months in advance for no coverage. Makes no sense because it’s 5 months in advanced how do they know that they already have no coverage ??
bad,"A stressful place to work for at times. It wasn't the store, it was some of the so-called managers. Some of them had nasty attitudes that they needed to take out on others. I asked a question to my manager and she said that I should know it already."
bad,Horrible place to work. Promised full time 3 years ago and still waiting. Management show favoritism and cut hours at will and chage corporate schedule to give others better schedules.
bad,it started out ok then a new co manager or that what they will tell you to get you away. they add about 60% more to everyone work load to make people quit because 75% of the workers at lawerence iowa street walmart have been there for 5 to 20 years. so a very shady place to work.
bad,"Sometimes you just need to light a fire under yourself to figure some things out. At the time i didn't know what i wanted to major in at UNM so i took some time off to think about it and decided to work while figuring that out."
bad,"Walmart takes the negatives of working at retail and turns them up to eleven. Only apply if you are truly desperate, and, even then, get out as soon as you can. Expect management that is soulless in how it treats you and other workers, a environment designed to wear you down to exhaustion and customers without a trace of humility or humanity."
bad,Worse place I have ever worked Walmart does not care about its employees they work you and expect you to learn everything about working there for no extra pay they don’t care if you work eight days strait they still expect you to work eight more if they call you
bad,"I say working at walmart is a basic living. you get what you get. for me, there seems to be no room for advancement as you have to be a favorite of a manager. the fun part is your co-workers are like your family. sometimes i spend more time with them than at home."
bad,"Tripling of workload with cut in pay, severe cut in hours, and paid time off accrual. You have zero chance at advancement unless you are REALLY good friends with management. Company does not follow their own policies and when management is called out on it they will find a way to coach you."
bad,"I wake up every morning pumped to walk into work... sounds cliché, but so true! The culture is unlike any company I've come to work for or interviewed for. Everyone in the Glassdoor community is truly genuine and extremely helpful in all aspects. Upper management will help you focus on your next career steps, in setting up mentorships and having one-on-ones to meet your goals. This is a copy of a review from a different website. :/"
bad,Job sucks work every weekend. Slip seat trucks 3-4 times per week. Benefits are a thing of the past. The other drivers for the most part are friendly and very helpful. Most of the managers will help you as much as they can. Walmart has mainly turned into forced dispatch
bad,They barely put in any effort to support me going to school and have this job. I was going to school and working from 8am to 11pm everyday with out many breaks. Sometimes you wouldn’t even get a fifteen minute break.
bad,"At first Walmart was a good place to work, but now they make it kinda impossible to make goal the management doesn’t really care  o an some of the coworkers are shady, there all nice to your face but then the moment you turn away they will start talking about you, most up in breakpack on there weekend shift."
bad,"I was treated poorly by management and the customers. I felt un-vauled and unappreciated. As a college student the company was not willing to work with my hours and would schedule me outside of my availability. The store was also not willing to relocate me for college, but the store i wanted to move to was open and willing. My manger would lie to my face and make face promises. I would get sent back and forth between managers like a game of hot potato without getting answers. Managers were rude to my face."
bad,Favoritism and no team work and management is very disorganized and disgruntled. Not uplifting or courteous. I was told I would never be anything more than an overnight stocker
bad,Walmart does everything it can to screw over employees from changing policies from 9 days you can miss before your fired to only 5 days plus they take 25% of your bonus for each day you miss
bad,"Understaffed, "
bad,Very bad Management and terrible environment. Driven by one culture. I had a terrible time doing work for these people and I feel bad for people who are in their system.
bad,Wal Mart should be a temp job. This is not somewhere you want to build a career. If you are in school and do not have a lot of responsibilities this is a perfect job for you.
bad,I didn't work for Walmart directly. I worked for someone who was attending an event hosted by Walmart and he was commissioned to create videos for a presentation for Walmart employees
bad,I worked here 4 years and was terminated on the spot for a technicality. Management could care less about most employees I worked 4 years with out ever having a write up or warning just to be booted out the door like I was nothing.
bad,It was absolutely horrible working here. You keep your stats up or they fire you. They are very competitive . The people that work there will single you out.
bad,The treat you like trash and micromanage you even though they don’t know how LP works. The district manager is a jerk and could careless about all the LPs in his market. The pay is ok. Suppose to be able to make your own schedule but the store managers all change it and force you to agree to it. Would never work for this company again.
bad,They have bad management the managers talk to you any kind of way that's the reason I do not recommend nobody they want to work you for lower pay and that's all
bad,Walmart is a corrupt company that does not care about their associates. Management is incompetent and never wants to hear the truth and or logical explanations.
bad,Management sucks! I could not work certain hours because I was in college. I found of 3 managers took turns making schedules. Every week I had to tell a manager that I couldn't work this day or that day or those hours. They constantly had to change my schedule just because they would 'forget' about that!
bad,"In 2013 when I first started the work was manageable, the managers were nice and fun to talk to, the employees were helpful to everyone. I gave them 6 years of my life. Two years later, after the old managers left and new management came, I was forced on to cap team 2, they didn't care if I wanted to be on the team or not. Gave us more work to do with not much time to work. I was coached more than one time for taking too long to down stack the grocery pallets, I was all by myself and there were more than 10 pallets stacked at least 7 or 8 feet tall. Previously, before I was on cap 2, 3rd shift would take care of things that my shift couldn't finish, but since they gave a $2 rasie (which is laughable) they expected me to break my back finishing all the the things 3rd was supposed to do. I'm not even sure what 3rd shift does anymore besides setting mods and complaining. Before I was terminated we got a new supervisors who would blame the team for everything, I would be taken to the office like 2 to 3 times a month for not respecting the idiots who I worked for because they didn't give respect. I can't just give respect to people who don't earn it, I wasn't raised that way. My coworkers were too afraid of losing their jobs to call anyone out. Their is a lot more to say about these new policies in place that make no sense, but I would be writing a book if I went in to it. Long story short crappie management, supervisors, and policies. Only apply if you know the managers won't bust your balls for doing your best."
bad,"Walmart does not provide its employees with an adequate salary."
bad,Management works lower associates like crazy while doing nothing but taking on cell phones and sitting in office talking amongst each other I would not recommend working here
bad,The Walmart I was at laid me off when I told them I was going to be a father the working conditions is horrible. They threaten you to finish the truck on time or your fired.
bad,"Walmart is a joke!  Not only have they started to cut hours and hire more people they do their current employees dirty.  There is zero care or compassion.  Def dont need to use your medical leave because they will do their best not to secure your job.  Its a joke.  Go to work sick, bust your rear, go above & beyond & get treated like trash easily thrown out."
bad,Bad management bad hours definetely not recommended unless you wanna treated as a robot and expected to work unreasonable hours and be treated as expendable
bad,I do not recommend this place because of poor management. I was supposed to be able to use PTO time for an important training class and the manager didn't put it in so i was fired then denied unemployment. Pretty poor
bad,Yelm Walmart plays favorites. I'm an adult but was treated like a child. I did the dm job temeraliy not only did they not pay me but i was 8 months pregnat when i came but they cut my hours to 6 one week then nothing the next.
bad,"Basically the title. You get good hours and therefore decent money, but its a miserable work environment due to management, fellow employees, and customers."
bad,"Would like to see a more transparent workplace. To much game playing and favoritism and talking ND back stabing."
bad,"Sweeping the entire store floor with a big dust broom. Cleaning breakroom, bathrooms, back room and any spills that occur during the night.  Picking up trash."
bad,"So much favoritism it is ridiculous, plus I was not in the right ethnic group to work there. I was not allowed to ask questions or talk only when speaking with customers. Even then I was in trouble for speaking to a customer. Every move was monitored and watched like your under a microscope all the time. I was so tired at the end of a shift that I missed out on valuable family time. The worst job of my life."
bad,Horrible company to work for that do not care about there associates. Horrible scheduling that will not work with your availability either. Also very underpaid.
bad,"Throughout my time with this company it was a great  learning experience, I worked with  a verity of personalities were I learned patience and also  what good customer services is."
bad,"I learned that working for a company for many years means absolutely nothing and having a health disability is an inconvenience to them. "
bad,Best advice for working a job like Walmart is to just keep your head down work hard don’t get to know anyone personally job can be very high schoolish if you let it
bad,I've never expected such a big company to be a horrible place. The store manager & assistants showed so much favoritism to others. They let all kinds of harrassment & bullying slip by & they didn't even care. Don't bother going to any of the managers for help because they won't. They're horrible people with no respect for anyone other then theirselves & their favorites. Don't work here if you care about yourself.
bad,"i didn’t like working here at all. horrible management and stern but rude employees, horrible hours for people who wanted to work part time, and very unorganized."
bad,I had a problem with my stomach which I let my manager know about. I was told that we would be working as a team but the Walmart I worked at was horrendously understaffed. I spent my whole day running around by myself trying to get all of the Bakery and Deli stocked up. I got in trouble multiple times due to not having any assistance and was promised to be placed in Produce with the other employees. It never happened so I gave up on the job.
bad,unless you like killing yourself working almost 9 hours straight with a little lunch and no breaks.and being talked down to like a dog then i suggest just a different job.
bad,"My experience at Wal Mart was not pleasant.  Even though, I did enjoy working in the cash office until I was replaced by the cash recycler.  I then had to move to a different department."
bad,You WILL work every holiday with no holiday pay. Wrote up if 3 seconds is late punching in from breaks or lunch. 5 point system to termination. Can NEVER get time off when you need/want it. If sick you have to come to work no matter what. Drs notes won't help so dont ever get flu and be out 5 days or its 5 points and your fired. If 1 minute late to work its half a point no exceptions. Get in an accident  to bad it's still a point. Dont call in on a holiday or key days or its 2 points. Production quotas are exceedingly high with no exceptions. Even if you are placed in a slow area and can't control it you are still held accountable to getting quota or it's a write up and termination. If you get hurt on the job at no fault of your own it's a write up. Need s a band aide for a small cut? It's a write up. Equipment malfunctions  and you get hurt....its a write up. Horrible place to work and treat their employees like garbage. Benefits are horrible and cover nothing. Huge copays and expensive. Covers no lab work at physicals.
bad,"It's like a cult they send you away for 7 weeks to brain wash you into believing they are out for good. They are just a company, Walmart. Think long and hard..... walmart. You will room with someone u dont know and have never met. Right next to your bed, then u get back and the managers of the stores act like they are Gods. Like litterly you will here your peers say that it's so and son's world. It will give you nightmares working there. Just dont do it!"
bad,I like my job but I have a disability and I was being bullied at my job one of the managers call me out of my name and I was being miss tread by the manager. I have never had a job like this before OMG.
bad,"The Store Manager at the time that i work there was really a great manager, he was concern about his employees, but the co-manager was horrible. the department manager was nuts, so i left"
bad,"Terrible teamwork, management is abusive- no problem overworking staff and not hiring new staff when employees quit. Stressful. WAY too much work for too few people. Management threatens jobs if performance is not up to their personal standards."
bad,"You are not a person here. You are a number. You have no face, and your nametag defines you more than your name, because nobody knows who you are without it. Looking past how terribly the customers treat you, the management is worse because they assume that you're always always always wrong. You are never ever congratulated nor compensated for a good job, only reprimanded for a job that appears sub par on the surface. Management does not care about your life outside of work, or even your life at work. Management is so strict and so distant."
bad,This has got to be the worst morale environment to work in. They don’t care about the staff at all we’re just numbers. There was times we had 5 people total working the whole store including cashiers and managers.
bad,"Horrible benefits, would ask you to work double shifts and then penalize you for working overtime. Would send you home at 2 when they were slow and call you back in at 3 when they got busy. Customers treat you horribly."
bad,"Managers aren't very polite or understanding to staff and don't take pride in their employees, Walmart is also a poor place to shop. There's this one supervisor who is very ignorant to her employees and has several complaints about her to head management and still nothing has been done about it.. Poor place to work."
bad,this is the worst place to  work they write you up for no reason the assistant managers are dicks they lie all the time and they let the lazy people get a away with everything while hard working people get in trouble for nothing
bad,What a bad place to work. They don't care about your mental health or the fact that you have things going on. The bully you into working shifts even when you can't
bad,Defiantly not the job for anyone who wants to advance and they fire you for simple things. Walmart doesn’t take care of their workers  which is only selfish
bad,Wal-Mart sucks I would not want anyone or anyone working their so don't waste your time walmart don't care about you or anyone so it is a lost cause thank you for not going
bad,Walmart is a horrible company to work for the managers treat you like your nothing!!! Your hired for a position but you barely get a chance to work in your department you’ll be unloading trucks working outside in the garden center on the register pretty much doing whatever it is they tell you to do. Your first 3 days will be great all the managers will seem friendly by day 4 the friendliness ends they’ll no longer speak when they see you and then comes the picking on you as if your going through a hazing that never ends. The customers aren’t the problem it’s the managers. Oh don’t believe the hype about the wonderful 401k plan it’s taxed so you’ll never get your full amount and if your looking for health benefits they don’t offer them but they’ll tell you they do but you’ll have to be full time which they’ll tell you you are but your really part time in their system. Oh and if you get sick your on your own because they don’t accept doctors notes. Walmart is the shadiest corporation on the planet!!!
bad,Working for Walmart is not the best job they don't care if their employees have a family/work life all they care about is that they have you at work when they need you.They don't help you advance in your career as I have been with Walmart for three years and have not advanced due to lack of management and lack of understanding.
bad,"Does not take words into consideration when needed, when advise or ideas are brought up manager hears you out but never listens, supervisors and managers never acknowledge your hard work only take your bad days/slow days into consideration, they overload you with work until you're burnt out."
bad,Temporary job for people who need experience on their resumes. No real advancement opportunity. Low pay. Low benefits. High stress. Little assistance from management.
bad,Don’t work here it’s bad. Production supervisor never at work and whennthwre does nothing but bark orders and talk to people like they are garbage. Nobody does their job. Leaves everything dirty. Management doesn’t care just takes advantage of workers.
bad,"i liked it at the beginning but i  have been noticed that you don't have the opportunity to grow up inside the company, you keep stuck in the same place"
bad,"This place eats your soul and spits it into the walton family's mouth for food. Seriously management doesn't know what's going on half the time, especially during holiday season. If they see you're a good worker, they'll just overload you with responsibility that should require a higher pay grade but they don't care. This multi billlion dollar company can't even afford to pay its workers a living wage, but they sure can cut your sick days and tie them to your quaretly bonus."
bad,"Our distribution center is ran by a man who has absolutely no Walmart family values in mind, and Sam Walton would be rolling in his grave if he saw this centers antics and disrespect for their associates. Extremely politically ran, and if you don’t kiss the right rear, you’ll be canned in no time. And forget if you have excellent work ethic, and morals; they’ll boot you out the door before they even investigate if there’s been any rumors or accusations towards your character. Guilty until proven innocent, and even if [every single one of] your former managers from other positions in the place go up to bat for you, they’ll still can you and make sure you feel like you were an extreme waste of company time and money."
bad,With Walmart it doesnt matter how hard you work. I have a bunch of leadership experience and I could not ever get promoted. The training is basically pointless because no one ever follows the rules. People just do whatever they want and no one is held really for there actions
bad,would not advise to work for because of mangement and the way run the store and treat there  enployees plus work sitution adn treat of workers and the people they promote
bad,Walmart should be a temporary job for entry level individuals trying to get some work experience. Management was not educated enough to do their jobs correctly.
bad,The managers there talk to the employees like they are children. They want as much work they can get out of you for as little pay as possible so they expect a 14hr job to be done in 7.5 Hrs.
bad,"A typical day at work can be frustrating, most of the employees bicker with one another and would gladly cut each other's throat. Customer satisfaction is merely a myth."
bad,"Management is just awful, there are some har deworming assistant managers but not many. For the most part they take credit for the work you do and know very little about the departments they manage. The harder a person works the more they expect. While others get away with doing nothing. Management is cut throat and rarely move people into advancement. They pay very minimal for what they make and often staff are struggling to survive off of their pay checks"
bad,"Hours were cut after initial hire, management was poor, work culture is hostile."
bad,"None to very little training, poor culture as this company in any store is run with favoritism and I found some departmental supervisors are racist. Also poor hours and they give best hours to the favorite employees."
bad,"The management at this store needs to be replaced. They do not manage their employees. They micromanage from an office, no direction ever given and don't show up for work most of the time."
bad,Management did not care about employees only about themselves. Working for Walmart in Austin was a nightmare. Other cities Walmart is an OK place to work.
bad,"I worked for both the Wal-Mart store and the D.C. the store is ran by a tyrant ironically named happy, who makes up his own rules which make others suffer. The overall management there are awful people more worried about their bonus. The D.C. is just as awful if not worse, the management was the biggest joke I've ever seen in a work place. Other than folding stickers and treating employees horribly, its hard to say exactly what they do there. At the store on average you work a 9 hour day with a your lunch, at the D.C. shifts are minimum 10 hours to 12 hours with a 30 minute lunch which makes no sense. Working for Wal-Mart means you're their slave. They will force you to put your personal life and family 2nd."
bad,"I have been employed at Walmart for 2 years as a FT employee. The rate of pay is high yet they barely give you hours. If your part time you might get 15-20 hours a week. If your FT you'll get 25-30; maybe 33 a week. Their is no set schedule so you have no life. New point system allows you 5 points per year before termination. Doctor's notes, accident's, death in family are all counted as an absence and will get you a point unless you use a PTO (Paid Time Off). Late to work is half point. No paid holidays or overtime either. While at work you have your department tasks you must complete (freight, price changes, customers, zone merchandise) plus you have support managers telling you to go into other areas of the store and do other people's work as well. Not to mention Assistant Manager's telling you to do other random things to. All while trying to do your tasks and take care of the customer. Very very stressful. If you don't complete the tasks or say anything wrong to management you are coached. "
bad,"It's a nightmare working at Walmart. Monticello, ny. Store# 2547. Some workers look like they're on something. Some of them stink, like they haven't taken a shower. Some have no manners, very rude. They look at you like your a piece of nothing. Forget about management. They have no clues how to run the place. They have so many department managers and they are all clueless. This place is the worst place. I can't believe that I'm working at this place. I'm working in this place for the money. Helps me pay bills. Looking for another job."
bad,"I do not recommend working here if you are a person who hates doing the same thing every day. There is no change ever, every day is the same stuff different day. Walmart never has coverage ever and if your the type of person who shows up for work you're screwed.  "
bad,a typical day at work is coming in and getting my reshop up the front from customer service. then i go to my department and assist customers and put up reshop and zone my department.
bad,"Walmart was a good place to work, but management did a horrible job at helping associates. Pharmacy was the best place to work, helping customers with there medication needs."
bad,the managers do seen to know what is going on and they expect you to work beyond your scheduled hours at a whim.  They are all very disorganized.  They treat you as a number not a person.
bad,"do not ever work for this company if you can help it. they do not care about there employs or the customers only there bottom line matters. they will demand you come in for shifts to cover people who call out but then make you  cut that time later, over time is a cardinal sin. i have not set foot in a Wal-Mart in over 6 years and i do not plan on ever stepping foot in one again."
bad,Truthfully I did not like walmart for the simple fact that ive been working there for a while and really the only person they could depend on to come to work and I wasnt getting treated fair in pay as a worker or anything.
bad,This job was the worst job I've ever worked! They don't treat their employees right. They over work you and under pay you! They require so much from you in 8hour shift but will be quick to repremend you if you haven't finished you daily duties!!
bad,The hours are inconsistent. You can not make it with the salary. They did not try and teach you they just expected you to know. Going to the bathroom shouldn't be an issue but they do not give you the opportunity often.
bad,Management need to be in same page and market always yelling at you . No personal tome you need work long hours everyday and if you have to go work on your day off you have to per store manager .
bad,"Talk to anybody who has ever worked for walmart. as an employee you are working there on borrowed time, Once you make what they consider to much money, they find a way to fire you or make it impossible to work there. Sam Walton would be disappointed"
bad,"Stocked up front and organized in the back,The most enjoyable part was to organized and make it look nice for others to easily find what they are looking for."
bad,I did not learn anything the management was not very good I did not like being product associate I wanted to be a cashier. Plus I got hurt. The hardest part of my job was lift the bins
bad,"Horrible company to work for as a salaried manager. "
bad,The deli was a cut throat place to work.  Everyone would watch everyone else and try to get them in trouble.  The manager NEVER did her job and then would expect us to do it for her on top of our assignments. It was not a fun place to work.
bad,"Walmart sucks, from the top down. Management is only concerned with meeting metrics and how they can pad their bonus. Pharmacist in charge at most stores are bully’s that treat ALL members of their staff poorly. Horrible work environment. No backup from management when problems arise. Pharmacist and technician hours have been cut in half while workload has stayed the same. Stupid busy work that must be done daily....leaving little time for real connections with patients. Open door policy is a joke. Rules are only in place to document and terminate personnel that have fallen out of favor. I wouldn’t wish a job at this place on my worst enemy."
bad,"They do not care about you or your family."
bad,Management didn't seem to care about your wellbeing and only cared if you arrived for your shift. Felt like I was going to be fired every time I showed up for work. As a woman I never felt safe or respected working there.
bad,"Great learning experience. You get the opportunity to work in many other department's and gain a greater experience in the  work field. You get the chance to be cross trained. however I have had issue with managers/higher ups while working there. Some of the employees are extremely rude, and try to tell you what you did was wrong despite being told by your boss that that's what you should be doing. Supervisors don't do anything when you try to discuss a problem. I got burned twice due to unsafe work conditions and they have not done anything about this issue. They told me it was because of ""lack of experience, next time be more careful."""
bad,"Customer Service Managers are horrible."
bad,They treated us like slaves from the get-go. You had a quota of 900+ boxes per day when I started which was very hard for most of the workers to hit and they increased it to 1000+ a few months after i started.
bad,I hated working for this place. I dreaded having to go you get in trouble for things you didnt do it was awful i didnt mind the people i worked with but the managers were not very nice and they talked down to you all the time and they were always right ad you were wrong didnt matter what it was about did i mention i HATED it there
bad,"Lack of support from management, they used you until they didn't need you, only concerned about their bottom line, doesn't practice what they preach in the beginning, very unfair, no job security, unfair decision making"
bad,"Absolutely not a good place to work unless you like being worked like a dog, with disrespectful management and staffers. there's no help its everyone for themselves"
bad,"Walmart is a joke, they don’t want you to make 40 hours or plus compensation it’s awful. Company face enormous discrimination against employees. Stray away from Walmart."
bad,horrible communication from upper managements to employees. upper managment always think their better than everyone else. They have no respect what so ever
bad,"If you like to deal with angry customers, crying babies and bratty kids all while not making bank then this is the job for you. Management has no clue what those in charge are doing."
bad,"I didn't enjoy my job at Walmart.  I was over the infants department and it was a lot of folding baby clothes and organizing the shelves of diapers and baby food. I also worked the women's department and brought things from the stockroom out to the floor and set everything up on the racks and shelves.  I also occasionally ran the cash register, which I enjoyed."
bad,every chance you get to move up management will stop it if they don't want you to move and that is going above and beyond the scope of your job duties
bad,Get same raise as bad workers. No advancement unless you suck up. Terrible management. Don't want to come into work do to lack of respect from management which trickled down to co-workers.
bad,"Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't have worked for Walmart to begin with. The store I worked at has very poor management overall, from the front end CSMS (who I interacted with more daily) to the ASMS (who claim they're working daily but are nowhere to be seen when needed). Management doesn't back its employees AT ALL and will quickly throw valuable employees under the bus and tell flat out lies to upper management rather than take responsibilities for their own actions. A lot of ASMS get their job the good old-fashioned way and are very young and inexperienced and yet expect you to respect them when they don't give or show it."
bad,"Overall work culture is off base, Management is poor. "
bad,I was there for almost five years and I’ve taken the test for supervisor and got looked over they like who they like and if they don’t your stuck in the position you got hired for
bad,"Was okay for a little while until my son got sick, when instead of taking me off the schedule they kept me on it and denied me any promotion, I worked hard to get customer service supervisor and they denied it to me because i had to many absences because my son had rsv and was in the hospital for 5 days. I liked my job. And was fast at my job."
bad,"Would keep employees scheduled to max at 40 hours and would ensure you never passed over 40. Would be asked to pull doubles everyday, would be kept pass closing hours without being asked."
bad,"Did not get along with the managers due to different beliefs. I struggled to feel welcomed and accepted for who I am. It was very inconsistent and inconsiderate how they relieved me from the job. They told me if I couldn't get over ny mental, physicaland emotional health, I didn't belong in Walmarts community."
bad,"I gave them 4 years of my life and all they did was screw me so hard my final month there that it drove me to quit."
bad,"The favoritism is out of hand and dont even get me started with the horrible hours and the stupid minor rules. 18 and still in school but can work all day because all of your classes are online? Nope, you're still a minor. Enjoy your 15 hours a week. CSM's are never anywhere to be found because they are so close with the managers and can get away with doing absolutely nothing. Have 4 absences and have bills? Guess what? No hours for you. I love my coworkers but I cannot deal with management. Wal-Mart is an awful company and I absolutely do not recommend working here unless you're interested in kissing butt."
bad,"poor management not honest, looking for reasons to dismiss employees, the supervisor, was dishonest, sneaking and not helpful in anyway. Overall ethics violated"
bad,"Everything you've heard about Walmart is true. Sometimes it's fun, most of the times it's not. Cap Team 2 is the harder shift to work for so be prepared to get griped and complained at by every manager in the store if the work isn't done in an hour per truck."
bad,"Manque d'organisation, des gérants se croyant supérieurs au autres et se contre-fiche de leurs employés. Il n'y a aucun respect venant de la direction et aucune démarche n'est prise en charge afin que sa change, après plusieurs plaintes reçu de la par de leurs employer. Surcharge de travaille, dû au manque d'employer, se qui épuissent les employer évidemment. Bref se fût mon premier et dernier passage dans cette entreprise."
bad,"Chez Walmart, les gérants sont très demandant et ce demande, après, pourquoi tu ne fais pas leur 1001 demandes. De plus, ils nous font faire des heures de fou ( finir à 22h30 la veille pour commencer à 6h00 le lendemain)."
bad,"Cleaned the store for 8 hours"
bad,"I worked at Walmart for almost 2 years and it was the most stressful, unfair working conditions of an employment I've ever had. The management is nothing but a joke only caring about receiving there quarterly and yearly bonuses with could result in a full year of salary. Associates are treated unfairly to only serve the management needs many associates were making decisions in regards to customers issues because management was nowhere to be found. Also management would falsify documents and do whatever it took to cover there own mistakes and punish hard working associates. "
bad,"If I could give negative stars I would. Wal-Mart is horrific. Assistant managers all seem to have ego, power trip, issues. Wal-Mart claims to be a retaliation free company but that's all Store 88 knows. Everyone is either frustrated about hours being slashed, or depressed because no one truly cares. Wal-Mart only cares about profit while depriving their employees of happiness. Wal-Mart may have been a good company back in the day, but now it's just a madhouse run by a bunch of manipulative children."
bad,Working for this company was very frustrating. Management is like blind leading the blind. Walmart does not pay or treat employees with the respect that's needed for us to put all our efforts fully into leaders!
bad,"They pick favorites and if they don't agree with our beliefs or the friends you make within the department you are in they will talk about you to EVERYONE about how ""bad"" you are."
bad,"Walmart is not a place you want to work if you get sick or have kids. They don't care about you or your family or even try and work with you to get on another shift if the current shift isn't working out. During the my time there I have seen countless employees come and go (such as myself). Management plays favoritism and doesn't do their jobs properly. I would never recommend anyone to work for store #771. Every store is different, but all the employee's (both current and former) I've spoken with all say the same thing, every since the original owner Sam Walton died everything went down the drain. I'm sure Walmart was once a company people loved to work for, now it is not like that at all. They work you to death and management wants you to go above and beyond for them like we are slaves. What I've learned from working at Walmart is NEVER be afraid to call corporate if you feel something is seriously not right, and if your own store's manager is not doing their job, GO TO THE PERSON ABOVE THEM - ESP IF IT IS A VALID REASON. Workplace culture is quite fun actually, if you don't think about management."
bad,"150 characters about Walmart.  I enjoyed my co-workers, and some of the customers.  Some of the customers were rude and ignorant.  Management did not care at all about employees."
bad,"Walmart trains its employees to stop working hard because no matter how hard one works, one will never get a leg up or catch a break. The only way you will manage to get ahead at Walmart is by tattling on your fellow employees or kissing up to your superiors. Hard work gets you absolutely NO WHERE. Also management is pathetic. There are so many people in charge of you and guess what? None of them communicate with each other. They also have a tendency to disagree with each other which makes it incredibly difficult to accomplish anything because you're just redoing things constantly, which is a complete waste of company time.The most difficult part of my job is the total lack of respect and common decency from my superiors. I don't deserve to be treated like an idiot and I definitely don't deserve to be given the run around when it comes to my hours. If I had to say there was an enjoyable part, it would be the moments when me and my coworkers have accomplished the tasks for the day while also laughing and having a good time because no where on One Best Way does it say I HAVE to be miserable. I didn't sign up for that and neither did Sam Walton."
bad,Not a great place to work. Management was bad and you are never given enough hours to be able to support a family. If you want any kind of advancement yo have to be liked by them.
bad,"There is little training. Pressured to ""sell"" the Walmart MasterCard to customers. Constantly asking customers for donations. These requests annoy many customers. Difficult to get bathroom breaks. Required to do computer training, but never given the opportunity to complete it."
bad,i will NEVER work at a Walmart again they atleast thanks to the managers and other employees who pic favorites and think they r better than every one else
bad,"Management is very poor, they do not care about employees and HR made a huge mistake on my last paycheck..bouncing and no one took responsibility for bank damages made by depositing a final home office check into my bank account."
bad,"Walking into unworked freight from the previous shift, store torn up and lots of complaints from customers about not getting the help they need and line being to long."
bad,It was ok to work there. I only worked there for a seasonal position. I was offered a permanent position but I declined due to needing more money. At the time I had already a better job lined up.
bad,"Walmart is a worthless employer at best used for seasonal or part time work. I would never recommend full time employment or attempting too advance in that company."
bad,"put product on shelves,the middle part of the day was the hardest part the best part was helping customers find the things they came for.the bathrooms were clean."
bad,"This company don't care for its employees, if you are not one of the favorites you are out of luck. "
bad,Empresa que tina tudo para ser agradavel. erencia muito mal treinada e desenformada sobre as leis trabalistas. Muito desvio de funçao.
bad,"they make you work long hrs for little pay "
bad,lots of turnover in management and associates.  Three store managers in one year when I worked there.  If management likes you your good if not forget it. Hours not consistent one week 32 hours the next 16 or none at all.  Walmart needs to pay a better hourly rate and reward those employees for their good work.  You are considered a machine doing as much as possible in the time frame you are working.  Would not recommend a career there salaried managers work over 70 hours a week and are burned out. Overall evaluation good for high school kids or college kids as part time work otherwise do not plan on a career working at Walmart
bad,all around this Walmart was the worst 6 plus months of my life especially under that ridiculous co manager. please do yourself a favor and work somewhere else
bad,Its a terrible place to work no helps you when you need it and then get yelled at when something isnt done to there standards. It isnt worth your gas to work at any walmart
bad,over night stocker stock shelves and clean/zone shelves and store and do inventory and set up end caps for new sales and do daily training on the computer
bad,The job was horrible. They did not give people breaks. Did not allow people to use the restroom. Had minors working past legal hours. Would not accept doctors notes. Made me walk for 9 hours when I had a broken foot and had an accommodations form
bad,"If you have ever considered working for walmart you must be crazy, they over work every single employee and they do not and have not ever cared for anyone like they say that they do. They do not treat you well and they bnever will"
bad,Poor management.  No room for opportunity or advancement within the company.  Stressful work environment.  Never were enough hours. Customers were TERRIBLY rude.
bad,Walmart pays very well but the company is rather twisted. Management only cares about the company. They do not care for their employees as people. They don't realize things happen in life and its not all about Walmart.
bad,"Every since I worked there, I even do my best to not shop there anymore. I was physically assaulted by another employee on camera and the management threatened to fire me because it caused problems for them. Also there was a verbally abusive manger in a neighboring department that several associates complained about or even quit over but upper management did nothing about because he had a medical condition."
bad,"If you don't kiss up to management, you will not get hour. they do this so you quit. I was lucky to be in the Loss prevention, because, my department was one of a few that did get 40hrs"
bad,This was my first job and I hated almost every second of it. If you not being a managers pet good luck moving up. It was just not a good place to work.
bad,The newest managers blatantly ignore their own policies and have done plenty of illegal actions just because they didn't want to deal with a customer. They severely cut the entire stores hours and refuse to work with you to fix anything. They ignore your availability and schedule you whenever they feel like it. The store rating has dropped nearly 40% in a year.
bad,They treated you like a high school student. Bad hours. Bad managers. Bad pay.  The only thing I learned there is that every body there was expendable. I hope its better now.
bad,I was a grocery/retail cashier and i worked very hard and did my best but was poorly treated and compensated.  I received a discount off retail merchandise and that was great.
bad,"They hire you, invite you in believing everything is going to be ok......Then the games begin. They lead you to believe that you will get hours and be able to move up the corporate ladder....that is a false statement.  They set you up for failure.  Management is a joke, co managers have favorites and they get away with ANYTHING.  YOU ARE BETTER OFF PANHANDLING."
bad,they make bad distinction and they belittle you and make you walk on egg shells. if you apply no one will have your back. they have to many chefs not enough cooks.
bad,"The work isn’t bad, its the management and Walmart as a whole company. They treat you like your nothing threatening you about losing your job. I dont dare anyone to get this job."
bad,"Managers were very unprofessional, i would not ever recommend Walmart to any of my friends or family. If i was the CEO I would recommend terminating some of the managers at the Hammond Indiana store."
bad,ever since i started at walmart i never felt part of a team like they talk about all the time but really your treated more like rent equipment not like a valued employee management does seem like they care more like they just covering they're on jobs they say they have an open door policy to just come to them with your problem but you are always afraid of loosing your job all the time
bad,I worked here for a year and it has changed but not for the better. Management never really understood our job and told us we were all replaceable. So all and all it was too great.
bad,Worked at Walmart for 8 months while the management were very rude and treated their employees like dirt. If you weren't fast enough they yelled at you and told everyone about it
bad,The management is so poor and they don't appreciate your hard work. and they don't let you work more then 20 hours when you in school even if you're 18 Years old.
bad,Was ok for the first 8 years and to many new general management coming in changing and taking away everything we had took vacation replaced it with pto time took sick time paid holidays
bad,"Terrible place to work, between the same songs being looped every day over and over, the inability to properly lift due to efficiency concerns, or the monotone management (similar to office space)"
bad,Always at work. Very stressful. No time with family. Management poorly organized. Never agreed. Always wrote people for silly things. Strict attendance pilicy.
bad,"incredibly understaffed, horrible working environment, rude management would not recommend it. I once tripped over a skid around a corner where skids are not allowed to be placed and hurt my ankle for a month! I was written up due to my ""negligence"""
bad,They know how to make you feel less of yourself here.they don't go by the culture they do it as if we don't exist we'er below them............. thanks for reading
bad,"The managers were very lazy and rude, I had a number of health and safety concerns that went ignored. They eventually cut my hours after I ended up bringing a bedbug home from the customer service desk. Forced me to quit after no shifts for 3 months. Great job if you like working for nothing and having scumbags be rude to you all night."
bad,"Definitely not a “teamwork” job. What I can say is the one person who actually cared about everyone was the Store Manager. Great guy !!! On the other hand, CSMs aren’t very supportive. They get impatient, too demanding, and get unprofessional. Also, changed up my hours that were way off from my true availability so I received occurrences for times I was unavailable."
bad,"Walmart makes customers and workers feel like criminals, the managers are always rude and yelling at workers. They expect too much and they threaten workers about getting points if we don't do or stay as long as they want."
bad,Not a recommendated place for anyone to work. People are rude and you are under paid. Hours during a shift are inconsistent and they send you home if you reach your limit of 40 hours. No over time.
bad,it was not the greatest job. a lot of bad management and very hard to change youre schedule and take time off they do not accept pto for part time employees
bad,So much work to do. Never enough time. If you are a good worker the demands just go up. There's no balance of work life especially.if u r a manager. Lots of work.
bad,I worked at Walmart for 4 years. I watched as the turn over rate of employees got higher and higher. This company is beyond unprofessional and they are unfair to many employees. No one was treated equally. The pay rate was beyond unfair.
bad,"Horrible management and a horrible company to work for. You would think Walmart would be a great company with great benefits. They don’t care about their employees. Majority of management is absolutely awful. They treat their employees awful. They’re rude. I’ve even seen them so much as take their rudeness to customers. They choose favorites. They bend the rules for those they like and are strict on those they don’t. They don’t like to hire many people full time because they don’t want to actually offer benefits. Their attendance policy is awful. They think your job is all you should care about. Your family, health, and well being do not matter to them, what so ever. "
bad,Walmart schedules hours so that an employee only gets 39 hours a week therefore making them ineligible for full-time status... meaning they do not have to offer any benefits but keep the same benefits as a full-time employee.
bad,Management substantially cuts hours with disregard towards the impact on the quality of life of their employees. Lack of hours with the same high level of expected work production leads to a very stressful work environment.
bad,Walmart doesn't care about you or your life. They care about running you down and treating you like you don't matter. Customer is always right even when they are wrong and then you get yelled at 😂 not worth it.
bad,"Clock in and go to my register, go other places as instructed throughout the day.. I learned the ins and outs of cash handling for a retail company. Management is not supportive or kind to employees or customers.Diverse, not a hard place to work. The job would be a great place to work if you had to Team of Managers who are compassionate, caring, supportive, helpful to employees and customers."
bad,I worked at this job part time while I was in school this job wa ok I quit because the manager told me they couldn’t work around my school hours that was my only dislike
bad,"Working at Walmart was the worst job I have had. I was a High School student, and kept being scheduled during school hours after repeatedly letting them know I could not make it in. Eventually I was fired for not coming in during school hours."
bad,Poor management. A lot of favoritism with some employees.  Don’t have proper equipment to work with.  Always changing your hours of work and days off.
bad,"The job environment and the management team is horrible. A typical work day is basically helping customers and staying on top of go backs. Picking orders and dispensing orders to customers as well. My manager was awesome however, the company as a whole is the worst."
bad,"nothing good to say about walmart it was an unreilable source  of income, they  have not reguards for home and work life balance the job is dangerous at times not really worth it."
bad,not that great though they never have enough peopl on shift and they kept firing cashiers even those with many years of service because of the new self checkout centers.
bad,"If you get overtime they force to take a longer lunch to cut the overtime. If you don't then they will coach you or take disciplinary actions. Also, the management does a poor job of coordinating the number of people to work to the size of the trucks that day."
bad,"The management is awful, all they do is pass their work onto others and some just sit in the camera room and watch as others fail without trying to help. Most managers don’t know what they’re doing and each department doesn’t always get along with other departments. If you’re sick, doctors notes don’t help and you could get in trouble and if you try to go home while sick you can get a strike"
bad,"I did almost everything while I worked there from remodeling to cashier to pushing carts to maintenance etc. Management never cared to listen when I reported safety issues...but instead made it seem as if I was complaining. They never cared that I had serious home issues and had to miss work, then fired me and violated the Americans with disability act."
bad,Management is terrible. They will not work around your schedule. The work schedule is never consistent and you will be over worked and under paid. Look elsewhere.
bad,"Would never work here again. Employees are treated like trash. No sick days, strict call in policy. Pay is terrible. Do not work at Walmart. They are a terrible company to work for."
bad,Working at Walmart is stressful and back breaking. They will not fix floors in the warehouse due to customers not being allowed to go back there. As long as Walmart can save money then that’s what they care about even when their employees are suffering.
bad,the walmart in new roads where i work is very unorganized and unprofessional . they do not care about your needs only care to benefit themselves ! they will work you to death but will not try to help you .
bad,"Don't let any of the hiring posters or management fool you, this is the worst place. Prepare to be belittled every day and watch your management play favorites. Your managers will constantly blame every mistake on you and will threaten to fire you at the drop of a hat. They will constantly remind you that you are replaceable and will see to it that you remember that."
bad,Employees are not treated with respect.  Employees are not valued. They are merely numbers and bodies. No one is hired based on their experience or compensated for it either. There is no incentive to work hard or to go above and beyond. It is all about money.
bad,Terrible place to work they don’t care about there employees don’t work there not good work life balance upper management don’t care about if your sick or kids sick nothing
bad,"Don't work here longer than you need to, just work here till you get a better job. Don't stay there for long. Advancing your career is almost impossible unless you are a favorite."
bad,The job itself was nice but you were barely trained but expected to know everything. The management was very lazy and made sure to barely get anything done
bad,I will never work here again they are rude and have rude customers with attitudes and it's always about race there so tired of it the theft was unbelievable there
bad,Management is horrible. Everyone makes it seem like it’s such a great place to work then you actually start working there and get treated like you don’t know anything . Nobody likes to train you
bad,"Unpleasant work environment. Pay is very low and management is unappreciative, they won't even say thank you.  Ive been working at Walmart for 4 years and I'm ready ready to explore more career opportunities."
bad,Spending 8hrs on your feet to when nobody shows up.  My manager could nver keep my schedule straight with my other jobs.  When I needed days off for drill I was still on the schedule for my drill days.
bad,I hated working there a girl stole my numbers and started stealing and I got in trouble for it. And they let me go but turned around and wanted me back
bad,I ended up leaving because they do not care if you have surgery. I had my appendix removed and they still pointed me for not being there. I found that very disrespectful since I had never missed without a doctors note (they never pointed me with a doctors note until this time).
bad,They would over work me and under pay me. People that were just getting employed were making what i was and i was with them for almost 7 years. They said i kept falling under a certain criteria where they just gave me a raise to match what everyone else is making. It was not just me others that have been there longer than i was getting the same rate of pay as new people. Hours cut. Never allowed me to progress to management level.
bad,I would not even recommended the job to my worst enemy let alone to any of my friends and family they don't know the word team work they also tell of u don't do something u lose your job even if you know that it could hurt you
bad,"Don't ever work for walmart. They do not care about you. If you are not a manager or higher, they will work you like a dog or will give you 8-12 hours a week even if you are full time."
bad,"Could be stressful at curtain times of the year.  Checked out customers, front end cleaning of registers and surrounding shelves. Put up returns and some stocking and needed."
bad,I work an overwhelming number of hours with little or no help it is easy to make mistakes as we try to rush through our duties so that we can get to the next one.
bad,I just think walmart needs to treat all their employees equal they have favorites no appreciation showed while i was there . will I work for them in the future I have no clue hope the one I was at does better
bad,"The worst job I have ever done. Work condition is dirty, customer's cars are beyond filthy, Management is absurd and slow. They keep changing the schedule whenever they want. They think technician is expendable and replaceable. They just don't care. The wage is extremely low which is as same as greeters in front of the door. Just walk away is the best advice I can give."
bad,In the 7 years I have worked at Wal-mart I have learned a tremendous amount of activities that gives me many job options. On the bad side the management was the most unprofessional people I have ever met. It was like being in high school all over again. I would never recommend working for them. The management spread rumors about other associates and talked to people like they were children.
bad,I worked there for six and a half months and I couldn’t handle it anymore. The management is terrible and they get very lazy and no one ever pays attention.
bad,The management degrades and abuses it's employees. There is no standard to hold anyone accountable for. Instead of working as a team. Everyone there looks out for themselves and how to get anyone else in trouble. Or push blame on someone else
bad,"So I don't like to trash on anyone or anything most of the time. Its in-necessary and it wastes both of our times. That being said Walmart was the absolute worse. I was fired from Walmart for scanning a customers items with the scanner. On top of that Walmart is so corporate run that you can't do anything without thinking first ""is there even a 1% chance this goes wrong"" for example ""helping a customer in a motorized scooter get up and into their car"" the something that could go wrong is that someone could slip and the lady could fall and you would get written up for even helping her. There is also the ranks of managers there's CSM (9ish), assistant department managers (15ish), department managers (15ish), assistant manager(5ish), store manager(1), district manager(1). for those of you that don't want to do that math that is about 46 managers that you are always paranoid by when you walk by them. The CSM's were in 2 categories (Very Nice and Strictest people in the world) and half of them were in both categories depending on the day. I could keep going on but I just hit 4 digits so I'm gonna stop now."
bad,"As an employee of Walmart, the amount of effort and passion put into my work was not compensated properly nor noted by management.  I do not recommend working there for this reason."
bad,"Tienen sus favoritos y es muy dificil subir de puesto y no valoran el trabajo de los empleados, ni a los empleados"
bad,"They only care about there favorites. If you aren’t a favorite no matter on how hard you work, there is no room for advancement. They don’t care about your family problems, they pretend they are a great company to work for and they love to throw hard workers under the bus. They always make  promises and never keep them. They themselves do not follow policy’s and always make it look like they do. The only good thing is making a few friends and some of the customers. That is the only great thing other then that a waste of time and no room for advancement. Hear my warning run!!"
bad,I supported walmart 100% until a new store manager @2450 and my jewelry dept manager fired me out the door with unjust cause. Even Washington employment agency sees it as wrongful termination that should have never happened.
bad,"Don't work here! Put on an act during the interview. Mgr's a joke ,doesn't know how to run a clinic. Will cut your hours, and then lie!  She's scared of old staff members. Let's her do what ever she wants. I was assaulted mgr has done nothing about it! Clinic needs a complete overhaul starting from the so-called Trainers to clinic staff. It's very unorganized. The place is NASTY!  There's dust everywhere but it's supposed to be a clinic.  Dust bunnies be waiting on you at the door.  They run across the clinic like they own the place!  The staff is messy bunch of little girls. RUN FOR THE HILLS!"
bad,"If you are hard worker you are typically running circles around those that are lazy and don't want to actually take care of customers.  Managers on duty do not give direction to those who avoid actually doing their job, they would just rather leave them doing meaningless task to keep them out of the way.  "
bad,employees treated like dogs not allowed to have lunch breaks on time or to sit at registers they stand  constantly . if an employee faints they leave them there until ambulance arrives.
bad,"Working at Wal-Mart as a job through college was fine. After i graduated and my manager was still treating me like a lower tier person was not okay. I was working circles around the others i worked with, and because they started after me they were getting paid more than me. The store managers would never listen to me or do anything about the problems i would bring up. "
bad,They put you on a 4 point system . Every time you are sick you get a point or if you are more than 9 minutes late you get a point and if you get 4 point in 9 months you get fired . Management doesn’t care about your personal life at all . Worst job ever . You never get your breaks on time and sometimes they will forget to give you a break at all .
bad,"Management does not care about you. They like to pretend that they do but they could care les if you work there or not. Even if your work ethic is superior to everyone else’s. On the outside looking in it seems like a good job. However the more you stay there you realize it is trash. All they want is money. They want you to kill yourselves for them. Work all hours of the day. To get their stuff together. You can stay over for that but then you need to cut it later on. I worked full time with 11/hr on Cap 2 and my salary was still less than 20,000. It’s an actual trash place to work. In the end Walmart is going to run itself into the ground. It’s something you’ll have to figure out for yourself if you don’t heed this information now."
bad,"To much favoritism, They got there picks easy for someone to get lied on are fired. Not a good company to work. Have to be someone they like in order to move up. In they company"
bad,"Having worked there I have watched the decline over the years. This company claims to be family oriented, however, actions ALWAYS speaks louder than words. Chances for advancement are few and far between, unless, you are a favorite of management. Benefits are sparce and as for paid vacation...no standardized 1 year=1 week, 2 yr=2 wks. etc. No more sick pay nor personal time."
bad,"Overworked, underpaid"
bad,Walmart can offer opportunities to people looking to work in a retail environment. There is flexible work schedules available and benefits are offered after 90 days
bad,"I helped open the Fort Myers Beach.  I knew every isle, every product.  I was Head Decorator in the Bakery.  Walmart Fort Myers Beach, I did everything I could to help this new store.  I arrived early and stayed late.  I was passed up for promotion.  I followed all the rules and did my job with perfection.  I am the perfect employee, Walmart didn’t see it."
bad,"If this location hired, and trained, the right people for the management position, the store would run more smoothly, and Walmart would be a wonderful place to work."
bad,I wouldn’t recommend working at Walmart to my worst enemy. It’s poorly managed and a all around terrible place to work with people who are paid to much and know to little. Hitler ran a tighter ship then them and you see how that worked out.
bad,"Walmart is a horrible company. The management do not respect you although one of the chore values is respect for the individual. Instead they yell at you belittle you in front of others. Walmart allows management to abuse you and you can’t say anything "
bad,"It is a horrible place to work. You have to be friend with management to be able to grow in that company. They do not reward good work, and there is a lack of commitment by the management."
bad,The company has to be the most stressful place to work for ever! The management only looks at the associate as hours not people and they are all replaceable.
bad,Zero communication between different managers in the store. Associate not held accountable for there actions. Blatant favoritism throughout the entire store.
bad,"They scheduled your hours without consideration of prior obligations you voiced and they agreed to when hiring you. They claim to not hire anyone on full time but schedule some new hires to work 40+ hour weeks and others get less than 12 hours a week. The give minimal training before putting their employees on the floor with absolutely no guidance. They also place some employees in departments they are not qualified to work in."
bad,"I worked overnight.  A typical work night is I go in at 8pm making sure that the second shift is stocking the grocery freight  to the shelves.  When the overnight shift comes in I make sure that all the GM freight gets worked to the shelves also.  Once that is done I have the associates work the returns and zone the store up and clean the floors, offices, bathrooms and backrooms.  The overstock freight is sent to the backrooms to be put in the bins."
bad,utterly terrible management. i have asked multiple times to help with scheduling and they have blown me off for months. I can no longer take how terrible management is.
bad,the jobs was great at first but as time when on i realized it was nothing but stress and no help. management never came to help with a customer that wanted to speak to a manager.
bad,"Terrible place to work. They see 1 or 2 mistakes and you get written up or fired for it. When my co-worker called in sick so many times, I had to do the work myself and they expected perfection. All assistant dept managers have to be in on meeting to terminate someone. Maybe they should have taken a termination class instead."
bad,Working at Walmart was a very stressful and seemingly possessed place to work. The management never wanted promote anyone who were obviously more than qualified due to experience and educational credentials. They only promoted their friends who were often very unqualified and slightly illiterate
bad,it sucks manage is rude and mean i do everything they told me and still got yelled at i got in trouble for a piece of wood went out into the aisle way
bad,If you want a job at Walmart you have to be perfectly healthy and have no sick days for the first 6 months you are there. The Walmart I worked I want shirt down for good.
bad,"Walmart tells you there are so many great benefits, it's all just to reel you in. The management is the biggest problem. The first two months is great. But after 2 years they just act like you are absolutely useless."
bad,"I do not suggest this place for employment. It is full of drama and the management does not know how to be good at their job, they treat their employees like dirt."
bad,"this is a hard, unforgiving place to work, the management is full of bullies whom act like superior children.  The management are awful and just don't care. discrimination and being bullied is a common practice at all walmarts in charleston area. i do not recomend walmart at all!!"
bad,Worked there and treated me like a dog. started out as cart pusher and was pretty much just a slave to them and not caring at all. that was my experience would say more but cant
bad,my experience at walmart as a cake decorator was a good experience for me I enjoyed keeping the customers happy seeing the smileson there face.When it came to managnement not enough communication
bad,I loved walmart the customers was friendly.  The location was great.i didnt like how the managers dont look over you time off when you choose a day to be off
bad,"Lack of management, high theft means employees pay the price. Treated like dirt by customers and management. Wouldn't go back even if they made me CEO"
bad,Wasn't worth working for. Pay sucked. Hours sucked. Was treated horribly there. Not the greatest of management........................................
bad,Horrible racist management not good for the worl need  whole new mangagement need alot of new thing chepa break easy people are mean there management people dont know how to do there job the right wat
bad,They treat their employees horrible. They don’t care what their employees are going through and don’t even try and make work better for them by asking them how they’re doing . Managers are having intimate relationships with associates and picking favorites. People that know are the ones managers try to push to limits so they can quit . No one can confide in no one . Management acts like your life is important to them and the work place and you tell them what you’re going through at home and they use it against you when you tell them you need to leave home early or you can’t show up. They assume you’re not working when In reality you’re busting your butt . They expect so much of you but you aren’t to expect better of them .
bad,"When it was SCM it was a pleasurable place to work, since become Walmart had been bad and every year is worse, management is terrible and they don’t listen and aren’t reasonable to talk, dispite of THEIR POLICY “ DOOR OPEN”, that’s just to make you feel trusty, but if you want to talk, management always going to have the reason, if you want to make a career and climb the ladder you need to be a favourite for them and that has nothing to do with your development on your duties, lots of people never had working in a warehouse before and after 1 year they become TL or even manager; so basically and literally you have to ki** a**"
bad,Get impossible tasks done before you go home or you get punished like hours taken away unfair opinion from management can’t run a store right only good thing is giving you a hour lunch
bad,"The employers are treated very poorly and there are no benefits for part time employees and no room for advancement. The pay level is poor with no funds to pay all bills without government assistance. I would never reccommend this company to anyone, especially single mothers."
bad,The amount of work required there far exceeded the salary compensation. The management was not helpful and they made my work experience very stressful
bad,"There is a lack of communication between management, under staffed, unrealistic goals, no room for growth within the company. The attendance policy is horrendous."
bad,"Been there for over a year and they treat people who are just hired and do half the work with more respect. I always do more that what is asked, and still, they treat employees like garbage"
bad,"very stressful, management blames everything on the people below them. its survival of the fitness between csm's , you  turn one in then 2 rally against you and have you written up for things that did not happen. they have other associates motoring your social media and you are reminded of it if your page is not consider walmart friendly. you have no personal life and can not befriend anyone without getting accused of anything."
bad,"Just find something else. There is zero moral or team building at Walmart. Nowhere near enough staff.  Management doesn’t care about you or how you get what they tell you to do done, they just expect it to get done."
bad,"For a multibillion dollar company, they treat the employees poorly. Whether it be not giving them hours or working them into the ground. I complete disagree with the amount of work these store managers pass off to the low level associates. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND"
bad,Hours with pay works out less money than hourly associates. Working there is like an island. Salary positions are not well compensated. Especially with online grocery positions
bad,"Some associates genuinely love Walmart, and most of those are people who never worked anywhere else.  Retail is retail, and expect the usual pros and cons concerning work requirements and conditions. However, Walmart as a corporation is moving away from the old traditional retail model and more toward an automated online presence. They are eliminating or combining many traditional retail positions, so don't be surprised if your job becomes drastically different in focus, pay, and hours than what you signed up for. Some locations are bearable because of decent managers and staff, but I've worked at one Walmart that was a hotbed of bullying and favoritism (especially with relatives that while they did not work directly""under"" one another, they certainly worked WITH one another at the same job and same shift)."
bad,"I worked for Walmart for over 8 years. And no matter how hard I worked and how good a job I did, I felt they did not have my back when things needed fixed or went wrong. I loved my co workers and that was the only thing I missed when I left."
bad,"Terrible culture, people that's been there over 10 years treat everyone like trash and if your new dont even bother reporting it just find a new job it's less trouble."
bad,"Not enough opportunity for hours and not enough coverage, nor do they follow all policies. Loved working there but was used on for seasonal work than let go."
bad,"Enjoyed the customers and other associates. Management was HORRIBLE to say the least. They treat associates with such disrespect and constantly yelling at associates, even in front of customers, very unprofessional. Pay was good but not worth the stress of dealing with management. Seen countless associates get passed up on promotions because management didn't like them. Had nothing to do with if they were qualified or not. Best term I heard out there from a fellow associate is that management uses associates and department managers as whipping posts. Truest statement I'd heard out there. Would never work there again."
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work for Walmart.  Management does not know how to manage the stores properly or fairly.  Much favoritism. Everything is constantly criticized and or changed.
bad,I worked part time and worked the 5-10 pm but was usually there until 11 pm or 12 am. The management was very biased and would give the easiest jobs and best hours to their favorite employees. The hardest part of the job was trying to balance family obligations and work. I did not enjoy any part of the job.
bad,Not a professional setting. Nobody knows what they are doing. Spend countless hours doing something just to get negative feedback from a superior. Superiors are never consistent.
bad,"I was a pharmacy technician for 10 years. My pay was not correct and was never fixed. I tried multiple times to get the raise that I was supposed to have, but was always told no. The managers suck and are really rude. They don't care about the employees. You are just a number and a body to fill a spot. They do nothing for their long term employees yet want good publicity for starting pay at $11 an hour. This will NEVER be a career no matter how hard they try to act like it is. They expect 1 person to do the work of many. The insurance is pure garbage might as well not even have insurance. Personal and sick time accrued prior to the bump to $11 an hour was made nearly impossible to use. Sick time can only be used if you are taking care of SOMEONE ELSE and they have to be sick or injured."
bad,Management have favorites so if you kiss butt that’s the place to work. They didn’t allow over time only when they wanted or shall I say needed you. Lack of management having your back. Scheduling system sucks it’s not customer friendly they only have 1 maybe 2 registers open and then expect you to help out the customers as well as do the other 50 millions task they gave you during the day and if you don’t get it done they will get mad. Go backs are always outrageous and put it on one person.
bad,"My experience of working at Walmart was horrible. Most of the management team was very bitter and unprofessional. They weren’t understanding of me still being a senior Highschool and I needed some days off for senior events like senior pictures , senior fitting and etc"
bad,"Unless you're a glutton for punishment and don't desire to move up in the company, look elsewhere. Very, very physical, blazing hot and humid in summer, bone shattering cold in winter"
bad,"I wouldnt recommend Walmart to enemy they talk about safety but ignore it when they want something done, lots of internal conflict"
bad,Never ever work here.  They expect you to pick up other peoples slack and don’t fire the people that do nothing . If you are sick you will rack up points and they will fire you. It’s just a horrible place to work.
bad,"Its Walmart, what more do you need to know? Everything about it sucks, they don't pay anything, every mangier I had to endure was a raciest, capitalist pig. Don't work here. Ever."
bad,"I worked for the Lincoln ME Walmart (04457) for little over a year. I started as Stockman(cart pusher) and halfway through the year shifted to maintenance (with no pay raise) which was arguably a much more stressful job. Covering for other stockman if they were just being slow and lazy (at the cost of my own duties going unattended.) Having absolutely zero communication with my supervisor. (So if day projects needed to be done I would never know until I was in trouble for not starting those tasks.)"
bad,Muita cobrança e era apenas eu e outro açougueiro e era muita coisa para apenas duas pessoas no setor.
bad,Management  doesn't care about their employees or businesses.  They only  care about the bottom line.  There alot of favoritism.  Scheduling is inconsistent.
bad,"not enough people to cover hours needed. they say, ""we are over staffed."" which can't even correctly cover breaks with how understaffed they are. People are awesome, management is a joke."
bad,"Equals High School Drama. It's never about what you know, how good you are at your job, or whether or not you show up on time every day. It's about the brown-nosing"
bad,"As with all big corporations it felt like all they wanted was a body they did not care about the person, The customers were often angry at the lack of coverage"
bad,The laziest employees are rated the highest and sought after. Your 110% isn't good enough. Management would rather berate you than help you achieve goals. You're not given any of the tools you need to do your job correctly and efficiently. And you're not trained properly either. It's sink or swim as you figure it out.
bad,"When I started it was great. The whole store was getting 40 hours a week and now you are luck to get 24 hours a week. No one person who has a house and family can live on 24 hours a week, with what Walmart pays."
bad,"This job started out promising, but ended up disappointing. Would not recommend it to anyone unless it's a life or death situation. Walmart is not a smart choice."
bad,"the hardest part about the job was training managment to learn about their job and going above mine and not being offered higher position. instead i had to train others on how to do the positions. the other part is when i got hurt no managment wanted to listen and waited three days to send me to their doctor and fired me on the fourth day. "
bad,"Always asking for more then what can be performed in a timely matter."
bad,"the very worst place to work, it doesnt matter if you have health problems , dr's appt etc, whatever , you wont get time off to take care of your health n wellness you could be crawling in to work n die on the floor and they would not care as long as you are there at your register.. The manager that makes out schedule was the worlds worse, there was no talking to her because she wouldnt take time off sitting in her office gossiping with the asst manager, needless to say that postion has since been taken away from her.."
bad,Save your energy. This job is overworked and underpaid. I worked there 6 years plus the store manager was a pill. He caused a lot of good people to wait.
bad,Walmart doesn't hire enough people. They don't pay enough .They don't keep you working In your position . They use you where ever then need you to. They aren't fair
bad,"OMG i am beyond glad that i don't work for this company anymore, it is by far the worst company i have ever worked for. "
bad,"My work experience at Walmart wasn't exactly hard; it was just very unpleasant. I feel that they could've created a more positive work environment, and also did a bit better at training the associates to correctly do their jobs."
bad,they tell you you could advance and you can’t they tell you you are not good enough all the time you get yelled at for things that aren’t even your fault they are not family-friendly like they say they are
bad,the management talk to their associates with very little respect. They talk to you like they are paying you $150 an hour. It is all politics. Way too much work with way too little pay. I wouldn't recommend d my worst enemy to work for this ungrateful company. By far the worst job I ever worked.
bad,"The worfk environment is fine, but the wages are not enough to live on, hard to get full time hours, no benefits, and no advancement. I do not recommend as a job for someone who has family/bills, and no other income."
bad,Dont work there they team leaders don't treat you very welcome and don't give you they hours you need to live on. So if you want to be treated bad then go for it!
bad,"It is always understaffed, the managers are very unappreciative and they have denied many of my vacations. Also you are not allowed to use a sick day until all your vacation days are used up. Sick days should be used when you are sick, at any time. So, if you are sick and you call off, you cant use your vacation day, you get a point,that's counted against you and after 5 points,you are fired."
bad,"It is a ok place to work, but good luck standing out. Honestly it is just a corporate giant that does not care about their employees. They do just enough good to look good to the public, but end game they do not care about you more than their bottom line."
bad,"The jobs walmart has available, in and of themselves, are not difficult to do. They can be incredibly straight forward and routine aside from interacting with customers"
bad,"Do not waste your time applying here! Everyday is more aggravating than the other. Management is awful! They are unwilling to take responsibility for anything. They pass on the hot potato and are plain unbelievable! They do nothing all they long. They are always no where to be seen. The customers are unbelievably ignorant! They are your typical low income, dirty and untitled bunch. I hate coming to work! The hours drag and you face dumb stuff  from the moment you walk in. They require you to do your job plus the job of two or three other people. The employees, the great majority are clueless! I get home exhausted everyday and I will lose it one of these days. Save your time and don’t even think about applying to this awful company. You mean nothing to them! Your safety, your health and well being don’t matter, they only care about the almighty dollar."
bad,The Management was terrible. If they liked you there was no problems. If they didn't like you they treated you like dirt. They moved good managers out who were fair. All they cared about was who could scream the Wal-Mart cheer the loudest.
bad,"Horrible place to work, don't take any position unless you are super desperate.  Management doesn't care about anything resembling logic most of the times or the rules they set up seem to just make the job harder than it needs to be.  9 years of my life I'd gladly take back if I could."
bad,"They work you and take from you at the same time, what job you know will at you to stay over if they are short handed but will make you leave early just to stop you from getting overtime. Walmart use to be a good company to work for but now it’s strictly about them making money no care or concern about their workers or the employees family and how giving 20hrs a week to a employee with a family will only sink them in the ground they have set it up so bad you can’t even work another job and with the poor management system they have they will find any way to fire you if you do have another job, I wouldn’t advise no one to rely on Walmart as a job to retire from it’s not worth it."
bad,buena experiencia ya que ha sido la cual me dio diferentes henrramientas
bad,I will never work for walmart ever again. Always felt like I was being belittled and taken advantage of. They claim to have advancement but when you try you are told that you are not good enough. Even if you are working a section that pays higher if they feel that you don't deserve the pay then they don't give it to you.
bad,"I enjoyed my job at Walmart."
bad,"I learned a lot at my job. However, I was also treated unfairly at my job. Which is why I left the company. They are way too strict on employees when it comes to attendance policy and I could go on an on. Don't work for Walmart"
bad,"Local de trabalho precário, difícil conciliar o trabalho com a vida pessoal."
bad,"The management only care for themselves. never approved anything even if it was a legitimate excuse, one day I came in late because of a flat tire, got coached for being late and took a half point, clocked in early to do my GLMS and took a half point."
bad,The job was perfext at first for college students who need to work in the evenings but now they arent looking for night closers as a matter of fact they are cutting hours
bad,"Employees don’t work "
bad,The company its self is good but the people and the lack of training or should i say the lack of them want to train you never happens always excuses trust me waste of time.
bad,"Very unsafe environment , A typical day at work"
bad,"I didn't even know who my supervisor was. No one knew my name. Rude customers (it's Walmart, that's obvious). Random hours that you can't choose; they're based on how many people haven't already called out that day. Sales associates are the lowest of the low there and you'll definitely feel like it. Boring and useless online training that everyone skips through. You're not even put on a register until a week or so after getting hired because they have you taking lessons on the computers in the back. One time I requested a few days off for a family vacation and the guy who was supposed to accept or deny it pushed it to the side. When I approached him about it, he acted like I wasn't even there and completely ignored me. Wouldn't even look me in the eyes. The customer service rep working during my shift would either make or break my day; there was only one CSR who I liked and he liked me, so I was ecstatic when he was working. Everyone else made me roll my eyes when I clocked in. This was a summer job for me so I can't even imagine what it's like to be full-time."
bad,"I currently work here and I hate it. I’ve been here for almost 2 years now and still havent been offered full time, my hard work and dedication literally goes unnoticed. I can only recieve their benefis only if im fulltime."
bad,"The management is unprofessional  , they just don't care they talk too there workers any type of way , have attitudes towards them and that not right."
bad,Walmart is as bad as the world sees it. only paying employees minimum wage and expecting world class workers. There is clear favoritism with the management and if you aren't a favorite in in for a rough life. No real chance of promoting within no matter how much they say its possible.
bad,I wouldn't recommend this place to my worse enemy. The managers get there under dogs to tell them what to do. They don't know how to run the store. The managers have favorites and they retaleate against the ones they don't like.
bad,"Nobody knows what they are doing, they treat you horribly , they lie, they had me work off schedule without clocking in and never paid me! The shelves were empty, they Were running out of groceryy bags and threatened to write you up for double bagging due to their lack of ordering new bags! The place was filthy expired food on shelves and dust sitting on top of food! It should be shut down that’s how poorly ran it is!"
bad,Was spoken down to. Managers did not care and were rude. They did not care for there employees. Easy work. But never had the tools to do my job. And they did not care.
bad,When I was working at Walmart I was in school for nursing and they would not be flexible to my hours and I ended up almost failing a class that I needed for my degree because of a scheduled day.
bad,"managers are not ready to give the hours to full time employees.,managers get the position without cualify. great please to get exeriense but not to have a career."
bad,Walmart does not care about its employees or its customers! Managers are rude uncaring and they lie straight to your face! I will never step into another Walmart again I don't employee or customer!
bad,It was alright while I was there but I would not work there again and would not recommend any one go there if they have a choice. There's no chance to move up if your good at your job
bad,"Managers and coworkers were vile and malicious. Unhealthy and unsafe environment. Not clean and not organized. Managers will tell you ""not my problem, figure your work issues on your own""."
bad,"First off, the store kept going through managers like water. Nobody ever stayed in their position for long and it was very disorganized. They would constantly yell at you, and not even bother letting you know that you were doing a good job."
bad,"Depending on your store, this position can be the worse position ever. It is not the fact that the job is hard, it's the fact that supervisors and department managers are incompetent. They do not understand the new system, let alone care for the associates. They do not understand that if there is only two to four people working for 8 hours then it is impossible to finish breaking down and capping the truck,  do a morning cap, do the picks for both 1st and 2nd shift, do the markdowns, do donations in produce first and then do the meat, bakery, and deli areas as well. The store I worked in was completely biased and worked first shift, my shift, like slaves but treat the second shift, who do not even do their jobs properly, like kings and queens. "
bad,"worst company to work for, favoritism and picks on people they don't like. not a company worth your time. they don't care about your family or children needs. if you cant work their hours they mistreat you."
bad,always over worked under staffed and not paid enough managers don't care so workers don't care I would not recommend this job to anyone that I know I don't even like going shopping there
bad,The mangers were rude and condescending. They had no regard for your life outside of Walmart. Get sick? Too bad. Still have to come in to work. Very horrible place to work at
bad,This job will get you skills to get your foot in the door nothing else honestly not that you should be looking to advance in a hostile work environment.
bad,never listened to you hated when you got hurt because of people. do not care about you they only care about themselves and no matter what you always get blamed for things go that goes wrong
bad,I dont like working at walmart ever again. The stuff and the management are so rude they don't know how to talk to workers. All of them think they have the right to say anything to people. They very disrespectful.
bad,The management at this store is very poor and they are very inconsistent with their employees. Many customers complained about the managers and they were usually right.
bad,"Worked for this company for 6  months and it was the worst experience of my life. The management team had more internal cat fights that Desperate Housewives, the employees they hired were either brain dead or too old to do their job, the pay was a joke, the worked you to death and you never received recognition for a job well done."
bad,"*Stressful,*Accomplish unrealistic goals,*Management is oblivious to the Assistant Mg's ethics,*Unorganized,*Communication,* Meeting Great  Customers."
bad,Walmart’s management was terrible. They only cared about theirselves. Hours were cut and they treated the hard workers like trash and the ones that did nothing were treated well.
bad,although walmart pays their cashiers well i did not like working there. the upper management would never answer questions from thweir cashiers. i never once saw upper management helping when we were busy
bad,If your not a people person you should not deal with the job like this. Consider that you should be fast and take care of huge amount  of customers with a nice and friendly attitude.
bad,"É uma grande empresa, muito boa de se trabalhar, não tenho nenhuma duvida, indicaria qualquer uma pessoa."
bad,Walmart say they are all about family but they are not I lost my job because my kids where more important then my job and they didn't seem to understand my children came first
bad,Management is incompetent and each manager has their favorites. If you don’t kiss a** you won’t move up. Pay is awful for a company their size. They are in serious need of a union. Policy changes almost every quarter or so and employees have no say in the changes. Their open door policy is total BS. You try to talk to management about your concerns and they just tell you to deal with it and make you feel like it’s your fault. Definitely do recommend this job unless you absolutely have no other option.
bad,I would not recommend trying to work your way up in this company. There is a lot of problems that I am not sure that will ever be fixed. The management is out of touch with reality and often take power trips. That being said I love working with the costumers but the management ruins working here.
bad,Company wants more then one person can give . Management and DM are very rude to associates in front of customers .No advancement unless they store manager likes you
bad,managers were douchebags. they dont care about the employees. they try to feed you a bunch of bs that its a great company but i despise walking in that place.
bad,"This place has a Moto that says have respect for the individual but no manager not even the store manager goes by this...They have so many elderly people working here but none of the manager's have respect for them nore how many year's these people have been with the company. .Most of the manager's were sleeping with the young females and promoting them just off that,when other people had to work hard to get to where they wanted to be but never got there cause this store never wanted to let people advance."
bad,Walmart is pushy they have too many family members that are related and there is alot of favortism going on. Its not fair to ther employees.  Other employees that dont have family working there get treated bad.  They dont give people enough hours the ones that get more hours are the favorite employees.
bad,I was slaved everyday and the management team above me always talked about how they were getting fired so I always felt like I wasn't doing good enough
bad,"I wouldnt work there is was lame."
bad,They are way more focused on what their competition is doing than they are in just taking care of their customers and their associates / workers. They are so focused on replacing associates with computers and getting away from the human touch.
bad,this was a busy work load with a staff that was in constant fear of disciplinary action. The work  was redundant and stifling. The management was concerned with performance and numbers.
bad,Horrible new management was horrible. No respect for the workers. Didn’t want to give time off to take my husband to his appointments. Shouldn’t have to beg for time off.
bad,Worst company i have worked for. There store policy changes everyday. The management are very rude and dont care for their employees. No recognition on any work performed.
bad,"I spent 8 years at Walmart and what was once a nice place to work has only become a place of profit for management. They are willing to take away people's bonuses and give it to the higher-ups, decrease the count of people and constantly expect more work out of people stressing everyone out. When we fail they complain that we are slacking and working our best, if we do succeed we ring a bell. Nothing else."
bad,Its a good place to work at. You'll enjoy it. Fun people. Nice people. Managers are very understanding also. All you have to so is speak to anyone about anything and they'll try to help any way they can help. Their helpful there.
bad,"Do not work at Wal Mart. You will not get to work enough hours to pay your bills. Some employees have to go on food stamps "
bad,A place that is not family oriented doesn’t care about its associates. Racially divided and associate fear retaliation from management. I would have never invested so many years if I wasn’t for hope that it would get better.
bad,"First off this place is a joke ,ie management is rarely around if something bad was to happen it can take MGMT up to 45 minutes to get back there ,alot of the customer just want the cheapest stuff,ie wrong oil for there vehicle or wrong rated tires for there vehicle ,all sales associates and service writers  inside has to answer both phones by the third ring ,cut keys, ring customers up  ,run freight ,breaks are a no no and you have to buzz people out and ask for receipts like your a prison guard ,the hours are horrible . 7-4   2-11 are your shifts Walmarts new point system is a joke"
bad,I am a disabled individual and they treated me poorly as there employee. They treated the other employees a lot better however apparently they don't care about there disabled employees. They treated me as a burden instead of a employee.
bad,Company is trying to stay up with competition. They are losing alot of good long term people due to restructuring and downsizing. New moto is Do more with Less. Less cashiers. More self check outs. More digital systems taking over human positions. Hours getting cut. People can not make it on the hours and wages provided
bad,Dont associate with management it could create unwanted conflict which sadly could result in being terminated... communication wasn't the greatest.. not a good fit for me..
bad,dont work here the management is so poor they treat your like bad. never got your back follow you around and talk bad about you other co work dont know what there doing at all yell no something you dont  work here
bad,Worked during the holidays for extra cash as a cashier. They work you until 11pm and then put you back in at 6am so not a whole lot of time away from work before you have to go back to work and work another shift.
bad,"I will never recommend wal-mart to any friend or family member ever....never. My experience with Wal -mart was very terrible, and I will not recommend any employee to such company. I don't believe this company in the interest of her employee, but rather for the profit making. The government needs to seriously look into investigation them as to how they treat their employees, because the employees are those that up hold the company and they are underpaid and treated very badly"
bad,"low wage for the work,terrible mangement,cult like culture...constant mandatory overtime,favoritism,no lunch break on any shift,overworked no time off to do what you need to do"
bad,I would not recommend walmart to anyone. Every bad thing you hear about them true. They run departments with bare bones staff and make you perform the jobs of three or more people. The management are trained to work you into the ground then discard you for a new employee when you refuse to LIVE there  and insist on a proper work/life balance.
bad,"Wal-Mart seems to like hiring ridiculously unexperienced managers/co-managers who don't care about their staff at all. To them, we are only numbers and they often say they can replace you at any time. Disrespectful, arrogant, won't listen to new ideas, always think they are right. The training is a complete joke, you are thrown in your department and told to ""have fun""."
bad,"I've worked for this company for over a year and showed reliability and have learned different hours to help my managers when they were short on employees, which went unthanked. They are not willing to work with my changing life and could really care less about me as a person, they don't see me as an individual, they see me through corporate eyes."
bad,"Wouldnt recommend it, although there were a few good people working with u, they didn't work well will your availability or college students.theyre weren't not very team oriented"
bad,I would never recommend anyone work here. They promise you advancement in the company but they will not follow through. No one is helpful and you will not get any hours around your life.
bad,"Just left this place after 12 years, as has most of the long term employees. Started out good with a fair wage and benefits package but as of late they have stripped us of deferred holidays,  sick time, personal time and vacation time. They have implemented radically unfair attendance policies and have pushed the production rates so high that it has become a very dangerous place to be. Employees are beat down daily with rules and procedure changes. Different rules for different managers.  Favouritism runs rampid. Constantly bullied and threatened to be wrote up or terminated by management.  People they dont like are fired frequently for petty things while others are overlooked. It's a hot mess! I only give it a one star because 0 wasn't an option. If you work here, quit! If you want to work here, dont! If your a manger, write a mandatory good review or you will be fired!"
bad,If you are part time you will not get many hours at all sometimes you are lucky to get 8 hrs a week .and some may get 19 hrs a week. They will hire in from other Walmart stores and knock you out of your job if you were currently in that position. It doesn't matter how long the other people have been with walmart. Say if they were there less time then you they can still take your job. Happened to me. So they put me in my secondary job just to get some few hours. They never allow overtime. And if you do get overtime they make you take long lunches or go home early just so they don't have to pay you that money. They will give you short shifts like for example 4.5 hrs. I don't know how they expect people to support their selves or a family on that. I don't even make my rent with that. Luckily my son works there and makes up the rest of the rent but on what few hours they give him we barely are able to buy groceries to last the 2 weeks before our next paycheck. You will stay broke working there.
bad,"There is a lot of unnecessary drama within associates and management. It is very unorganized, managers lack communication skills. I would never recommend working at this Walmart."
bad,"This is a totally awful company to work for avoid it at all costs, employees do not come first and never will, and the employee discount is a joke as well as the benefits"
bad,I hate that place so much growing up I liked it cause I'm not sure what I figured out the transitions between the groups and everyone went with everyone but I dont know how to get a little bit of the same as your last
bad,The management at the location i worked at was horrible and played favoritism. When i got sic and put in hospital it was near impossible to come back. They say they are there for you when they're really not.
bad,The management were not experienced enough for their jobs nor trained well enough. Most were personal friends to each other and talked about partying all the time. The scheduling was inconsistent at best. It really was a nightmare to work there
bad,"You are a student living with parents until you are 30 and they pay for everything and you're going to college and then taking your time finding a job that is good. If you are trying to make a living as an adult, this is not the place to work unless you cannot find absolutely anything else."
bad,"I worked over night maintenance for 4 months.  Because of understaffing i worked full time hours.  I was told by my supervisors that i would qualify as full time employee..after the 4 months were up i inquired about the full time status and benefits...i was then took aside and told since they didnt schedule me for those hours...they werent giving me fulltime and that id still work those hours but they woupd never write me into the schedule properly."
bad,"awful management, awful customers, illegal practices (throwing people on register with other persons ""numbers"") not allowing breaks. etc etc etc do not work here."
bad,"High stress, no acknowledgment for hard work, always understaffed, management does nothing for their employees. Very unprofessional and unethical. Treat their disabled employees terribly."
bad,"The job as a cashier was not bad at all. The attitude of the management is what made the job so difficult. They do not talk to you. They talk down to you and do not ask you for your opinion. They just want everything done their way, good or bad."
bad,"Absolutely corrupt place too work for poor management ridiculous attitude from management, a lot of retaliation and drama, wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone horrible pay"
bad,"This has got to be the worst company anyone could possibly work for, if you area a college student like myself you understand that only retail postions open up, I was fortunate to get this job, but I'm now regretting it. The store is filled with customers who cant seem to put 1+1 together without your help, often times customers will berate you, threatin your life and try to walk all over you becuase of where you work. Although I worked in a small walmart, with great bunch of teammates; I only enjoyed my coworkers for their personality. When it came to jobs, my coworkers sucked at everything, many times associates would not be willingly to learn simple job skills. My coworkers were lazy, unprofessional, and often times misleading customers. Mangement is a bunch of of behind kissers, spend their time in the office doing nothing, with only a few good managers who work hard and get fired while the evil managers stay. Once you work for this company you are expected by management to know everything the first day, you are expected to know every department. I spent my time often working in other departments then my own electronics department becuase associates either left their post or are on break."
bad,Huge favoritism going on. the managers are dictators not leaders. Never any help so you get cussed out by all the customers who can't find help.RUN!!.
bad,"The Walmart I worked in was very unprofessional so I wouldn’t recommend anybody working at the one I’ve worked at , but other than that Walmart does pay good"
bad,"Shady,  liars who have no regard for loyal employees. Was there 3 years and they held a chronic illness against me even though I did the work of 3 employees. Very saddened by their treatment."
bad,"they expect you to work at a pace that is extremely unbearable. "
bad,they are not a good place to work   all they care about is money  they don't care about their employees   been there 9 years in march and they refuse to give me hours
bad,"not really sure what tot say in a review. Walmart is Walmart. if you are looking for a stepping stone to move forward in life, defiantly check it out."
bad,"Over the years this place has went down. Management is a revolving door(from the GM on down to area management). They're trying to do the most work with the least amount of people, so a full 10-11 hr day is completed in 6-7 hrs. If you are only working 7 hours a day in a 4 day work week(3 days for weekends), your averaging 28 hours or less a week. That's no money its basically a part-time warehouse now. They have ran all long term associates away and are nonchalant about it. They micro-manage everyone and watch over your shoulders constantly. Managers have a quota of write-ups they must meet, so your written up for literally any and everything. There are plenty of other warehouses to work for, so please stay far away from DC6055 in Monroe, GA"
bad,A typical day at work was productive enough to wear you were doing management jobs i learned to say no and that the management is judgmental and play favoritism the hardest part of my job was trying to do my job plus department mg jobs plus about 2 other jobs while getting yelled at by store manager so no do not work there what i loved about that job was the day i quit.
bad,Poor company to work for.  Work load and environment are unprofessional and unstable.  Manage was poor and the company gave no incentives to the employees to continue to 'want' to work for them.
bad,horrible i hated this place it was complete waste of time managment is rude and uncooperative would very much not recomend to anyone BAD PLACE TO WORK!
bad,a job givin to the young kids and the ones that has been there fro along time recive log count the freight that comes in there is nothing like it used to be were we had fun at work everybody is just do do do because i said so type place
bad,"I was CAP2, and there was a supervisor position open. One girl wanted it, so she started bullying the entire crew and me and a friend more specifically. I went to every member of management about it, and they just fired me instead of dealing with the bullying. They want you to just keep your head down and take it. I liked the job, but not when I'm getting singled out and bullied over practically nothing. Management encourages bullying and doesn't care about how you feel."
bad,walmart is almost infamous for its belittlement and treatment of its employees. i personally was made to stand at my register while customer screamed and threw things at me without help. i quit when a customer threw a basket at my face and left a bruise but walmart still wouldn't make changes to better the environment for its employees. i was cheated out of my raise and they bullied many people i worked with out of the job so they wouldn't have to pay severance.
bad,The customers were usually mean. Not enough workers used because worried about costs. I worked there a long time but glad I’m not there now they’re eie sure
bad,"People talk about you in dirty ways including some managers, having to do others work and still get in trouble for it, they hire lousy workers who don't do anything."
bad,"It's not a great place to work because of how they mistreat their employees. They will cut your hours down to nothing if they want you to leave. They will come up with excuses to fire you. Favoritism is a big problem, so if your nobody's favorite, your doing all the work no matter what department you go to. The list could go on forever. The pay is okay but your mental health is what will be paying the price."
bad,competitive in tire and lube. race like atmosphere for $8.50/hr. physical labor at fast pace. cut hours.  let me go right before christmas reason being my position was only temporary.
bad,"Pretty simple, really. Wal-Mart's business model hinges on massive turnover. They don't exactly like to spend money on training new people, but veteran employees present risk of unions, so the threat of firing is perpetually held over the head of most decent employees. Management is there to directly encourage/punish lack of compliance with company policy for the overall effect of giving off the appearance of compliance (or have hourly employees to blame if noncompliance is noticed by higher-ups). Absolutely nothing of merit whatsoever. No points for having a company-wide 11 dollar an hour minimum when Target did that a year earlier and it was leveraged in the name of encouraging employees to support tax cuts."
bad,Horrible company to work for. Extremely stressful you get written up for the most smallest things. they have mandatory overtime throughout the year so it’s hard to plan stuff on your normal days off
bad,"Not caring that I was bedbound sick with no voice and I had no one living with me to call in for me."
bad,"Training is a joke. They throw you in the deep end & tell you to improvise. Mgmt says all the answers are on the computer under one best way. But they Never, Ever will give you time away from your job to learn how to do your job."
bad,I worked five years with the company and was making the same amount of money as the person that was just hired. My specific store had a 100% turnover rate. Management doesn't want you to succeed they only want to advance themselves and earn their bonus. Training is a joke. They sit you in front of a computer and expect to know everything afterwards. DO NOT WORK FOR WALMART. You won't be able to provide for your family.
bad,"No tip just don’t apply  stay far away as much as u can , the ppl treat u like doo doo and nobody deserves that. They also love to favor people all the time"
bad,there are  not the best company to work for because their befits are not that great. you always have to work out side of your job description which can be a good thing but it Walmart case it is not because its a daily thing that tends to happen.
bad,Worst working environment for a employee no team work and the management no clue how to run a store or there employees always trying to fire someone they didn’t like
bad,There is never enough supplies to do our jobs. this makes it difficult to help customers in a productive way.There is never enough help for customers either.
bad,"Everyone I worked with had a terrible attitude, my manager was constantly changing my schedule without letting me know, so I always had to keep a very close eye on my schedule. I was constantly being forced to work on days I had classes to study and get my GED. You could have 4 unpaid/sick days off per 3 month period. The managers did not care about anything, constantly leaving while they're on the clock, and disappearing, they did not care about their employees. While working as a cashier, I got yelled at and had things thrown at me and got in trouble for stepping away to get a manager because no one responded to my calls. VERY terrible work place."
bad,"I was lucky not to work the day shift, since they are REQUIRED to attend a pep-rally start-of-day with clapping and singing/chanting Walmart slogans.  We were mostly minimum wage workers, we don't feel the ""love"".  My job as a truck unloader entailed showing up on time to set-up conveyor lines, pallets, and supplies to start the fast-paced work of merchandise unloading from a semi-truck, sorting into sections of pallets/carts, then stocking shelves of said merchandise.  Or unloading refrig trucks of chilled and frozen foods quickly, and putting foods away in already over-stocked backroom freezer or cooler.  I swear I spent half my day shuffling merchandise from one place to another place so I could put stuff away, or store it out of the way.  "
bad,Worst management team i have worked for. unprofessional and stressful place to work not to mention the unrealistic production goals. If you would like a job where you break your back this is the job for you
bad,"Its a horrible place to work management is messed up even if your nice to customers theres still a high possibility they'll ripe your head off, there is no fixed schedule and an orientation group (which is constantly a thing) coukd drop you from 30hours a week to 5 hours a week instantly. Unless you brown nose management its impossible to advance. All the bad stigma you here about working at walmart is true, even if your not one of those stupid people working at walmart customera are still going to treat you that way, through out my four years working here i have gotten close qith some of my csms and have been told way to much about what happens out on the floor as well as what happens in upper management and its a lot of horrible information, the whole company is so corrupt its insane. Everyday when I wake up i dread having to go in, it reaks havoc on your mental state its just a horrible place to work all over and I would never even recommend it to people i hate!!!!"
bad,"Walmart is a horrible place to work, but the benefits are good. Management has no clue how to run a store. The people that get promoted are suck ups and have no clue how to do their job."
bad,the people there was aways rude always said something mean about me always lied about things about me was never nice and just did not like how they treated me there.
bad,"The company is not going in a direction take the ""good news"" with a grain of salt. Don't work there. There are golf people but the bad management sucks your soul from you."
bad,"Management is horrible and not professional. Favorites run the company. Can work for the company for years and then they’ll find a way to fire so they can replace with a younger, starter for less pay and hours. Will pay minimum wage/part time but expect work done like you’re paid like the upper management/full time (in part-time time)"
bad,"Management there did not care about the well being of their associates. Good hard work would go unnoticed, while others who did very little work got recognized. The store manager was disrespectful, rude, targeted associates, has been reported many times by associates and customers for the disrespectful things she has done and still has her job. I will never work for Walmart again nor will I suggest a friend or family to work there."
bad,"Las jornadas laborales, son exhaustas."
bad,Walmart did not train me very well and they also did not inform me of the rules and regulations as far as tardies and sick days. I found out i was pregnant not long after getting the job and they didnt even give me a fair chance.
bad,"No benefits, horrible employee discounts, and disorganized management."
bad,Working 18 hours a day and being yelled at and talked down to like your not doing your job. Just to much negativity coming from the store manager. I worked for Walmart for 17 years and I was proud of my self the way I was moving up and I respect my old store manager but I was promoted to assistant and moved to my new store that’s when it all went down for me this store was always short assistant the associate attitude seemed like they where always made. I have all treated folks with respect but I couldn’t do it at my new store this was the worst 2 years of my life being a assistant. Because where step I took I was micro managed and your opinions didn’t matter.
bad,"The job alone was actually decent. I had no complaints over the duties I performed everyday such as scanning and bagging items, cleaning, restocking, etc. However the management in more than one walmart have been less than satisfactory. Many of the issues I had were managers not understanding or even easy to get ahold of. They have a probationary period but it means nothing to you. Even after they just fire you and allow the next person in line to take your place instead of paying the benefits. They dont take doctor notes for medical issues and wont work with you about medical leave. All in all, the job is perfectly fine and straight forward but the management drives people away."
bad,"Horrible place to work, management is poor and no room for growth. Was there for three years and never received a raise or a opportunity to move up"
bad,Not a good company to work for at all management dose not help you advance and favoritism runs rampid unless your full time expect to get no hours unless they fire out they can use and abuse you with emtpy promise's
bad,"i love to shop at Wal-mart but I absolutely despised working there. between the unprofessional management and rude customers, its not a healthy place to be i would never recommend anyone to work there !!!!"
bad,"Steer clear if all possible. Overworked and underpaid, no overtime, don’t trust the management, discounts on regular everyday prices, and not on any food items."
bad,"i was promised promotion after promotion and never got anywhere"
bad,As a cashier I was standing constantly for 5-6 hours with only a 15 minute break.  I required more rest time due to the nerve damage in my back.  I enjoyed the other associates I worked with but management is inexperienced and do not work together to assist their associates.
bad,Every manager at the wal-mart let their personal feelings effect work and how they treat others very unfair and unprofessional and just an overall messy staff reminded me of high school
bad,"Management gives you a new set of rules from corporate every few weeks, because someone has found a new way to make an easy job more difficult. Hours are cut without notification. Not enough people."
bad,Very bad management. Managers are racist and give privilege to only white employees. Too much humiliation every day. I left becosof of humiliation and racist behaviour. The non whites are pinned down with discipline but the whites with all attitude remains favourite. I will never come back and join this store again. The new manager came NAD she is also racist.
bad,Do Not work at Walmart. you will be over worked and under paid not a good place to work!!!! You will be bored. no employee appreciation. no employee voice
bad,Was not treated well in my area. left for better opportunity. Looking to have a better career as Walmart does not provide this. Looking for a chance to grow within my career field
bad,"My store had only 50% of the employees needed to fully staff the store.  As a result, as a Customer Service Manager, I was running from one end of the store to the other all the time.  AND I had to make sure shopping carts were always available.  I frequently had to go outside to get carts in the parking lot AND be responsible for getting change for cashiers and making sure we had enough cashiers at the registers.  It was too much for one person to do."
bad,I would never recommend working here over work the new paid I do not care about their employees at all And don't care if you sick or anything will fire you on the spot
bad,"if you are a hard worker, you don't get recognized you will get used and abused. You have to kiss up to management to get where you want. Management have their favorite Associates. It can be other cashiers working with you and you will be left alone with no help."
bad,I learned that walmart is like the army just as strict and not a good place to work. The most enjoyable part of my employment was my co workers. Management is way too strict and there is no leinency
bad,Poor choices made by management lead to unhappy employees. Poorly acting customers lead to unhappy employees. Rude customers and uneducated management lead to people leaving.
bad,needs better management... management did not know how to make schedules. Did not properly give hours out and did not work with employees in regards to schedules. I was being harassed due to being hurt at work..
bad,"Understaffed areas, underpayed employees, lazy associates, corrupt managers and low benefits."
bad,"in 2007 it was a good company, however once management changed  the employees where just that...disposable.  No full time employees to cut down on insurance I'm sure.  You can no longer get a full time job there."
bad,The walmart i was at was poorly run. I was severely overworked for the amount i was getting paid. There was 3 other people that shared the same job and management always moved them somewhere else so i did all their work. Often including lifting 200 pound boxes
bad,"If you enjoy watching the people of Walmart videos on youtube, go work at a store and find out all those videos are unstaged and modest compared to some of the nonsense you will see."
bad,"if you are just starting to work then i would work here."
bad,The management was absolutely terrible. The pay was worse. The customer were just as bad as the internet memes make Walmart shoppers out to be. Love shopping at Walmart but would never make it a career.
bad,I hated walmart still do.... worst job ever ..i worked in tle tec it was a fast paste job for low paste cost it was not a place i seen myself growing or deveping in alot of co workers didn't even do they job that ment i had to work harder
bad,"Walmart is a place to start for a week then leave, its not worth the hassle and the poor management and the people who shop there, the management caused more issues then the customers"
bad,They are mean and work u to bone i worked 50 plus hours and was fired being hospital for 14 days when i got out made work my hole shift than fired me my discharge paperwork did matter
bad,"Horrible work experience, managers don’t care about their staff at all... some staff have worked at Walmart for 10+ years and still can’t not receive full time .. they only give you hours when THEY NEED YOU not when you need them, they’ll find anything to give you a negative review about so at your 1 year review you don’t get a high raise, mine was 0.10 cents even tho I worked hard  every day, I did work managers should do and I did the work other teams were supposed to do and I got no appreciation"
bad,Wal-Mart doesn't care for its people. The mangers don't really care about you. They only think about themselves. They talk down to other associates...
bad,Walmart is a good job but it gets stressful at time and you have to have good patience and they will say they will work with your hours but reallly no
bad,"Store is horribly managed , would never work here again. Too much favoritisms, too many people out to get on another , bosses are sleeping with coworkers, workers are stealing but they fire people for putting a box on the wrong shelf, it’s like high school."
bad,I really don't recommend working at Walmart. It's stressful and demanding. Management is horrible and they say they'll work with you to keep your job but that don't.
bad,Managers there dont care what go on and they also do not work their department like they are supposed to do as so. They are always behind on catching up with things that have to be done for the store such as projects and managers are not even there most times. The managers do not pay attention to good work that their department associates have done or even thank them for doing their work 99.99% of the time. They take longer and more breaks than what they are supposed to and dojt get in trouble about it. When other associates are acting inappropriate like being sexual towards woman the manager let's them get away with it.
bad,"horrible managers "
bad,I worked for this company for 8 years and only got paid 11.87hr. yep .87 more than a new hire... I tried to go for higher positions and they wouldnt even interview me...but wanted me and many others to train the new employee... Management had their picks and sometimes was unreasonable....Look work there just for a temporary job... maybe while in college... dont make it a career.
bad,"During my time at Walmart, i was constantly upset, overworked, never heard, expectations were high  but never able to be met as there was no proper training."
bad,not a great place to work in a walmart pharmacy. no auxiliary help is given that is needed. long customer lines at the pharmacy. they clone you with their culture.
bad,Walmart is a very stressful job to work at. they need stop those time frames. some people are not fast enough & getting written up. I don't enjoy working at Walmart any more.
bad,Walmart is one of the worst places I have ever worked. 75% of the employees were rude and would always talk about other employees. it was like being in high school all over again.
bad,Sometimes it can be stressful. Just try to make the best of it. Put your best foot forward and keep working towards the main goal: providing good customer service.
bad,"As most people are aware of the soul leeching properties of retail work and ensuing side effects, such as dark humor and feeling dead inside. Walmart actually can be a good place to work if you work at the right store.If you don't though it is essentially a race to get out before the corporate domitor can bleed you dry of hope for any future."
bad,"No son humanos te humillan "
bad,"I would not recommend applying to Walmart to anyone. There’s no respect, no advancement, and no trust. Managers acted extremely immature and gave no room for explanation. They promised my job would be safe and then terminated me the next day."
bad,The management at the Estevan Walmart lacks many qualities that a good solid leadership should have. I had a very small job but was often asked to do others work when they were either slacking or hiding off. I was also sometimes forced by management to stay up to two hours after the store closed to clean and do jobs that others haven't.
bad,This was not a pleasant experience. The management was not friendly or forthcoming with information. Scheduled weren't posted on time and it was usual to find out you were working the day you were scheduled to work
bad,"Terrible place to work. Management was never around to help or give direction, only when big supervisors  came they would act kind and friendly. Never had the correct amount of people in department to help work."
bad,Did not Like nothing to tell did not like this company it was  a job that provided for the time in which I was there. Management has lack of knowledge and work ethic this job is not for anyone that has a family or small children.
bad,"Low pay, growing workloads without added time to perform. Poor organization in store, low staff morale, working 9 days in a row at this wage was unacceptable."
bad,"Horrible management both local and corporate, toxic environment because manager broke multiple ethics policies and probably even violated the law and when i reported to upper management and HR nothing was done about it"
bad,"The Management is awful and incompetent, they have no concern for their employees and are only interested in bringing in the largest profit. The work culture feels like something out of the cold war, as you have other employees actively spying on you while you eat to see if you say or do anything against policy. I have learn't absolutely nothing of value and the only thing I have gained from working at Walmart, was back issues because they provide nothing to protect their employees from injury. If you ever have the misfortune of working here then look for another job immediately because it is awful."
bad,"The management sucks, I enjoyed the people I worked with and made lots of friends. But management was horrible. They did get rid of the big boss there and I heard it was a little bit better. And it pays okay for the area. But still I would only use it as a last resort"
bad,Unfriendly  working environment bad management liked waiting on customers I am a people person but my favorite employment would be working with the elderly
bad,I don't have much to say about Walmart im currently employed at kingfood saver. But id like to get on at the hatchery in Butterfield mo. Walmart doesn't teat ppl right.
bad,The pay is ok but they do not give very many hours. Time off is strictly impossible to get approved. The company is poorly managed and communication is definitely lacking.
bad,"managers or unprofessional and non responsive to employee needs, coworkers were good but the customer base is difficult.  hours are assigned with little predictablity"
bad,Worst job I had 7400 Rivers Ave the mangers treat you like children and the pay it’s worth the headache. I like my coworkers but the leadership isn’t what you look for in a company like Walmart.
bad,Working for Walmart will always be a hit or miss. Unless your in dire need of a job I'd recommend looking somewhere else and save yourself the disrespect the company has for it's employees.
bad,The store works on favoritism and only specific managers do their jobs and that is rare.The promises made are always just a lie. Only certain things get verified when it should be following policy.
bad,"Walmart was just a job at the time to get through college.  There was no mentorship to encourage advancement.  Hardly any raises were given, and the healthcare hardly covered anything."
bad,Bad management bad communication skills not a happy about their ability to appreciate the employees. Work doesn’t suppose too be stressful environment. I pursued another job with better pay
bad,I worked for Walmart for 7 years and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone that wasn't wanting to go anywhere in life. I went from working 40 hours a week down to 15 after 7 years.
bad,"Walmart Managers always complained about their job, never are able to help any associates complete a job they may have assigned to them, and had no desire to help anybody else move up in the company."
bad,"This job was stressful and the management sucked they dont take s"
bad,"First off... this was my first job ever, so at first i though it was cool to work here. but the older i got, the more and more i started to realize that it got really boring and repetitive"
bad,It was a very fast paced place to work. The coworkers were rude and they always called out. They didn't want to give us a raise and our bonuses we're every 4 months and we never got them if they store didn't make any money.
bad,"Was able to do things for customers by cooking foods and interacting with them. Being able to talk to customers was a highlight of my days, knowing that I could make a difference was a good feeling."
bad,They will pick on you every chance they get. The management was awful. Low pay. They chose favorites. They never put you first. They would always call you on your days off and ask you to come in and work and if you didn't they would get very angry.
bad,It's not very open minded. Snooty and unprofessional. They don't follow procedure correctly. When you get close to having full time or benefits they cut your hours so you don't qualify. They are overall an awful place to work.
bad,The job at Walmart really wasn’t good or bad the management was horrible though and the employees would steal all the time my goodness ... but they all lower it
bad,"I was told that to be promoted , I had to work for walmart for 90 days or more. I was looked over for lack of procedure. There is no regard for mankind. The treatment to employees , we should just be robots."
bad,Terrible all together . Management does not care at all so don’t think they do. Favoritism is crazy at Walmart. They say it’s all about moving up when it’s really not
bad,"If you have any medical issues, do not work here. I was almost fired for going to the ER due to a serious asthma attack. Would regularly schedule me outside of availability and not give me days off needed for my doctors appointments. They also fired my friend due to his epilepsy."
bad,"managers are self centered, egotistical, uncaring.  more concerned with their own paycheck than helping a ground level associate to succeed. My time there was the most stressful period in my life."
bad,Managment is poor  and will treat you as such. It’s a everyone looks out for themselves place. Managment does not care about your well being at all. Do not work for Moscow Walmart
bad,"Management is poor, they treat everyone like dog poo including their own management teams. We are expected to do too much with too little associates to help. Customer service is terrible."
bad,worst job ever....if you value your self respect find a different company to apply to your just a number at Walmart they don't care if they work you to the bone it is expected!!!!!
bad,"I worked here and I hate it, the managers are cruel, and don't take care of their people, I was shorted on hours, they dont care about the small guy or girl."
bad,"The work is great if you want to work. I learned how no one cares about the job, how the coworkers say ^ this is not my part of the job^. The management is worthless doing noting, with the hands in the pockets  walking around the store. The culture was ok, some of them with complexes . I loved my job."
bad,"dont work there not enough people , they pay paid time off, no holiday pay and they will find any reason to fire you, management is bad, lack of ny help"
bad,Every Wal-Mart I worked at had upper management that was on a power trip. Some good people but for the pay the stress is not worth it. Still if you're in a pinch and can't find anything else it's pretty easy work.
bad,worst job i ever had no management skills required to be a department manager you just have to be a favorite to co- managers no dress code 4 times to be late
bad,"Very lazy workers, not enough hours only work up to 10+ hours. Wouldn't recommend to anyone. Walmart in my eyes should be a good job for anyone looking to go into retail but its the complete opposite."
bad,It's walmart! They dont care about anything except sales. Look at the stores they have. Even the brand new built ones are gross cuz they just dont care. They need more customer service training
bad,"This was an okay place to work, I think that they sometimes overwork their cashiers when I worked there.  I would not recommend this as a good place to work."
bad,"Very unpredictable"
bad,"would not recommend Walmart as a job for anyone. a lot of back stabbing, if you don't fit in you have no chance of moving up in the company. will work you to death with lack of appreciation"
bad,"Pushing carts in all types of weather was a daily day at walmart. Most of the time you were alone, due to poor management control, and would have to maintain the entire lot yourself.  The only Enjoyable part about this job was my lunch break and when I left to go home."
bad,"Work load was over barring, No training, forced to stop working to do others work as they watched, dangerous work environment many broken and deadly objects where forced to be used repairs to walls and items were cheap and not up to regulations, forced to work through breaks then finned and wrote up for it"
bad,Stocked the store and load the trucks and unload the trucks and greet the customers and sometimes help the cashier but most of all make sure the store is stocked up and the trucks are loaded and unload
bad,"A typical day at work was always being watched, overworked, talked down to,and not at all appreciated for the work that I did. The Management there was so horrible. The workplace culture was at it's worst. The hardest part of the job was having to do your own cardboard. The most enjoyable part of the job was the breaks."
bad,They treat you like they want that to be your career instead of treating u as if u want to move on with your life such as school liscence and other opportunities
bad,I really don't have anything good to say about my experience while working at Walmart. They never had enough people to work the 3rd shift. Always had to stay past the alloted time even though the day shift was already there.
bad,"Typical day at work would be overwhelming, if you work overtime the company takes it back at the end of the week. Not enough help, poor management overworked and underpaid. No discounts on groceries until Thanksgiving and Christmas."
bad,The management shows favoritism. If I have an opportunity to find something better I will leave in a quickness. They don't give every one the same opportunity. I don't have a problem with completing my task it's the people that make you not want to return. Worse job ever my opinion.
bad,"Management did not how to handle people. Difficult peopel to work with."
bad,The management was rude and disrespectful. worked me over 40 hours. but did pay for break and lunch . sometimes i had to skip break to finish ringing people up.
bad,"Rules are inconsistent, you have to be friends with hr or certain managers to be treated fairly. Women are worked hard than men. Schedule can and will change without notice."
bad,Horrible it was the worst place I’ve worked at management were some bullies and power highs and they don’t help the newly hired overwall my experience was again horrible
bad,I don't recommend this job over worked and underpaid.but everyone is different other people may like working at this place it just wasn't for me so I moved on.
bad,Don’t recommend working at Walmart .. management does not care about there employees and has a lot of favoritism for people there who work in the aRea . I was a top order filler and load and hauler and friends or others close to management got privileges over the high pullers
bad,"Bad atmosphere, incompetent management/employees. Would not recommend to anybody. "
bad,Walmart is probably the worst company to work for. Upper management only comes out when corporate is there and then takes credit for everything that you have done.
bad,Not a bad it has a lot that needs to be updated.  A lot needs to changed and the open door policy doesn't really work when management is one sided; with the exception of a few good managers.
bad,dont work at walmart unless you are offered the position of CEO. Even high level managers are subject to termination on unjust grounds. not a fun environment.
bad,every one how work at walmart at like teen in high school. if you where not part of a group you where a threat to to every one job. manager picked  favorite.
bad,"I had a horrible experience as a seasonal employee due to the fact I was being pressured into sending my kid to daycare, not getting any sleep, and taking care of my younger sister who couldn't drive much due to her foot injury."
bad,"Although it paid my bills, Walmart turned out to be one of the less decent companies to work for.  Walmart offers health benefits and vacation time for long-term or full time employees.  Also Vison and Dental.  I would have to say that Walmart has questionable ethics practice and negative customer feedback."
bad,"Management likes to retaliate against it's employees. No job security."
bad,There is no communication between management and associates. No one is ever on the same page. You never get lunches and breaks on time. They do not accept doctors notes unless you have protected sick pay to cover the absence. Management is never available. Never make thieves accountable and never consistent shifts.
bad,I worked the overnight shift which overnights are bad enough. I also only got Tuesdays and Wednesdays off which meant I never and I mean never saw any friends or family and would never get weekends off when I asked for them which meant I was the only person I had any social contact with. The work itself isn't hard but this job will take a major tole on your mental health especially if you have seasonal depression. You'll only get 2% raises and that's for everyone no matter how hard you work. You'll get off when the sun rises and will never be able to get a good night's sleep. You'll never get to partake in any events be them town family or friends. You'll have no life no friends and you'll become a loner. And you won't even be able to advance or get decent raises ever. Walmart is a no no.
bad,"I was a toy asscosiate, and they made it an effort to run me all across the store. People I would of never met knew my name because it was constantly over the  intercom. With that being said they would get mad because my toy aisle looked like trash, yet they would call me to push buggies and pull merchandise and fix other people's aisles and it was overwhelming. They caused me to have a mental breakdown when all I was trying to do was get out of a rough situation in my life."
bad,"worst job ever. poor management, inventory, and floor crew. no one helped anyone. very poor customer service. If overtime was gained, you were required to take time off."
bad,"Typically, Managers give realistic options to employees, but when at wal-mart they tend to see you as a means to an end rather than a person. many tasks ran me thin, leaving me extremely stressed and unhappy going to work. It was not worth the minimum wage they gave."
bad,Not at all flexible with hours even though they said they can do flexible hours. They like to forget your breaks so sometimes you can be standing for 6-8 hours before you get a break. Management likes to belittle you and bully you. Nice and caring cashier though
bad,It's ok but a typical day. It's tough to keep up with the management as they don't communicate with each other but expects you know everything with lack of training.
bad,I would never work for Walmart ever again. The co-workers for the most part was very fun to work with but I could not stand the management team. I will not be working for Walmart again.
bad,Its a job if you need a paycheck otherwise there is nothing good about working for walmart you will never get anywhere or make any kind of money go elsewhere
bad,"Harassment by upper management is common, retaliation is common, ethics does not follow up on complaints. Underpaid and lied to, job threatened when I discovered this fact. Changing of hourly schedules after posting without notifying associates. Routine OSHA violations. Unsecured electrical controls, blocking of propane cage with electric displays, attempts to refuse water to outdoor associates, refusal of team lifts on large items, expired ple licenses used, broken items not properly locked out or tagged out, sometimes still in use. Paranoid managers harass employees for using work phones or computers to do work related jobs, for fear of being reported. Managers cannot spell even when typing a word document. Cannot write clear directions, market mandated retraining as a result, still aggressive when asked followup questions."
bad,"horrible and worthless day at work"
bad,"I took up a job at Walmart thinking it would work with my other job (one where i only worked about 10 hours a week at oddball times). I went through the long training process, and was constantly reassured by my Trainer that they would work with me on scheduling for my second job. WRONG. I was scheduled 2pm - 11pm every day. I was exhausted by the time I got home, slept and had to do it all over again the next day. On days I had to work at my first job I was WROTE UP for not being able to go to walmart. With my position, I was required to stand my entire shift - answering phones. The trash coworkers I had made fun of each other, me included. I was wrote up a day i had to rush home sick - I was throwing up with a migraine. After about 2 months of working there my trash manager had the audacity to call me and tell me he was firing me for my write-ups. They claim they have a ""3 strike you're out"" policy. So much for working with my schedule."
bad,"Management constantly contradicting each other, shifts were there was no supervisor, they’d pull you off of a job to do another than complain you didn’t get the first job done."
bad,"Everyone's hours have been cut where I work and they do not care about their employees. It's a nightmare and my hours are inconsistent at best. There's a lot of micromanaging and passing the buck that goes on, too. One day I work a full 8 hours and the next I work 7. Some days I start at 10AM, other days - I start at 1:45PM. NO RAISES!!! ALSO... NO holiday pay. I worked on Thanksgiving for straight pay, same with all the other holidays... just straight time. Horrible company to work for and does nothing for economy."
bad,I absolutely hated this job.  Walmart is not a good employer and I would never recommend anybody to work there.  Corporate environment is not good and they could care less about their employees.
bad,One of the worst places I've worked at with some of the worst management out there. My coworkers were the only reason I didn't quit sooner. Management absolutely does NOT care about the average worker and will write you up for any little mistake you make. Very strenuous work for very little pay.
bad,"made up write ups, inconsistent management, terrible hours some employees received no hours for several weeks. this company can be described as a modern day slave monger"
bad,"This was not the job for me "
bad,This has to be one of the worst places to work for they don’t care about their employees. If you get sick better have pto to cover or you’ll get fired. God forbid you end up in the hospital unless you have it in with management.
bad,"I had to take this company to the Labour Board just to get my final pay. The company was determined to be in the wrong, I'm now blacklisted from Re-Hire Permanently."
bad,"i would never go back to that place, even if i was homeless i will file unemployment before i go back. i only learned to work the handheld and csm work. Management sucks."
bad,Management only cares about themselves not their employers! Made a lot of good friends though but never made enough money. There was never any benefits of working at Walmart
bad,They are a horrible company to work for always on me about something dumb always rushing me giving me to many tasks at once poor poor manament and the store manager is horrible. Just worse working experience here
bad,I can honestly say working graveyard shifts are made so certain people. It was an 24 hour Walmart so while we were restocking the shelves we also had to help customers with questions. Management was great at making sure you were in your area in time and would make sure you had all your assignments done.
bad,"This was the most horrible work experience I have ever had.  I never felt less valued as a truly hardworking associate. I experienced discrimination, nepotism and favoritism. I was systematically robbed of career advancement  and met with the deaf ears of store level and upper management, when I attempted to defend myself. This company is suffering from a lack of REAL LEADERSHIP FROM THE TOP DOWN and continuation down this path will yield certain demise!"
bad,"Everyone was quitting including my boss, and it  was just to unorganized. They wanted one man to work a team job and expect him to do it with no excuses"
bad,Walmart Management lacks management skills toward employee's. It feels more like a labor camp than a job. Management training and people skills are nonexistent
bad,"If I was told before working for this company that it feels like your soul has been sucked dry, I would of not even applied. I worked for them only to realize under the sheer innocent face of the Walmart company, lays a harrowing horror that not many should face. Not all Walmarts are bad, but many need to be looked at. I worked for them and worked very hard. However, they will fire you for anything and everything under the sun or not put you on the schedule at all."
bad,"Drama filled, managers cause so many issues that you cant even come with them with a problem without them biting your own head off. dont even look you in the eye, just snort and go to typing"
bad,"Working here was random, one day i had hours the next I didn't. My schedule was all over the place, from mornings to nights, working on the register to in the back stocking. I never knew what I was getting and management did not care about you and never resolved the issues. Every weeks we would see less and less changes to help us with living."
bad,I was a very busy worker I always got my work complete at a reasonable timely fashion and was able to help others when I was done with my work. They loved me there customers and managers.
bad,Working for walmart wasnt the worst but the majoirty of my fellow associates wanted to shoot themselves so I decided to attain a skill and work somewhere that people are motivated to work at
bad,Hostile work environment and poor management. Retaliation and favoritism. They run off great help and treat managers poorly. Lots of micromanagement by upper management.
bad,"It's a good temporary job, but for long term I wouldn't consider it. They refused to give more hour even when I was down to four hours a week. What it really needs is a new set of managers that know how to talk to people professionally."
bad,"Walmart isn’t a good place to work. They honestly do not care about there associates. I complained about multiple things when I worked there and nothing was done about it. I wrote a report me and a manager did about a threat that was made to me by a co worker and to this day she still is there. I recently left that job because I was being told I was going to be watched because I was taking to long on my “breaks.” I left for many MANY reasons. I do not recommend this job, if anything the managers need to be looked into and something needs to be done about what goes on there."
bad,Bad place to work bad management a lot of work to do and not payed enough and lunch one hour and no over Time and the management bad people to work with
bad,"Company cares more about a bottom line then its employees. This company could flourish if it went back to caring for its employees and not a dollar. They are behind the times and has gone steadily down hill over the years. If you like being lied to, manipulated and controlled this is the place for you, if not keep on looking."
bad,"Poorly managed, very low employee morale, as a whole a very disappointing career experience. Left for better career opportunities and was told one thing and completely the opposite was what they provided."
bad,"Wal-Mart sucks, I really do not feel the need to go into detail about a job that I hated, I had a family and financial obligations , and as a single mother we do what we have to do to take care of our families."
bad,management has no respect for their coworkers. you are under payed I will never work at Walmart again or a sales job there are no enjoyable part of working for Walmart
bad,Walmart is unfair and is not a good company to work for you don't get paid for working on the holidays you do not receive discounts on everything you buy. Some managers suck.
bad,"I was not happy working for Walmart. I felt as if they overworked their employees for the little pay that they made. I believe people stay there because of the stability and if they have a chance to move up, there may be a better outcome or experience."
bad,"Poor communication"
bad,"Walmart is diminishing hours of associates, has unfair work practices, over looks qualified canidates, doesn't have any work life balance if you intend to move up."
bad,"Good workers are treated unfairly and poor performance workers treated good. Management is demeaning, unprofessional and talk down to associates. "
bad,It's a cutthroat company to work for. Ypu're underpaid and underappreciated in a hostile work environment. Most employees are set up to get fired immediately after being hired. There's way too much inter office gossiping constantly at play. No one's monitering the mismanagement of regular employees and all managers are pressured too get rid of hardworking employees and promote their favorites. The entire operation is in dire need of new management direction towards regular employees.
bad,"The amount of disrespect in terms of professionalism, verbal abuse, unethical treatment, and unrealistic job expectations is very disappointing to say the least.  Co-Managers and Store Manager are lazy, experience and work ethic of 1/2 of the Assistant Managers is a joke.  How the upper level management in the store addressed the hourly associates behind closed doors is downright demeaning.  Corporate management does not spend enough time in stores to see the problems, and behavior of the store level leadership.  So much potential, and so many good people, it is a real problem for the company that it is all being thrown away."
bad,pay was low. the work was easy. the management was fair for the most part.. better money can be made elsewhere .Many of my co workers wouldn't show up for there shift.
bad,They hire you on a temporary basis without informing you. I was only part time but would beg for more hours. Sometimes your lucky and someone calls in.
bad,"Worse place to work "
bad,It was an awful job to work for made me feel miserable i hated it and the managers were jerks too many restrictions for an employee and is not a good employee friendly place
bad,I would not recommend anybody working for this company! The management is poor. People don't take their jobs seriously. No training provided. Benefits wasn't even worth paying for.
bad,"It is very hard to move up in the company and they don't think about their associates family life. I'm usually working all the time when my kids are home and they cry everyday when I leave for work and when I ask for a day or two off it always seems like ""there's no coverage"". If my job is that difficult that they can't train more people to do it so I can have a day with my family I need to be getting paid more. My family means more than anything to me and I will quit my job if it means that I can't see them. And as far as moving up, I've been training for a higher position for about 6 months now being promised that when the next available position opens up it's mine. Well a position opened up and they decided to hire a girl who was a CSM five years ago as a cashier just to get her foot in the door, and they're putting her on the ""fast track"" to become a CSM and bypassing me. They should've told her the same thing they told me. When a position. Opens up it's yours. I'm done with this company."
bad,Management was poor and did not pay attention to their employees. Did not discipline employees who needed it and did not pay close attention to see the employees that excelled greatly. Managers are not good and comforting to go to when you have a problem that needs to be fixed.
bad,"Soul crushing work and refuse to pay over time"
bad,communication is poor. on a day to day basis i found that none of the management knew what anyone else was doing and would constantly undermine each other. overall morale is poor and trust is almost non existent
bad,"I spent a year working at the Walmart in Pierre where I did 1.8 million dollars in sales basically by myself for them to argue to give me pto to deal with a sick realitive then from there they try to replace my job while I'm burrying that realitive asking for help was a joke and I had $240,000 in merchandise over the years before DM for toys promises of help didn't come at the beginning of November when I was told it would happen honestly it took them believing that I was going to leave to get that help two weeks before Christmas which is sad that I have to leave because they don't act like they want me there or even take who I am into consideration so no I don't recommend the Walmart in Pierre SD as a place for employment"
bad,"This is hands down the worst company to work for, they say everyone is replaceable, and they mean it, from store mangers to sales associates, no one has job security! They treat employees so poorly."
bad,customers are rude staff is under to much stress never enough staff to properly run the front end. Many nights i would come in and deal with angry customers would ask for help and  rarely received it.
bad,Management is rude and very mean they will not help or listen do not work for Walmart horrible experience which is why I’ve been trying to find a new job
bad,We were blamed for a broken safety light that was broken for years before I started there. We were then told we had to carry tires up the stairs I hurt my back and was promptly fired.
bad,no review company do not pay employees fare salary work you hard management just wanted. no consideration for the employee they just want the lines to be moved
bad,"While I was working I was terminated shortly after having a grand mal siezure. They told me this would not effect my working conditions, and niether the fact of medications. I was termininated under the ruling of being too slow of a worker. So after being told that my medication would not affect my job disposotion I get fired two weeks after having a grand mal siezure, and I get told its because I was too slow of a worker. They based an opinion and terminated me knowing I take  medications that make slow and lethargic. I would not reccomend anyone with a disablity to try, and find or look for a job at walmart."
bad,"They really don't care of you . They take everything from you  , don't expect them top help you if you are injured or a family matter , Very stressful place to work for ."
bad,"They expect you to work beyo d what yo,u are capable of, the managers tell you what to do and give you not enough time to do it. Stocking some things were heavy."
bad,I was young when i worked for walmart so they had me pushing carts.  I wanted to work inside but after 6 months of doing the job I asked when could I have a job in the store and I was told 6 more months I left.
bad,"I did not like them and the managers were very cold and unsympathetic and unhelpful! treat you like dog meat or worse  not very sympathetic"
bad,"Wal-Mart is the most unpleasant retail experience I have ever had!! They are extremely unorganized. Management just hides in their offices or the cash room. They do not stand up for their employees no matter how abusive a customer behaves. The hours are horrible, weekends and holidays too. Pay is awful and benefits expensive. Nothing positive to say"
bad,"A lot of drama amongst coworkers constantly would happen. Managers/supervisors belittled their staff regularly. Purposefully had hours shortened so they didn’t have to give benefits, apparently not uncommon of them to do."
bad,"This company pays well, good benefits but does not have work life balance, long hours. Management sets unrealistic goals and expectations for longer ."
bad,i have nothing good to say about this company they treat us with no respect plus no chance to grow in this company and i've done nothing but my job but to them its never good
bad,Working for walmart was not a very pleasant place to work at employees were treated like dirt and thieves over worked underpaid walmart doesnt allow for unionization any thought of employees wanting to unionize and they fire eveyone and close the store
bad,They say that they believe in respect for the individual but don't practice what they say they believe. I have worked there since 1997 and have seen the good culture of respect for the individual thrown out over the saving of a few dollars. Human Capital lost due to the misguided actions to save money; through overworking of good people to the point of making a stressful environment.
bad,"Its walmart, they treat all their employees like garbage!"
bad,This place is a horror to work for. Management does not care about employees or customers. Treat night crew better than day and night members do not do their jobs.
bad,"Sups yell at cashiers; do not respond for customer aid; rarely work when busy unless big bosses in store; treat cashiers as though beneath them; upper management fires excellent personnel employee and moves outstanding front end manager only to replace with ""nose-in-the-air"" young person who never speaks to the ""underlings"". Too much negative change. Customers even comment on how poorly employees are treated."
bad,this was my 1st job and it was the most awful job I have ever had I wasn't trained properly I was just thrown in the toy department I didn't know how to bin or do inventory wasn't taught but was expected of me the managers were mean and would yell for every little reason the pay wasn't even worth all the hassle I would never ever work for a Walmart ever again.
bad,Management dont care about you and they believe customers over employees. Told no full time yet there is . Was told I would be promoted and that didn't happen. The worst managed business ever.
bad,No one knows what they are doing. Everyone is running around with their heads up their arses. One manager says to do something then another comes up and says no go do this. Then they like to change your schedule without telling you and you get a no show no call.
bad,They allowed people to bully others even when you go to higher management they don't care. The hours I worked were nice until i was not able to come in on my day off. they cut me down to 14 hours after i was promised full time by management.
bad,"Horrible place to work, unfair treatment by managers and other employees also favoritism is and seems to be recognized as their number one achievement also is making yourself look busy instead of actually doing work and being busy."
bad,"Full of rumours even personnel gossiped about associates"
bad,Management is horrible.  I worked there for seven and a half years.  My day usually consisted of starting my regular job and then getting called to do a lot of other things including finding my coworker who kept disappearing.  Complaints were filed and nothing was done.  I lived 45 minutes away and it got to the point where I was given four and a half hours 4 days a week.  Not enough for gas.  It was nothing for me to cover 6 departments at a time.
bad,"Walmart is a non-family culture for associates. If you have a sick child and you have no call off days left, they will let your child suffer and die before they have human compassion, not to mention the fact that the biggest Walmart sin is to unionize for higher wages! Worked for them for 2.5 years, hated evry minute of it but didn't have options to leave."
bad,"Would never work for walmart again. After giving them 10 years of my life, they decided that I didn't deserve a raise or even an advancement in my job title. Over night managers are a joke, always looking down others that aren't in same title as them."
bad,Walmart  is the worst place to work at.... Management is horrible the pay sucks and they don't offer overtime....Walmart is ran by disrespectful racist people that pick and choose  who they like and don't like.
bad,"I worked for Walmart as an Assistant Manager for almost 10 years.  As a manager, you are treated like a door mat.  You’re expected to work 50 to 70 hrs per week with no appreciation for your hard work.  You constantly have to watch your back because the environment is so cut throat that anyone will throw you under the bus to protect themselves.  My self esteem was so low that I didn’t realize that I could work anywhere else and actually get treated like a human being.  I should have left a long time ago and I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND WORKING FOR THIS COMPANY TO ANYONE"
bad,The management was extremely rude for little to no reason at all mostly every day. I didn’t have a day that I didn’t leave work mad and I am extremely confident that I was one of the best workers on my team.
bad,Do yourself a favor and go to Walmart. Look at the employees that are working. If they have a smile on there face it's probably because there about to quit
bad,"N/A"
bad,"Probably one of the worst jobs I’ve had, needed money and I liked my co workers but management sucked. And my house it’s didnt cover my bills. It takes a certain type of person to work there"
bad,"Great Corporation, heartless I.T. abuse of SMEs."
bad,Making sales is the entire goal of the management. Customers are routinely the forefront of priorities even if they are committing criminal acts within the store.
bad,"I work with Wal-mart for three years, changing management was not productive, although i have noticed recently they have changed stocking procedures (from shopping there) not at all employee driven"
bad,Would never recommending anyone to work for the company. They do not take care of the employees and management is horrible. You work long hours and barely get time off.
bad,"Over worked, under paid, and the company is totally mis-managed.  They lie, steal, and cheat their employees.  take of benefits and do not provide them, promise deferred profit sharing, then take it back when you leave.  People are not promoted on merit, instead they are promoted on stupidity."
bad,"I will continuously tell anyone who ask that walmart was my worst job ever. From the awful folks in management to the messy coworkers, I'd say the customers were the only good part of the job. The pay was not worth it in the slightest and management expects you to do everything that is not in your job description. Your coworkers expect you to do their job as well as your own and no one wants to help anyone else."
bad,"Blatant Favortism.  No room for achievement on hard work, experience, or knowledge; It's who you are besties with.   Bullying tactics regularly used every day, especially if you come with 15+ years of previous retail experience."
bad,Walmart is not a good place to work its a stressful environment due to the competitive people and racist management. they have favoritism and over work there staff while others sit and steal company time
bad,Management don't care about you at all. was given 40 hrs a week part-time and when i asked to receive part - time hours like i was promised they politely told me to go screw or quit.
bad,got sick at wok couldn't work in a fast task told the manager that i wasn't feeling good that's why i couldn't get my work done fast he wrote me up didn't care at all my daughter had to get me from work to take me to the ER that was my typical day at work. Managers don't care how you feel as long as you get the work done so they can get all the credit. The hardest part of the job was that they pull out so many pallets out on the floor and give you a time that the work need to be done. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people.
bad,The managers didn’t back you up. Over worked and under paid. Didn’t want to give you time off when needed. Too much drama in the workplace. Management would lie to you about new policies coming out that they new about.
bad,"Walmart was a okay place to work , the pay was good for a grocery store and hours varied.  The employees are fun to work with and some managers were too ."
bad,probably the worst job I have ever had in my life. I wouldn't go back to that place. The management team didn't care about their staff and just thinking about my experience there gives me the chills.
bad,management was so bad at times my typical day at work was short no hours nothing was hard about the job the work place was a great place to work area was awesome
bad,Lets just say this job and I did not mix well. They kept messing my hours putting me on shift while I was supposed to be in classes and telling me to quit college so I could work more.
bad,I would not return to work for Walmart. working for Walmart was the worst place I worked at regarding customer service. the work place was so stressful it put me into early labor at 33 weeks while at work and they wouldn't let me leave until i called 911 my leave of absence was denied and because I was going to be off for so long they fired me even though I just had a baby.
bad,Management is subpar to say the least. I felt as though certain aspects of the job could've been held to a higher standard such as cleanliness and organization.
bad,Walmart is a terrible place to work at. Everything about it is terrible. The managers could care less about you and you rarely ever get to change positions. Everyone is rude.
bad,The summary describes it all. The associate you work with will be great but the management at this location is awful. If the most of the assistant managers were changed honestly this would be at better location to work at.
bad,Walmart had terrible management. It was catered to one group of people more so than others. They do not offer overtime and if they do u have to give it back by the end of the pay period.
bad,"Although it was several years ago when I worked at Wal-Mart, my friends that are still there have said that management still wants ""more work for less pay""  and that management is still late on giving breaks and lunch breaks.  If you received a raise, it would be $0.05 and hour."
bad,"Walmart intentionally creates an 1800's Slave worked Plantation atmosphere.  You can be terminated for taking your scheduled lunch 5 minutes late even if you are helping a customer. Store and Department  Managers typically are disrespectful to associates and are not required to have a socialized character. I refer to Walmart as Ghetto-Mart."
bad,"Horrible.  I wouldn't work here again to save my Life.  Worst job on the planet.  Shopping there is better than working there, and we all know how bad that is, always."
bad,"it is a stocking job, if you have the ability to work by yourself in your area, and get your stuff done, you are a generally good worker as management sees you,"
bad,the worse job i have ever worked. One of the poorest company's out there. No training and they do not follow there own policy. Many cut through people there. Management are no where to be found and do not acknowledge when they make a mistake instead they blame other people.
bad,Not much to say if you need a job fast its for you. Your never respected over worked and under staffed. Straight out of high school needed a job and Walmart was the place GO TO SCHOOL!
bad,"management was prejudice and racist, no other comments need to be made, The duties were as expected but there were not enough people to complete the work in a efficient manner."
bad,"Lack of scheduling and coverage, unable to learn new skills due to limited time and resources. Management is very poor. No flexible scheduling and poor benefits."
bad,"Over worked and under paid, At least in the automotive department.  past paced and you put up with a lot of bull, mostly from the managers that think they know everything. Can not except tips for services."
bad,"I hated working at Wal Mart. It was unprofessional and you always had to work extra hours due the checkout lines being long. Therefore, you had to stay over just to check out some the customers when you're shift was already over."
bad,"the discount was a perk to the job, and the benifits if you worked full time. but other than that they are not willing to work with yiou if you have an illness and get sick and have to leave work."
bad,"The employees are all rude and not helpful at all, the managers are rude and only care about themselves, treat their employees like second class citizens."
bad,"Horrible work environment!!! Sweat shop mentality!! Managers are horrible!! Racist!!! They treat Blacks like there in a penitentiary!! No talking??? What?? No laughing??? What??? They use you up!! Then after that,use you sum more!!! Clean house!!! HR is not on ur side! They suck too!! Managers sleeping with employees!! Is this ok?? Smh"
bad,"this place was not a good place to work, they would mess with your hours so you don't get full-time hours. They would cut your hours in half. The managers had their favoitors. Some manager made it hard to work there"
bad,as a department manager a typical day at work is working under stressful conditions with not enough help and not enough pay for all the responsibility with more an more work being put on you with many conditions to meet. management is very disrespectful and tries to use intimidation and threats of being coached and fired if work is not completely done. the hardest part of the job is working with upper management. not having the help to complete all tasks. being bullied by upper management. hardest part is seeing other employees being mistreated and their work day being fear based work which in turn takes away any enjoyment. the staff lies constantly to everyone. i love to customers and making great sales. walmart is a culture of its own and everyone is in a low vibration level and seems to want everyone else to be this way. i worked there 8 years and so wished i had put all that time in to a company that values its employees and gives them great tools to accomplish great things with in the company. I believe the employees are as great as the management.
bad,"Most of managment is corrupt,godless ,and out to get paid above all . That's all they and this company cares about MONEY.They have no morals and no""ethics""as they claim to have.No core values,nothing at all.They treat subordinates like trash.And they don't even do their jobs very well at all . Disrespect to the individual, Disservice to the customer,Act without integrity (always) and Just barely do your job.Thats Wal-Mart."
bad,It was a really bad place to work as an employee. You have to make a close friend to the managers to get anywhere at Wal-Mart. If you don't you will be stuck in a dead-end job forever.
bad,Awful work place and won't ever go back. Management is cut throat and acts like you are supposed to know everything they want you to do but they do not tell you want they even want from you.
bad,"Mangers and DM's belittle you in front of customers."
bad,"I was Over worked and under paid, at work for 10 hours a night 40+ hours a week, with no overtime pay and still considered part time, it was stupid and I was treated terribly"
bad,Management at Berlin Walmart lacked communication with other managers and staff. Would not listen to lower management or normal staff or the people who have to stock the shelves.
bad,The Walmart DC if awful. I do not recommend not only will it tear your family apart if you are honest you will get fired. If you mess up once on accident and admit it you will get fired. The managers only care about themselves and if you’re not in a click you’re easily targeted. This is a terrible place to work please save your self and your family from all the awful people who work there. If you’re good at lieing you will be fine. Any honest person trying to make a living and be a better person will get fired.
bad,At first working for Walmart was actually good but things took a turn when managers who had poor social skills and were irresponsible regular associates expendable.
bad,"Learn so much about customers coming into the store and how nice they where, interacting with my co-workers every day, dealing with some stupid customers on the other hand also and at this store people tried to steal all  the time."
bad,"The company values their employees as much and in the same way as their products."
bad,I learned working at walmart that managers will play favorites and do what they can to anger and irritate you if you question them on their ethics and the way they run their area
bad,Managers were very unprofessional and unfair treatment of employee's.Was supposed to transfer to night shift stocking but managers would not let me have the opportunity to move up from Courtesy Clerk.
bad,If you need a job deeply and nothing is coming your way then apply at wal mart . You will get the job . You will not get the pay or the hours you are wanting tho .
bad,"I have worked at walmart 2 times this time I started having migraines and had accomdation boss did not like it so I was treated  like a nu,mber.Horrible managers and csms"
bad,"They are very anti Union. They don't pay you near enough to support you. They do not allow flexible scheduling. I would have stayed part time so I could still bus drive, which is where I got my benefits and $5 more per hour, but they wouldn't work around my school bus driving schedule."
bad,"There isn't a lot to say about working at walmart. I worked nearly 40 hours every week as part time until my hours averaged to full time, then they cut my hours to 15 a week with no warning. Someone shattered my finger tip in the cardboard bailer, and management tricked me into signing a sheet saying it was my fault and wrote me up. They will not pay for the surgery I need on it. Management kept promising me specific promotions and promoted others instead. I was not paid enough to live on my own, and had to live with my parents. No one was organized or worked well as a team."
bad,"They don't train you well, they don't give you required breaks, and they mistreat their employee's and blame them for everything.  I had a vape battery blow up in my pocket at work and was blamed for endangering customers, they made me finish my shift with third degree burns even though i should have got to the hospital.  A typical day there is being thrown out on the floor and being told that it's sink or swim.  What a nightmare, i deter anyone wanting to work here because of the mistreatment going on."
bad,I hated working for Walmart the managers picked there favorites over a good worker poor management and there’s always a lack of employees lack of communication poor service
bad,Walmart is not the best place to work because there's to many managers trying to run one department. also there customer servers is show them the product and leave
bad,"I didn’t feel like they wanted to promote me. I had been at a different wal mart for years, then went to a different wal mart but was treated like I didn’t know anything. I did not need to be trained either."
bad,"Too many chiefs, not enough Indians. Punished whenever you take a vacation, harassed by employees and/or customers and no one defends you. Terrible place to work."
bad,"Walmart is a great place to shop, but to work, I wouldnt recommend it to anyone. Reasoning on why I wouldn't recommend it, its because the managers don't help. They just throw you on floor and not give you resrouses on what to do. The tell you to just unload the cars to the shelfs."
bad,"I worked in the pharmacy and studied on my own for the pharmacy technicians certification exam. When I passed, I was not given any pay raise. "
bad,"Responsible for managing, coaching, and driving the preformance of the customer service team to achieve KPI’s. You will need confidence, patience, politeness, tact and diplomacy, when dealing with difficult situations."
bad,"there is a SERIOUS issue going on at the Walmart I work at. the manager team needs to find a way to motivate the employees and stop making things harder on them. mangers here pick and choose who the like and don't like. giving special privileges to the ""favorites"" and ""picking on"" the non-favorites."
bad,"They use you and your hours. they work you too hard and expect you to be okay with it. they tend to forget that you have breaks and lunches, but then yell at you for doing overtime"
bad,it was not that bad just the mangers have an attuide all the time. your coworkers always play around and dont get there work done in time. it was ok..
bad,"Left to have a child. Poor hours and pay. High stress. Under appreciated, workers are not trained and difficult to work with. Would not return to this."
bad,"It was a o.k. job always something to do"
bad,That need to lat us tack the haladays off and be Las stressful to all off the workers at the walmart and I don't like black Friday it's over wall ming
bad,"They didn’t want to work with my schedule at all and would act like Walmart is my life. Management is poor and they don’t treat you fairly, would never recommend this place"
bad,You work and do everything asked of you and are still are not appreciated. The management team is horrible they defiantly do not treat you like family. The only enjoyable part of the job is the coworkers you meet.
bad,walmat closed the location where is was at so i moved on to and job to help pay my bills and get my life back from the close down so i found other employment
bad,The management there is not good. They discriminate. They overly work associates and there is no holiday pay. You barley get raises there. It took me two years to get 2 raises.
bad,"Poor management.  High turn a round for employees and managers.  Never a set schedule.  Not a place I would ever recommend to work at.  Employees call off all the time or come in late,  I learned what a terrible place this is to work at,"
bad,I hated it and I won't return please for your sake don't let that company take your soul like it did mine. It is at my behest you do not apply at such a horrid place.
bad,This   company has strange ideas in the tire and lube department it takes 2 guys to do a oil change and filter I know of a single mom had leak in one tire they needed a new tire  but she  should have to buy 4 tires the other 3 tires were like new I checked 4 other tire shops and they there's no need for that is this how they help the consumer there use to be 12 guys on this shop  now it's down to 4 I wonder why
bad,"They dont care about their employees , they don’t care about you getting days off they do a lotbof mandatory overtime and if you don’t go they ride you up or give you a step they don’t care"
bad,They are cutting everyones hours. They make you work free over time hours. You dont get paid for them . Breaks are too short. Managers doesnt care about work getting done .
bad,Didn't have enough associates Mgt. was aware not enough of work life balance typical day at work was a struggle because of not having enough associates
bad,"can get fired for anything possible and they dont care about you one bit, also rude customers and even ruder management made me hate going in everyday"
bad,I would dread every day at work. Whatever the Morning shift did not feel like doing would be put on me to finish at night along with everything else that I needed to accomplish on a daily basis along with helping 2-3 other departments as well. I would not recommend gaining employment there due to the sole fact that their sanitation quotas were not met and no-one was held accountable to the things they did or did not do at work.
bad,They take sexual harassment lightly. They force you to change positions and take a pay cut when you call ethics to report that nothing was done when you report to management. They pick favorites and move people up that’s in their clique
bad,"Too much micromanaging, too much management at all, teats me like i need my hand held and that i don't have a brain to think. good pay but, i wound find some were else if you want to feel accomplished in what you do. Also to not to be treated like a robot that by policy by throwing 300+ boxes in a hour."
bad,Managers were very unprofessional. Treated employees like dirt. Other people that worked there treated us like we were dirt. I will never work there again.
bad,I started at walmart in the automotive dept. I became a department manager with in 3 months. With in a year I was promoted to the assistant manager program. The assistant manager at Lowes recruited me before I ever went into the walmart assistant manager program.
bad,"They are a company that thinks only about themselves. I was demoted and then let go on my day off. I called ethics several times, and they refused to do anything about it."
bad,"Walmart was not a good place to work in. Constantly under pressure, managers did not care about its employers, Store manager is the biggest gossiper at Walmart. Store was a huge mess and unorganized. Back room a disaster. Staffs rude to one another and customer. Worst rating in Connecticut. There was no change for a hard working individuals to further their Walmart career. Overall very unprofessional and stressful job to work in."
bad,Lazy Management deception betrayal gossiping racists the most worst place I have ever worked at in my life No support from store manager or assigned salaried manager.
bad,"Walmart was a difficult company to work for. Management never did anything in a timely manor, nor did I feel like they cared for their employees. Expect to get walked all over."
bad,Personally I wouldn't work at another walmart again if I can help it. and I wouldn't even shop there if it weren't for the fact that its basically the only place to buy anything in my town
bad,Management has no respect for anyone that works there.  They want you to do everything in the store and the right way no training. They say they are family oriented that is a lie they don't care about anyone the only thing they care about is their money and bonuses about their sales and profit for the end of the year bonus. What ever happens in sales and profit if its a bad thing we get yelled at for it like it is our fault. If it is a good thing they want us to work harder to make it better and more money.
bad,"This entire corporation is corrupt. Only focused on monetary gain. There is no ""open door "" those with values and awareness of the unethical operations are simply pushed out the door and replaced with new lesser paid oblivious victims."
bad,This job is Stressful because the managers and the store manager have no kind of gratitude towards the employees. The store manager will not even say Job Well done or thanks doing the storm I came across dangerous waters to come work at the store he didn't even thank me and then I didn't an assignment one day and he just say it was a Jeff Note.
bad,This is a POOR company to work for the managers SUCK! They are not friendly to customers. They make you work so much. They really don't care about you and your well being. THEY ARE HORRIBLE PEOPLE AND COMPANY TO WORK FOR !!!!
bad,"If you work hard they want you to work harder, pay not great after you insurance and stock buy in. You barely have enough to live on and stress they put any one in manager positions, and some of these people are the worst they just want Yes men and women."
bad,"The management didn't care for there employees. When you talked to them about a problem they never looked into it and it was very frustrated to have a company bot help you out when you need them too. "
bad,Managers have no respect I worked there for almost a whole year and quit cause the manager treated me badly over worked me compared to the rest of the team never gave me a raise gave the new guy the supviser position whenever I did all the work for that spot even before he got it and I was still doing everything benefits and paid time off are alright but besides that don't work here ur just gonna wanna not live anymore
bad,Definitivamente no me gustó para empezar el salario es muy bajo no hay oportunidad de crecimiento rápido ni de ganar comisiones.
bad,"This was a college job for me, the pay was very low. I didn’t have intentions on staying here long just needed extra money while in college. I have nothing else to say"
bad,"Poor insurance, work holidays, no holiday pay, they only care about the money you can be replaced they will remind you of that.Manatory three months a year or ur fired after 3 call ins.they watch with cameras all day dont stop working.they single u out in front of everyone."
bad,They work you like a dog to the point where if you don't reach your goal...  Especially productivity.....You'll get occurrences from left to right...  All the managers and leads only care about bonuses..  They tend to lie about everything and act like they are there for you but at the end they are looking for themselves..
bad,they treat their employees real bad and if you have to go to the hospital for any reason they hold it against you the only thing i like about my job is waiting on customer
bad,"treated employees like dogs"
bad,I started working at the stores and then transferred to logistics after getting a promotion. I should have stayed at the stores. The atmosphere is a lot more associate friendly in the store. At the DC it's easy to feel like you're a slave trapped in a never ending loop.
bad,I would not recommend working for Walmart. Its a job that if you plan on being in pain during your later years you'll continue to work for Walmart. Many long lasting employee found much better opportunity after leaving the security of Walmart.
bad,I regret working there. You are treated like a slave. Management care more about profit than they care about the workers. I do not recommend people to work there.
bad,Stocking shelves at night in Tillsonburg is dreadful. Managers and support managers are miserable and grumpy and they look down on you. It was good when the main night manager went to Lowe's. Im still waiting for the other one to quit too.Only work here if you are desperate.
bad,not a great place to work for naturally happy individuals. the management at both sites had favorites and if you weren't one of them you had a hard time doing your job.
bad,Upper management does not care about associates or management. Will alway's look to put blame on others. Benefits are poor and costs rise every year. Spend a lot of time in the office for meetings while customer service goes out the window.
bad,"Nice place to work , good atmosphere, and team work. Pay is low for hourly positions. Good Health benefits. Hard to advance in positions.Managers are awful to work for."
bad,Do not wanna write a review. Don’t like this company and work not recommend you work here. I really can’t streas this enough you so do not want to work here.
bad,"Walmart is the worst job I’ve had. The managers are horrible. My child was sick and I needed to be off and they didn’t care to take me off the schedule. She said just call off, knowing it was going to count against me. They’re all unprofessional and will try to talk to you any kind of way. They don’t do any work. They have the department managers and support managers do all the work."
bad,Management was horrible from bottom to top always increase work load and shortened breaks but would not increase pay couldn’t get overtime bc Walmart started hiring temp agencies to cut back on overtime pay
bad,In my experience there i was treated as expendable no job security and the open door is a joke. I went thru proper procedures that led to me doing the open door with management. Serious problems with things not getting done. I worked in the deli. Resulted in me getting fired for petty reasons i saw it coming but still hoped my concerns would be taken seriously. To this day two years later these things are still not getting done. Q&A should catch on
bad,"Underpaid, unorganized job. Good for students wanting to get customer service experience and to make a little extra money. Management is poor to both staff and customers."
bad,"I worked at Wal-Mart because I couldn't find another place to work that would eventually offer Benefits."
bad,They never had things done or put together correctly or had people doing what they should of been doing. Everyone was basically running there own show.
bad,Working at walmart was fun. Everyone on the shift got along well and worked together in a capacity that allowed for a little bit of goofing off. It was a fast paced environment with friendly people.
bad,They was never happy with the restrooms because I would clean them and the customers didn't care and mess them up again.The mgr staff had to check the rr to make sure that we cleand the before the customers messed them up again
bad,"empresa ruim sem perspectiva de crescimento,chefia despreparada"
bad,No teamwork or appreciation very low wages no enough help in certain areas management dont  assit in helping out wen its busy or even dealing with customers
bad,Walmart just use you. When it comes to emergencies in ur family they want u to choose work over family. when u choose family they want to give u all these points.
bad,This was by far the worst job I ever had. The pay was horrible. The management was horrible. There is very little room to grow. The company rules were not followed.
bad,Walmart is not a good place for an adult to work. Employees are underpaid & over-worked. They are treated a disposable idiots. The management does not care about employees at all.
bad,"This company to be the worlds largest employer could care less about YOU as a human being! You are a number or a tax write off for them. You'll NEVER get full time, you'll always get screwed out of positions you bust your butt for, you'll never get benefits and if you do they are never explained so it's not till you need it you find out you actually don't have it. Drama, lies,backstabbing,being treated and talk to with constant and consistent disrespect is what you can expect everyday. I think Walmart has forgotten that it was the ""little people"" who brought them where they are today! If you want a career,a job with security,respect,honesty and a way to provide for your family then RUN FAR AND FAST FROM WALMART! If you just need a paycheck and don't care like most of the people then by all means, please apply."
bad,"The worst... no worklife balance, all you have time for is to use the bathroom and you have to rush to do that! Its a shame how the managers are treated. Never seen anything like it. It should be against the law!!!! You dont want to work for them. Go some where else. The discount for all this hardwork is only 10% WOW!"
bad,"Not a very good work environment poor management always cold small breakroom poor scheduling personal employees are rude and disrespectful, you ask them questions and they are rude and uncaring."
bad,"Note this is just my time at Corinth MS Walmart."
bad,"j'ai travaillé pour waltmart 5 ans de temps lors de mes années expériance j'ai connue certaine bonne personne mais généralement j'ai vaiccue plus de négatif que de possitif... lors de ma première evaluation a place de me dire quoi arranger je me suis fait dire que si il avait pas besoin de gens il me virerais déja sa partais bien. avec les année j'ai recu des commentaire comme de fermer ma bouche par un  superviseur. je me suis fait faire de la manipulation et losque ont manquais ont avait le droit a des beau commentaire  qui demontraire leur mécontentement travaillé chez waltmart a été ma plus decevante expériance je ne recommande  aucunement cette compagnie . Heureusement que il n'étais pas tous comme sa et que certain étais de bon superviseur,de bon employer c'est grace a ses personne que waltmart existe"
bad,"I would work very hard everyday but management didn't care as soon as my grandma got sick I had to go to Mexico on emergency and managment threaten me that I would lose my job if I went and I chose family ovor the job, smart move too on my part"
bad,"Low pay, no organization, no care. As a temp job while you're in school or looking for other work it is okay. As a long term retirement I would not recommend."
bad,"High stress, not enough cashiers, upset customers. Management not really hands on not available when needed. Cashiers not included in meetings had to hear things just from other employees."
bad,This company is horrible to work for. They constantly try to find new ways to intimidate their associates to work harder for less money and encourage you to not report any injuries or risk reprimand and termination. It is a good place to work until you find something better but do not listen to any of the nonsense about three basic beliefs and the Wal-Mart family because those are only enforced when terminating associates.
bad,"What to say that hasn't already been said, this company was great 40+ years ago it was decent 20 years ago now it is just a sad shell of its former self. Go work for Dollar General."
bad,"Poor management & pay is to little for what they expect for a dept. manager to do daily.  Its the worse company I ever worked for never again once I leave.  There benefits are poor, there pto is so bad & poor team work."
bad,"Management at Walmart could be erratic and often pushed for unrealistic goals that put associates at risk for accidents. I worked night shift and enjoyed the jobs I did in and of themselves however most interaction with management was negative in nature. Cooperation amongst the associates made the job easier and more enjoyable though again upper-management would often interfere and ban interaction even when it benefited the store! The hardest part of this job was dealing with a workplace culture that did not respect the individual. The best part was my co-workers and working together to get things done in a manner that we could take pride in,"
bad,Walmart fires full time employees for no provided reason and replaces them with part time employees. They do not care about their employees or their employees lives.
bad,If you want yo bust your butt everyday for mangers who don't appreciate you you can definitely work here. This company is good if your mangers be nice and don't play favoritism to your other Co workers and they finally changed they pregancy policy
bad,Treated completely unfairly. Felt like I was watched all the time. Co workers were unfriendly and mean. I always hated going into work. It made me depressed if I knew I was working that night.
bad,"Training was simple enough. Coworkers were hostile and rude. Expected to work as a team but no teamwork to speak of."
bad,Walmart is a great job for someone who is working part time and attending school at the same time. The managers at this store are very respectful and curtious
bad,"its a job but not a career i would not recommend working there and the management was awful. holidays were just madness with no relief in sight, but like i said its a job and now a days you thats better than nothing"
bad,They don't fallow the rules unless they want to write you up.Not like my previous walmart experience. This store is not run lime my other walmart stores. They fudge a lot of rules.
bad,"It's not a good place to work when you have children at home or you need them to go around a schedule. They will deliberately schedule a shift you cant work, then YOU get in trouble or get fired for it. I asked for dayshift all the time an even asked to get transfered to another area of the store where they needed day shift, instead they scheduled me a shift i couldnt get to on time if I wanted too then fired me for  being 10 mins late every weekday"
bad,"at first walmart was great. as i worked there it was nothing but drama. management didnt care about anything,trainng was terrible, it was liking being back in high school"
bad,Management does not care about employees. Some weeks you will be scheduled 40 hours and other weeks you will only be scheduled 5 hours a week. Horrible job
bad,"poor management, management never talk to you when you needed to talk to them always claimed they were to busy overall worst place I ever worked at would not go back if my life depended on it"
bad,The people were great to work with but management doesn't care at all about what's going on or their employees. The only thing the company cares about is making and saving money.
bad,Wal-Mart is not a place to work at if you have a disability. They do not care if you are sick they still expect you to come to work. If you miss 4 day in a 90 day period if you are sick they terminate you. Management is poor and ungrateful.
bad,"I have been at this store for a year and a half now and it has continued to roll downhill. Management plays favorites, overworks and disrespects employees. Cooperate has began to control schedules and that has caused a big decline in hours. I do not reccommend this company to anyone searching for employment."
bad,"work was stressfull as a stocker"
bad,"Basically you do whatever the ""click group"" didn't want to do. I done basically everything. Walmart needs a better system in the hiring of managers...."
bad,Management is not friendly. They favor people. Stood by register all day till customers came in. Slow in the morning. Didn't let you grow with the company
bad,Wal-Mart used to be a place full of management teams who cared about your well being. nowadays its a place where you need to get work done whether you are about to pass out or not.
bad,"They hire you with lots of promises but never come thru after you are there. Poor management, and they change them just as fast, as you are employed there"
bad,"Unfair treatment and favortism, they say there is no favoritism and it is not tolerated but it is definitely there in the company. They promote whom they want not based on experience but on friendships"
bad,"Evil company. Never ever work here. It can will and does kill you every second. Managment literally did not care when my life was in danger, they felt inconvenienced to call an ambulance. Just evil."
bad,"Was hired because of the experience electronics with the first 2 weeks of work was fine and after that everything went down hill really fast.After I was trained I would go into work and be told to go work in different department even though I was hired strictly for electronics."
bad,The job was not worth all the head aches. They don't treat the workers right and they don't care if you are sick or if you have sick children at home.
bad,"work like a slave completed by slave wages and you wait 1 year for benefits. i learned that people are not of ""Great Value"" as employees rather treated as commodities.Management non existent workplace culture? go to see yogurt for culture.hardest part of the job slackers take advantage of people with strong work ethic.most enjoyable helping customers who ""truly"" appreciate associates"
bad,"management like to pull you from your job to do something else,some managers are sexist, and employees don't get long enough breaks.and they sometimes do things illegally."
bad,"I would never recommend Walmart, it is definitely a place where they have preferences to foreigners who don’t speak their mind. Cut down to 12 hours weekly not enough for a person to sustain themselves, passed over numerous times for advancement when I was most qualified. Caused me more grief to work there than anything since they allow customers to abuse you all day long because you have to make it right for them no matter what."
bad,"Working for Walmart was horrible, upper management did nothing to empower lower management. They uses scare tactics and threats to try to get thing done."
bad,"Place is bad to work in. Not worth it at all. They don't care about there workers and treat them bad,that's why everyone in Walmart always has a bad attitude."
bad,"Day is filled with stress from the moment you get there, until you leave. IF a co-worker shows up for his/her shift, then consider yourself lucky. Management has no clue what they are doing. From week to week, you NEVER know who your manager is going to be, and for the most part the person who is considered the manager has no idea how to do their job. "
bad,"One day you are there next day you are not, processes change everyday. Management if very shaky, just not a great environment for growth. Promotions are based on who they want to be in he position not who deserves it."
bad,"Overworked, under scheduled, stressful,"
bad,"This has to be the worst job i've ever worked for rather be at McDonald's, the managers don't care how hard you putting that work if you don't meet production they'll write every week for nothing, to some it all up Walmart DC is a terrible job the only thing good working there is pay that's it... I HATE IT!!!"
bad,"Not really a place that encourages period let alone in areas of advancement. The staff are individually expected to complete tasks of more than one associate at any given time and aren't appropriately compensated for it. Instead of overtime pay for the extended duties, your hours are cut to compensate for the extra time you are on the clock."
bad,"I would not recommend no body to work for Wal-Mart store in Champagin, Illinois. They treat you unfair, don't give you the right information about things that are important to getting the help you need when needed."
bad,Very Very poor managment. That's why i left there no one cared about us who works for them.. They would do there job as a manager and trued to make us do there job witch was not working
bad,"productive workplace, have to be a fast worker, have to be friendly and be very patient with cuistomers.get three breaks two 30 min breaks and one hour break."
bad,"Terrible management, sexist bosses. Always made promises they couldn't keep.  Picked favorites, expected overtime work without the pay. Rude and condescending ."
bad,Managers are not friendly and and they have there favorite  and nothing more they don't care about anybody but there selfes their butt kisser and selfish
bad,they do not care about your medical issues or family life. I have never worked for a company this bad in my life.. I will never recommend this job to anyone.
bad,Managers take pleasure in making people miserable.  Managers have No ethics of morals.  If you want to move up you have to be just as mean and ugly as they are.
bad,while you need a job you need a job. they will keep you at part time to avoid paying for benefits. It is a good place for a young person to work at or even for holidays
bad,Was a full time employee 40+ hrs  When as soon as open enrollment for health Benefits Came upMy hours got cut in half so they didn't have to pay me benefits
bad,Managment is aggressively hostile towards associates. Poor pay due to lack of scheduled hours/constant hour cuts. No fulltime positions unless you are in management.
bad,i was overworked and underpaid. i would have to stand in one spot for hours on end and i would leave there in tears because i was in so much pain. it just was not for me.
bad,The managers are twisted evil and do everything based on who their friends are. The pay was good but wasn't worth the constant stress and annoyance of the daily managers
bad,"Walmart in the past was an amazing company to work for. Very employee focused, meaning they appreciated their employees and showed such in their policies and how management treated them. Now all management are only out to try to move up, meaning they will step on anyone who they feel knows more then they, or can out work or out perform them. I was salaried management worked my way from hourly. I went into that position with the knowledge of how badly hourly was treated. Very high expectations with little to no tools and support to accomplish the task or job itself. Too often employees are thrown into a task or position with little to no training to accomplish said task or position. I was fired because I was pointing out what management was doing wrong. How the management was poorly treating employees. I was wrongfully terminated and corporate shrugged me off."
bad,Not a good company to work since it don't value the associate or family values.  The higher your position the less time you have for your family and they don't care.  They set a management schedule to balance work and family and the store managers don't follow them.  Company implement new programs weekly but no one follow them correctly is all how is interpret by the store management.  Overall the less experience managers are the ones that get promoted or they hire from outside.  District mangers don't enforced policies establish by the company and don't follow up with ethics concerns from associates to find resolutions.  High turnover on associates based that they will have little training and they will have to do 3 person work for the pay and also the treatment they get.
bad,I have been working here for 3 years and I have not advanced. People who are incompetent seem to advance while those who work hard and well stay where they started.
bad,"Management only worry about their bonuses only and themselves."
bad,Over worked and not appreciated. No job security at all. Every 6 months they move managers around so you never really have a set manager to report to.
bad,The day at work can go good for a little time of the day and then it turns bad the.Management and the costume is what the job so hard to get by and to keep it real the best part about the job is when you clocking out to go home.
bad,"This place was managed so poorly.  They can't keep the place stocked, they treat their employees terribly, never give them time to do the computer work they need to upgrade their pay status or improve their job status.  I asked constantly for time to do my computer ""tests"" to get the promised pay raise, they never had time or the computers were down. the training staff was rude and made fun of the company (which should have been a sign to leave right then & there!)  Some of the managers were very clickish, actually I felt like most of the store was that way.  Each department had clicks, I felt like I was in high school again."
bad,Too much favoritism. Too much unprofessional management who don’t value their hard working employees. They used them to do all the hard work while they look good for their bonuses and in the process promoting the favorites that haven’t earned their positions just based on who related know one another or usually sleeping with one another. Don’t use open door it’s a joke all the managers mostly lie and stick up for each other all you’ll be labeled as is a snitch for voicing the very same problems every one complain about so they are aware and simply don’t care.
bad,it wasnt the best place to work. i wouldnt suggest it unless its just to get you back on your feet and into another job. then it would be worth it just to do that
bad,Terrible place for anyone to work. Upper Management doesnt have a clue... Over work assistants. No incentive. Expect the impossible to get finished when know body in the company or the world can do what they expect. Stupid frustrating and funny how dumb it is.
bad,Inconsistent direction given to people. Mismanagement issues throughout the store. Too much work to complete in one day. No consistent direction from the management. No empathy or understanding for single-mom hardships.
bad,"Department manager was awful. Always had an attitude. Always spreading negativity. Was never positive. Too critical, no positive reinforcement. Pay sucked, no full time allowed which meant no overtime, no benefits, no vacation or sick time."
bad,"Working for Walmart is like driving to your own funeral everyday. The customers are NOT the problem here. I worked there 2 separate occasions for about 8 months each time and I NEVER had a customer problem. However, the management skills there are incredibly low. Resources are slim to none. Benefits aren't offered unless you trade your first born. Its awful."
bad,"Excessive workload and conference calls. As pharmacy manager, I spent a lot of time off to catch up with paperwork, having meetings with my team and coaching my technician."
bad,"Constantly being asked to put in ot, but never being treated with respect. Zero considerations for home life, or being sick. Favoritism is allowed when promoting associates."
bad,"Poor working environment, poor management and working conditions. Rampant retaliation practices among managers. Could not in good conscience recommend working at this store."
bad,"It's an awful, terrible place. The customers are trash. People go potty on the floor. Black Friday is a nightmare. On every holiday there is at least one fist fight. Management are scumbags they're sexist, and they don't care about the employees. If you take more than a month for maternity leave they'll give your job away."
bad,"If your an employee that's been there for a while they will find ways to lets you go, unless you get promoted to something. New employees are making the same as employees that have been there 5 or more years. Ok company if you don't plan to stay for a while 6 months or less, Lots of politics involved from the lowest to the highest level."
bad,"I worked at Walmart for two years as an electronics sales associate. Throughout that time I covered on average 6 other departments, because Walmart is too cheap to sufficiently staff its stores. Per company policy there should be no less than 3 associates in our department at any time due to it being a high theft area yet for the last 2-3 months I worked there my shift consisted of me regularly being alone for most of my shift or only one other person with 15-30 customers in the department at the same time. Management was not dependable whatsoever for my last few months my schedule was outside of my availability every single week and I had to bother the manager 5+ times a week to get them to fix a schedule that should have never been ruined to begin with."
bad,I have worked for Walmart off and on for a total of 11 years. I started as an hourly in deli and within 6 months Walmart give me the chance to grow with the company I was very excited to work for the company great people and they treat you like family
bad,It was my first job as a cashier. Customers were very rude. I like counting money and cashing checks. I also like serving my customers the way they like it.
bad,"team work does not exist. you never get credit for your work and you are over worked. they expect you to do the job of 4 employees at once, and the customers are allowed to abuse and mistreat you, no matter what the customer will be right and can get you fired."
bad,"treated very mean , lack of tranning learning on your own , change your schedule with out your permission . no union every man for them selfs . mangment sucks"
bad,Was not alright working for this company Rasist profile going on at this store 2785 Milwaukee road Walmart in Beloit wi the managers are very disrespectful talk to you any kind of way just not a great store at all.
bad,Didn’t work there for very long but was treated very poorly for the amount of time I was there. You are underpaid for the amount of stress you have to get from rude customers the breaks were good but not given enough hours and I just really wanted to get out of retail to find somewhere I could start a career
bad,I don't recommend working at walmart if its your first job random hours few breaks rude people have to wear a uniform and have to basically be standing the whole time
bad,they need to get new employees in there that know how to do there jobs i can take any position at walmart and take anyones job that works there I can take any of the managers job in there
bad,"Walmart is one of the worse places to work. Management is very disrespectful. They don't not care if you are injured, and will make sure you don't go to the hospital if you are to make sure they don't have to pay the medical bill. will not accommodate pregnant women."
bad,"Need to collaborate, check. Their behaviors. Must have free lunch and benefits to all enployees. Fixed schedule , paid time off, vacation and sick days."
bad,Salary Managers are required to work unlimited hours. The entire focus is to reduce staff thus staying under budget so that your store looks good under audit. The Salary Managers are required to make up the difference in staff shortages in any way possible.  Salary workers are pressured with the constant fear of being terminated.
bad,"a good learning experience.I enjoyed my time with the customers.Run the front end, deal with all customer complaints. Supervise cashiers. In charge of cash deposits."
bad,Pay was too low. Stress was too high. Management was the worst. They conducted business in a very unprofessional manner. Very rude staff..............
bad,"I work at Walmart Windermere branch and it's horrible the amount of work they ask you to do, even doing my best as I can manager approached me and told me the aisles you are working on shouldn't take more than 30 mins. And every single manager told me you have to finish this many boxes in that much time. They think they are dealing with animals, not humans. I am only waiting for a certain exam to end and then I will quit this company."
bad,I guess it depends on where you're at if your walmart sucks or not but the ones in lawton ok are all do-do but I didnt have any complaints about my store in virginia the people there were awesome
bad,i didnt really like to work here because i was a cashier and people always thought that they could talk to you with no respect and that did not go well with me so  i had to leave the company.
bad,"te dan a veces malos tratos, los horarios no son accesibles."
bad,Don't Trust Management everyone is out to get theirs much like everything in life keep people at arms reach if anything bad it's always your fault people will always blame shift you so they can advance management will steal and get away with it for a time people don't follow task as intended  and need to go to the bathroom together for whatever reason if you go to lunch with a friend you're probably going steady with them rumors at Wal-mart are life
bad,"I worked the Graveyard shift from 10pm to 7am. I started working for them 9-28-17 to 8-23-18. when the store is turned over to us, it is a disaster and by the time we turned it  over in the morning, the store looked like it did on grand opening day. On the average the crew size was 20 a night. when i started working, i was working 40 hrs a week and this went on for about 6 months until i mentioned to H.R. that California law states that any part time worker working 6weeks straight full time hours, they automatically become full time employees and get the benefits. I never saw 40 hrs again, All this started after my six month review which was one of the top scores in a long time. with in two months after, I was taking charge when I did worked and the other employees started listening to me when they had work related problems. I would resolve the issues and tell them how to do the work faster and safer and not get the managers involve. The managers for that reason, started to see me as someone that can actually replace them. I requested to take the managers test and move up and clean up the bad management seeds. The manager held me up from returning from lunch one shift and used that to fired me."
bad,I have good memories at this job but management was seriously full of it and incompetent. If you don't believe me just walk up to management and ask them something they should know about their job and they won't know anything. They are literally puppets.
bad,"Walmart has extreme unrealistic expectations, they work you to death, 45 days in a row without a day off during inventory, never, ever, ever, any holidays off, forget about any personal life."
bad,No es un buen lugar de trabajo tienen muchas politicas que no se cumplen empezando por gerencia que solo busca su propio beneficio
bad,"Working for Walmart is one of the most monotonous boring and physically unintended jobs in the world. I font like it there, and many other font. there is no sense of working here when amazon, their competitor pays more."
bad,"This job was a cut throat, back stabbing environment The management was the worst.  I was over worked, underpaid, and unappreciated. I would not recommend this job to an enemy."
bad,"They are desperate for people to work there. They will lie to you in order for you to work there about advancement within the company, regular consistant hours and days, and all the overtime you want. Your hours will be consist except the days you work will change constantly, which will wind up making you work 6,7, or 8 days in a row, because they manipulate the pay week schedule. If you go over 8 hours in a day, expect to take a longer break, or be foreced to wait before clocking in. Managers all have nasty attitudes, they are rude and disrespectful and will lie right to your face. The bonus, my share, and shrink program is a scam just to put more money in the Salaried managers wallets. Walmart itself is a horrible company to work for. Stay away from walmart, shop local."
bad,when management change it went down hill from there it was a wonderful place until the new scheduling system is in play the people there there very nice to a certain point
bad,"I would never recommend wal-mart to  a friend, I had very long hours was purposely reprimanded to keep me in a position with a high turn over rate and after a year had been in the position the longest of any one of my co-workers. it was thankless and offered little benefit."
bad,"Just a sad place to work and they are to clicky with each other."
bad,Only go if you really need a job. But do not get comfortable. Always be looking for another job. Management is rude.  The only move ahead there is if you kiss butt.
bad,You never know who to listen to! One manager will tell you one thing another something else. Then they will throw you under the bus faster than anything to save their own butts.
bad,It's easy work that anyone can do.  But can get stressful during the holidays.  Management gets stressed and associates get yelled at in turn.  After the holidays hours are dramatically cut.
bad,I wouldn't recommend working there to anyone.  They are firing everyone for every little thing.  I guess they want new blood in there.  They cut full time employees hours in half and don't care.
bad,none of the management don't talk among with each other they never communicate they can never do there job was so every not a place to work at and waste your time
bad,This place sucks don't work here the management is horrible clueless and stupid have no idea what goes on in a day to day basis and do not give one care abut the employees or their concerns.
bad,"horrible job to work at, they ofter bonus but cut hours to give you the bonus, they are not flexible at all, and quick to write you up even with doctors excuses."
bad,Managers don’t care about customers or assossciates they walk all over you they r poor in management  personal is mean to and they don’t care about anyone or themselves point system sucks there when you get sick with strep or worse
bad,I would never recommend working here. The managers are rude and dealing with them are the hardest part of working here. Stocking the shelves is the most of enjoyable part of the job.
bad,Upper would ignore simple changes or questions that could be easily fixed but got the run around or answers to other problems that did not pertain to the issue at hand
bad,"I was physically and mentally abused, and I witnessed it happen to others as well.The customers, managers, and associates all were like that to each other all the time. You expect to work somewhere clock in do your job and go home, not the case in retail period, especially at Walmart. It's like prison without weapons sometimes.If I came in in a good mood it was instantly gone."
bad,fast paced environment. Learned a lot . Some members of management are just there for a pay check. Poor learnership.Met some good and honest hard working people there .
bad,Only recommend this as a job to people you never want to speak to again.   Not an ideal environment for peacekeeping people to stay that way. Way too much cattyness amongst management.
bad,i will never work for walmart ever again even though they known about my bad back they still tried to push me further than anyone in my job filed do yourself a fever  and never work for walmart
bad,"If you plan on working here DONT "
bad,if you move too slow or get hurt they dont want to help you out. you are on your own. if one person in your area is slower than the rest you all get in trouble.
bad,not exactly the place where you'd find a career at least not in this day and age. maybe 20 years ago this was a great company to work for and had many opportunities for promotion but now its brought down to the level where its a side job for high school kids who just got out of school for summer break. That's what the company and how it cares for its team has amounted to.
bad,Walmart management has no regards to their employees whatsoever. I’m sure there a many that are great managers but then you have the ones that are terrible at their jobs.
bad,"I was good for while until a lot of managers left walmart, and management bad  .took away our sick days without any reason an no vacation days . I Feel I don't have a future.too many changes,and a lot  of our want to or trying to leave."
bad,"They do not care about you, you are only fodder for them as they rack up billions of dollars a year.  The benefits, even for full-time employees are horrible, and they pushed for people not to use workman's compensation with injuries.  No unions and they tried to suck as much money and time out of you as possible."
bad,"The job was very stressful. the work hours make it hard to balance life. The management was rude, and they always had a bad attitude. never really had great experiences with any of the managers."
bad,"I think this was one of the bad location. There were a few good management, but they can't always step in and stop the foolery. Even the Store Manager is on the dark side. "
bad,A typical day at Walmart was very stressful I was expected to come in and handle my job as well as other employees job who would sit around and do nothing. The management there cared nothing about the thoughts and concerns any employee had unless you were working there for 5+ years. The hardest part of my job was trying to help customers with no light of the item they were looking for do to the confusion that kept all items backed up in the stock rooms. The most enjoyable part of working there were the employees they always had a way of helping lighten up your day even with being aware of the poor management going on in their own areas as well.
bad,Wal-Mart was one of the worst decisions I have ever made. They treat their employees like garbage and have no intention of ever treating them like human beings. No room for advancement ever.
bad,"It was okay. I would be on time and complete anthing that needed done. I felt very under appreciated, since I worked hard. Good coworkers and okay pay."
bad,I don't like the iam treated by mangers and customers. And I don't like my varying work scedule that changes every week. And I don't like how the managers follow some policies correctly but not all.
bad,"employee appreciation is low, but performance expectation is too high"
bad,I'm a former employee at the bottineau Walmart and the management sucks at this Walmart..do not work for this Walmart it's a bad idea. U will work like a slave with no recognition.. to many good employees walk out of this Walmart because of management.
bad,"Management didn't care about your needs or problems. No understanding or caring coworkers. It was all very cut throat and me, myself, and I built. Good for first job but would not recommend building a career."
bad,"Hours are fixed"
bad,I was constantly berated for tasks i was not involved in. Constant schedule changes with almost no notice. Disrespectful and useless management that kept the store as a whole from being productive.
bad,"under staffed working environments make it hard for new arrivals to fit into the schedule, it makes it harder to train employees. with lack of training comes mistakes which take time. and in a fast paced work place time is money."
bad,there is really nothing good to say about wal mart other than just a job when u need one the only place i have ever worked where i have been called stupid bye a member of mangement
bad,Lousy pay management sucks and lousy hours!! treatment unfairly! it is just not a very good place to work and one other thing breaks were never on time I am diabetic and I almost passed out a few times due to not getting my break on time!
bad,"When people ask me would you recommend your friends or relatives to work here I say no I mean I might recommend someone I don’t like to work here lol just feel they are unfair and the management sucks ! "
bad,Don’t think I’ll work there again. Worst management ever and I would never refer anybody to work there no matter if they need the money or not. Never again
bad,"I didn't like Wal-Mart, I didn't treat me fairly with sick days and other things. It stressed me out more than I can remember but it had some good things, very little"
bad,"not professional management team ,"
bad,"My manager decided to follow me around narrating what I was doing to upset me and told me multiple times they didn't need me. The other associates were mostly great, but no one could help me with the woman who decided to treat me poorly."
bad,In Puerto Rivo people who have big positions bring all their family members in to the big positions ONLY. If you dont have a family menber with a high position they will overlook anyone qualified and give the position to their family member. Our stoe manager gave the award of employee of the year to her family member that was working in the store for 6 months only she also gave that person a raise and a higher position at 6 months in the company. And there are worst situations  of high positions given to people who do not have the experience or the college degree. They only have to be married to the right boss.
bad,"As far as the workload itself goes, its not so bad. My other coworkers were great and were great people, but some members of management created a hostile, and stressful work environment so bad that many times throughout the day their shenanigans made it almost impossible to get the work done that was necessary. They also expect you to do everything on time by the end of your shift, which if you only have one or two people working the whole area it's pretty much impossible even if you try your absolute hardest. They will openly admit to micromanagement, and they won't admit to this but some members of management harass employees to a pretty deteriorating degree. All in all, I wouldn't work there unless you really need the money, or you have a wonderful work experience there, which doesn't seem to happen often."
bad,"Walmart is not all they make it out to be especially when you are use to working in an organized place, and working for them was hard and unsafe, and I wouldn't recommend them"
bad,"poor management, lack of team work, lack of staff and under paid. these are just some of the reasons why I disliked working at Walmart. Management only cared about themselves."
bad,"I am looking to change my career after 10 years in the Pharmacy.  I won’t go into details regarding my job there because I’m better than that. Bad management is what convinced me to leave. Hostile work environments are not for me, so if your company is like this don’t bother contacting me."
bad,"Just save your time unless you have no other options. You'll be worked to death, the pay is lousy. the only upside is the benefits are great, but its not worth it."
bad,"This job gives you an income but that's about it. Management is too stressed out to help you or care about you. They only care about if you meet the goals they give you.Regardless of how short staffed or unrealistic the goals are, they must be met or all will suffer. The best part of the job is getting your paycheck."
bad,walmart was great to work for at first but not anymore i am ready for a change the management doesn’t treat their workers correctly tif you aren’t their favorite they only give hours to the people they want to instead of people who actually want them
bad,"You get little pay to start with and it is hard work and unfair, I'm 60 years old and work hard and did more work than the young ones so they work me hard, They put you on a time limit to stock and down stock, There where a few of the employees I loved working with."
bad,"at wal-mart the have unrealistic times to get a assignment done"
bad,Walmart has great benefits and everything but the one I worked at management team could have been better and the team work needs improvement ! They need to work on communication as well !
bad,The management team does not seem to realize that their employees are humans. They are willing to throw employees under the bus while trying to save their own skin. It is a high stress environment where employees fear daily for their jobs and their safety. The management team is not there for their employees.
bad,i wouldn't recomend working at walmart they tell you the customer is always right even when the customer is yelling and cussing at you. you will always have to say you are sorry to a customer for the customer being rude. because walmart said the customer is always right
bad,They scheduled me for night shifts then told me months into the job that i was too young for night shifts and they switched my shifts along with my Pay.
bad,"if you have any other retail store options, take them, Walmart is a terrible work place and should only be a last resort to anyone. Management is a joke and only care about their bonus, they will fire you for anything cause you are replaceable no matter what position you are in."
bad,"I was definitely not paid enough to deal with the things that they had me deal with. The managers also do not care about you, only what you can do for them."
bad,"In this job you are promised quick advancement, paid for schooling, etc. "
bad,"stressful and fast paced, with a very bad management. treats people like slaves, and that isn't how a job should be. makes people wanna not show up, and be apart."
bad,"Walmart linden newjersey  is not a great place to work"
bad,Lots of hours split days off poor management. Walmart does not care about their employees.   I have been their for 2 years and the environment has gotten worse nothing positive to say about this company.
bad,not a place I would go back to.  they don't treat people correctly and a lot of favoritism.  just overall poorly managed.  I would not recommend anyone to work there.
bad,"No staff when needed, upper management plays favorites, worked like a slave, no days off ever approved, have to work every holiday, barley any PTO, alot of call ins"
bad,Unreliable hours and non cooperative or helpful management.  Very high employee turnover. No team work environment. Unable to get full time hours to prevent employees from getting benefits.
bad,"it has its own review by the regular customers and not so regular."
bad,"Horrible company, treats their employees like badly, management gets to do whatever they want with no cause of action, cashiers treated horribly by both customers and associates, associates talk about you behond your back.. Need I say more?? I do not recommend anyone to work here ever.. it's a horribly run company"
bad,Walmart is not a good place to work if you have children. They don't give you enough hours to live off of. I never want to work for Walmart again because the management sucks from the store manager to the assistant managers.
bad,Walmart is a horrible company because of the higher-ups. Not just CSM or managers but above them. The big wigs. They care nothing for their employees.
bad,Management slowly getting worse. Doesn't care about associates. Every week management finds a way to make the job and live more difficult without making the store more effective. Character and moral was low when I left.
bad,"First off if you have no kids and no life this is the perfect job for you, but if you have kids that you enjoy seeing then this is not the job for you. Management is absolutely horrible, they are all extremely hateful, I’m talking more about upper management . They are all very hateful, and no one wants to train you how to properly do things and get mad when you mess up. I would figure for as big of a company as WalMart is they would be very organized, but they are very unorganized. Work hours are bad, it doesn’t matter if you work so hard doing  everything they ask if you’re not management’s favorite it really doesn’t matter, all in all to me it’s not an ideal job."
bad,"Nothing is realistic while working at Walmart, very horrible work place. Atypical work day would be very stressful and unorganized not a lot of help from managers."
bad,"Of all the jobs I could have had, I strongly and passionately regret taking this one. I've heard of Walmart horror stories but I always believed it was an exaggeration. Now, I realize Walmart is literally the WORST job anyone could ever have. Actually, the job itself is very easy, there is not much guesswork, but the managers there are an entire different story. Walmart has a sort of motto they go by to always respect each other and the customers. They also have an open door policy, and of those two things, neither one are upheld. The managers will treat you as if you were a piece of gum that got stuck under their shoe and when you express your concerns or discomfort they go out of their way to coach you later on and eventually fire you since you can only receive four of these coachings, the fourth being your termination. You go into work here every morning worried about whether or not you'll finish your shift without a problem. Everyday you wake up wishing you didn't need this job as desperately as you did to still be working there so you could just turn back around and sleep, but you gather all your strength to get up and go in. And GOD FORBID you actually happen to be in a great mood there! The management goes completely out of their way to make sure that smile on your face doesn't exist by the end of the day, and then they coach you for not being productive because you spent too long helping a customer. If I could write this review seven billion times over to have this specific store shut down I would. Do Not Work Here. The pay is DEFINITELY not worth it."
bad,Managers are unprofessional and rude. You can be part time but they have no problem giving you full time hours and no benefits. I did not enjoy working for this company.
bad,"This is an awful place to work. Become a favorite and suck up, because that's really the only way to get ahead. You will be taken advantage of based on your gender, sexuality, and the color of your skin. Just a heads up."
bad,Managment was rude and hateful. Workers were lazy and ignorant. Store manager was a joke. To be plain to work at the location I did was a nightmare of bad attitudes and stupidity.
bad,"All the stories you have heard about walmart being a terrible place to work are true. They work you like a dog while you are there and give you almost impossible amounts of work to complete within the small amount of time they give you to complete it. There are no opportunities to move up, and management does not do anything productive and will not help you out with anything unless forced to."
bad,I worked at Walmart for about 8 months as a stock and backroom associate I loved it at first but the managements true colors showed I use to get a lot of overtime because my team always needed help but then one day I come in to start the day work a few a hours then the assistant store manager brings me in here office and says I’m fired due to too much overtime smfh they are a joke!
bad,Management is terrible. No one has any real skills. Many people have criminal records. Employees don't get along and don't teach each other. They don't care about sales or the company. The lowest bar of employment.
bad,working there is like having to do a chore and listening to your older sibling on how to do something right all the time or how not to do something even tho you're doing your job correctly there is always someone leaning over your shoulder and always asking what your doing and why arent you doing this or that . hardest thing about this job was having to talk to people you didnt really like or wanna like
bad,During my time at Walmart I feel as thought that management was working rather against you than for you and in a general seance  of getting the job done the most effective way. Also when it came to requesting earned paid time the management was reluctant and back lashing when you did it. The management to worker relationship was not respectful in the least; which is the best way I can put it.
bad,"Injustiça total, muita bagunça, abuso, muito desconto excessivo"
bad,"the job is ok, I love working with the public, the hours wasn't enough, there was no vacation time, no sick leave no 401k. Its a job for beginners, unless you in management"
bad,"I ran front end cash registar,stayed quite busy, had to keep a busy pace and be polite to customers. worked between 10-12 hours per day at a steady pace"
bad,As with most retail jobs they expect you to work constantly for limited benefits and pay. During holiday times the work life balance goes out the window and you are expected to neglect family to make work during the holidays.
bad,The company store was filthy. and the management was not flexable .the managers were insulting. It was a dead end job for me I rather have a career than a job.
bad,"Company will hire you as a temp with out informing you and keep you hired as a temp indefinitely if they are able to sneak it around you. Management will pick and chose favorites. Hours get cut near a bonus so that management receives a hire bonus where as, as an employee yours gets lowered since its based on average hours worked."
bad,"Too stressful, don't care about their employees, don't get paid enough to deal with the stress, management talk to their employees like their worthless."
bad,"Workers falling under the job title of sales associate take responsibility for greeting customers, locating products, price-checking items, and organizing store shelves and displays. Sales associates also answer customer questions about policies, services, and products."
bad,"Management needs to treat their employees better. the everyday things was so so. only learned what I needed to know about my job, even though they wanted me to do more outside my job discretion. the place is cut throat as every employee is taught to undermind other employees. the job sucked as they want things done now even if your are on break or lunch break."
bad,unpaid and over worked there is no team work and management does not try or put in the work to help workers  its very demanding the pay is poor and they offer u low raises
bad,"When I first started at Wal-Mart I loved it. Then some health issues arose and everything changed. They say they care about their employees, but as soon as something happens that can't benefit them they start to push you out. As well as other employees who would bully and make you feel so little and defeated. Management is so rude and they put way too much pressure on everyone. You get written up if you don't get any MasterCard apps during a day."
bad,low pay hard work for low pay tough hours not enough career advancement not enough responsibility pay is extremely low management doesn't have room to think for them selfs
bad,Managers don't like to answer questions. You will have to wait for thirty minutes before they excuse you to go to the bathroom. They fired me for asking about maternity leave. No one would answer my questions. The managers are rude and selfish.
bad,"Responsible for stocking and facing assigned aisles.  Assist customers in locating products in my assigned area or explain where other items would be found.   Other duties as assigned included assisting areas where help was needed or unloading merchandise from trucks."
bad,A typical day working at Walmart i would clock in and either provide customer service as a cashier or a layaway associate some day i did not wan to do layaway it was not my job too had to move around to many heavy boxes.
bad,"I have exceptional customer service skills from working at Walmart having to deal with very difficult people."
bad,"mal trato por parte de los gerentes, nada de disponibilidad de horarios"
bad,It was awful the managers and they wouldn't listen to anything I would say and not take my schedule into account. I was a full time college student so when I heard that Walmart had flexible hours I was very excited to work their until they put me into the eat department and wouldn't give me a day off without hounding me about it. My coworkers we're all together just not good people to work with and some were very sexual and it overall was just a horrible experience I don't know if its different when you don't work in the meat department but considering that's the part I worked i'll judge Walmart based on that!! I hope anyone that has the unfortunate event of having the work with that company I hope your experience will be better than mine.
bad,No matter what wal mart you go to it is all the same. Management does not care about you and for the most part its all about the money. No one is educated here unless its a few from upper management. Racism is strong here and the customers who shop there are extra rude and lack manners. If you can save yourself the stress i would look else where. I understand everyone needs an income to support themselves but this company is not what it used to be and if i can save you the headache i would. good luck to you all
bad,The company does not give enough hours to live. They work their employees like a dog. When they do not need you anymore Your fired. I would not work for them.
bad,Walmart will count you absent during surgery or if your family has a heart attack. Walmart has no family values and raises are like 40 cents a year. Multi-million doollar company who employees need welfare to survive.
bad,When they cut you hours and become homeless they don't care I have to work two jobs just bc they can't even give hoursme I wouldn't recommend this job
bad,"Walmart company is not a bad company, Walmart  company has some opportunities in some areas as well"
bad,I hated working there. They didn’t treat the employees like humans. The managers never provided what the employees needed when they where out in the hot sun.
bad,I was working here while going to college. I had to change my availability to accommodate school and was soon cut hours and then fired. Transferred by management to another department resulting in less pay.
bad,I got fired because I wasn’t working fast enough probably because I have disabilities and disorders and they  knew that I had them and took to long of a break
bad,Poorly trained management. Little to no chance of advancement. Hard work with bad conditions. No control over environment or ability to change positions. Management has little background.
bad,"It used to be great. It has gone downfall. Way to stressful. No integrity. Harrasment enviroment. No fairness. No equality.  No leadership, just a dictator."
bad,"The management is terrible. My hours are always messed up, I’m supposed to be full time but the schedule always messes up. I got stuck working in the one department I told them I did not want to work in."
bad,I hated the job. Not paid enough for the hours I worked. Got stuck running to many deparparnments solo for more then 3 hours at a time frequently. Managers were not sesponcive AMD lacked the ability to help out there assigned areas.
bad,"Running register, assisting customers, zoning various departments, helping unload truck when needed. Helping keep isles clean and stocked. Also have experience in produce"
bad,"This place was a very stressful place to work, when I first started in 2004, I loved going to work, we had a great time at work.  When I left in 2018, I hated going to work, it was VERY stressful and management did not care about you like they did when I first started."
bad,"Management would disrespect employees, and gang up against employees if you ever had a complaint. They would never follow through with investigations, and always stuck to one side. I asked for a raise, because I was working 5 departments and was also given the task of the department manager without proper pay. When asked for a raise (I was making $11.50) I was laughed at and told I make more than enough for what I do. I was harassed by management, and told they would run an investigation, in which they never did. Very poor company to work for."
bad,"It breaks my heart to say this but Walmart is just not a good place to work. Hours are inconsistent, management is very lazy and unhelpful, pay is dangerously low, and the environment evokes hate. This does not apply to all Walmarts, but to the one I currently work at. It is not good."
bad,"This review is for the Pickering, ON Walmart. Long 8+ hour shifts for ""part time"" workers. Management doesnt care about workers. No room for advancement since they hire on new managers. Working fulltime isn't an option. The discount is a joke, this company will not take care of you like other companies will. I feel like a number instead of a person working here. Working here i've learned not to jump into any work place; this is a very unenjoyable place to work. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers (sometimes) and going home at the end of the night. Management either schedules you fulltime hours or no hours at all, no inbetween.The only discount is 10% off (not even taxes). I wouldn't advise working here unless you're desperate. Again, this review is for the Pickering Walmart.. the other ones might be run fine."
bad,I spent 7 long years of my life here. I worked hard with no reward. I lived in an area with not many options so I took what I could get. I would never go back
bad,"Applied for the position of store standards and has been my biggest mistake of my life. Basically Store Standards is on the bottom of the totem pole when it came to the store's ""Hierarchy"" and you were basically treated like a 2nd class citizen by the management and basically everyone else including the customers themselves. Constant mind-games by the management team and if you retaliated or stood up for yourself even once you get falsely written up for something you didn't do and was told that you were an awful employee. Also there is a very nasty cult-like atmosphere that is very toxic that has been enforced by the both the management team and from the brainwashed employees that would basically sacrifice themselves for the company. If you ever wanted to be treated like nothing but absolute garbage... apply for Store Standards if you want to get mental stress...."
bad,"What you're required to do, you don't get a dime for in the Houston stores.Where I transferred from, it was much better, I don't recommend SW Houston....at all."
bad,I had health problems while working and was fired because of it . I was told I could reapply once I became health and that was a complete lie they didn't give me another opportunity even tho I was rated as being a great worker.
bad,I couldn't stand working for this place they are so so so demanding and they do not care about anyone at all they simply treat you as a work horse not as a person
bad,"I hated working here. i was 8 months pregnant and when i asked to be transferred to being a cashier due to medical risks they told me that my ""continued stress of going to the E.R. on shift"" was to hard on them when i was bleeding at work. Horrible Management they dont care whats going on in your life and you're there to do a job. They expect very little out of you but dont really like to help out when you need it."
bad,I would not advise anyone to work for Walmart. I’ve worked for Walmart for 3 years and management team is awful. They don’t care about associates and they work you to death.
bad,"Horrible place to work. Every change makes it even worse. I sprained a muscle at work and needed a few days off to let the muscle heal. I was cornered in the office with Asset protection, a mix of 1 dept manager 3 asst managers and the manager of the store where I was told to recount how it happened. Within three words I was interrupted and told no it happened this way. I had to argue to get a word in to tell what happened. It was horrible, and I'm a strong person. They run short staffed on purpose. Which puts more work on each employee."
bad,"Working at walmart was literally te worst job i have ever had. I was 18, in college, and i barely had time to breath. we were treated poorly by management and customers, worked to the bone for a pittance. Seriously, this place should be a last resort for anyone who values their time and wants to do something with their life"
bad,"Walmart will restructure just about anything and everything claiming that it is the best move. They make it out to be a good thing but they just do not care for their employees. They will let you go at the drop of a hat and the hours you work could be wildly different week to week. If you don't agree with something you are basically told to get over it or find yourself a new job, so there isn't really a point in talking to management about issues. We"
bad,"Terrible management and no organization.  No two managers could ever give you the same answer to a question.  There was no consistency.  Every day, the direction would change."
bad,"working graveyard they had you put all the merchandise away that customers left by the register, and also check customers out who came in late, drunk and obnoxious."
bad,not fun at all This place is very stressful at times and nobody does not have no respect for nobody at they work you alot plus They expect you to do 2  times the work for less pay
bad,"Working at Walmart was the worst decision I have ever made. They would always overwork you, and when you did not do the workload they wanted you to do, which was a lot, you would get in trouble."
bad,"Would never work at walmart again horrible place to work at....hours arent consistent, lack of respect from management and customers....if i hadnt needed a job at the time I wouldve not taken it."
bad,Hate working for this company. The management is awful. No one I know who works there is happy with their job. Associates are treated like children. If you call out sick they don't care it is held against you no matter what which is ridiculous.
bad,The work place was slow. You have to do it there way. In all not a bad place to work. Just didnt think the boss like me they let me go after i went through the tryale
bad,Working at Walmart was a terrible experience. They never let you get days off they work you like a animal. Walmart does not care about your well being as a person or there employees in general.
bad,Walmart is the mist awful company and i havr worked there 8 years. I gave almost a decade of my life to that company and they shoved mr out the door the moment it was inconvenient for them.. I will never work there again!!!
bad,"not enough pay for the work the is done and not vacation time, so if you have children then you either dont see them much or you quit. the managers have no care for your personal life and dont try to work with you even when you are trying to work more hours."
bad,people here are really irritating always yelling at the next person its a mad house they fired people knowing that they are under staffed no ever doing the job they are suppose to be do
bad,They dont care about their associates they only care about themselves they want to make sure they( as individuals) look good i would never work there again and they are always bringing people down
bad,everyone at my store qualified for food stamps. Bad hours and low pay with a lot of stress. managment would lounge around playing on phones while we did all the work.
bad,Not a place. I would recommend to  work at least in the spring mills WV area he representative is lazy and lies to former and current employees about positions and be hired or rehired
bad,I loved what I do as a team member. Enjoyed working with my customers and giving them the care and responsibilities that is assigned to me on a daily basis. My customers enjoy me even when I'm not there they ask about me loyal customer service.
bad,"It's not a good job they rip u off and most of the time they will refuse to pay me so I basically work for free "
bad,"a bad experience"
bad,"This job absolutely sucks. Managers will make you work way too much with very little time and if you do not meet there needs you will be in trouble. They will put you in a new section with no scanner each day. Guarantee you 40+ hours as only end up scheduling you 20. Low pay, cut paychecks. No benefits. Lie about the discount on Walmart merch, promised a 20% discount in reality it’s a 10%. And you either have to be dying or have someone already dead to miss work."
bad,Todo se maneja por  jerarquía entre mas alto es el puesto más despectivo es el trato al empleado.
bad,"Management was horrible, scheduling was bad, and deli was the worst department to work in, too much stress and coworkers not doing their job right or not at all."
bad,"I use to like working for this company until I transferred to another store, at first things where going well, then had a change of overnight management,  and things went quickly downhill. There is constant retaliation against associates who disagree with said management (despite a non retaliation policy)."
bad,Horrible work experience at Walmart! I was a department manager and could ever get any kind of help. Price changes every day was sometimes 800 or more items.
bad,"Put it this way, you will get stuck in your department. Only select people will have the chance to move into another department and even less are able to get promoted upwards. My store in Palm Bay, FL didn't encourage any advancement ever. Most employees were just pulled out of their departments to provide support to ICS and the registers up front because the salary managers felt zero obligation to the value of production by means of hiring and staffing those appropriate departments. Your own department would suffer as a result after spending hours elsewhere because it will be ill-advised to refuse management when they tell you to do something else other than the original job you were hired to do. The only reason I made it as long as I did was because I actually could forge friendships with my coworkers and I still do remain friends with a handful of them nearly 5 years later."
bad,I did not like working there from my time there i dont mean it rude but i also thing it was not a good choice of job for me  ..........................
bad,"Terrible place to work. Don't recommend anyone to work for them. Bad pay overworked.....,............bad place bad management not worth the effort. Would never work there again"
bad,This is one of the worst companies I've ever worked for. They treat their workers unfairly and cant ensure that they get paid properly for the hours worked.
bad,To much stress schedule hard on me and to many mixed hours. Managers purposely added more occurances than I actually took the workers stand around and play on their phones while I do all the work and managers are never helping and managers always take off and take 2 and 3 hour breaks managers make workers come in when they are sick and work with food also workers sexually harass women and managers do nothing about it.
bad,"Walmart as a whole will be your best friend in public and say they will give you a good rate of pay and they will! Then they'll cut your hours so you're forced to be on government assistance. "
bad,"This place has a very high turn over rate due to long hours, poor management, rude customers, and terrible coworkers. The best thing about this job is the paycheck, if you can deal with the mess you get a solid amount of hours and high pay rates"
bad,"This job was a horrible experience. They mistreated me and they did not give me the proper amount of hours that i requested for. They treat you as if you are inhumanly. Very poor communication skills. They do not like to give you your breaks on time. They DO NOT take health serious. Although you may have a health issue, they rarely acknowledge it."
bad,I wouldn't reccomend working for this company they dont care about their associates ufhejdjsmoskxhxbxbx jsjdjjmdn sjdjkelsnxjeowk sjdjdndjruowosjshrudnd
bad,"When the Waltons all died or left Walmart it became a much different company"
bad,Management does not care about the associates especially the hard working ones until they stop working hard and then want to write them up for no reason. There is nobody on the associates side.
bad,Walmart is a okay place to work at but they had no right to fire people who has reading disabilitys and other stuff I have this disability and I cant help it
bad,"A terrible place to work. Customer come first, even at the expense of the employees. Managers often forget to give cashiers break when it's gone over."
bad,They lure you in with good startingmpay but get hardly an hours they work you to death benefits are terrible managers treat you terrible Walmart is a cult
bad,Walmart is a horrible company to work for. The managers dont care abut the people at all while treating them like trash. Upper management only cares for people that are willing to suck up to them
bad,"horrible place to work, no values,,,,,,,,,  pharms are hateful and displeased with their own jobs. Nothing to gain. Back biting and spiteful. never will work for them again"
bad,Worked for Walmart for many years and it’s time to move on and find something different. Walmart is a very difficult place to work everyone is always so angry and frustrated.
bad,I did not like walmart because the managers targeted me a lot. I also was cheated on a lot of hours and couldn't survive with what I was paid. over all I didn't like the place
bad,workinig with them was awful. they were mean and nasty. They expect for team members to make it to work regardless their situation. they were negative toward younger generations. they didi not teach younger employees in college they would not ork with college schedule.
bad,It honestly was the worst job I have ever had. The managers and supervisors were honestly the worst. My coworkers were amazing though. Everything else was terrible!
bad,"If I could give this place half a star I would. "
bad,Every single person at Walmart is out for themselves. No one cares about eachother. You get penalized if you can't get all your work done plus someone else's job.
bad,"The management there is horrible. There are around 5 or 6 levels of managers, per store, which doesn't make any sense to me. This doesn't include the upper management team, like the district managers, and so on. "
bad,I worked at Walmart for about two weeks and it just turned out the job was not for me. It was hard on my body and I did not enjoy it. As a young adult I believe you should enjoy the place you work at. The job was already starting to hurt my body and coming from a family of people with bad backs I don’t i tend on having One at a young age. All in all the job was just not for me.
bad,I and a few of my coworkers were constantly harassed by a group of workers and anytime it was brought to managements attention it was just shrugged off due to the managers liking those workers more.
bad,"Nothing good to say. Horrible management, unwilling to help. Lots of gossip among them. Never flexible with scheduling, liked to change it up with out letting you know. Crossed trained in different areas, and expected to do so much for little pay."
bad,"Working is not the problem, its the way they structure their work calendars, some people would go 10-12 days straight with no off time and only to have one day off then get right back into work, and they label most employees as part-time but have you working 40+ hour weeks."
bad,In the TLE shop it was tence in there a lot of competition and yelling very stressful just a lot of hostile worker no one ever really wanted to work people would call in 12 to 16 times a month
bad,"Are you ready to work somewhere where the company will literally hire anyone? Walmart cares about having associates in view, and not much else. Half of the people who work there don't do anything at all, and no one cares. The other half of the employees are good workers who do twice the work they should have to just to pull the dead weight of the first half."
bad,Walmart sucks and everybody knows it.  People work here because they have to.  Some other places won't hire them.  A few years ago I went to work there and I left within a short amount of time.   The managers suck they are really hard on employees harder than they need to be.  The pay sucks period.  They are very paranoid to even mention the word union.  You are warned in training that if somebody approaches you with the union and you don't report it your fired on the spot.  They are awful.
bad,"Don't work at walmart unless you have nowhere else to go in life, you can always do better, the job was terrible and the associates hate life because the managers intentionally make their lives terrible. No one sticks around, even managers for very long."
bad,This probably is one of  the worst company anyone could ever work for. Management is made up of a bunch of losers.  Most employees are lazy and get away with it. There is no accountability from the top to the bottom.
bad,"Terrible place to work, sure u get a 10% discount but on very little stuff, no discount on groceries at all. All they care about is the bottom line and making money any way they can. Sure things r cheaper there than most places but that's because they treat there employees like animales and make money from others misfortunes and mistakes as well as ripping people off. I've never seen so many lies and deception in a company, pathetic, go to amazon"
bad,"Working at this place sucks the life out of you. The general public is so mean and rude and treat you like you are nothing, you are over worked and under paid"
bad,"Store leadership sets the tone for each individual store. Management needs to buy into your programs. Most of the bad store managers don't ""Cheerlead "" the staff into the bigger goals. Instead they focus on the short term "" fix it list"" from the higher ups and push the pressure down the line until everyone is too stressed to come to work!!!"
bad,Walmart shows a lot of favoritism if you’re not in good with the managers they done respect you they make you work harder than what you’re getting paid for and they don’t appreciate the work that you do most of the managers don’t know how to talk to or treat regular  associates they talk down on them as if they’re better i would never recommend anyone to work for Walmart unless you’re considering remodeling
bad,"This job is not good for your health, mentally or physically. Management lacks people skills. No one is willing to actually teach you what needs to get done."
bad,"A typical day was going in and I had some good friends. But the area was not that great, I was really upset when a customer came in and told a manager that someone was stealing tires from a car and management did nothing about it. It was mine!"
bad,Overall my work experience with Walmart was awful. I was the training coordinator so I saw the management aspect and the employee aspect. Managers will work you to death and take all the credit but fire you in a heartbeat if it suits them! I was fired because I was accused of breaking policy. But I collected unemployment for 16 months. Walmart always fights paying unemployment. Do you think I would have received unemployment if I truly broke policy?
bad,"Slave labor. One day a week work. Lies about hours. Lies about advancement. The machines are taking over. Not enough money to maintain a healthy life. Possibly the slowest way of suicide, but very effective."
bad,"This job was not for me. It’s difficult to advance, management does not care about the employees, the employees there usually could care less about their jobs, so you have to pick up the slack or get written up."
bad,my Walmart experience was the worst...poor moral..poor management just all around poor...I don't even shop there anymore  they have no respect for the little people at all
bad,Awful place to work. Scheduled ridiculous hours around the holidays and then hours cut to try and get people to quit after or people were just laid off.
bad,"I didn't like the job at all. The management there was ridiculous. We had 401k. Wal mart is always busy, they have good prices. Never had a chance for management."
bad,If your not a favorite or tell on everyone you don’t get hrs nor available to get moved up in company. If you open door someone higher up then you nothing happens management sucks in the bellefontaine Ohio store...
bad,"On average I have worked at Walmart two times in my life. Both were out of necessity. I would never ever work there again. Most of the management was awful, they were rude, they acted like children. It doesn't pay enough to support your whole family."
bad,"Management didn't seem like they cared of the employees. Very sad to say. When someone had a problem they wouldn't listen. I personally didn't feel comfortable there. Managers and some supervisors always asked where we were going , threatening employees about checking cameras to see if they were actually working or not."
bad,"Each store is run differently and though there is insistence on a chain of command, there is no real way to deal with issues with management if majority of your issues arise from a store manager.  Constant shifts and changes in tasks, often being assigned tasks and roles assigned to other areas, and expected to make up the slack for other shifts.  If anything goes wrong, it ultimately would fall on CAP 1 Associates to handle the load."
bad,"The company has changed so much, it’s impossible to be a parent and work for them. The hours given are too small of an amount to pay bills, live, or have any sort of fun. The managers are so stressed. The atmosphere is terrible, and honestly no one is happy. We are under staffed and our customers are frustrated that there is no help available, and this is what happens when a computer spits out schedules."
bad,walmart sucks i hate walmart neverrrrr work for walmart everrrrrr in life their management is so poor they treat their employees like slaves and over work them
bad,"There is no room for advancement (at least not at my store). No matter how much experience you have if you're not one of the ""pets"" you are stuck in the position you are in. Its a job and a pay check that's about it"
bad,Horriable place to work for they treat you unfair and expect so much out of you that you end up getting stressed out about the stupidest stuff out there and it just makes for a poor soul environment
bad,The mangnent is out of control and the store manger just lets them do whatever they want with out any repurcussions at all its not a friendly place to work at all
bad,I was promptly promoted to manager. Management wanted me to do their job for the same pay and demoted me for other people’s mistakes that I didn’t fix for them.
bad,"My typical day of work consisted of constant complaining that nobody was doing their job correctly, but we were not given the resources to do the job."
bad,No enough hours. No time off even if you are sick you can't call off there what you there sick and don't want you to leave on time. I would not recommend this job.
bad,they dont care about the guest only proffits to many time i was told not to do whats right just to save a buck. i kow you have to mack a profit but their is a correct way ond a wrong way
bad,Worst place to work at. Managers are disrespectful. Everything is unorganized. Not friendly at all. I feel like im being watched at all times and won't let you talk or have a small conversation with other employees without getting yelled at by managers.
bad,"The time I've been at Walmart I'd learned if you don't suck up you will not go anywhere, they promote, who they want and not who is qualified for the position."
bad,"Had high hopes for a long-term secure job. However, the new management, some under-handed coworkers sabotaging my work efforts, hours cut to less than 10 hours per week and sporadic hours, additional job changes to include even more responsibilities than the 4 job roles I already was doing, and no pay increase with the additional work made it not worth the trouble."
bad,"long hours of repetitive work, good for when you desperately need a job but try to look for something else as soon as possible. take my word for it and run."
bad,"Walmart was good at first, but overtime as I became a manager, my store manager became a bully and harassed many associates and her own management team"
bad,Wal mart is a good place to work if you don't plan on being there long term. If you work hard they over work you. Just do enough to get by and then move on to bigger better things.
bad,Walmart was a great company to work for when I started in 2004 but as the years went on Walmart was no longer concerned with the associates but only about making sales. Walmart was always about the associates so that is why I wanted to move up with the company but if I knew what I know now I would not have become a manager for Walmart.
bad,this company has forgotten to put its associates before the almighty dollar-it has changed so much in the last ten years it is unrecognizable. The associates are expected to do the impossible with no regard for the practical time management.
bad,Management does not care about employees. I was called vulgar names by a supervisor and when I approached upper management they refused to acknowledge the incident occurred. Meanwhile my verbal assaulter was promoted in the company
bad,You are treated like you are expendable no matter how hard you work and how much pride you put into your job. It's all about the bottom dollar and cutting costs instead of raising morale and quality of work. NO ENCOURAGEMENT AT ALL
bad,the best part of the job was the interaction with the customers and the customer service that i enjoy. if the customer had a question i did my best to help them always and if i couldnt i got someone to help.
bad,"They keep changing the rules on things that we can take back."
bad,the walmart in colorado i worked at is a lot better the the one in barstow. i pushed carts outside and i would come inside to take a short break from the heat and drink water and the mangers would yell at me to go back outside even if the parking lot was empty anyways.
bad,I did not agree with the way they were running things very rude and not understanding what so ever they were never helpful it was mainly a figure out for yourself kinda job
bad,Don't let this Companies media advertisements of scheduling being a better for associates for them to help manage their lives ( Its Horse crud ). Yes they give raises but then they cut their hours and lock scheduling off where long term associates cant have a life outside of work then they lock into a schedule that doesn't even fit their needs. Then they treat their long term dedicated associates like they are scum of the earth. Their scheduling is take or leave it. Paid holidays comes out of their own associates pto time. Sick time can only spent on the associates family.
bad,Horrible working environment and inconsistent work hours. Manager that treat the employees like dirt and expect the employees to do their jobs as well as the managers.
bad,I was with walmart for 13 years. When I started it was a amazing company. I can't say that anymore. The company use to care about their associates. Use to be about to advance with in the company basted on your work. The open door policy is the biggest joke ever.
bad,not  very good  training   poor culture  lies to customers  not  to believe  the  management  and  didn't  offer  very  good  benefits its all about  the  money not  the customer  or  employee  at  all
bad,would not recommend working for walmart. inconsistent schedule with no benefits. uniform was not provided and pay was minimum. not compensated for work.
bad,"Working at Walmart was hectic at times.  Management made everything extra difficult not only for me, but other employees as well. Unless you want to work in a cult like culture, steer clear of working at Walmart."
bad,At first it was alright.   Then it slowly died.  In the end there morality is slave labor or else. Some managers are ok.  But they like to play the let's person game
bad,treated poorly due to pregnancy. much discrimination horrible management.  No one is kind or understanding in this establishment.  I will never work there again
bad,"This is a high stress, high work volume, low pay and no respect job.  You are worked to death, written up for stupid reasons,  cussed out by customers and are given no respect by managers."
bad,"the company doesnt give you enough hours or pay to survive in the world. the benefits are non existence. they dont follow policy at all, they dont keep shelves stocked and rehire people who got fired for harrassment or stealing or such things"
bad,i did not like working here management had no respect for their employees. this was a stressful job without any of the reward. no paid time off or benifits i could get
bad,Middle level management was the absolute worst experience. The pay is way too low for the extremely unrealistic amount of responsibilities. stick with being a stocker/cashier or run the store. Do not work in an inner city location. Bananas! Pick a low key location out of town
bad,Management is aweful.  micromanage everyone 24/7.  I worked there 12 years and every year it only got worse. I was always having to watch my back even when I wasn't there.  There was always someone in management that was constantly going over my work to find something wrong.  I even had managers screw up my work and take pictures and tell me that was the way they found it.  It is always your fault not management when things go wrong.  They have the worse safety record for the year so far and corporate still does nothing to help.  It is a very scary place to work.
bad,"I make the same as a new guy after 6 years of raises."
bad,"The shifts are hard to fit in with your college courses and the management nudges you to take your allotted hour meal to go to a course you need to take to graduate. The company claims to be helpful to those who are wanting to further their education, but they push you to take night classes at part time college status so their schedules do not take a hit. Salaried management also seems inadequate to make decisions and are rarely seen or heard from during your entire shift, which is actually 9 hours for a full shift. Little is also done from home office when you have an issue with the salaried management and try to get out of any responsibility, even when the issue is able to be reviewed through the security cameras and multiple people come to your defense. The pay raise to $11 an hour sounded nice, but they also changed the entire scheduling system and when shifts were starting as early as 4 am for positions."
bad,Nothing good to say at all....every one out for them self...every try to get you fired so they look good.....Very bad place and they do not care about you or any family problem you may have
bad,typical day at walmart was busting butt to getwork done and getting yelled at for doing everything wrong they could think of when work was getting done proper
bad,Horrible management. No enforcement on policies or management who actually enforce anything with their title. There was a lot of people who were there for the wrong reasons. No culture in walmart. Never again.
bad,"Very rude managers , strict about anything . Show of people favoritism. Policy only used for some not all. Everybody treated different not the same . Immature environment"
bad,"Poorly managed/ has no respect for employees unless your dealing with favoritism.very stressful,no type of appreciation no matter how hard you work..."
bad,"Main manager for my position is fine, but the clowns he has running around as his second in command are overly pushy and expect inhuman time results. "
bad,The first 18 years of my employment I enjoyed very much. The last 11 years I did not enjoy as much. It was hard to stay staffed and it just got to big.
bad,The management was not good and they did not know how to schedule associates appropriately. Most of the time I would be the only cart associate working.
bad,Managers where unprofessional Wal-Mart did not care about their employes there is 0 chance of moving up if you work there for 20 years Wal-Mart does not care they will fire you for childish reason
bad,Walmart management training needs improvement! They have a lack of interest in the development of all employees. As a leader you should lead by example and practice what you preach. The moto is one dream one team but the actions are not behind the moto!!
bad,"Anyone who has walked into a Walmart knows it isn't a fun place to work. The only good thing is the hours are consistent if you can show up, which is really the only thing they expect out of you is to show up alive."
bad,the work place was low staffed and was unfair to the other workers every day I was mistreated and we had no manager to go talk to about fixing the problem
bad,"Walmart is an unfair, stressful workplace. With no help whatsoever, and managers putting all work on you, it really puts a strain on you. I would not recommend working there."
bad,"did not like it one bit."
bad,Pay was $11.00/hr. Not enough hours scheduled to survive. Micromanaging of Associates. Too politically correct to accomplish anything. Apparent racist tendencies toward whites.
bad,"Walmart is easily one of the worst places to work at. You'll get promoted only if you know someone, not if you are qualified. Management plays favorites and even more of them hate their jobs. This isn't even getting into the abhorrent and entitled customers."
bad,"I got a death threat from a coworker and managers did not take it serious, and took the coworker’s side over mine. Poor management and treated unfairly, played favorites."
bad,Walmart treats there employees as slaves. Everyone is miserable that works at Walmart. Management is mean and doesn't listen to complaints. This company also doe not pay well.
bad,"Walmart does not pay a living wage and will cut your hours to one day a week without notice. Walmart expects you to receive public assistance from the government to feed your children and pay your bills,"
bad,The company makes it sound like they're the best place to work very hard to work at very high-paced if you can't keep up you could call in the office for a little things and they try to get you to get fired
bad,Managements have favouritism there's no communication. If you need something or have a problem they dont help you at like they say they will. They never answer when you call them
bad,"Typical day at work was working the job of two or three people and getting no recognition. There wasn't  a work place culture , there was a lot of favoritism, to mush gossip."
bad,The management team at walmart play favorites way to much and let the pets do what they want to do and there pets never get in trouble but if you do something wrong you get in trouble even if there pet does the same thing.
bad,Horrible. Worse job I ever had.  Never give raises. 11.50 an hour to work your butt off. I had to take 4 days off because my mom had a heart attack. I came back to work and they fired me. Been with them over a year.  Them firing me was the best thing about working there because I have a better job now. Their turn over rate is very high. That should tell you everyrhing you need to know.
bad,unprofessional management and bullying employees. the manager picks on certain employees. Unprofessional Conduct in the Workplace The workplace is supposed to be an ideal environment that needs to be maintained and molded by employee professionalism and company policies.
bad,"No room for error, bad training, no help from co workers or management, and unhappy customers. I learned to be self sufficient and how to be patient when waiting for change and dealing with extremely rude customers with no help from management."
bad,No set schedule. If you some how got close to 40 hours they would lock you out of your register so not to pay overtime. Would never get full time and no benefits whatsoever
bad,I didn't enjoy my time working there.  Was working two different jobs at the time and Wal-Mart management wouldn't work with my schedule with two jobs
bad,"There are quite a few issues associated with being under the wing of the parent corporation instead of a totally separate Foundation. The lack of support in recent years from Wal-Mart Stores, Inc for the mission and programs of the Foundation. Also, having to double as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc's Corporate Giving department instead of concentrating on Foundation Work hampers our efforts quite a bit."
bad,"Working at Walmart was actually ok, besides the salary managers that didn’t do anything. I enjoyed it. They work with you if your in school and have other jobs, which was a plus for me."
bad,It was very unpleasant to work for Wal-Mart. Employees are very unprofessional and they still promote them. Wal-Mart was the reason why I decided to go back to school. Employees do not follow the policy set forth.
bad,Walmart has cheap items to buy and I used to like shopping there but I had no idea exactly how cheap this billionaires company was in paying their overworked employees fairly
bad,Walmart is an excellent example of everything wrong with corporate culture. There was absolutely zero coordination between managers and constant bickering between them.
bad,"Its great in the beginning then once you been there 6 months or so management treats you bad(like rejecting time, off cutting hours)til you quit so they can hire the next employee so they do not have to pay benefits."
bad,The management team (not all but most) like to treat their employees like garbage. It’s sad that you go to work and literally hate being in a place as much as the employees hate Walmart.
bad,Management was terrible barely know what there doing or how to be good management plus a majority of this store location especially the overnight staff are almost all foreign people mostly Haitians that are extremely ignorant and obnoxious they would yell back and fourth to each other very loudy all night and blare there annoying foreign music which I don’t understand and management would let this go on and not do a thing which is a big part of why I left
bad,"Walmart is a stepping stone to a better career, working for Walmart in hope mills, NC is very stressful to the mind and body.  Working under pressure or stressful duties allows the mind to grow strong to adhere to volume fluctuations"
bad,"If you were not a brown nose you were nothing, and eventually the brown noser's got shafted also.   Management has personal vendettas against all employee's, especially if they are validly being mistreated from them."
bad,Forces employees out of the departs where they were hired for. Makes them work other departments even if against medical orders. Extremely against any type of Union.
bad,"Its a job and it pays well. The thing I have a problem with is the management won't work with my schedule, I spend half my check going back an forth from where I live, which is around 45mins from Altus. I'm wanting to cut that down by moving into Altus but the thing is, I need a full-time job and the management even consider won't giving me one."
bad,"My manger would change my schedule without notifying me about the change to my schedule. All the manger in the store though they were over the cart pushers, which they were not."
bad,"Walmart treats you like any other piece of lint on the floor. They will schedule you for all different hours on all different days. You can't make plans in advance. You work just about every holiday. The machine only stops for Christmas. You will not be able to maintain a meaningful family life. For all your loyalty you will be rewarded with the lowest wages possible. I worked there for over five and half years, my position was eliminated. They replaced my cash office position with a ""Robotic"" automated cash counter."
bad,"walmart is only there for the money they do not care about their associates.a typical day at walmart is not knowing what to expect from higher up,i enjoyed my job because of the associates and the customer"
bad,The worst job I've ever had. I've never felt so disrespected and cast aside. I went through the proper channels to become an  assistant store manager and every time i was up for promotion they would claim i broke an arbitrary rule so I couldn't advance.
bad,"Inconsistent work plans, hours, duties.  Never defined answers from management when the deli manager was away and a management only decision was needed. Long periods of time would pass before broken machines, stoves, fryers, equipment would be fixed. Would work overtime or a double shift because a lot of employees would call off work a lot.  The most enjoyable part of that job was meeting customers and helping them.  I feel I provided a wealth of information to the customers and would pass along the knowledge I would gain by researching the food items I prepared and sold.  I was acknowledged by management on several occasions for my outstanding customer service and was awarded pins for my uniform.  I also appreciated every one of the outstanding reviews on the Walmart website for my outstanding service."
bad,I dont recommend working here ifyou need health insurance or other benefits. THey do not care about their workers at all. It is not worth the hassle to work there
bad,"Been 7yrs since I've worked here, I do not know how things have changed. While I was there, there was a large turnover rate for management which then trickled down to the employees."
bad,"Managers are very unprofessional they will not stop for a second to listen to my concerns about other members of management provoking the associates to be upset at work."
bad,working at Walmart I not only experienced harsh treatment but heard horrific stories of people being penalized for calling off after miscarriages or being demoted after attempting suicide.
bad,Working at Walmart is full of stress and does NOT allow for a healthy work life balance. Your schedule is NEVER stuck to and if you bring up a scheduling issue it is unlikely that you will get any help.
bad,"The work its self wasn't the worst part. The worst part was when we would run out of items for the bakery ( even though we told her) we would get yelled at by her on a daily. The work isn't stressful. If you can handle getting yelled at, because your manager doesn't want to do her job then it's a great place for you."
bad,"Everybody knows Wal-Mart.  25 registers, 2 are open, customers are self-centered and aggravating.  Management sits in the office and eats McDonald's and then take their life frustrations out on the associates."
bad,"There is nothing but favoritism and the constant need to push productivity on everyone. It doesn't matter if you're old, pregnant or disabled you will still be pushed to your breaking point and treated like a slave. No place of employment should ever feel like imprisonment. Managers do little to no work and there is zero accountability. I found myself fired for being too slow, yet I was one of the fastest and most physically fit members on my cap 2 team after 8 months of solid effort. If you're intelligent prepare to be targeted or blamed first for work not getting completed, despite greatly varying work loads on a day to day basis. I have started to leave Wal-Mart out of my resume and have no desire to ever look back. You've been warned."
bad,The job itself is easy but the managers do not do their job duties and will pass them on to associates followed by several meetings everyday about how the associates did not get done what they wanted done. Even though your crew is supposed to have 12-15 people and you have been working with a 4 person crew for months. Meanwhile the managers walk around slumped over a cart doing nothing except telling you your not working fast enough.
bad,"An awful work environment that promotes stepping over your coworkers to get anywhere. However, if youre looking to make a bit of cash, it does pay slightly above minimum wage."
bad,Walmart pays ok but they will most likely work you to death they never work with your schedule they don't care about people that are just starting the job don't try Walmart unless you desperate for work and now if you quit and try to get re hired they won't re hire you Walmart is best for a single person with no kids no wife and no life
bad,as  front end manager you have to deal with abuse from customers and management never supports you. They play favorites with employees and when something happens they take one persons word over another with no proof
bad,This is the epitome of soul draining work if I have ever experienced it. Unfortunately they have capitalized all over the globe. Take it for what it worth.
bad,managers didnt care what u do and you always where giving too much product for the shelfs and no help too restock and stock and move the stuff back too the spot it goes.
bad,I only worked at Wal Mart a month they always scheduled me past my availability it took 2 months to get my first check if you put in an availability it takes at least 3 weeks for them to honor it . I wasn't available to work nights they always scheduled me 2-11 pm or 1-. 10 pm store manager refused to help my immediate supervisor left to go to training for weeks they just didn't care they list a great employee.
bad,"Seems like management has no idea what they're doing or what they want you to do, the rules change from day to day and manager to manager. "
bad,"WalMart  is run by poor management.  YOU go to work every day and do what is expected of you, they ride you constantly.  The CSMS congregate together and BS and eat snacks and ignore the cashiers.  There is no work life balance.  They work you like a dog and show no appreciation to you.  It is sad how poorly they run this store.  The management does NOT communicate with you.  If you have a problem management DOES NOT want to hear what you have to say or try to help you. Horrible working conditions."
bad,"The Walmart location where I was employed had serious issues with their management team. This included: inappropriate behavior, lack of knowledge in their area and job title, poor stress management, lack of organization, and poor mediation skills. Overall the company seemed wasteful and careless. I am appreciative of the extensive retail skills I took from this job, however when it comes to the management at the store I worked at, disappointing to say the least."
bad,"typical day was assembling products. I learned how to assemble products, management was not the best, culture was satisfactory, hardest part working there was management, I enjoy assembling products"
bad,"This company is crooked, management is a good ole boys club, and the only thing that hard work gets you is more hard work. It's very cut throat and they pretty much lock you in place so you cant advance if your a hard worker (even though its supposed to be non bias). They don't pay near enough for what they demand. The atmosphere sucks because no one wants to be there, so everyone's in a bad mood. The boss always throws everyone under the bus to make himself look better."
bad,"When I first started working for Walmart, i was getting great hours. After being there for so long, they started to cut hours. The drive from my house to walmart is an hour. I was driving there about twenty hours a week or less. That's gas money. Not enough for bills."
bad,"Favoritism and bias is shown in all aspects of the job, towards certain employees. They cut your hours until you finally quit when they know they cannot legally terminate you. There is only room for advancement for those whom are favorited or priviledged by the management team, and allow harassment to take place among employees."
bad,"I hated working at Walmart, The management talked down to the employees. They dont know how to treat people. I absolutely couldnt wait to find another job."
bad,"Management needs work. Too much favoritism. A typical day we were always slammed with not nearly as much registers open. Also for a superstore, it was way too hot!!"
bad,"No raises, horrible management, childish behavior(talking on cell phones), and less than preferable pay. Job prefers experience over efficiency and overall was a terrible experience."
bad,This is the worst company they do NOT advocate for their employees. There are cliques and favoritism not a positive word for hard workers.they cover for the.lazy employees and have mo compassion for their employees. Worst place rum from here!
bad,"I worked at walmart as a service tech in the shop. I worked there for almost 7 years. Only got 2 raises the whole time (they found a way to not give raises). Management targeted the shop and always tried to have us go inside and help every other department. The health insurance will fight everything you try to use it on. They don't allow overtime almost never, even when the shop had 2 techs all day. Overall working in TLE at walmart is extremely stressful, over worked, unappreciated, and abused(in terms of work). I would never recommend any body to work there unless it's absolutely unavoidable."
bad,They are really strict at the one in Pineville mo I understand that they do not want you to miss work I had to miss be ause it rained alot and I could not get out the road I lived on was flooded and they fired me for that.
bad,Poor management lots of favoritism. If you are part time they will work you 40 hours for 11 weeks straight and right before your 12 week they cut your hours to as little as 12 only so that they don’t make you full time.
bad,"Walmart sucks your soul dry. They do not care about any of their employees. They believe they are above the law, and usually when you're a multi billion dollar company you are right!"
bad,"The pay wasn't nearly enough, the work was both dull and teeth-grinding, and the management was somewhere between overworked, and utterly unsympathetic to any plight."
bad,"Management only did what benefited them and blamed the people at the bottom for things not working. Cap team 2 was the worst position possible, taking 10 minutes of a 15 minutes break was frowned upon and constantly under stress and pressure from being yelled at for not being able to control something that was not our area or our doing."
bad,"While i was going to college, my manager at the time made it really hard for me to balance work and school. he/she would schedule me during the time i had class,and then would call me and ask me why i had not made it  in to work on time. this also happened to a few friends of mine"
bad,"- They overwork you"
bad,"I gave Wal-Mart seven years of my life. I have worked many different fields in the store, from stock-man to material-handler. I am thankful for the training I have received, but only in the sense that it gave me experience to find better employment. Wal-Mart is the very essence of a toxic work culture. Management is vindictive and gives favoritism to pet employees while honest, hard working individuals are worked to the bone, treated unfairly, and tossed aside and fired on tiny little infractions. It is a very suffocating environment to work in, uncertain whether or not you're going to have a job every day. I do not recommend this place for anything other than an emergency job or training for someone in high school. As far as long term work goes, they don't care about you and there is no job security. Look elsewhere."
bad,Working at Walmart is what you would typically expect from working at Walmart.  Customers can be rude and expect a lot of the customer service representatives.
bad,I've had nothing but bad experiences at Walmart. I was discriminated against because of my mental disabilities. they were very mean and disrespectful.
bad,When I worked for Walmart they refused to promote us within the store. They would just hire new people. We never get sick days and if you miss 3 days you are fired. I wouldn't recommend working for Walmart to anyone.
bad,I enjoyed working there I learned a lot from my peers. I wish I could have stayed longer but I had go back to school I shop there a lot miss my co workers.
bad,not a great place to work if youre looking for advancement. it okay if you are a student looking for supplemental income. manger micromanage. if you decide to move to another dept. your pay is dropped according to.
bad,Walmart does not want to help you or see you succeed they are only concerned with their bottom dollar and nothing else. I will not return to work for this business .
bad,"The only issue I have with the company itself is that they will allow ANYONE off the street no matter how morally corrupt, discriminating, or unfair they are. The people they put in charge the store I work at in particular like to pick and choose what policies they want to follow based on the person they are dealing with is and what mood said manager is in. They talk about about their associates and target the ones that will not back down from their stupidity.  I wouldn't wish working for walmart on my worst enemy."
bad,"They are the worst company to work for out of all the places I been with. It's all take and noting in return. They have a point system they go by, so if you are ever out its a point against you after so many your gone no questions asked. They don't care about there people all they care about is making money."
bad,Walmart was a very difficult work environment to get used to.AT my location the people worked with did not care about your well being. Everybody was out for themselves and that created a hostile work environment.
bad,This place is a joke they treat their workers like sweat shop workers they arent organized like they are supposed to be. I wouldnt work for them ever again.
bad,"I believe that maybe it was the store I worked at. Employees were unprofessional,management is poor and unfair, the customers in that area was just HORRIBLE. I’m 18 now but was 17 at the time when I was working. By far the WORST job I had. It makes never want to work for a supercenter/supermarket ever again. If your young and in school please find a more peaceful job"
bad,"This company treats all employees as if they or their families have no worth.  After having worked for this company for 4 years, it was decided to restructure the management system.  The offer was to relocate to a different city and take a $12K a year cut or receive a severance.  During my time at Wal-Mart, Assistant managers had to re-interview for their positions twice.  Do not recommend this company as an employer or a place to frequent."
bad,"You might end up insane. Compleyely, totally, entirely out of your mind, and that's just from poor management. Favoritism is rampant, managers are poorly trained, and cruel."
bad,All they care about is how much money they make and nothing about people.  In the start years ago it was a good place to work. They do not treat their employees like they even care about them.
bad,"Walmart is not run by people who do not think long term, it is also managed by people who feed off of being an assistant manager. Walmart is not a place to work for, if you intend to advance in life. But suits as a young person, needing to make ends meet."
bad,it's like selling your soul. you will never advance at this company unless you play the politics game. you can be the hardest working associate and they wouldn't care.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend anyone to work at Walmart. It's overwhelming, overrated, and not Worth the pay. I don't feel appreciated for all the blood, sweat and tears that I put into my job. Im suppose to be an full-time associate ,but don't always get my 40 hours"
bad,I worked for Walmart for five and a half years . I like it at first I was they’re forever. Things are constantly changing at Walmart. They are constantly taking things away from us. For example holiday pay. Things like that make it easy to say Walmart is a bad company to work for
bad,This company teats you unfair.  Tries to make you work threw breaks. Managers have no Idea how to be a manager.  They are NOT family oriented.  there goal is to fire you if you are a full time worker. and do a good job.  I picked up shifts that needed covered I went beyond my job.  Got fired because they did not change my sechuel in the computer when I worked other shifts .  Therefore it showed as a no call no show!!
bad,"Working at walmart was terrible. The mangers are the worst, you don't get any help but expect things to get done on time. If you're looking to work there, don't."
bad,Over the last 9 years i watched this company go from ok to awful. Standards need not apply here. Im really not joking my best example is we have one associate who can literally leave to store for hours and not get fired. So if you have no self respect this is the job for you.
bad,"Wal mart needs to review who they hire, they need to review who to let go, they need a huge upgrade in their training. They need way better management and management training. They are disorganized. They need a new method for acceptable work, and job titles."
bad,"All you see there now is people with no teeth, druggies, felons, and non educated people. I felt like I was way too good for that place and I hated it so much. Management sucks and there’s too much kids working there. I don’t recommend at all!"
bad,I can write walmart a lot and a lot and a lot. over and over again until the time when i dont have to anymore what fun this is to live and live again I want
bad,out of all the jobs i have had this was by far the worst. There is really nothing good for me to say about this employer all the way to the corporate office. This is a company that only cares about money and not the well being of its employees.
bad,I don't recommend working here. The managers do not listen to you. Your hours are never what you request. Getting time off is almost impossible. They don't treat their workers with respect.
bad,This is a terrible place to work for and the work environment is harsh you have to deal with not being respected by your management and being put down as and individual
bad,I was not impressed with working at Wal-Mart. MY experience there was unpleasant with Management whom did not know how to properly manage and be there for the associates whom needed the help.
bad,Overall OK place to work TEMPORARILY! Some managers are understanding others abuse their power. I recommend working here to understand real life and customer service.
bad,"They treat associates like slaves, they have no respect for anybody, they don’t even care for the quality anymore , just about money, they just use people for their own convenience"
bad,It's easy to get a job here and if you get in good with the right people you can move up a little faster. The pay is HORRIBLE and the raises are worse.
bad,When I first started @ Walmart for the first seven years I loved working there it felt like family people cared for people now its just a job to me so I go in now because I have to have a job but I don't like how I feel when I go in to Walmart that's why I know its time for me to do something different.
bad,i had fun working there the only problem was the lack of help by other employees and it landed on me .witch led to me leaving the company.other than that i liked it.
bad,"no hours, low pay and incompetent managers. Its Walmart they dont give raises hours or benefits. I would never go back unless there was just nothing else."
bad,"Walmart does not care about you. You work to their schedule. You work when you are contagiously sick. You work when you broke an arm/leg. You work the day after that horrifying car accident. You work till your knee gives out. You work on prescription painkillers. Eventually, you work till it eventually either kills you or your left so broken you can't work anymore. Do not work for Walmart, and if you do, still keep looking for work. Trust me. I've worked four different Walmarts, over Six Years. They are all the same."
bad,"Wal mart is a very selfish company. you cannot have your own life or be in schoool because they do not care or work around school hours. they do not have any consideration with mothers and kids either,."
bad,"Everyone is no negative, you get no training there, you don’t get to move up without someone replacing you even after being there for months, communication with managers is awful, they treat coworkers very unfair example: giving positions to the people who they like no the ones who deserve it, there’s a lot of drama, and they overwork everyone. Some of the managers even talk poorly about the coworkers. I am a worker there and see the behind scenes. They recently had a raise but, newcomers receive the same amount as veterans."
bad,"Dont work for the North Smithfield in RI location, they dont care about you they just want the money that people spend. i should have never worked there. they are a bad place"
bad,good place to work for your first job. aloud to punch in early. meet new people.... horriable managment skills the managers dont know what they are doing half the time
bad,I thought Walmart was a good place to work for until they cut 10 of our highest paid people and left them high and dry. Some of them had 20 plus years invested. It was heartbreaking. Walmart isn’t about family or bettering yourself. It’s a depressing place to work. They suck the life out of you.
bad,This place will squeeze the life out of you if you succumb to them...they are poorly staffed and they have you doing 2 or 3 jobs at once....I don't recommend working there.
bad,"Tried to do all the things they wanted in my shift, but just couldn't. Out in the weather(winter) in the rain, wind, & cold. Wound up having foot problems, along with swollen blisters from standing/walking whole shift. Multiple managers, not know which one was in charge. Then got the flu & was fired for it."
bad,Worst job yet they cheated lied to me and tricked me into taking a worse job than what I had my advice? The pay is not worth it go somewhere else it's a bad environment.
bad,Its a very busy work environment. lots of work to do at all times. must be great with the public as well as working with others. being physically fit will be a great benefit as there is lots of lifting and moving of heavy stock. for the most part the people you work with are very nice and fun to work with.
bad,"No flexibility for your hours or job, you are expected to sacrifice your life for the company and if you don't you are let go.  Terrible managers and training."
bad,"Hate walmart. Unprofessional, terrible work environment, management team are a bunch of bullies, they play favortoism, nobody is on the same page, no hours, bad pay,"
bad,"my experience at Walmart was negative. I had a very hard time going to work knowing the outcome of the day already. I had to work while injured, men were very inappropriate. One even slapped my butt and my managers wouldn't do anything about it."
bad,"I would not send my worst enemy to work there. Employees are treated horribly, and underpaid. Also, I accepted the job under the false pretense that the job was part-time, and then I later learned that I was only temporary just to get the store through the busy seasons. Then was released 4 days after Christmas."
bad,"Very bad place to work I would not recommend it to anyone, go to HEB or somewhere better. The hours are not enough your word doesn't matter to them you don't get paid time off or sick leave."
bad,"poor management skills, unenthusiastic"
bad,I would never tell someone to work at Wal-Mart the company sucks the management is poor and they favorite people even tho they say they don't safety is not a concern for them
bad,"never back up walmarts own stated policies,poor pay make you bend over backwards to satisfy screaming customers returning 10 yr old items that have now broken"
bad,Use to have more job security. Cutting hrs hurts us. But they still cutting hrs daily. No job security anymore which is not a good thing at all for us
bad,They over work there assoiates. As a customer u never can find good help. An almost everyone that wors for walmart has an attitude twords customers. An i as an old assoiate work twicevas hard as everyone alse an never got bonus or even a pay raise. Mangerment takes all the credits for what assoiates do thats good. But treats assoiates bad. It like signing a deal with the devil when u work for walmart.
bad,"I dislike Walmart. I would never recommend someone I know or anyone for that matter to work there. Horrible work environment, High stress environment, cut-throat, favoritism (extreme), nepotism (extreme). Just don't work there unless you are desperate or out of your mind."
bad,"This company was bad before, but ever since the reshuffle its been so much worse. This company is about to sink so avoid walmart unless completely necessary for survival"
bad,"Resolving the issue for the employee or customer take forever; if you get a response at all."
bad,Walmart is a terrible place to work. Wouldn't recommend working here to anyone. The managers were rude people got fired for no reason. Walmart's policy's were terrible.
bad,very unorganized don't care about employees well-being they don't pay you enough for what you go through in automotive horrible store managers and department managers no one wants to work  loved my job but hate the way things go
bad,"This isn't a good place to work the company doing cars about their employees at all, you have to suck ups to them to get anywhere and they don't cars if you are sick and have a doctor's note it will still go against you no matter what"
bad,"It started off as a great job with good managers. Quickly turned into the most toxic environment I've ever been in. Typically had to work an excess of 5-9 hours of freight a day with little to no help. No real training from anyone other than coworkers who did it their own ways. Most of the good managers quit when we got a new store manager because of the unrealistic standards placed on them. We were consistently short staffed and under motivated to complete the work. Rushed and mismanaged by supervisors. Unloading the truck was an absolute nightmare daily, sometimes dragging on for 3 or more hours. No breaks or lunch until the truck was completely finished. Some workers were favored more than others when it came to time off being granted and most managers pawned off their duties to other staff. No room for growth or opportunities for promotions. I was working full time hours but listed as a part time associate, so I could reap no full time benefits, i.e not enough pto, no healthcare."
bad,I was a supervisor at walmart and overall it was a low paying job to actual talented people that only got the short stick of the work as opposed to the favorites of upper management
bad,asked me to changed my school schedule so that i could fill in for a coworkers shifts while he went on vacation. i couldnt do it so they cut my hours. i quit
bad,they suck at hours and the mangment dose not know what there doing at the east side in saint john NB all the store manger cares about is the bottom line
bad,"Well if you join the wal-mart team you will think it is all great in the beginning, and then one day you will show up to do your job and you will have about 4 managers breathing down your neck threatening your job and eventually they will try hard enough to either break you and make you quit or they will just come up  with some reason to get rid of you."
bad,They cut my pay AFTER hiring me. there was no work/life ballance. the company pretty much treats you like property. management is not at all compotent.
bad,The managers are rude and don’t know how to talk or treat the employees. Management is very ungrateful for the things you try to help them with. Overall it is a terrible working environment.
bad,"All of the assistant managers do nothing to help, if you call for help you either wait 40 minutes or have to call again or go find them. They do absolutely nothing and are rude 110% of the time."
bad,the CSMs treated the cashiers very disrespectful even in front of the customers. also they do not care about families or the workers wellbeing. they will have you come in even if you are extremely sick even if it is contagious.
bad,They don’t care about your life. Me being a single mom my child tends to get sick they never cared. Not any hours at all. Managers don’t do anything st sll.
bad,"I was so naïve to stay at Walmart as long as I did. They pay you the least amount legally allowed, over work you, have ridiculous ways of running things. They felt like they could insult me left and right almost like we were in high school. The managers were acting like children with a lot of power over everyone and it was not okay. I hear all walmarts are the same."
bad,Small fish in a very big pond.  Education and experience often trumped by seniority and EEOC status.  A very political environment; very competitive and cut-throat.
bad,"Walmart doesn't care about their Associates plain and simple, not enough Associates to run the store people are walking out with items no teamwork management doesn't care when you come with an issue"
bad,The hours were weird and sometimes you don't get your breaks. I had almost been locked out of my register several times due to it being my lunch time. The management is not good.
bad,"This company will mistreat you until you leave. They do not care about quality, and only care about getting the cheapest labor possible. Management is composed of people who have worked there for years, but do not have any sort of valuable input to give about the methods."
bad,"treat employees like they don't matter, terrible leadership, employees with any background in retail knows more then the management teams at walmart cause the company provides no training"
bad,"Long Hours"
bad,"Poor management does directly affect the productivity of the store as a whole. The job duties are quite simple to carry out. The worst part would be the amount of work that is expected by any given person in multiple areas through out the day. One person cannot provide effective customer service when they are expecting to cover many departments at once. I enjoy working with my co-workers and enjoy interacting with the customers. I have learned a lot and hopefully I can apply those skills to future employment opportunities.  Lack of teamwork and constant ethical violations tend to set the tone and make for a hostile work environment. Overall, complete respect and appreciation will make it a much better place to work. I am ready to put my skills to the test but working for a different company."
bad,would not work for the company ever again. management did not back up employees when problems happening. not enough staff on hand at any point. cut hours randomly.
bad,Overall Walmart is not a fair company to work for. Management doesn't recognize performance and they don't reward you.There is no chance for advancement.
bad,Rasistaspara crec e necistas palanca meterte el g e ente o distrital. Crecer o aniversario aunos 150 miserables pesos a otros 900 pesos de incremento por año que se llevan bien con la gerencia .muchos q se relaciones entre gerencia y asociados no gerente de tienda no dicenada pero entre lider y asociado si slbroca. Debe ir uno.
bad,"I worked here for four years. That’s four years of my life I cannot get back. The hours were terrible and they expected you to come in for like 4.5 hours a day. Sometimes you were getting 19ish hours a week. The managers were sub par and would belittle you. Actually, no they weren’t at first. The managers were really awesome and understanding but they got rid of them all and replaced them with managers that came from I don’t know, the department of prisons?! Do not, I repeat do not work for WalMart. You will be sorry."
bad,"Poor management workers, i would never work for this company again, thry dont care about their associates. Racist Management, threatens workers of their job."
bad,"Seriously don't work here, they do everything backwards and only care about making the waltons richer. They don't care about the employees at all. Horrible workplace."
bad,Good as a first job from high school or college.  They took hours away many times.  You don't know your schedule for a week.  Supervisors unexperienced.
bad,"I was 6 months pregnant with my son and my zoning manager was horrible to me made me bend over pick things off the floor and talked to me horribly about my home life which I thought was unprofessional, didn’t get breaks when needed and was almost fired for having pregnancy  complications that made me miss work"
bad,Typical your schedule is all over the place and you only have 4 points from day 1. if you miss a day thats 1 point if you are late that a half of point.
bad,They did not know how to manage people and they never offered more pay or recognized your hard work. They simply treated me like dirt. Working for Walmart was a joke. I hope it was just the area but I doubt it.
bad,Its a basic walmart where the employees don't matter unless your kissing up to the boss. The management system is a joke and your more of a number to them than a person.
bad,"I don't need to explain why this place is horrible. Worst experience I've ever had with management. coworkers are awesome, but managers micro manage and complain when people aren't working fast enough in 120 degree trucks in the middle of the summer. This place is downright abusive and the only reason they get away with it is because no one can stand up to them."
bad,Walmart was a good place to work when I first started... After about 3 yrs it went down hill.. They kept taking from the associates and never gave anything back...
bad,"TYPICAL DAY WAS LONG AND STRESSFUL"
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of the managers jumping down your throat if you didn't finish all of the previous work the night before, then they would pile on even more work knowing full well that you still need to get the previous days work finished. The management at Walmart was very rude, lazy and very overbearing, you weren't even allowed to talk while you worked. The hardest part of the job would probably have to be when you are trying to finish all of your work and then another department manager come and pull you out of your department and make you do their work knowing that you just got your head chewed off from the department manager just a few minutes before."
bad,"It was a difficult place to work , angry customers , rude managers and supervisors. Sometimes they give you hours and some times they don’t . They have a 3 point policy"
bad,fast paced manual labor intensive job. hardest part of the job was the amount of hours worked and not knowing when you were going to get out of work. .
bad,"you don t have management support.They treat you horribly.They work you hard and the pay sucks.The manger there walks around the store and is useless,Majority of the time he sits in his office,Suppose to be open door policy,Thats a bunch of bologna.I tried talking to the manager but never has the time to busy playing video games on the computer,Very very high employee turn around,The employees that are there are miserable.Also if you leave there theirs no chance of rehire-ability."
bad,Each manager makes his/her own rules and don't follow what corporate wants us to do. They don't listen to associates concerns and even though they pay good per hour they give you very little hours.
bad,It's a good place to work. I have many friends there I have worked there for 3 years and I like it.i was first hired in grocery I didn't like grocery very much. I was working in the deli for a while. Then finally I transferred to clothing and I like it very much
bad,was not worth the drive to get there grafton was a little to wierd to work at. I had no choice on time off cause they always gave time off to their special little groups of people
bad,you couldn't paid enough to ever work at Walmart again. if i had been liveing with family i would have been homeless and i could not even afford food at lunch with what they paid me.
bad,"Walmart is really not the company it once was, They used to have respect for the associate and after 10 years there I learned the associate is just a number to the company. The chances to move up and grow in your career are limited, I am thankful for the experience I got there but I would never go back to work for walmart."
bad,"I have been employed by Walmart twice now, two different locations. Both locations have been an absolute mess. The turn over rate is through-the-roof. The people they decide to employ for management positions are awful. Most Team leaders treat their associates like they are less than. Corporate and actual location employees and managers don't have solid communication, the work place is so unorganized and so unstructured, some people are following policies and some aren't. Systems set in place fail."
bad,"Managers are illiterate and horrible.  They forced me to work overtime without pay since I was an Assistant Manager and did not clock in/out, so they took advantage of it."
bad,at first it was cool but after awhile the management were very annoying you could b working and they'll tell you your not and they had a set time for everything not a great stress free place to b working if u ask me.
bad,I wouldn't recommend Walmart as a career starter. More like a job for highschool students or retired people. You cannot make a living from this job unless you work double shifts.
bad,Terrible treatment and no respect and the managers are useless and harsh they made you download an app just to find out what days you work and if the app fails then that's your problem according to the management.... wouldn't recommend this job to my worst of enemies..
bad,"Management is constantly contradicting each other and will not back up an employee no matter right or wrong"
bad,"Management was rude, unfair, cruel, had unrealistic expectations on purpose to throw us off just so they could yell at us. It drove my supervisor to insanity."
bad,"If you work at this place and come down with the flu and you get put out of work by a DOCTOR with a MEDICAL NOTE, they will NOT accept the note! I was told to work even though I had the flu and was highly contagious!!!"
bad,Worked too hard and not taken care of. No room for growth within the company. All outside hires hired into management positions. Associates are not cared about. just a number.
bad,You had no knowledge of who was in charge on your first day. The managers played favoritism and there attitudes were horrible to those who were not there favorite. It took a very long time to get assistance from the Customer Service Managers especially in the evenings.
bad,"I hated it the people are all fakes and every body acts like they love you, the management Is unfair and plays favorite so forget about that promotion."
bad,"Management didn't care at all about any employees at the bottom, who were not in management level. Management always talked down to you, never considered your comments to improve the flow of sales. Salary was always low wages, & never affording to gives good wages increases. Me, as a sale associates brought increased sales for October,November, & December in your assigned areas,  never given recognition for your hard work, not ever by the Store Management."
bad,Don't apply to work at Wal-Mart.. They work you like a slave and gets mad about it when you say something... They talk about you behind your back and everything
bad,At Walmart all you are is a number they don't care about there employees or there families.  Walmart is a place you work if you have no other choices.
bad,It was employment to maintain income until a reliable job came along. The Management did not care what happened to its employee's. They has constant areas where they called people off their breaks to help employees. they accused and punished before the facts were presented. Not a place i would consider working for again.
bad,Walmart is cut throat and the Management is criminal.  It needs a union so bad but a good union.  Something really needs to change there I feel bad for the people that work there.  Just don't work there if you can help it.
bad,"The typical day of a Walmart associate is a hard one, the average person is ill-treated not only by management but to the people shopping as well. Everyone is never there when you actually need them or don't bother showing up when called."
bad,"Sam Walton founded Walmart on Respect, Dignity and valued the Customers.  That is not the case with the current way the Company is being run and managed."
bad,notoriously bad place to work. it's as bad as you'd expect. even if your manager loves you and you're a hard worker they have to adhere to ridiculous corporate policies.
bad,"while my coworkers were kind some of the managers were very rude, training was short, no one would help me if asked to. very inconsiderate when it comes to illness if it isnt approved through the sedgewick leave program."
bad,"This company is terrible, they have taken away so much of the employee benefits that used to make it a very nice place to work. They train management to be excruciatingly difficult to all employees, especially if they make over a certain dollar amount per hour."
bad,"-Let's start off with the lies. "
bad,I push carts like a robot that is what they liked and no one answers when you asks for help when you do a carry out that required a team lift they think we are useless tool that can just be thrown away
bad,Hated every minute of it. Management was atrocious and slack jawed at best. will stab you in the back the minute you turn around then smile in your face.
bad,management thinks its okay to disrespect employees if you don't do what they say they threaten your job even if its not in your job description if you try to move up they brush you off even though thats what they claim to pride themselves on helping employees move up
bad,waking up at 4 am to get to work to be a cap one associate. which is basically just stocking shelves and unloading the trucks. the hardest part of my day would be just waking up in the morning at 3am.
bad,Bad experience and I don’t recommend this to anyone that’s looking to actually to using this to pay bills   Or maintain anytype of life. Yea it’s not worth it
bad,"The managers never know what they want done, they contradict themselves and pick favorites. Nothing ever gets done properly no one cares about health and safety procedures. The people are horrible. You won't get enough hours and the managers don't care about your availability. Don't work here."
bad,It’s to hot ... customer service there sucks .. the management never spoke to the associate ... called for manager and never showed ... to many people
bad,I worked at Wal-Mart for a few months before I found out I was pregnant. I was told that even if I had a note from my doctor I would not be allowed to transfer to a different department. The managers are terrible and cold.
bad,I was a frozen dairy associate my job was to go in the freezer down stack pallets and put the merchandise on the shelf.Everyday I was constantly harassed  by management because of my skin color.
bad,"walmart sucks, management, workers, pay, hours, everything. they did have a cute Spanish girl who was my CSM eventually. i bagged her of course and now shes my wife. best thing i got out of there"
bad,i met some incredible people in my time at wall-mart but with the amazing there were definitely just as many people that made it one of the worst experiences iv ever had i dont know if it was just my store or not.
bad,Management is non helpful or time punctual with problems. Don't fix problems that rise with machinery. Broke own safety regulations. Don't Force cleanliness in the workplace
bad,Walmart is a horrible place to work especially the walmart on Greenbrier in Normal. Management is horrible they do not have any respect for the employees. I would not recommend this job to anyone. if you are a student they will tell you they will work with you but once your in they will over schedule you and tell you to prioritize walmart which is totally insane. Management sticks together and will not care if a member of management is in the wrong.  if this is your last and ONLY option then apply but if you are in desperate need of a job apply.
bad,"Management is clueless and they choose favorites horribly, and will find a way to fire people they dont like, most of the management sleep together or with associates."
bad,The management was so horrible and rude to us. They didn’t except doctors note. They don’t seem concerned about their employees at all. It was all about them.
bad,"Most terrible job I’ve ever worked at , poor management they are not about the customers most depressing job ever , dirty bathrooms never cleaned. "
bad,"I felt like my young life was Bing drained in more ways than one! Management played favorites with employees so some people had to do way more work than others. Management sucks, they're annoying, horrible people they don't even treat you like a human being! Unless you literally have no life DO NOT work here!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,Walmart does not care if you get hurt on the job and will let you go if you are not able to do your job instead of giving a temporary job till you recover like them did years ago.
bad,They treat the associates poorly.Management is only concerned about them self’s and the bonus they can make.They were at one time a good company but not anymore.
bad,"Management was not team oriented, they preferred to give orders and then take the credit for completing the task. Employees were underpaid and overworked."
bad,"If you want to be worked like a dog, be under-valued and treated as disposable, then Walmart is the place for you!  If you do your job well, they will not help you advance - they want you where you are.  A very negative and depressing environment - not healthy!"
bad,"To be honest the job is relatively easy, all you have to do is to sort out the items from a pallet to their respective aisle and then start stocking. The people I work are really great people they're very friendly and willing to give a hand when it is convenient, SOME of them though. Management is not so great, and pay ,sucks. So if i we're to rate this job I would give a it 5 out of a 10."
bad,"Walmart warehouse is dirty, dusty, no air condition, no breaks except for 30 min for lunch."
bad,"Walmart benefits are great, the management sucks because they have the reasons to favorite there employees and don’t a knowledge all of them in the same way. Walmart isn’t a great place to work but it is one of the best due to benefits and time."
bad,"Check in and work till my first break. It was common not to have anybody to relieve me for a break so I ended up working through my breaks a lot. Though they always made sure we got lunch, due to fact they didn't want us to sue them. I learned that Walmart tries to brainwash you to think that unions are a bad thing because they'll take care of you and they'll never do anything to take advantage of you. Management at my store was kinda of a joke and reason why is that Walmart fired most of them and made other manger pick up slack. They over work for sure and most of them working 80 plus hours week just get everything done."
bad,"Walmart is a good place like if your in college, and trying to make a living while in school, but not for a living. There are no benefits until you have at least been with the company for a year. He days are long and your management is not te"
bad,Walmart has ever changing shifts and schedules and the store is extremely busy on weekends and holidays. I would be at Walmart from 7 to 8 hours 3 days a week. There are times where we would get weekends and holidays off and the environment is rather fast paced.
bad,"Walmart is not a go place to work for. "
bad,overall walmart is a great company but it too can improve every company can improve. work many positions met a lot great people. a mix of the minds. can
bad,never  have  I  have  a  more  miserable  working  experience  than    the  time  I  spent  at  Walmart.    never  again  will  I  work  at  a Walmart.
bad,"kept busy breaking load. supervisors would stand around, not help out and then say that clerks were not doing their jobs.workplace culture was not very good. I liked getting to know my fellow coworkers"
bad,It's not fair when you go to management when you have been wrongfully accused. There was management present but higher ups did not listen. Assumptions are not the truth.
bad,"Manger dislikes military,favoritism among others from some assistant managers, understaffed and work load is placed on small crews. Advancement is given to people who are butt kissers and not the hard working one's."
bad,"This place is just awful to work for. Don't expect any help from anyone for just about anything. Walmart is a joke to work for, nothing they say in the interview actually happens. You get treated like a second class citizen depending on who doesn't like you."
bad,Not a good company to work for bad management horrible organization they do not care about theyre employees I was fired because I became pregnant while working for them which is discrimnation and I am in the process of sueing them
bad,"I loved my job , but when new management comes in and makes their own rules, cutting hours for hard working associates, it was my time to leave.They work you all over in different departments while only paying you for the job u got hired on at. If you work overtime they make u take it off on Friday and on your lunch break. It's no overtime at walmart.I hate I gave them 6.5 years of my life."
bad,It was a great way to start building my customer service skills. also to be accustomed to work with a variety of people. Also engaging with the public.
bad,walmart is a money hungry company who does not care about its employees it treats you like a number and is only worried about your productivity and nothing else
bad,"Arguably one of the worst jobs I've ever work. Worked me to the bone for a mediocre paycheck. Management was iffy, hours sucked, had to work on major holidays."
bad,"It's hard to say everything that happens in a workday here. It consists of ringing up customers, handling cash, bagging, and general maintenance upfront. If you work in a fresh department you could be doing deli; slicing meats and cheeses, doing rotisserie chicken and oven-fried foods, or baking breads and cookies. Fresh departments also had to pull products from fridge and freezers to stock. Overnights stocked the floor and you worked independently so that's a plus. However, Walmart is the number one user of social benefits in the US despite being a very fortunate multi-national retailer. They tell you your store will bonus and there's profit sharing but that all depends on your store and the duration of your employment there. They also don't trust you to have a discount card until after 3 months of employment. The culture lacks, and not enough pay."
bad,I left because I couldn’t work for someone who didn’t want to care for employees. I didn’t like working for them because of lack of safety. They made me work outside in a lightning storm
bad,Overall walmart is a slave driver and the people who work hard is treated bad and the lazy people is treated as if they are gods i would never work for them again
bad,"I wish I never would have gotten this job. THis was my first job off the back of a discharge medically from the army. I love working with my hands. I did love talking with customers but this was more than just that. I hated how I was viewed as a number, not a person."
bad,i felt like a slave working at Walmart. they coach you for EVERYTHING there. if you work overtime they make you cut it. u have to take a longer lunch or go home early so they don't have to pay you for the overtime you worked and if you don't do it. they WILL write you up (coach you)
bad,"Unrealistic expectations in an unreasonable amount of time. The management does not work, they just delegate. Also, you answer to 7 different bosses, each telling you to do something different."
bad,worked at wal-mart for 4 years. no advancement. company does not cover medical bills if injured on the job. managers do not care if you are injured they will allow you to work in heavy lifting departments.
bad,"I worked at walmart for about a year and the people there are a blast to work with. The management was ok. Some were better than others, but if you mess up once they hold it against you."
bad,"My husband at the time lost feeling in his legs suddenly, when I told a member of management I had to leave and didn't know when I would be back I was told he would take care of it but my ""exit interview"" which I wasn't even there for states I was 3 days no call no show and had quit. They will not even try to provide a semi-regular schedule, I once worked for 10 days straight with no days off alternating between early mornings and late nights and because of how the pay period fell I didn't get over part time and they were still covered by me having 4 days in a pay period. A manager refused to let me and another cashier switch shifts so she could be with her kids during their Christmas event. All and all not a good place to work."
bad,This happens to be my first job. I was in the middle of school activities and told them that when I was first hired on. They tried to fire me after the first 9 months because of my co-curricular activities. Had to open door the manager. Ended up leaving for senior year.
bad,The managers were rude they cut my hours it was ridiculous they don’t train enough and they change your hours too much there was no set schedule I couldn’t handle it
bad,"I started working as a cashier in walmart, but started to hate the job, it was so consumming and oculdnt keep with my school scheule, people and costumers are not friendly"
bad,The last 2 years of my job at Walmart I tried getting help from Walmart because of an unfit member of management over me nobody believed me that stress this manager put on me caused knee damage .fatigue I got sick to many times so I lost my job .
bad,"This store was poorly managed, and the worker-to-customer ratio was insufficient to meet the needs and expectations of store patrons.  Lines were typically long (especially evenings), and managers were slow to call department staff for backup on the front-end/checkout.  The low pay-rate was a demotivating factor for most employees, and performance reviews were always behind-schedule.  My primary role was to process point-of sale and returns, but there was rarely enough staff on-hand to accommodate the sheer volume of customers."
bad,They need all new management and workers. That place is worse than highschool. Co workers are unreliable along with the manegers. Not able to get jobs done because people like to be lazy in that place.
bad,"Maintenance management is incompetent, and place priorities of work in the wrong places.  Too concerned about saving face than actually executing good repairs."
bad,when i started i was receiving 34 hours per week. after a year my hours were majorly cut and i barley get 17 and some weeks i get 4. my manager says he will fix it but it never gets it fixed. the new software system that is doing the scheduling is cutting everyone hours. due to Walmart policy if you work less than 16 hours in a week you are subject to termination.
bad,Underpaid and overworked from not enough employees. Always trying to catch up. Too many people that don't want to be there. I like the work but I don't like the process. Too many bosses contradicting each other.
bad,I love to work with other people I love to meet new people help people when they in need I’m smart love to work and I’m always on time  I’m never late
bad,"poor management and races because of favorites, hostile environment.  Management are poor because they don't care who is working hard  or not all they care is favorites. They now that if they let me work to long in Walmart I will everything . They let me go because of a person that don't like me and that person is the management and the employee."
bad,Walmart I worked a few years at different locations always drama and management always needed investigation hours are given but for those that have a family they honestly never consider anything outside of walmart
bad,Management can be hard on employees.  Store manager treats employees like a dollar sign.  No care for employees.  Hope this has changed since I worked there
bad,Good for students in high school or college. Pay is low and not close to what you should be paid for dealing with management and rude customers. Work while you find better opportunities.
bad,I admit I messed in my past but when i applied this year to Walmart in eau Claire its like the store manger didn't care about anything only to protect himself and it really unfair how he treated me and told me bad things about me its like he had no heart or anything but in all it is a good company like and company they need better mangers
bad,"They have changed several things over the last few years. Such as PTO accumulation, sick time, benefits, punching in and out, overtime, etc. which I have become unhappy with."
bad,it sucked all day  they don't provide water for when its hot the other employees doesn't even work together as a team and i learned how to use a cart machine
bad,"Wal-Mart is widely known for underpaying it's workers. You don't need an Indeed.com review to tell you this, everything everywhere for decades has told you this."
bad,You will not have a life if you work for this company. They basically own you. If you do not comply to a change in your schedule you are gone.  It doesn't matter if it is outside your availability.
bad,You will not get a good review from me about Walmart. I refuse to shop there unless its an emergency. After my employment I did some research and I believe the Walmart corporation to be a business of greed and human suffering throughout the world
bad,"then after several weeks, they cut me to like 12 hours a week.  Gave me the excuse that they are not allowed to hire full time.  That's not what I was told in my interview."
bad,"This is hardest job ever, carry more than 50lb, manager is pushing around, stressful environment, the stoking of cooler, health hazard, and severe pain in the body. I hated it and quit. Do not do this job."
bad,"My experience working for Walmart was not very pleasant. I was mistreated in a way, that I would never recommend anyone that I know to work there. I was one of many, that were mistreated and wrongfully terminated."
bad,"I did not love this job.  It helped me get by for a little bit, but nothing to get excited about.  I enjoyed the customer service aspect of it.  I like working with the public. But, the hours, the pay and the skills set needed were beneath  me.  I don't mean to sound pompus.  IO just was not happy with this job.  I needed a career, and I had to do thiks to make ends meet."
bad,"Not a good place treatment of employees are just not right to much of a trun over people leave even people that's been there a long time"
bad,"Not a good place to work, but good place to shop. The lower paid employees do all of the hard work while the managers just delegate. Management is rude, and the time of rules are too strict. I was scared to call out even when I was very sick because of the limit the have. Not a good place to work."
bad,it did not satisfy my needs for advancement as well as the feeling of being a valuable employee. I did enjoy some of my co-workers though we all seemed to feel the same way about being under paid and under appreciated. I hope they find a way to work on that there.
bad,"it sucks, they treat you like garbage. pay is a joke and they don't care about you or whatever personal problems you're having at home. they give you short amount of hours for little to no pay"
bad,"Mangament is terrible, too demanding, they have attitudes all they time, some people never show up to work, they make you do extra work for free, no one stays in their departments."
bad,Walmart offers many different management opportunities.  Many managers transfer frequently to other stores so there are frequent job opportunities.  They also do not require experience to hire.
bad,The salary of employees with this company was barely at minimum wage. The crudity of of conduct of employees bordered on harassment. Workplace absences were frequent and paid time off was very uncommon.
bad,Walmart does not take of their workers. The customers don’t treat the employees poorly. In a rude manner with no regard for the employees life’s. No benefits and employees come and go
bad,"While Wal-mart has the biggest corporation in America, it lacks the foundation for career advancement. Typical employees will work for many years and barely, if at all, receive advancement options. Wal-mart as a whole is a totalitarian corporation where the employees have no say in their work."
bad,"The Managers and Assistance Managers at East Stroudsburg Wal-Mart all need training on customer service, communication, and  overall leadership skills."
bad,"Long time Home Office associate. This company has seriously lost its way. They have one mission. Report every nickel profit they can to shareholders.  Minn benefits, incompetant managers, very sub average compensation, absolitely  positovely NO excuses for missing days. Medical, kids, family - NONE. No team building. You make your numbers or you are disciplined.  Pay incoming associates as much as they can and “lay off” anyone approachjng retirement.  General attitude of management is we are giving you a job, if you don’t like it apply somewhere else.  Micromanaging, toxic workplaces..  This company has become the evil it was once portrayed as."
bad,"I don't believe the company itself to promote toxic management or employment cultures, but I do believe the store I worked at specifically had significant issues because of the workplace culture it promoted. "
bad,Working for Walmart was the worst experience ever they had me stalking multiple areas including one that I needed to keep my eyes on all the time if you missed the bus and couldn't make it to work you got a point against you if you were late because of the bus got half the points against you most of the managers were cool but then you got a few that just were outto get you
bad,Jovem aprendiz no mercado nacional da empresa walmart.
bad,The managers were rude they didn't care about their employees I didn't agree how they treated the employees with disabilitys and i wouldn't really recomend anyone to work there.
bad,As I began my first few months at Walmart the work was pretty okay. Until they start losing people then the work became stressful on me and it was a lack of poor management.
bad,The management try to shift blame in case things goes south. A typical day or any day is very stressful as it is very fast paced environment. It is easy to get in if its your first job.
bad,Walmart was the worst job ive ever had. the management is poor and they don't care about their employees. i would never recommend this place to anyone.
bad,"I think Walmart is automatically associated with absolutely miserable employees. Although I was not miserable and enjoyed staying busy, I think overall Walmart is probably one of the greediest companies on this earth. It shows on the faces of employees, stressed, cancer runs rampant and people often cannot afford a ride to work or food for lunch."
bad,Associates are overworked. There is an atmosphere of discrimination. There is no advancement for middle-aged women. Management and corporate bend the rules to fit their needs. There is no flexibility for associates.
bad,"Stocked, cashiered, interacted with customers. very multi-tasked position.  As the largest retail chain in the world, Walmart must hire on and maintain sizable staffs of sales associates to provide customer service. Workers falling under the job title of sales associate take responsibility for greeting customers, locating products, price-checking items, and organizing store shelves and displays."
bad,"If you have mental health issues do not work here. People will find out you are struggling and pick at you even worse. I’ve been told to suck it up, get over it, get on drugs, etc. Nothing even happened to the guy to locked me in the freezer as “joke” Even management joined in on this torture. I would avoid at all costs, they have probably set back my recovery time significantly."
bad,"terrible experience, I would never work there again in a million years. They tried to pin fraudulant returns on me when the customer themselves tricked me!!! its a terrible place to work. they treat you like ants"
bad,"the management was horrible, there was absolutely no room for advancing my career at Walmart. I was harassed mercilessly by the store manager for no reason at all whatsoever."
bad,"do not work here, this is the worst place I have ever worked, this is not sams dream of what wal mart should be, they do not always have the lowest prices"
bad,"awful place to work I am glad I am done there.  The people you deal with are normally unpleasant and cranky, always under staffed and hours fuxuate a lot."
bad,"During my employment, there was no ability to advance in the company. HUGE lack of pay for work given! Benefits were horrible and managers even worse! A lot of favoritism in each store."
bad,Manager was the lazy in hypocritical people I ever work with in my life. It’s was an awesome hole from the beginning they only wanted to save their selfs when it was time to get work done
bad,Management at WalMart is mostly non-existent. Managers take naps in the management office as well as extended 2+ hour lunches. Personnel are placed outside their areas of responsibility with no area coverage and then blamed when they were not allowed to work their department and the job did not get done. Work there if you need to in order to not be homeless.
bad,"there is nothing good I can say about Walmart. Management will lie to your face, abuse your loyalty and have unrealistic expectations. "
bad,I hated working for walmart the managers were always rude and never had a nice thing to say to you. They would yell at you if you werent moving fast enough for them.
bad,"my manager treated me very poorly and interrogated me in the security room after lying to other management. I was having health problems at the time and he said that I could switch to another position privately, then, in front of a camera, told me that he never said such a thing. The pay raise at Walmart is a joke, you don't make 10$ an hour until you've been working there for six months."
bad,"When i first started, there wasnt anything wrong with the shift other than learning how to stack product on the pallets. But as the company grew and managers got switched around, the shift was unbearable. Managers do not know what they are doing, they treat certain employees badly, company treats you like you are nothing and keeps pushing and pushing wanting more from everyone. A lot of employees, including management, is leaving walmart because of how they are treated. Hardest part of picking would be trying to meet the production requirement."
bad,If your not a favorite your over look favouritism goes along way in our store. You make just as much as people who just started after being there 8 years.
bad,"They have poor management, and no care for their employees, they make you work in very hot temps and dont a low extra time to cool off, and work every holiday with straight pay. Except Christmas you get off, just not paid"
bad,"A typical day would involve managers requesting hard workers to go above and beyond their job description, while allowing lazier workers to not perform their required duties. The work enviroment is pretty hostile, a lot of gossip and unprofessional workers. There is no real enjoyable part of this job."
bad,"A typical day at work would be slow to quick paced, the pay is not worth it because customers are allowed to harass, threaten or treat employees with disrespect just to earn business. It is more of no matter what it is always the employees fault even if the employee goes out of their way or job description for the customer and they are not satisfied. Management does nothing if a customer harasses, mistreats or threatens employees. The pay does sound good but when hired hours will be cut and the expected pay is not made for that position. Unable to talk to management such as transferring if unsatisfied with current position and when it is done they say it will take a very long time and may not go through. No interest for the employee at all if anything after being hired they are ignored when they talk to management about issues such as customers harassing, threatening or mistreating employees. Training almost doesn't exist it is done on the computer which does very little and management such as supervisors are even less trained some do not know how to fix or address issues with the department so it makes it a hostile work environment.  Over all rating it is not worth working for this Walmart."
bad,"coverage of sales floor horrible, wanting 1 employee to do to many departments at one time, not enough hours, firing employees for missing a day for being sick"
bad,its  not a good job to work you will not like they lie to you they tret you like trash they undering pay people just not a plase people want to work really
bad,"Management changes about every 6 months. Store 1552 is a training store for manager's so about  the time they figure out each persons strengths and weaknesses, they are changing again. None of the existing problems get resolved. There is never enough help for the departments so therefore customer service is bad. The self checkouts helped some but the lines are always long for checking out. So management calls all the sales floor help to the front to run checkouts, that is the ones that work."
bad,"Managers play favorites and you can't succeed when you have managers like that. Managers don't say thank you, they demand you to do your job and plus other employees job. Saying ""Thanks"" goes far with employees."
bad,"Managers were very rude and nasty to employees. Requesting time off was really hard. Pay was very low. No room for overtime. No holiday pay, No room to get 40 hours a week."
bad,"Sueldo bajo, pocas prestaciones, pésimo ambiente laboral, preferencias a las jóvenes para ascensos además de hostigamiento laboral por parte de los superiores jerárquicos."
bad,"Walmart is a bad very employee. The management wasn't good. The hours were horrible, and the schedules weren't flexible. Some of the managers were very rude. They did not offer the employees enough trainees, and once they targeted an employee they didn't like, they got rid of that employee through whatever means possible."
bad,Literally the worst place to work on earth. Never have a set schedule even after working there for over 15 years! Veterans are grunts to them! Won't allow us to use our PTO without fear of disciplinary action.
bad,They work there employees into the ground and are not lenient with emergencys after a period of time and any worlers comp injury is the employees fault no matter what and will be written up as well as a point to your record which goes against moving up management wise
bad,seriously hated working for them because the management team was too chaotic and they were a new store so they did not have all of there ducks in a row
bad,They don't care about their employees whatsoever. They won't give full time to us because they don't want us to reap the benefits but will work us full time.
bad,"Poor company to work for. Mangers continually stab employees in back lots of retaliation from superiors, store manger has unprofessional behavior towards female employees, poor poor work environment."
bad,This is one of the worst companies I have ever worked for was worked to death and never told thank you or ever given anybody to help therefore had to work long hours and received no benefits
bad,stressful day at work too many call outs and not enough hours to much freight and dirty restrooms many people coming in and out of the store at all times
bad,"Terrible jon, treated terrible by the managers and other employees. Called part time, but full time hours unless you are injured, then they cut your hours till you quit cause 4 hours a week isn't enough to live."
bad,Its Wal mart money for the rich not for the workers. not much time with family you will be at work all the time or they will cut your hours so you cant make a living and they will want you on call at all times
bad,"The lack of respect is hard for so many people. That is one of the reasons the overturn is so high."
bad,"walmart is not the best place to work."
bad,I hated it when I walked in the store I would immediately feel depressed. The only thing I learned there was how to use a cash register. I don't even like shopping there anymore.
bad,Management was awful. They would blame people of things when it was some one else. They just suck all together the hardest part was not the labor but the management is bad.
bad,unfair bad management they are bad to the employees they work you hard for less pay. they don't care if you do your best Walmart just want the work done for less pay.
bad,"poor management, unrealistic work goals, longer you work their the less your opinion counts . Many people have left the Walmart or people that have worked there for along time got fired. I hope all walmarts are not like this ."
bad,I did not like the place. It didnt pay very well and the hours were not very good either. The people you work for are rude and so are alot of the customers.
bad,not flexible at all with schedule wasent flexible about working with schedule and during training was told that they would fix any problems but did not fix just reported as false info and in less then a week of working already let me go and I had tried talking to managers about it but nothing  so I would not recormend anyone trying keep a job here a lot of favortisum and not very promising job and not very flexible at all
bad,Not the greatest place to work but it was a job at the time. Stressful and busy all the time. People are nosey and are in your business. For a pay check it was good pay but the work environment isn't were it should be.
bad,go to work every day just do not know what your walking into with your job every week it is something with your job after you have been off you come back with new information about them cutting your hours or down sizing in the office going from 40 hrs to 32 hrs weekly
bad,"Management doesn't care about the associates. They tell you one thing and do another. Schedules are never consistent. Hours are always cut so management can make bonuses with no overtime for associates. Always begging customers to get a Walmart credit card, even though they already tried and didn't get one."
bad,"The Walmart store here should be closed. It is the worst job place i have ever had. I f you like work for a company and be watch, talked, about, or lied to, then go to work for this company."
bad,My typical day at work was being on the cash register the whole time. I got lunch and breaks. I remember being really bored. This job wasn't a good fit for me. But the management was horrible. When I worked at Walmart I thought it was a joke and I don't recommend this job to anyone. This is when I started to hate working in retail. I was not treated fairly either. The employees were rude and impatient. I am glad the employees took their job seriously but when I was working at Walmart I was naive at the time and didn't know what I was doing.
bad,Management was terrible and inconsiderate of my situation when I was pregnant even though I work 30+ hours a week and always came to work on time. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!
bad,I wouldn’t recommend this place to work. It’s all about who you know. They don’t  look at the hard work you put forth. They are not very considerate of others. Very childish and not professional at all.
bad,I feel that Walmart is unorganized and have no structure. They have no flexibility with your scheduling and don't care about nothing but points. They don't care how good of a worker you are.
bad,The management is horrible here and personnel is not very personable. The way this company operates is horrible and they don't pay you what you actually deserve and you can't live on what they pay you.
bad,worse place to work no body had team work or would help if you got behind on trying to take care of customers I beleave in team work and helping coworkers
bad,I've enjoyed working for Wal-Mart for the short period  of time. the only thing I missed was the friendly people. Wal-Mart  could've been a better experience for me if I didn't have trouble  with some of the staff about me  finding someone to cover my shift due to having had a child that was born with multiple disability which I don't have anymore because she's deceased. Now my work ethic has improved
bad,Working at Walmart became a stressful way of life. Never feeling like you were good enuff to work or do your job right. The customers were decent for the most part but there was never a peaceful moment.
bad,"open door policy is a joke and upper management not very friendly,open, or understanding.  The pay is low and not much room for advancement.  To get an upper management role one would have to be cut throat."
bad,i felt as though it was a very poor place to work and in my opinion they really didnt seem to care about there employees that much. not to mention we never made above mininmum wage
bad,"Worked there for nearly 7 years. Very cliquey. Don't recommend to anyone. Poorly paid. Some employees worked very hard and some were more ""tenured"" and were very slow/bad at their job and the treatment of all employees didn't reflect that. Got 32ish hours of vacation after being there for 2 years. Disclaimer - I was relatively well treated for the place, but it still sucked. Avoid at all costs."
bad,"Poor working environment with little to no effective communication.   Hours given to associates vary weekly so one week you may get 40 the next you may be scheduled 5, in order to prevent associates from achieving full time status."
bad,Had problems with personal issues addressed to them and did not care for my health and safety at all or ever for the time I was there...not a fun environment
bad,"Très mal gérer, n'écoutent pas l'avis des employés, ne savent pas gérer les horaires, les assistants gérants sont peu-jamais présent, peu d'organisation"
bad,"very busy did most of the work, filling scrpit, answer phones, waiting on customers. counting medications, and anything else that needed to be done by pharmacist request."
bad,"Walmart is the most hypocritical place ever. I was fired for getting angry, while I saw someone literally punch someone else in the face and he didn't get fired. I never got a second chance for losing my temper once, but the guy who punched another coworker in the face got a second chance."
bad,Criminals and morons work overnight here. Illegals and convicts get hired here. Mental asylums push for them to hire their patients. If you've just been released from prison apply here
bad,"There are constant issues with scheduling, customers are rude and entitled and because of the company culture feel they are permitted to act that way. The culture of the company is high stress, low happiness, and they seem content to stay that way."
bad,Not a good place to work.Every week they increased the amount of production in each line. Production belts always get stuck affecting production groups
bad,Everyone knows how walmart is... not much of a career type job and the pay is disgraceful. cant forget to mention the flak you get from management and/or other employees even when completing job tasks beyond what your asked of.
bad,Terrible hours. You'll be homeless if this is your only income and you pay rent. The employees are disrespectful to one another and management does nothing but feed into it.
bad,"I worked at Walmart for nearly a year, and I can honestly say it was one of my worst experiences of my life. They have poor management and they are understaffed."
bad,Management has favorable employees that can change positions like ants at a picnic!  Schedule is a joke not enough cashiers for work in evenings managers don’t care about assiciates
bad,Management was always watching and coming down on employees for anything at all. You couldn't be a minute late and they would get bent out of shape. The pay moving from cashier to lower management was less than fifty cents with all the responsibilty of running the front end of the store and accounting for every employee that worked on the front lines. They would not allow you to work full time hours because they fought to keep you from getting insurance and benefits. Write ups would happen if you worked more than 38 hours.
bad,"Management  doesn't care about you as a person. You will get terrible hours, terrible pay, and treated like garbage. Never work for this company. Wal-Mart will not provide you anything useful."
bad,"I would not even tell people to get  job there, there treat there employees very well , they do not pay them fair. If you get hurt, they would find a way to get rid of you."
bad,Don’t do it don’t do it don’t do it. Worst job ever. No body ever really works. Everyone just is miserable there. The management don’t even care about u
bad,This was my first job and I had terrible managers who all ended up leaving or getting fired. I was once written up for walking around the store on my break and I know people who were fired for getting injured on the job.
bad,overall anyone who has ever worked for walmart already knows that the hours suck just as bad as the management walmart is not for the weak and kind you have to have no emotions working for this company
bad,The people in management was not consistent or kind or compassionate towards me or the fact i got injured on the job and did everything i was supposed to do and they still fired me.
bad,"Spent 20+ years with company, enjoyed being hourly associate. As a manager there was no work/life balance, too many long days and late nights for the pay."
bad,Save yourself the trouble of being treated like a number because that is exact what you become. The work is work but  management is less than desirable for a large-scale company that has been in business for years.
bad,"I was not pleased with this job. I worked overnight. There was no advancement in this area, not enough pay for what I was doing. not enough raises, and again I had small children at home."
bad,I wouldn't recommend working here because they fired me for being admitted in the hospital.. They are rude and they give not really good help and don't really know what there doing...
bad,I been there for almost 6 months and I witnessed and been a victim to how the managers treat their employees and its not good i got written up for stuff i didnt do and they refused to remove points they gave me while i was on a approved leave and they told me that they would remove them and they never removed them all just one and it made me over on the points and they fired me for being over.
bad,"WalMart was fine for temporary job, but not long term. The management is not helpful. You get a lot of hours occasionally but anytime you need time off or have an emergency its counted against you."
bad,"the deli is not apart of walmart. the management has expectations of workers but are not present at critical times. they go off word of people they trust (favorites) and exploit minorities. closing shifts are punished as a group and no real path towards advancement. hard work doesn't matter, but who's butt you kiss will get you far."
bad,WoulWouldn't work at Walmart poor customers service. Poor communication. Within managers and workers. Will not meet the workers schedules or hours. Poor benefits and vac. Hours
bad,Was very unhappy working in the company. It wasn't like that at first but after thanksgiving was the major point in the downfall. Working Thanksgiving evening. For basic pay and a 15% coupon to spend in the store. So for my hard work and time spent away from my family. My reward was to spend money at the company i work for. Biggest slap in the face ever.
bad,I stood around for 7 hours some days just moving things on shelves forward. I asked to be a cashier and they told me that they had too many and then the next week they hired my friend as a cashier.
bad,"This company is as bad to work for as you have heard it is. Hours are never the same, and tend to get cut if sales are not super great. benifits are poor, and the pay is way below what is needed for even minimum cost of living."
bad,I don't like wal Mart as a whole.  It is a company that has ruined American small towns and mom and pop stores.  It Was a job when I needed one so I took it was never happy there
bad,walmart doesnt hire full time they refuse to pay benefits and demand you work full time hours for part time pay. and dont promote females they would rather promote a man first. they dont pay enough to evedn live or pay your bills.
bad,"At first I enjoyed my job, but then I began to notice our company runs on a lot of favoritism and poor management. You have to be someones favorite to make it far in the company and when you aren't on that favorite list they pay attention to only what you do wrong and nothing on what you do right. Everyone always has an attitude and no one is on the same page with our ""team"" or our customers."
bad,"Dysfunctional, chaotic, unprofessional, unproductive, extremely poor management, disrespectful of employees. Work schedules are often messed up, and often changed without knowledge or approval of employees."
bad,well I was working as a freight handler which is loading trailers for Walmart... very fast paced job and employees are not friendly... when you are finished your trailer then you can help the next guy till you get your new trailer to load.. so when you help out the next guy he will walk away and leave you in there loader trailers all alone then he appears  when you are done with with trailer..its crazy
bad,"The schedule is set but not posted properly, it's unprofessional, unfriendly. Management has improved but was very uncooperative and unhelpful.all in all I'd say never work there."
bad,"I would not work there again and i would not recommend anyone to work there. It was the worst company i have ever worked for. Poor management, lack of decent hours and not family friendly."
bad,I worked very hard for Walmart but was not appreciated at all. The young kids they hired didn't want to work at all and a lot of times did not show up and you were responsible for taking on their workload.
bad,CSM were mean to me. They yelled at me across the floor and in front of customers. Not all CSM followed the same rules. CSM's had their favorite associate that they let get away with talking and cutting up. Were in my case if I spoke to another associate I got yelled it. Management were just as bad. They only listened to the CSM and never your side. If you looked off from them to look at something else you were rolling your eyes at them. The hardest part as trying to get alone with the other associates. There wasn't a enjoyable part of this job. I was afraid to go in to work on a daily bases.
bad,Working at Walmart was a terrible experience. Bad management through and through. Employees were fighting with each other to gain more control over who ran the store and how. Abysmal workplace environment. Stay far away.
bad,This company is a joke. The pay is terrible and the workers are as well. Never would work here ever again. Its a decent job for a high school student.
bad,not enough hours or wages to make a living without working multiple jobs or go on welfare. benefits too expensive. policies unfair to workers with seniority. workers play well together. policies not conducive to a happy work atmosphere.
bad,"Some people in management will abuse you for the sake that it makes them feel better that they've been working at Walmart for 15 years and if there isn't anyone willing to stop it in a higher position than you'll be stuck like that until you quit. Some places are much better than others but when it's bad, it's really bad.   "
bad,"management sucked there is no open door policy everybody knows about everyone business, favoritism to the max!"
bad,Working at Walmart was very stressful . the managers where very rude and disrespectful i was there for 6 years and im very happy to be out of there they are very unorganized
bad,"No one can handle a stressful situation, and the management is unprofessional and uses personal feelings to manage their employees. The ability to keep focused on following protocol and keeping items stocked is limited at best, and those who should take responsibility pass the buck."
bad,Only bad thing about walmart is the refuse to put u on a consistent schedule and they want you to work crazy hrs. and honestly not enough pay for what your dealing with.
bad,management is the worst i will not recommend anyone to work there. they try to give training which you dont have time to complete. over worked not enough pay
bad,The company is prone to favoritism and eliminating jobs at the drop of a dime. Employes are constantly calling in and work just piles on for everyone else because of it.  Respect is never given for a job well done and staffing has become over exhausted with barely having any associates to serve the customers.
bad,I left on leave for surgery and the company put down that I quit they put 1 person in charge of multiple departments and when it came time to do planograms you did them alone and the shoe department totally flipped each time you redid them plus you had to keep up with your other departments also
bad,If you want a life don't work for Wal Mart. You will never get any days off to go camping with your family or go to family gatherings or at least I never did when I worked for them.
bad,There is a lack of respect and bad attitude from management. Morale all over the store is low because of low staffing and being forced to work multiple areas in a short amount of time. people get scolded on the sales floor.
bad,"Walmart was a great paying job, I don't regret working there however the employees liked to gossip and talk more about your shortcomings than your success. The managers were good to certain employees."
bad,"Hours are erratic per week, no room for advancement (the back office gives you the runaround when asking about management training), management is a joke (nobody knows what they are doing or are otherwise uncaring), and needless to say retail deals with many rude and impatient customers."
bad,"Coworkers disrespect, managers don't respond to employee concerns. Coworkers complain on being alone on the floor. Failure to train employees. Doesn't give time off for required events."
bad,"Store Showed too much Favoritism towards some employees, if your not a favorite your job is on the line. Training was horrible, you basically have to learn things as you go while looking stupid in front of customers."
bad,"The management was stressful and very strict, the pay wasn't much and they put a lot of presser on the employees an it was hard to request time off an you rarely get it"
bad,Walmart trains their management to overload & under appreciate their associates. If an associate does a good job in their assigned area they are made to do another area on top of that with the expectation of one person doing the job of two without higher pay. If any concerns are brought to management the employee is made to feel replaceable & their concerns left unresolved. Walmart likes young 1st time workers as they are less likely to know Labor Laws or their rights.
bad,"I've spent 23 years being misled, wrongfully promised, and abused by upper management. I would never recommend Walmart as a career job. Walmart fails to mention to the public, that all the money donated by Children's Miracle Network is all money donated by Associates struggling to make it."
bad,Great starting job. There is room for advancement if you can put up with the process. I didn’t like working overnights full time. And they don’t offer full time to very few associates on day shift.
bad,I would never allow anyone to work for such a company that treats their employees. They never really cared about if your have medical issues they just count that against you even though you have doctors notes.
bad,"Lebanon, IN was the worst location I have ever worked for.  I had better management in Indianapolis, IN.  The managers in Lebanon, IN were all about bullying people onto a disability check instead of working."
bad,i don't recommend working there. management treats you horribly unless youre in their little clique or suck up to them. the hours are crazy trying to get off or switch shifts is a nightmare
bad,Walmart can be a place to work for as a temporary thing. You will not be able to cover your life expenses on a job like Walmart. The hourly pay rate is extremely low.
bad,Poor management.  Lack of incentive to advance.  Pay was very under what was required of job.  Many times forced to do thing in job never trained for.
bad,The policy and procedures for the cashiers to have to work out of the same drawer without verification of who the overages and shortages need to be addressed too.
bad,"This company was awful to work for. Training is inadequate and your thrown on a register. If you have questions, someone else just comes up and does it for you instead of telling you what to do so when the question arises again, you’re needing help again. Managers are a joke and definitely have their favorites. Never have I seen team members treat customers so rudely! You’re definitely treated as a number and not a certified employee."
bad,"I worked Lawn and Garden in Carmel Indiana. There was a cash register I had to guard. But I couldn't stand there all day so I had to make myself look productive. So mostly had to lie and look like I was doing something. ""Zoning"" is the term Walmart uses. One manager always demanded I go to the back to get more stock. I'm actually a hard worker and can do stock in a matter of minutes as I worked at an insanely paced Walmart before. Of course, he didn't know I did all the stocking in less than 20 minutes and would just assume I did nothing for the past 3 hours. I would tell my fellow co-workers I was getting stock, then of course they would all leave. Then I would get yelled at when I came back with stock. That's when I decided I had enough. I thought I was being hired for part time but they hired me for full time. Why didn't I hear about it? Because it's one of those ""urban"" Walmarts where everyone is cackling and having a good time, of course doing nothing, and taking 3 hours to do a half hour interview, then it all gets quiet when some kid from out of state asks a question. It was a very ""different""  Walmart with the managers and human resources having a very different big-city mindset. It took them a while to change my schedule. Everyone was rude, most of all the managers and the customers, who were the worst part. It's a rich town with lots of old, rich people who look down on you for working at Walmart. It's a pretty bad Walmart with nothing but bad reviews. Check it out for yourself."
bad,"I have been at walmart for almost 9 years and the management team in there is terrible. They either hide in the back room, gossiping or are walking around with their phones, texting and laughing, all the while drinking coffee. Two of them are alittle to close for comfort. They never give you a straight answer to questions and seem confused with the goals of the store or associates. Makes for a very stressful and unsettled work place."
bad,Was not fair.Pay was horrible. Management was not professional or helpful. Staff us poorly trained. Lack of moral. Security was an issue.Asked to do many jobs. Too many chiefs and not enough Indians.
bad,"I hated it, i was setup and it wasn't fun. i would be at the self check out all night then one hour before i have to leave i have to go back in office that had 3 cart fulls. I would never go back even if they beg me"
bad,Honestly it is a joke to work for Wal-Mart. Management is horrible and the company doesn't care about anyone but itself. Definitely do not recommend working there to anyone.
bad,Wal-Mart is not the best place to work they have no respect for the people that work for them.They don't even like to give you the day off for your doctor appointment. That's why I'm looking for a better place to work.
bad,No future in retail business. Slave work. Bad store manager. Every manager gets caught up in policy except Produce manager. Workplace dehumanizes everyone.
bad,very bad place to work unless you're a butt kisser then its fine. if you work hard it isn't recognized .only if you kiss the right managers butt . if so you'll go far
bad,The managers care very little about the associates. Things are hard to be done here. Managers communication is very poor. Associates are not trusted. The only people that really help in issues are other associates.
bad,"store was very stressful to work for .... a lot of call off and no help from assistant managerd  ,  assistant managers do not communicate with each and to associate either"
bad,i would not recommend anyone to work at Walmart its very stressful place and management doesn't care if you catch a stroke they still want you to attend work the next day
bad,Management sucks. No one is ever on the same page about completeing tasks and when you try to switch positions throughout the store they don't upgrade your pay and change your title
bad,The west hills walmart lack of management skills lack of management and they play favoritism especially among the managers and employees also when you try to explain that why you when over 5 hour for lunch they write you up
bad,never work here it is terrible and unfufilling please if you have any respect for yourself do not ever work here in your whole life it is horrible smh
bad,They do not protect their employees. They constantly push you to the limits and do not care about your welbeing. All they see is money. the only thing they care about is profit no matter the cost.
bad,Would not recommend Claypool Hill Walmart unless you are desperate for a job and like being treated incompetent and like trash. The managers are horrible.
bad,Very stressful job and they expect you to have no personal life outside of work. Spent the last 8 years with Wal-mart and missed out on a lot of my childs childhood.
bad,You likely won't move up the chain too far unless you have friends that are higher ups. There is a lot of favoritism at play and it generally will not involve you.
bad,Everyone knows walmart is a terrible company in general that operates with a complete lack of morals or ethics.  Their customer service is terrible and their treatment of their employees is no better.
bad,I did not like working there when I did. It was very stressful and the customers were never satisfied.  However we had to always maintain a smile and keep it moving.
bad,"Disorganized, high ego management that dont know whats going on at all in the store and fire you for the littlest thing that they dont like at all, do not work here."
bad,bad place to work worrible staff control bad respect poor pay poor management and rude coworkers and also no career advancements in the future big waste of time
bad,"Toxic company to work, never appreciate the production you give and always demand more. Management played workers against each others and had favoritism."
bad,"Really bad management skills at the store I worked for. and pay was not enough, they need to retrain all management, and a manager should be making more $12.00 a hour,"
bad,This company says it cares about its employees and customers but that is a lie. You are a cog in the wheel. Don't apply and don't work there they allow underhanded managers play games threaten and intimidate associates into submission or force you out. The Sherman Texas Walmart and its Store manager and his management team especially.
bad,"trabajo forzado, jerarquias dentro de la empresa, mala administracion de personal"
bad,"Crazy hours for a highschool student and rude supervisors. They don't respect you, especially if youre a young worker. I never felt comfortable working there."
bad,"You stock shelves, and unload semi-trucks for $7/hr. The management doesn't care about your life outside of work, the co-workers are okay. The hardest part of the job is unloading the trucks. The most enjoyable part is going home."
bad,I worked there for 10 plus years. They say they are there for people and they clearly are not . I have one minor injury then demote me and take my hours to the point it was more beneficial to leave. NEVER WORK FOR THIS COMPANY . I WOULD SUGGEST ALL PEOPLE WORKING THERE TO FIND BETTER JOBS. THAT PLACE IS JUST EVIL
bad,They do not work well with your schedule of things especially if your a college student. Everyone there is really nice fo rthe most part but overall being a cashier is really boring.
bad,Not a very good place to work pay is not that great and they make promises that are not kept management is not very good as well I would not recommend this job to anyone
bad,"Worst job I ever had. Management was rude and unhelpful, training was poor, constantly understaffed, breaks weren't guaranteed, and they didn't work with peoples schedules."
bad,"Terrible company to ever work for . Management is all over the place , rude customers and smelly customers . The Walmart is dirty . They don’t pay for customer service but want you bend backwards for them ."
bad,poor management do not listen to emplyees  do not follow policies thats all i hav to say about this job i am done with this no sense things will never change at that company
bad,"Todo está mal, no existen estándares de buena administración"
bad,Other employees were rude to each other constant bickering and fighting blaming one another for their mistakes. Told them I had limited availability and gave them the hours I was able to work and they continued to schedule me outside of the time periods specified.
bad,The management is horrible. They play favorites and don't care about their employees. Its always about the customer even when the customer is wrong. This place stressed me out so badly I ended up with ulcers that were rupturing on a daily basis and I nearly ended up living in the hospital.
bad,this place was horrible management wise nobody knew what was going on half the time and everyone sat around a lot certain people got to do the easy jobs while others had to do twice the work to make up for it
bad,working for wal-mart was and is Cut-throat you can not trust any body you work with or work for their the management are brown nosie's their they would rat their father out to get ahead in life if they could plus all the MANAGEMENT at wal-mart are trying to get you fired on the frist day of you working for the compion so i would not work for wal-mart
bad,"Walmart is a great store but shoppers but as far as working their i wasnt comfortable, management was poor and stressful. The pay wasnt enough and hours were bad"
bad,I was literally fired for refusing to cut overtime earn legitimately while covering for a manager that did not show up for work. In the training they make you take it will show that is not allowed but they did it to me. 3 months later that change their overtime policy and asked me to come back... I declined
bad,Its a company that doesn't care about its employees. Nor do they care about workers with disabilities. They fire hard working employees who do their jobs.
bad,"Management was unorganized, lack of communication. You were always doing everybody else job. Every 3 months you could get a bonus that was only the good thing about it."
bad,From the start they made me sign a life insurance claim and didn’t train me to do the job I was hired to do. Then when I went to management for help they pushed me to do a job I didn’t sign up for.
bad,"This entire company is based on not caring who or what you have going on in your life as long as you show up as one of their little manipulation dolls. Also, if your even sick at all with something awful when your start that you have to keep going to the doctor for? Forget it! Wlamarta gonna fire you on THEE SPOT"
bad,Walmart was an unfair and corrupted work environment. Managers would pick and choose their favorites and cut them slack but mistreat the rest of us. Walmart also didn't start me off at minimum wage they started me below which I also felt was unfair and they had me working 40 hour weeks but still had me as part time in the system . Was poorly treated by most management within the company and was let go recently due to misinformation I was given by the company in the first place .
bad,"they over work you, management doest care about employees, if you are sick you will get a strike which you only can 3 then they fire you, never gave breaks"
bad,Fast pace good company for advancement growing. Training daily new products. Changing to make cusyo.ers shopping experiences better. Associates incentives. Listening to associates and getting good feedback.
bad,Calms to be family oriented but does not care about the employees. Pay does not compensate the companies lack of interest in employees well being. Management is poor as well.
bad,"Atribulado e estressante;"
bad,"the employees are rude, management doesn't care and doesn't do their job properly, they think they are better than everyone else, they don't help with stocking the shelves, unreasonable times to get all freight out, overall this place is horrible to work at, don't do it"
bad,"Walmart is awful to work at, atleast during my time. Customers are terrible, the shifts are terrible, and the pay was terrible. I would drive to work for 4 hours which was barely enough to cover expernses."
bad,"long and always on the go"
bad,I did not like working for Walmart at all. The management was very rude and proved many times that they did not care about their employees. I hurt my foot at work and was moved to another department and pretty much forced to quit.
bad,"Over worked, Incapable of properly scheduling, under staffed, too many mangers, lack of communication, unfair wages, poor inventory management, incapable of proper stocking, labels, tags, & prices are misplaced, raises are completely unfair"
bad,"A pior empresa a qual eu já trabalhei , as pessoas não respeitam o próximo ."
bad,"Bad management is the main problem with this company. An employee will be told to do a task by one manager and then other managers will come by telling you something completely different. They'll easily with you up for something that you had no control over. Example you can't get your car out of your own driveway when it snows, write up! A coworker swept grocery side while you swept gm, coworker clocks out to go home and your left sweeping up what they didn't, manager sees it, write up! Floor machine was broke before you were even hired, they make you run it even if it's not in your pay grade and the machine still leaves small miniscule water streaks, write up! It happened to me and it can happen to anyone else. I quit due to bad management and in Orthodox write ups."
bad,If I could give negative stars I would... terrible company owned by terrible human beings... I wouldn't ever recommend this company to anyone unless they were absolutely desperate for a job... they treat you like a 5lb sack that they continuously fill with 10lbs of manure...
bad,"Sucks DO not care about employees."
bad,Dont work here. Management is the worst. You only move up if you are a suck up. They dont work with your schedule and they are so selfish with the employees.  They only care about making rude customers happy. Even if they are in your face being threatening.
bad,"When I first started working for WALMART and seeing how it is now. They took away our paid holidays, we don’t get sick time and vacation time it’s all one thing instead of it being split up. Lately they haven’t been given there associates hours even if you are full time. I have been there for 3 years and my schedule never been as blank as I.T had been the last couple of weeks!!!! "
bad,"Everyone there was constantly exhausted. and usually ill-tempered. work flow direction and instruction was always counterproductive. Management was rude, disconnected, and inadequate."
bad,"feels like your in high school again really bad work place ethnic ,, "
bad,"Management doesnt care. Most perks the company had over the years they have taken away. If you get a quarterly bonus, next few weeks your hours are cut pretty good. Just not a good ethical company to work for in my opinion"
bad,"Walmart is a horrible company to work for."
bad,Management was very partial to certain people. Unless you have been there for years you don't get much respect from other employees and management. I would not go back unless they was the only ones hiring.
bad,The worse place I could of ever work for poor management I had a wrongful termination and the store manager didn't do nothing but take his managers side.
bad,"I used to love working for Walmart,, but management became lazy and rude. They didn’t care about nobody but themselves. It was always a problem when it came to them listening to customers ideas."
bad,"Not enough associates for size of store,  Customer are frustrated  when they cant find help. Work in all areas even if you have no knowledge of department.  Called to work on cash often but still expected to get your job done. Unflexible scheduling , mostly part time hrs."
bad,"My first job out of high school while I still lived at home. It was a miserable job at a miserable place. Constantly berated by customers, fellow employees, and management. You were disposable despite all the work you put into the job. Don't bother requesting time off because you most likely won't get it off. They yelled at me for requesting a week for a medical procedure."
bad,"Worst job I've ever had!! Lack of breaks. Long lines that never slowed down. Rude and unhelpful management, schedule hours were ridiculously inconsiderate for example: Monday- 3pm-11pm then Tuesday-5:30am-2:30pm"
bad,stocked shelves with meat products answered customer questions and would put away freight when needed. lot of time working alone with the occasional customer.
bad,"Being Management you are basically signing your own death certificate. Your store manager sets the rules doesnt matter what corporate wants. Example overnights 4 on 4 off. 8pm to 8am. Ha only on paper. You might leave noonish if lucky.  So 12 turns into 16. Complaints fall on deaf ears. Oh so and so yeah I worked for her when she got promoted. We go way back. Had associate open door store manager to hr. Hr contacts store manager to tell them about it before it was handled. 2 days later associate fired for locking up printer in locker. No more issue. I lnow agaisnt the rules but amazing which ones will enforce. "
bad,Career advancement is not determined by how hard you work.  Stressful work conditions and many times you will be asked to do things outside of your job description.
bad,"Walmart ISD is a great place to get experience in technology.  The cons outway the positives though.  Walmart is micromanaged and it's not how you work, it's who you know.  This has been the only company that you have to fight to keep your position.  They also give raises to people based on who they know, not if they are qualified.  There is favoritism based on who the managers like.  Sam Walton created a great company that has now become a cesspool of micromanagers who base your performance on if they like you. They will also break procedure and call you to fire you  The beliefs that Sam Walton founded Walmart on is no more."
bad,It's a ok place to work for beginners. If you is an individual that like stress then it's a job for you. I had my share and I am good on not going back to work for that company
bad,"I was a visually impaired door greeter.  The problem was while Walmart higher me to get a tax break, management used me as a scapegoat for everything that went out the door.  The last straw was when I came to work one morning and the manager brought me a list of over 5 thousand dollars with or electronic merchandise and said ""this is what you let out of the door over the weekend"".  Problem was I was off all weekend long and had not been in the store.  When I pointed this out i did not even get an apology, so that was it for me working for this terrible company."
bad,I worked in the back of the store as inventory management and i was always being harrassed on a daily basis about never doing enough even though i was basically running circles around them work my self to the ground. I always did what was asked of me but it never seemed to be enough.
bad,It was hard to want to keep going to work at store 1140. The managers were just horrible and the stress level alone there was unbearable. I’m sure it’s just a hit and miss type of situation but this store sucks all around and I am not the first one to stay that or fell that way.
bad,"CSM  and management  didn't listen to the sticker working outside , Stockmen were responsible for picking up all outside garbage,  when they have maintenance people to do that."
bad,"When I was employed at wal mart the pay was low and the management at the wal mart I worked at was at best poor! Petty sqwabbles in management"
bad,Walmart was the worst job i have ever held.. i would be sick with a very high fever and the managers would not care.. i would be throwing up in front of the and they would still want me to work
bad,extremamente dificil de se trabalhar horrivel pessima
bad,It’s too much favoritism and people bring their personal business to work  meaning emotionally taking their anger out on the employees if you don’t do what’s asked of you or can’t workover your hours will be cut or your took off the schedule
bad,Walmart kept on making changes to the place that would end up not working out. I am adaptable to change but sometimes it did get hard. All of the managers have too many thoughts in their head and forget a bunch of things because they try to do everything at once. Also they would try to get you to do 50million things before your break. Sometimes it was their jobs they had to do but they took on too many jobs on their plate. Also you had to listen to customers yell at you about the store and couldn't take it to a manager. They had an open door policy but a lot of managers were shady. If you have mental health issues don't bother with this place because they are not sensitive about it. No advancement in the company. Only if you are fulltime and even then full timers would get rejected of benfits and advancement.
bad,Horrible place to work. I would not recommend it to anyone. Treaded horrible. Bad hours. Bad schedules. Horrible employees. Super mean management. Benefits are only for full time but they refuse to give anyone full time. If you’re forced to work an hour overtime you can’t keep it. They force you to take a two hours lunch
bad,I work in a very bestial work environment. I am threatened daily with my job and if I take any time off I am retaliated against.  It is hard to enjoy a job when the management teams won't support you but wants you to support them.
bad,Low pay unfair managers and it’s a ridiculous corrupted company. They don’t care about you or what you have going on in life no excuses what so ever. Standing all day will destroy your feet
bad,Just an overall terrible place to work . Everyone has to be friends in order to be promoted or even appreciated. Management is never to be found. Requesting off time is a no no. They will deny it.
bad,Its a good job if you are a student looking to make some money on the side to help support your time at school.  Outside of that it is not a great place to work because of low pay and inability to move up with out seeking an education outside the business on your own.
bad,"my hours here were form one pm to ten pm at the time this Walmart was not converted into a super center, meaning they closed at twelve am. while here. though i was off around 9:30 i was forced to stay until twelve am for closing. employees are treated each other poorly yet also treat each other poorly. overall an awful work environment"
bad,The management was horrible they cared more about themselves then the customers. They sure knew how to put on an act. Behind closed doors it was such a toxic work environment that had a lot of favoritism . The pay is decent but not worth the head ace.
bad,"The managers played favorites."
bad,Nothing good to say. Too Greedy and don't care about the people that keep their stores going for them on a daily basis.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,At first I was happy to work for the company the store I started with was very nice they were like family but when I moved to New York it was totally different the management and the people were so rude. I think if I had stayed in Kentucky I probably would have achieved more because the encouraged you. I didn’t get much training but I used to watch and listen and learn and became very good at what I did .
bad,Management treats the associates horrible. They discriminate if you are pregnant and if you have mental disorders. Management doesn’t care if you have legal obligations such as court order visitation where your child has to be dropped with your ex on certain days of the year.
bad,Siding like it at all it was poor management skills the cashiers was rude  food was expired no one ever Clean the bathrooms never could get help findin
bad,The managers at Walmart are more concerned about associate trying to steal them paying attention to the customers that are shoplifting and walking away  with the items
bad,Managers are very disrespectful and ppl think they are managers nobody even knows anything honestly lines are always long and managers don’t care to know any concerns address they just want people to work in unfair work conditions
bad,Walmart is a horrible place to work cut hours one person has to do ten jobs short handed all the time assistant managers are lazy doesn't like to approve your PTO time and don't care about your family point system suck and when you call off it's no excuse not even a Doctor's notice
bad,"Bad pay, high stress, horrible costumers, treat you unfairly, never appreciate you, never compliment you, also they pick out the bad things only about you. Horrible hours not enough pay also if i could give it a star i would put 0 stars"
bad,"It ’s an entry-level job, the position of stock associate involves moderate-to-heavy labor. That may include loading and unloading shipments, organizing backroom spaces, constructing displays and stocking shelves"
bad,"The management is really bad at this store it makes moral really low and not wanting to be there , it is very stressful when management belittles you right in front of customers, they cut hours so bad it was not worth wanting to stay there had to get different job because management sucked and lowered hours so much the money was not worth trying to save the job . Need new store manager and new management all the way down then it would be a better store , I did not rate the store with stars because there was no negative stars and right now that is where they are , it is sad because I had always dreamed of working at Walmart and when I finally did , it was a very stressful nightmare"
bad,They trained me to be a machine. They wanted me not to car3 about my associate but 5o be a machine and just mow everyone down. The nsurance was terrible. The deductible was so high that it was just better paying the hole bill instead of using your nsurance you pay on.
bad,"""The customers and associates meeting their needs make it worth going in every day doing the best job you can do."""
bad,"Management team is running the place into the ground as far as employee satisfaction. I do not enjoy working there, it just pays the bills. Management"
bad,"its Walmart what can you honestly expect from them, they don't no who you are by name justd ur badge the turn over rate for employees is ridiculous but we are all humans and need work"
bad,No words describe how terrible walmart treats its employees. Disrespectful. Demanding. Demeaning. They have no people skills ...The supervisors.  It was the worst experience of my life at the amelia location.
bad,"management is trash , payroll sucky, co workers don't do their jobs. walmart is trash altogether, the culture of this place is garbage. no amount of money can make it okay to deal with this mess."
bad,They treat you like dirt. Do not give you directions on tasks than get angry because you have not done it their way. The pay sucks. And I would rather starve than work for this Wal Mart ever again.
bad,I did not like this job at all. I was let go of because I had surgery and the managers didn’t think I provided enough proof for the operation. Managers are horrible and do not care about anyone.
bad,Can not get work done in 8 hours they expect you to.  Sometimes there was 12 hours worth of work to do and you had 8 hours to get it done.  If not you got called into the office and asked why it didnt get done.  The pay is not that great for what they expect out of you.
bad,Walmart for me was a good experience. I loved working there but the wage wasnt worth the hassle or torment that i endured. there were associates that were hired after I had worked there for three years making more than i was. when ever there was an increase in minimum wage the new associated getting hired would get the increase but no one else. so there is a bunch of associates working for less than minimum wage. they will not allow any flexibility (even though they tell you that they have flexible hours)
bad,walmart was a good place to work for when i first started out there but slowly over time went down hill.i never moved up when asked about it and got wrote up for working overtime or not doing to good there.
bad,"don't bother working there, managers don't care if your sick at home, or sick on the job your either there on your shift or get written up. Three write ups your gone....you've been warned"
bad,not a good place to work.  The more you do to help out the store the more you are required to do.  You get absolutely no recognition for anything.  The only thing you get on a good note depending on the person is recognition for other department managers that you help.  And also most of the customers are absolutely great.
bad,I was a overnight stocker at Walmart they treat u like a dog and want you to work like a dog and treat u like garbage non stop and I would stock my ailse and help other workers out and stock the back room
bad,"Management  was the store was not well  organize  most  employees didn't do there jobs. The stocks were never correct, so the incoming truck was well over what was needed."
bad,This job should only be a stepping stone not a career. I was treated racially while employed at this particular Walmart and I would never recommend anyone to work here
bad,Walmart gives you nothing but your pay and you will like it or leave. Management treats you like with disdain. The only good thing about walmart is the discount and the breaks you get. You work when they tell you and if you make the smallest misstep they write you up.
bad,"Walmart has no work/life balance as they claim.  They are constantly changing schedules without your permission and when you ask for a day off  they say no.  Walmart doesn’t care about its employees they only care about profits.  They keep trying to lower their budget so the management get big bonuses and the front line staff get nothing. Management is lazy meanwhile piling more and more work to their workers."
bad,"Clocking in began the hours of being belittled by management, despite working non stop and a team of 7 doing the work of 20 we never did enough. we were treated like dirt, threatened with termination and then insulted in front of customers. yes, those were the days"
bad,"Left because my manager was transphobic and refused to use the correct name for me. I absolutely dreaded coming to work. Customers were always rude, too. Not a great place for your mental health."
bad,Management will not allow you to get promoted but will have you train your supervisors in you area.  You are not allowed overtime and they will change your schedule one hour before you arrive.
bad,Would be outside all day pushing in carts by myself. I would be in the rain the cold with no help.  The cart machine was down so i had to push in all the carts by hand.
bad,"I worked at the salon called Smartstyle at Walmart.  A typical work day would be like this.  You come to work, sign in at the cash register.  I would check to see if there were any clients available that needed assistance.  Most of the time one coworker would say these are my clients.  She would take over.  I would go to the laundry room to see if there were towels to be laundered or folded.   The most enjoyable time at the salon was  when I would get a chance to cut the men hair on Saturdays when it was slow."
bad,"Too repetitious. I did not learn anything, the management when I was there was horrible. No hard parts to the job. Enjoyable is when you leave for the day."
bad,No es muy agradable trabajar en la empresa hay mucha explotación laboral
bad,Its a job! very low pay for what they want you to do. people come & go like water.for such a Big company you would think they would be a little more picky on the employees
bad,As an Assistant Store Manager a typical day includes touring your areas to plan for your day. Following up with Department Managers (DM) regarding their routines and notes that need to be completed. Attendance and Schedules are also a part of daily plans for ASM. Overall it is very fast pasted and often times there are not enough people in place to complete the work.
bad,I wish I was working somewhere else where I could feel good about coming to work.  Feel good about working for a company that cares for their employees
bad,i did the samething every day. was never giving the opportunity to stock anywhere else in the store. I was in the grocery dept every night. And when i asked to stock anywhere else i was told i wasnt allowed.
bad,No one knows what they are doing. I am constantly doing everyone else's job as well as my own and do not get paid enough to do so. The managers do not care about their employees and treat them like dirt.
bad,"I entered Walmart as a manager but I have seen how employees are treated. I dont think the environment or moral in encouraging to the sales associate, and is in no wa accomodating."
bad,I am there to do one thing and one thing only and that is to make sure that my customers have what they want as well as what they need I do not have anything else to say about Walmart.
bad,"poor management"
bad,"This was only my second job I have ever had, however, I will forever tell people that try to get a job at Walmart to not do it because the management at Walmart treat their employees like they are cockroaches waiting to be stepped on."
bad,When I worked at Wal-Mart there was a lot of favoritism. Along with high demands that could not be met cause of poor scheduling. It was a very stressful and unpleasant place to work cause of management.
bad,"A typical day at work would be stressful because we would never have equipment to perform our job. I learned a lot about sales and shrink, HBA items. Management is really poor. Workplace culture was not great. Hardest part of the job was not having equipment. Enjoyable was customers and working on features"
bad,"I really liked my job, then we got new store manager and other assistant managers. They set rules, then will not follow through with them. Lots of times the customers just have to fuss and they get what ever they want"
bad,"I did not enjoy my time working as a cashier for Walmart. They overwork and underpay their employees, are not flexible and are very inconsistent on scheduling and the management did not seem to care about the people they were in charge of at all."
bad,"Previously, Walmart was all about customer service and being a team oriented and a enjoyable place to work. Due to workplace changes, Walmart no longer cares for customer service or team work, and focuses on simply merchandising and stocking shelves, and it was no longer a enjoyable place to work."
bad,Walmart makes you work everyday and they are terrible about giving you a schedule. Manager aren’t helpful at all either. Would not recommend this job at all
bad,"Walmart is a good working team, great time shift, organized, great team members .  Walmart is a great job with good benefits and will work with their employees"
bad,it was okay. i wouldnt rrecommend or going back to work there again. The workers arent reliable and are unstable. They work you so much for not enough pay.
bad,"They don’t allow sick points and if so you get fired, they go back on their word a lot, force/pressure you into working longer than your shift. It’s just not a good company to work for"
bad,Would be good with a better management staff. The Burton Walmart does not provide you with the proper training or equipment to fulfill your job requirements
bad,"the manager was so rude and not listening my situation every time there was a problem with this company situation. Manager don't care to listening anyone about situation problem.  they were siting in office all day and night and get pay for working doing nothing. Every time, I asked the manager for sent someone for help my department because there were lot of people was waiting for me while I was working alone in my department. The manager do not know what they doing their job.  It was bad situation to work this place."
bad,They were rarely considerate of your home life and scheduled you based off of what they wanted you to work. Your availability basically doesn’t even matter.
bad,"I worked here as soon as i graduated high school and they just treat u like any ole worker, you dont really feel value with this company. Its like no job security and they work the heck out of you for noting."
bad,"To Walmart your are body on the floor. Go in, do your job. Do other peoples jobs and you will stay employed. Raises and compliments are null. Welcome to Walmart!"
bad,"Not a good company  ,the work environment is extremely stressful . The managers attempt to talk to representatives as far as trying to be in relationship . Company have a lot of improvements to work on ."
bad,Many older workers depended on newer employees to do more work while they stood around. Older workers who had been there for quite some years always complained and were mean all the time even on their lunch breaks they gossiped. I didn't like the manager as well she always was angry about anything and scoffed a lot.
bad,I started Walmart almost 3 years ago. I have to say it has been an awful experience. There has been only 3 mangers that actually know what they are doing. This company is so disorganized and the lack of care is ridiculous. There is no policy to enforce but if you enforce it you get in trouble. If you don't you get in trouble. This place sets you up for failure. I would not recommend this place to anyone. I advice to anyone is to not work here or get out as soon as possible.
bad,"there is no room for opinions, only military direction. Common sence is not required. there is also no training for the management team. very poor company."
bad,Managers are inconsiderate in how they talk to you and how they manage your breaks and lunches. When trying to solve a problem civilly with other associates it is poorly swept under the rug.
bad,It started out ok but when they know you are a hard worker they expect that at all times. mamagment does not offer enough help and push to much. they promote based upon friendship and not work related skills
bad,Wall mart is not the place  u want to work management is never on. The same page. No one takes responsibility for their own failure all management that’s all
bad,"If Walmart actually adhered to the culture that it professes to follow, it would be a great place to work, however their ""culture"" is merely a publicity stunt."
bad,"Working at Walmart was psychologically hardly asking. This is a cult-like company where they make you sing a song in the morning, providing a smiling advertisement, but the working conditions and manager's skills are horrible. Histories of manager screaming on employees on the sales area during their work shift, always pushing people to work more and faster to get their primes."
bad,"The management had extreme issues... from sexual harassment to prejudice. Would never work for this company again! I used to admire Walmart... now, I cringe at the thought of them."
bad,Top meet all customers need and help out with the needs of associates makes customers need feel meet and count up registers daily stock the store and make sure the place was clean
bad,Didn't like the people who were supervisor for adecci staffing co real unprofessional people talked bad to the employees not to people oriented was to controlling and verbal
bad,This company would expect you to go above and beyond with little pay.  No matter how hard you worked for them you still feel under appreciated.  Management was some of the worst
bad,store manager so it was kinda corrupt  it was hit with a classaction sutae whitch is when i got fired after they found out i had joined the suate   i cant think of more
bad,"I was a cashier at Walmart in capitol heights and the experience was horrible. The training to learn to learn basics wasn't helpful, very stressful, not a enough to grow and horrible people."
bad,-5 Walmart logic is soo backwards but it’s bothing u can do about it Because they are their own boss they don’t really care about your personal life and they are really really sneaky
bad,I always wanted to work at Walmart but as I got older and when I was able to work at Walmart I could have gave that job up it was a waste of my time all the stories you hear about Walmart about Walmart have great benefits well they do but you have to work there for some years before your benefits kick in I got real sick one day at work and they didn't even let me go home and the customers oh my they were a hand full by there self I would shop there because of the great deals but if I had to go back my answer will definitely be NO they said the pay was 10 dollars a hour but I was only getting 9 I had to be there for a while before I get 10
bad,Answer the phone and explain questions from consumers •	Reconciled daily summaries of transactions to computer balance system and deal with returns...
bad,Terrible place to work at they want everyone to be robots they have a constantly rotating staff and no one cares enough to help customers so most of the time the people stand there for a long time waiting for help
bad,Very comfortable to work if you need somewhere to start that's a good place good benefits good pay 32 to 40 hours a week good not a stressful job to have
bad,"As a front end supervisor, I had 7 other people on my same level but our manger quit around Christmas and as of April that position was never filled making my job rely on other managers who would argue on wether they would help up front. Management would get angry at my position for not being able to do role that only the salary management could do. It was common to have no help when it was required. There was even a moment when I asked a store manager who was the acting manager on the front end and she laughed in my face like I was joking."
bad,I would not recomaned this place to anyone. They don't treat their employees good. They see them as expendable and then wonder why no one wants to work there.
bad,"never trust anyone including management. If a management doesn't like you, you will be terminated no matter how great of a worker you are, management will always cover each other's backs, they will falsify information,"
bad,"Never will I work at a walmart again nor will ever refer a friend to work there either. Disrespectful staff, customers and management. I was offered a job here due to knowing someone in the corporation and to this day i wish i would of never took it."
bad,Walmart dies not care for their associates. Walmart wants to work with as few associates as possible. Walmart does not care about associates that needs more hours to pay bills.
bad,"Very well needed organization, its not the people over all its the company and its ongoing changes.Walmart is definitely a company that everyone knows is lousy and it starts at the top and trinkles to the bottom."
bad,"The customers was what made my day brighter "
bad,"modern day slavery, when nobody wants to be there or do any work it becomes a bad place to work, favorites are chosen and they get away with not doing anything.and all for peanuts"
bad,"working for walmart is for someone who just needs a job or a starter job until you land your dream job, i would not recommend working for walmart due to the recent changes"
bad,it was a job just very low pay at the time some of the people was very nice some was not very nice a lot of rude customer but other then that it was ok
bad,"I was treated poorly by my managers, I was yelled at after completing my responsibilities. I was yelled at and verbally assaulted by customers and my managers just watched. The only time I truly was happy at this job is when we had floaters."
bad,"i come in go to cash office get my drawers for the service desk and wait for customers to come and i assist them in paying bills money orders ,money transfers ,returns and any cashier errors we fix them,and the most enjoyable part is going home."
bad,management had unrealistic expectations. little to no recognition was given to employees for a job completed well. wages were low and unfair to hard-working employees.
bad,"Terrell Walmart isn’t great. "
bad,Drama and nothing but management constantly on you draining your energy and piling up tasks. Negativity from almost everyone there. I would never want to work there EVER again.  It drained the lifeyou. om me and made me hate my job to its fullest.  I would never recommend working there.  It hardly pays for the amount of stress that it gives you
bad,"Walmart is a company I would advise avoiding at all costs. The floor staff is treated as disposable and paid the least possible to retain them. Set schedules are unheard of. Management would cut hours for not having a completely open schedule, even if that would mean being present outside the hours your department was open. Priority was given to people who could reschedule on a whim or had no limits on when they could work, instead of using that flexibility to ""fill in the cracks"" of coverage."
bad,"Management is the worst, they have no clue how to run their business. Sam Walton would be embarrassed to see how the company is being ran. Over worked and under paid."
bad,Walmart managers have  no considerations on how to treat associates. When something happens they dont want to find out the truth the just terminate there associates.
bad,"I'm not sure if all WalMart's are like this, or if it was the one I worked for, but it was one of the worst retail jobs I have ever had. At the time, they only paid cashiers 7.90 an hour and we were required to put up with all types of customer aggression. Cursing, throwing things at us, threatening us; and when we tried to tell management, we got yelled at like it was our fault. They never had our backs and treated us like dogs."
bad,"Walmart doesn’t care about its employees, at least at the one I worked at. They use people and then throw them away when they are done with them. I don’t recommend working here and I’ll never go back."
bad,"trabaje ahi por cuatro años, fui una empleada modelo, jamas me asesoraron, ni llegue tarde, pues esa era mi responsabilidad como trabajadora y para eso recibia persepcion economica, pero como hay muchos jefes (subjefe, jefe de piso, subjerente y gerente) cada uno de ellos te pide cosas diferentes, y las tienes qe hacer ya que para eso vas, es desgastante, siempre tienes hambre y sed, no te pagan por lo que haces, hacer el trabajo que tendrian que hacer tres o cuatro personas, el trabajo de limpieza, de mantenimiento al pintar y armar muebles, el de seguridad, si se roban algo en t departamento es tu culpa, y por supuesto el tuyo, un asco de empresa"
bad,"Its awful, unappreciative managers. Treated poorly. Hours were to a minimum and your work was never commended or meant nothing to anyone.. not recognized or recognition where it was deserved."
bad,"I was a health and beauty sales associate then they asked me to be a cake decorator when they saw my artistic skill in the break room. I accepted. But the pay was really low for what I was doing, and even with 5 cake decorators during the morning the workload was immense on weekends. After 5pm i was left by myself to help the whole department, very often."
bad,horrible place to work where i was told there was 500 others waiting in line to take my job. too much favoritism and unfair punishment. would never work for walmart again.
bad,"Unless you have been there for 10 plus years, you will not last long. There is not appreciation for your hard work. Sure no compensation. No teamwork."
bad,"It's walmart, unless you're some kind of snake you'll never make upper management and even then your only job is to be incompetent and be clueless about anything related to a product."
bad,"I had to be on FMLA I got so hot one day and was passing out the manager took me home instead of hospital I ended up in ICU with kidney failure, I could have died, but they dropped me off at home."
bad,"Walmart is one of those places you work because you really need a job, and you think, ""Oh, I'm there all the time, I might as well get paid to be there."" Don't...Just don't."
bad,"its a very challenging job you must be available at all times as if you was a doctor on call"
bad,"Wal-Mart was my first job and it was just terrible I had terrible management. employees were rude to me, maybe it was the managers fault. its not a place I could see as a career"
bad,"Walmart shows little to no respect for their employees and expect grade A performances with subpar rewards (if any). Though having hour long lunches, getting to them and being able to enjoy them without being harrassed is not likely."
bad,Poor management. Always short staffed and a lot of work is placed on one associate Favoritism is clearly shown by management. The schedule is inconsistent and will sometimes schedule closing then opening in the morning. By far the worst job I've ever had.
bad,"Worked was long and never enough hands to help get the job done on time, felt depressing and felt like there was only a few people actually working at a time."
bad,I worked at night time so my days were very slow and long so I didn’t enjoy that job but it taught me to get through certain situations and do your job to your best ability
bad,"Very stressful and many co workers are unorganized. I learned that wal mart is one of the worst companies in america to work for. Management would retaliate if you open door an issue. The people are friendly at first but then they will deliberately try and hurt your career. The hardest part of the job was the low staffing and the low communication. I did love how every day was different, the customers were the best."
bad,"I had the misfortune of needing a seasonal job as a freight unloader. At the end of the season when they told me I was no longer needed I as very relieved. The training provided was not applicable to the position I held. The pace of work was frenetic with heavy boxes (sometimes 100 lbs). It did not matter how fast you could work the managers would always tell you that you weren't working fast enough. The training would instruct you to help customers but if a customer would ask you a question while you were carrying freight to the shopping floor the manager would yell at you for wasting time with them. Many of my seasonal coworkers stopped showing up, no surprise there, so I had to work even harder to cover them. I was exhausted and in pain every day despite being in my prime. If I didn't need the job I never would have taken it. I would never recommend working here. That job was so aweful."
bad,"The one 3rd shift manager at the time was terrible and didn’t know what she was doing. Very bossy, but never helped anyone with problems they were having. At the time I was a new employee and recieved no help in my department stocking and when I would ask for help the manager would make me look like an idiot. Only worked there a month til I couldnt take it any longer and just quit and found better."
bad,"Walmart was not a good company to work for. however, while there, I gained a lot of working experience but the management did not invest in their employees."
bad,Working for walmart in the beginning was a fun place to work for then after awhile it was no longer fun. Management didn't care for employee's nor do they care about customer service.
bad,Most of the time we stood around doing noting.  We could never find the stock.  As a cashier I had to be home at a certain time to pick up my children from school (my scheduled hours).  I was forced to stay because they were busy and told to stay on my register and not to send ANY customers away.   Very hostile environment.
bad,If you work at walmart now run while you can. Start somewhere else while you are still young!! Walmart will do anything at store level to make management look good! Run a poor store until big wigs of company in town and then try to fix wrong things over a couple of hours! If not fixed hold lower management accountable. This is the biggest lying company in existence
bad,"Los horarios no son flexibles, hay mucha desigualdad de genero y nada de oportunidad para crecer."
bad,I would not recommend this company to work for due to long hours its the same routine and the days off you want off they have know to cover.You have to check in at the dressing room each time you go for a break or meal. You have to cover the dressing room for meals and breaks.
bad,I had no benefit and was not guaranteed hours. It made it hard to have a balance because of how the schedule changed so much each week and not knowing how many hours you would get
bad,"It is a fast paced place. "
bad,they fire people for no reason and that over time thing is stupid how we cant do overtime. favortisim. the mangement isnt very good at all. and the coworkers suck
bad,"The managers are in their own little bubbles and only cover each other, NOT the associates. The store manager will wait until the last moment to do something about your issues in the workplace. It took me over a month just to move departments and putting my two weeks in before they decided to do something about it. The pay is not even close to the living expenses in Orange County. I am currently looking for a new job."
bad,"working for walmart is everything you think it is. its not a dream job good for students or part time work. management is ok, lots of options if you want to switch deparements"
bad,"As a company, it lacks management skills and over works you for minimum wage. I do not recommend working for the company if they do no appreciate or value their own workers and/or having favortism within the workplace as well as work politics. The only positive side for working for this company is hoping they give you vacation time when they feel like it."
bad,The hardest part of the job was the constant cuts on fingers from cardboard boxes. A typical day at work consisted of a meeting at the beginning of the shift.
bad,"hated working for walmart. terrible work/ like balance. I called out because I was sick and it added on to my no call no show record. They don't care able the employees, they will just replace them."
bad,terrible place to work. don't treat you well . mngrs were horrible. they would lock the doors so we would not leave before they said it was ok. no respect
bad,"Never worked for acompany that tries so hard to fire you from the 1st day you start.Will never take on a problem head on,just make a new rule to punish everyone.Benifits are far below even minimum standards."
bad,working in a place not happy. understaffed and overworked and no thank you. A company that advertises they are family oriented and friendly are anything but. Family commitments are ignored as requests for time off.
bad,"I worked like crazy at Walmart, from the time i clocked in till I left. I would always get in trouble for not finishing my managers jobs because i had more work then time."
bad,Terrible Management unless you like being screamed at in front of other associates or wrongfully terminated for BS Reasons. overtime is a big no no and dont count on getting full time
bad,"It wasn't bad working there while on the remodel crew, but after being hired on and having to deal with the managers who only walk around gossiping and trying to harass people that they seem to dislike it got pretty bad. Even after trying to speak to people above them about everything going on it seemed like no one really cares about the small people at this company."
bad,Bad company. Never in my life have I been treated how they treat their associates. They are very picky of who they want to keep working and get rid of their long term associatesm
bad,"I don't feel like walmart is a good place for anyone to work at, problems aren't taken seriously. if you are a new worker, they will treat you like garbage just because you are new. They occasionally will schedule you outside of your availability."
bad,"Walmart used to be a better place to work then they changed the scheduling program and unless you have full open availability you won't receive your full time status or benefits. If you have 2nd jobs, school or kids you get screwed."
bad,"TYpically i work Monday to Friday, I learned to run the Register, do the running of the the returns of various departments, i learned their management doesnt care if you worked hard, no place for advancement,the hardest part of my job is we were pressurized on doing returns at dawn, since Im a third shift cashier, I have to managed accurately how to do the returns of customers in a very fast and accurate manner, for me that was the hardest part especially on Black Friday., I did not enjoy my job,"
bad,Managers treated employees terrible and were not willing to work with you if you had family or medical problems. and paid terribly while being overworked and underappreciated.
bad,when i was working there keep in mind it was back in 2007 so i have heard they do pay more now but when i was working there i was still in school only getting paid 7.35 an hour i worked outside in the garden center area part time well barely part time some weeks i only had 8 hours that week
bad,everyone that has ever worked for Walmart know it is a terrible place to work. built on the backs of the employees. I would never want anyone I know to work for them.
bad,"The store I worked at was so unorganized and not professional at all.  Nobody was ever on the same page,we were under staff in certain departments. Lack of real team work."
bad,"Working at walmart was one of the worst experienced i ever had. There is no ethics at this place, there is a lot of favoritism inside the store in between management and regular associates and nothing gets done. There is no appreciation from management and they wouldnt listen to any of your concerns."
bad,"I worked at Walmart for a year and i never had a good work day. The coworkers tried getting each other fired by framing, lying, or 'tattling;' on each other. The management never cared about their subordinates, they treated them like trash. The entire company is a bad place to work for."
bad,"You can not call out sick! If you do a Doctors note is not valid,  so basically you can't get sick because you will get an occurrence which leads to a Step which eventually will lead you to termination... Wild Right SMH"
bad,"Área treinamento, foi aprendizado tive oportunidade de desennvolver pessoas e reter ela na empresa ."
bad,"In February 2009, things were good. Within the next few years, things went downhill. They took away many benefits, downsized employees but expected remaining employees to complete all tasks."
bad,"Nasty inexperienced supervisors and managers will lead your day and night. Attitudes exist that you'll do exactly what they say , when they say it or you can go home. Always call outs and never enough help assigned or available where needed. Stores compete against each other bragging about sales dollars when they do not even offer livable wages. Raises year after year are a joke. Keep looking......"
bad,This stores management was very cold toward their employees.  Reluctant to work with you if illness or family problems arose.  High turnover for this store.
bad,Management over stresses you in poor working conditions. You work your hardest for it to never be good enough. They don't give you hours but then expect you to work overtime on your expected shifts.
bad,management is horrible any problem you have management never took care of it wal-mart isnt a place to work its not a hard job once you get the hang of what your doing
bad,"The managers are horrible! And the customers are even worse! They offer all kinds of benefits but pay so low that no one can afford them. What's it like working at Walmart? If you enjoy being treated like dirt but people who call you thier ""associate"", then this might be the place for you! But you must also enjoy living in poverty while the bosses drive brand new Toyota trucks."
bad,"Bad pay, hate speech was present. low management. Inconsiderate to their workers experiences or health. Over all there were good people and hard workers, unfortunately cruel work environment and expectations."
bad,No job security. You never know when they are going to do layoffs. Management is not very supportive. The TL do not want to help. Some of them are great but most will not.
bad,horrible manangment horrible pay some good and ok co workers not enough hours. i dont reccomend this job to anyone whatsoever at all. please do not work at walmart
bad,"Very stressful conditions. Low moral, managers not competent. Sick pay is given for family member care not for our own illnesses. Work you when they want and cut your hours so that you don't get overtime."
bad,My time at Walmart was very stressful. Them management was always yelling for work that was not completed but the work was actually done. I did enjoy my time there when I got to be moved to the photo lab.
bad,Conglomerate greed combined with a turnover rate that is like revolving door. Low pay and high expectations. Job life and health is very poor. Break room hadn't been updated since late 90s but everything is updated. Families of rats living shelving units which are not regulated to change by law or any other requirement. If you hate shopping there you will hate working there even worse.
bad,"It's a bad job with bad pay and bad management. I worked overnight which is where they sent managers as a punishment meaning we got the ones who were bad at their jobs and didn't want to be there. You are treated as if you're expendable and they don't much care how you feel about it. My manager didn't even accept my three day bereavement leave and wanted me to call in everyday that I would be gone. Unless you're about to be starving on the streets, don't work at Walmart. It's never worth it"
bad,Extremely stressful. Not worth the hours and hours of training and videos they make you watch before being set loose. And customers expect to be treated like dirt so it's normal to be yelled at daily for no reason at all.
bad,"From management down, the culture of the store, from my point of view, was that of one where nobody cared. Other employees did not respect or take care of the workspace, and management did not care to try to change anything. The people were set in their ways and did not want to try anything different."
bad,"I wasn’t to big of a fan working at Walmart. Management was terrible, they didn’t understand much. Wasn’t a family oriented place to work. Management was very rude to their associates out in the open which to be ,  be little in front of a store full of people is terrible."
bad,I will never work for wallmart again they were the worst place I could have worked for ever. they didn't treat you Fairley made you do more then what the job requires. they make you come in when you are sick and don't let you leave for family emergencies.
bad,Job it self was easy but everyday company to work to be disrespected by management was not worth the pay they are extremely rude to their customers and act like they can talk to you can talk to you anyway they want!
bad,"Honestly the only reason I put up with Walmart was because I needed the money. They show a lot of favoritism and do not let you get ahead unless you kiss up to them. There was a position for management that my friend was OVERQUALIFIED for but instead they gave it to someone who had only been working there for a few months. Management does whatever they want with you, abuse their power, and do not care if you have an emergency. They also break the ""rules"" but will quickly try to reprimand you for any little thing you do. I was miserable even thinking about going to work and time seemed to freeze when I would be at work. Also the whole ""the customer is always right"" statement will always be used against you. A customer can be really rude, yelling at you, or be wrong in the situation but of course the employee would be the one to always get in trouble. Basically do not work there unless you REALLY need it."
bad,would not recommend anyone to work her they pay less then Heb and Whole foods .The store is dirtier and the associates seem to hate there life and aren't as friendly.
bad,Filled with lies broken laws and horriable people and and mangers that try to take advantage of you. Do not work here unless you have no other choice.
bad,"Management are very unappreciative and have no respect for the employees, they hide equipment in their office unless corporate is coming in than they want you to try to work a Miracle"
bad,The management is very poor. They hire to many people and not enough hours to support the number of staff. The training was all online and there was no hands on training with a manager.
bad,"I had a cashier position at Walmart and loved that actual work, but always had problems with management. They were not properly trained and would talk down you every employee and treat you like you was nothing."
bad,"The employees are typically good people, however the lack of communication between management and employees make it a very difficult place to work. They don’t offer a steady schedule so it changes from week to week."
bad,If you are somebody in school looking for a part time job to get by this place is for you but actually trying to survive off the pay and grow at this company its unrealistic.
bad,Working at Walmart is like working for children the management team will do anything to not get blamed for their own failures they will throw you under the bus to save themselves.
bad,Job is very stressful and overbearing. No matter how hard you work management scours. Hours are limited to none depending on the time of year. Management is very overbearing and doesnt know what the word teamwork means.
bad,"Discrimination against health issues, all in who you know , lack of respect for employees.  They do not care if you have been there for 20 years and given half your career up.  They will not work with you on any type of issues.  They will hire peopyand put them above you despite your apparent skill."
bad,Not a good place they talk to u crazy management bad they cut your over time on lunch and depend on u to keep up with work I will wouldn't recommend to nobody
bad,Would never work here again. People made the job. Management was awful. Don't know what their doing and take everything out on the little guys. Horrible pay.
bad,"This is a terrible experience. I  worked here while attending college to have some income for basic necessities. However, the company pays minimum wages and tries to find any reason not to give a raise and the raises ranges from 5 cents to 25 cents per year for the billion dollar corporation."
bad,"This one specific Walmart is horrible. The management only cares about what corporate thinks of them & what the immediate higher ups inside the store say. A fellow coworker who has worked for the Walmart corporation for 17 years has described this specific store as one of the worst. Getting anyone to do anything that isn't the bare minimum is like pulling teeth, including the managers. They do not manage the employees schedules well, frequently their will be too many people one day and barely 12 people in the entire store the next."
bad,"Una porqueria de empresa con gerentes, empleados, seguridad de porqueria y salarios de hambre. Muy facil robar articulos y se lo merecen por OJETES."
bad,its a cut throat place to work. they don't follow policy's and make there own rules. if one member of management says something and another changes there mind they will write you up
bad,This company does not value their employees. They longer pay their employees for holiday when they are forced to work on the holidays and the pay should be higher than what it is.
bad,expect a lot of work to be done for such low pay.Managers expect things to be done in half hour even though it requires more time. they expect perfection for low pay.
bad,"The walmart I worked at was awful. I did things outside of my assigned title (like running returns).The managers and my coworkers teased me for my height and called me a little kid. And the attendance policy is ridiculous!! Four absences allowed in 6 months??? I have a life, you know! Also, customers are awful, entitled, and treat you like garbage."
bad,They don’t care about family and never take doctors notes and mistreat employees and treat them as if they don’t matter. I wouldn’t recommend working for Walmart to anyone. They treat employees terrible. The stress level working for Walmart is threw the roof.
bad,"the advertised ""starting salary"" of $10/hr was a scam, they start you at 9 and give you 60 days to complete computer based training or they fire you. however, you are not allowed to do this training on your own time, nor can you take time off your normally scheduled shift to do this training. they will not schedule time for you to do this computer training either. they set you up to fail."
bad,Think of this place like a high school were nothing is sacred and people all talk behind your back.  The management runs very lax and zero discipline for bad workers leaving other people to make up the difference.
bad,Walmart was not a good place to work because of lack of management and also no good benefits were offered to any employees working for the company. Move on to bigger and better opportunities.
bad,"As a former employee of Walmart I will say that during your interview they make it seem wonderful and that you can make it a career there. They tell you that you will be respected as an employee. Reality is that the management sucks and make you want to quit. They don't treat you good, disrespect you and don't let you advance or grow in the company"
bad,Antes del chip de administración fue exelente pero con esta nueva administración empeoró todo la gerencia no sabe dirigir al personal
bad,i hated working their the management was never there to listen even if its an open door policy. I will never recommend this place to anyone to anyone to work at
bad,Managers did not care at all about any family emergency I may have had. Bring my first job I was hired as an overnight cashier. I wasn’t old enough to ring alcohol up so I was the one facing consequences from customers.
bad,Managent was terrible. the work load was too much to handle in the time that they wanted and the hours were too long and the training was a joke. I didn't like how they handled my case when I was injured
bad,Walmart mangers do not work well when it comes to family and there benifits they over are worse then the states. They don’t care about your well being
bad,biased. rude. judgemental.play favoritism . need better trained staff of supervisors and management. the managers act off what co-workers do or say about another employee rather than evaluating themselves and are very unprofessional and rude
bad,"Management is a clown show, nobody knows what there doing... you get one guy telling you do this,.. then another guy yells at you for doing it the wrong way..."
bad,I did not care for my job at Walmart. I was also a student at the time of employment there and they did not work well around my school schedule. they would schedule me to work during school hours.
bad,"Not sure what other to say other then the management style lacks serious communication and a general negative attitude on frequent basis. Not horrible place to work, but the atmosphere ruined it for me."
bad,Not paid enough to do 8 people's jobs they dont care how busy yu are there are so many bosses it's hard to know which one is going to give yu grief in one day
bad,"This place has too many people that use their jobs to pull up the people they like personally and to drag down those they don't like. Everyday I hope that something very bad happens to me so that I don't have to go. I have panick attacks before going in the building. If I could just find a different job, I would leave in 2 seconds."
bad,Managers do not care about any single person. They do not give you the chance to earn the raise they originally offer at hire date. Must be able to learn on your own.
bad,"I was not a fan of my time at walmart.  It was probably my specific location, but it seemed management had their own club and favorites and if you weren't part of that group, you were alienated from any sort of advancement."
bad,"Employees were great, fun to work with and made some lifelong friends while here. The job was not bad, the work was not to hard. The bad thing was the salary. We were all very underpaid and deserve more than what was given."
bad,Company does not promote employees who deserve to be promoted. Employees are not compensated fairly for the work they perform. Company had inadequate pay for various positions.
bad,Lack of real safety protocols. Safety equipment not provided to all employees. Underpaid and mistreated by immediate supervisors. Lack of recognition for any positive achievement.
bad,Stressful having to to make sure everything was done and  customers were sloppy and demanding. Tension to have stock brought to floor when you were busy.
bad,"never enough hours, never enough employee"
bad,Worst place to work for. no room for advancement. poor leadership. management only help them self. poor annually raises. advancement not base off of performance.
bad,worst job ever. unless your friends with management you won't really move up. store manager was expose sleeping with a associate who was allow to break rules. never will reconmend walmart again
bad,They run on a skeleton crew and then tell you that they have more than enough people working. Management will not communicate with each other. You will be pulled to another department and then still be held responsible for the work not getting done in your area.
bad,This was a good place to get basic customer service training on the computer.  The staff was basically helpful if you asked questions.  Customer services problems were not dealt with by management.
bad,Management has the intelligence equivalent of a walnut. Unless you make no incentive on actual improvement and do what your told despite obvious issues revolving in the same door as their employees. Incredible how the most mindless obvious lack of appropriate treatment towards people is what allows these people to do what they do. No wonder it's considered the most likely place in America to get shot.
bad,Work hours were crazy. Pay rate is not enough for what you have to put up with customer wise. No full time position so that benefits were not available.
bad,Employees are not very valued. The management was not concerned with employee satisfaction. Not easy to get time off of work. Very strict with breaks and lunch. Not a fun place to work at all.
bad,I really didn't like Walmart very much at all and the management was very hard on everyone and I learned that I should stay in school because I didn't want to work at Walmart for the rest of my life.
bad,Walmart wasn't a great place to work maybe it has change are put some rules in play by now but at my time of employment everything was rust employees never had a sch to go off what to do management was very rude .
bad,"Low pay, bad benefits, zero job security with people being laid off by the thousands every couple months, terrible micro managers, and cut throat job culture."
bad,it sucked... boss threw me under the bus all the time when management yelled at her.. So glad i left because there was too much drama and not professional
bad,"Ive witnessed abuse with top managers and supervisors. managers are also verbally abusive with employees. Its a very toxic workplace to be in. When I was doing over nights I got a verbal warning for being too slow. My slowness was due to the repetitive change of departments and trying to learn the area. "
bad,"Honestly, if your supervisor does not like you, he or she will be petty and either cut your hours or make your job a whole lot harder than it should be. The regular associates themselves were very friendly but you pretty much had to kiss up to management in order to have it easy. Management will find ways to lie to you or withold the truth in such a way that it may affect your job. Communication is weak."
bad,Walmart was cutthroat. I worked as a consolidator on the second shift 5pm-2am. Working on an assembly line in a warehouse. I learned the job wasn't for me.
bad,All of the coworkers were rude and the management was a joke. The cashiers are the only ones that get the best treatment but the rest are treated like garbage.
bad,"Staff were friendly but management did not care about their employees. I stated I could not work a certain day on my application and they put me on that day every week. When I told the manager, the manager stated I had to get a note from HR, I did get the note but decided not stay."
bad,Walmart has made a lot of recent advancements to improve their wages. The new-hires are compensated much more appropriately while the employees who have been there for 3+ years are not compensated and end up making the same amount as the new hires. This structure supports high turn overs within departments. High turn overs creates a lot of stress because of regular associates often knowing more than their managers when they are looking to be lead. The best policy at walmart is to learn what your manager likes and cater to them specifically when they're on shift.
bad,You work when every they want you to.  If you limit your time you can come in you don't get hours. management does not care about their associates.  you are treated like cattle.
bad,The company has become company first and not customer or associates first anymore the company is trying to compete with all the online companies and is going to be nothing but warehouses in a couple years.
bad,This place does not value or appreactie there workers they over work you and ask for more they bully you into working and threaten your job and talk to you any kind of way no respect at all
bad,I worked here for quite some time and all you deal with here is drama. Managers get replaced every few weeks and no one can do their own job.. Don't even try working here.
bad,"During a typical day at work, they would forget to give me my breaks and I would not leave when scheduled. They make you take your breaks early, the management is poor, and they do not care if emergencies come up. They do not truly care about you."
bad,No hay mucha prospeccion de clientes y hay favoritismo
bad,The hours were terrible and the management at my location was extremely unprofessional. Train was a joke and the entire culture in the workplace was awful
bad,"The people you work with are very interesting and lively, some sour and negative but most family oriented and friendly, happy but the work environment was awful.  The store manager was wonderful and some team managers was wonderful but the CEOs at the top were horrible, very criticizing, nothing was good enough and the pay was very small amount for the hard labor that is done."
bad,Walmart was my first job after my employment there I never wanted to work again. Walmart does not follow their own policy's and they do whatever they want.
bad,"Unfortunately this company has too much power in the business world and abuses its employees and no one takes notice."
bad,"Working here barely paid the bills. the management as a whole were cutthroat and would throw anyone under the bus for advancement, save for a very select few. The pay was low and the hours were inconsistent. They would give you enough hours to be full time but less that 40 so they, as it was put, can make sure you don't work over time. The company tells you how long it should take to put your freight away. a time build in a warehouse with no customers or management distracting them. If you don't meet your time because the management pulled you for something you would get in trouble. Only work here if you must (e.g. need cash till you get something better)"
bad,"Walmart didn't care about their employees at all. Management would often change employees schedules hours before their shift and penalize them for not being their in time with no warning, to the point where almost the entire store staff printed out their schedules just to prove that they were there in time for their shift. "
bad,"I was a sales associate in the clothing department, I finger spaced put clothes back where the items belonged and organized the clothing on shelves. Management could've been and still can be better. The workplace was tense no one wanted to be there. Hardest part was taking courses online. Enjoyable part was making new friends."
bad,It started off nice but after being there it's picks and choses who now who hard to move up don't get recognize for the work you do don't get time off manger time have favorite people who only get notices.
bad,"wasnt that great of a place to work"
bad,"Cash handling"
bad,"100% the worse store to work in. Management treats you like trash. Work until 10 or 11pm every night of the week including Sunday nights. No weekends off even if you request them. Don't accommodate anything outside of the store. Don't have a personal life because they will quickly take that away. No arrest are allowed at this store no more. If you have kids, well i feel sorry for you because you won't see them again as they don't care about what they have going on and if you need time off for it. They threaten your job security if you question them on anything. Do not and I repeat DO NOT apply here. you will hate it from the moment you start."
bad,"I would constantly be harassed by customers and employees and did not appreciate the way I was being treated. I worked my butt off for them and was their fastest checker, but my boss didn't even care when I quit. All she said was, ""That's fine, we have people coming in all the time. I don't need you."" So that tells you just how much they cared about their employees."
bad,this is one of the worst if not the worst place to work at low pay disrespectful management no room to advance cut throat in safe and very unprofessional
bad,like any fast food resturant it is fast paced and sometimes frustrating. but the managers are really friendly and you can use these skills wherever you are
bad,Managers are not professional and not friendly. My co-workers were helpful with training for the most part but after that were rude. There was always a lot of DRAMA!
bad,They will work you to the bone. Upper management would approve things that were against federal regulation when it came to returns. Walmart had to set in place their own regulations due to employees being over worked such as being locked out of a system if you have been clocked in too long without an unpaid break. They care more about the bottom dollar than they do their employees.
bad,"The hours sucked, the management is horrible,  the pay you get for positions suck. the customers are ok but most are rude, customer service will almost never be usefull"
bad,night shift stocking shelves dairy and frozen learned i didnt like it management was horriblehardest part of job going in to work enjoyable part was end of shift
bad,Hours are always changing and you can never count on days off.  Favoritism by management is very bad.  It all depends on who you are and what you are.  If there is someone who doesn't like you you will find yourself being attack offend and being coached for no reasons which leads to termination for no reason.  Would not recommend this as a job.
bad,"terrible leadership"
bad,"I have been working at Walmart part-time (More than a year)"
bad,"The Walmart I had the unfortunate task of working at, was one of the most poorly managed I have ever seen. General manager was never on premises, the hours scheduled were ridiculous, including the regular practice of putting gaps between shifts of 2-5 hours, refusing to schedule associates who used public transportation accordingly, and overall just treating associates like disposable pawns. The break room has no ventilation or temperature control, so good luck if someone uses the attached employee restrooms. Management, with a few exceptions, don't care about their employees, just so long as there isn't a problem they need to handle."
bad,Didn’t like it there at all. Got treated unfairly and my paycheck was sketchy. Worked a lot of hours but felt like I didn’t get paid good enough for all the hours I worked.
bad,"You are understaffed, over whelmed, and over stressed. You have to deal with rude management that can't tell the difference between there rear end  and there elbow. To much drama and just very poor way of working. Once your done with your job you get to go do someone else. Do not work here as a career not many opportunities. I work over night and I hate it.  No one cares about anything and nothing is done as they should be."
bad,If your great with others attitude this maybe a place for you. I worked with rude people and manager and I still held it down for several years. I kept a positive attitude. If this is something you can do this will be a ok job for others .
bad,it is the worst place to work that mack you work over tim and tack it back over 4 months for the holladays .thay dont like giveing rases and its way to hot to work in the backroom.
bad,Walmart in Washington Nc is a terrible store period point blank the store manager doesn't know what he's doing have associates doing what they want on their phones having headphones in and being rude to customers.
bad,"Bad managements.pay is very low. hard labor, customers are rude, i dont recomend this company. products are so cheap thats why customers are left and right returning the producrt"
bad,they are always taken sides you have to be almost dead befor they are willing to move you up and its not even a good clean place in the first place this place sucks to work  for not enough pay for an over night job
bad,"I was not given an opportunity to find a better fit in job placement. they would not work with me to help me keep my job thus I had to leave, if they would have worked with me I would have stayed employed longer"
bad,"Entirely too much favoritism, accountability is out the window and the higher up you promote the more you realize very few people are willing to work as a team and follow policy."
bad,Management was the worst I have ever been a part of. New management came in and did not care what you needed and if you didn't do what they wanted you were fired. Point system was a joke
bad,"greeting customers an helping with issues that make come about, helping other coworkers an making sure customers things were paid before they walked out the door."
bad,Basically doing warehouse work but getting  paid significantly less . Mangers treat you like trash & very back breaking work . Still got back problems from unloading those trucks . Very hot work environment & repetitiveness of doing the same thing everyday .very demoralizing job
bad,"Don't do it, no matter what you are told in the interview process - it's smoke and mirrors.  It's totally about the numbers no matter at what expense to the employee."
bad,they will break you down  and work you like a slave. they dont care about family your a number a replaceable number. i was there 10 years and saw them mistreat people everyday. health insurance is like not having anything at all. nothing good to say about that place. i have a family to feed thats why i was there as long as i was and i took the first job that came to me
bad,"People are miserable working there."
bad,"I don’t exactly blame management for poor time management, and excessive policies that only irritate customers, but getting yelled at for doing my best nearly every shift by customers and management alike is soul crushing. They say “don’t take what is said to you to heart”, but that’s immensely difficult when it comes from so many angles."
bad,A place where you work starting out. Or trying to have some income before changing jobs. Management is infamously terrible and a joke through out every sector.
bad,Management was honestly the worst thing about working here. They slacked and were more concerned about making friends and picking favorites rather then keeping it professional.
bad,I have tried to help manage this store for 9 years. Most promotion opportunities have been removed. We have been understaffed for 6 years! We are now the last place in Bozeman anyone wants to work. Corporate is unwilling to compete locally for wages. Two years with 2% across the board raises. Thanks for letting us know that we really are just a number to you.
bad,"Constantly worrying if you have a job week to week because upper management is ready to push you out the door. Upper management has no regards to their workers, or the customer. As long as you spend money their nice to you the customer. The management team is could care less about you and is only worried about what you're spending. The wage is laughable. The turnaround rate is sadly super high."
bad,One of the worst jobs I ever had and NEVER want to go back. to shop there is one thing. But management MAJORLY sucks and need to get there heads out of there butts and start running things better before it starts going ever more down hill majorly and royally.
bad,I got cussed out almost all the time got asked to do illegal stuff got called many names and I was a 4-star technician they have no respect for anyone..
bad,You are payed the lowest possible amount and are schedualed hours which will change daily sometimes without you knowing then when u dont show up when they change your shift you are at fault and diciplined. You are fiven unrealistic goals to accomplish.
bad,"Made $7.50 an hour got one raise to $7.90 an hour, the management was out for themselves and cared little for the employees. I tried changing my schedule to accommodate my joint custody I had with my daughter so I could get weekends off since I had her on weekends. My answer was a no in capital letters. The management didn't care whether you had family they just cared about you working and their production. I enjoyed customer interactions and it built up my speaking and sales abilities. There were no benefits and got no paid leave whether it was vacation, sick, or accrued leave. Bottom line, they work you like a dog and could care less about you as their employee, there was no room for advancement and they seemed to always be short staffed. They always have backed up registers due to poor scheduling. They had up to 20 registers but only 3 would be open. Will not work for Walmart again."
bad,I was amazed by the things that were accepted while working for this company. I have an established career and this was simply a second part time job for some extra cash that turned into more work and stress than expected.
bad,Not worth it. I dont have anything good to say about the company or the work environment. They just care about themselves not the employees. Dont waist your time.
bad,My typical review at Walmart. I would be expected to get everything done regardless of how short staffed we are. The management is awful to associate.
bad,Terrible job managers are inept quick to blame employees under them terrible hours unprofessional coworkers and abhorrent customers and horrible working conditions.
bad,"their okay to work for, they have got better so I have heard. They do offer bonuses and a discount card. I heard the pay has been raised. they do a drug test."
bad,Walmart refused to raise my hourly pay for the 21/2 years I worked there. There were no Holidays & mandatory work for Black Friday! Walmart was a job I took because I needed work.
bad,"Stressful"
bad,this job was not enjoyable at all! The managers were very unprofessional and racist. They also showed a lot of favoritism to their friends/employees...
bad,worked for the wal-mart company for over 10 years with nothing to show for it.  favoritism showed by management.  would not recommend this job to enemy.
bad,It was good didn’t like my boss or any of the CSM I didn’t like the store manager he was not very nice but the customers were mostly good and the staff was tolerable.
bad,Not anything better or worse than you'd expect. Working long hours for little pay and have seven managers over you telling you to do the same things differently.
bad,"racist if you do not know Spanish family does not come first like they claim, They talk bad about customers asking questions like they are a problem when we are suppose to be there for customers or we would not have a job"
bad,"They are racist if you do not know Spanish. They talk down to the associates, There was nothing good about working for them. Family is defiantly not first like they claim"
bad,work at walmart if you want to get a job quick. its not a hard job and i would recommend anyone to work there if you don't mind certain things like poor management
bad,"Management doesn't know what theyre doing, want you to be in 3 different places at the same time. hated my life working there. youd get in trouble for any little thing."
bad,uma empresa de porte grande de grande nome no mercado de varejo.
bad,this place is not horrible to work at but the company does pay low and barley gives you any hours so if youre going to school or have another job and just wanting to do this part time then this would be the job for you
bad,the managers never knew what they were doing and we had little to no help when it was actually needed. I would not work for this company again. they did me unfairly.
bad,Only there for a few months before suffered a major injury which their health and safety manager attempted to file a counter claim with WCB.... Not sure what else to say.
bad,"When anyone is asked about their thoughts on what may be the highest paying jobs in the world, interestingly, most of us seem to incline towards bankers and actors as the richest people on earth. On the contrary however, recent studies have shown that the highest paying jobs in the world are concentrated towards the medical department."
bad,They are not a very teammate oriented. They don't always encourage a team effort. They sometimes will make overtime mandatory but then have you cut that time later on to not have to pay overtime.
bad,"Walmart was a ok job i would maybe recommend someone who has never worked to use Walmart for their first time job, like someone graduating out of high school"
bad,I would NEVER recommend this business as a place to work. management tries to be-little you. they talk to you however they want to . management leaves before workers when they are still needed to perform certain duties that employees need done so they can perform certain tasks. employees  stand around doing nothing as your working. i would NEVER recommend this to ANYONE for employment
bad,"The location I worked in did not have good communication, had lots of mistrust, and was very difficult to achieve goals through the use of team work. Do not recommend applying"
bad,worse employer to ever work for trust me they really know how to jerk you around i stayed there for way too long but they finally fired me like i wanted
bad,"oil changes ,new tires ,air filters , new batteries installing for Different Types Of Car Using Computer To Make Sure And Find Right Parts For Each Car"
bad,"Management is horrible. Have been working there for nearly 8 years and only get paid the same as someone who has worked there 8 weeks. Had to beg and plead to become full time for nearly 4 years and when it finally happened, someone who has only worked there for 2 years was able to get full time right away. After being a loyal, hard working employee for so long, I now get treated like garbage. Do not recommend. There is not a single piece of me that enjoys going to work here."
bad,This management sucks at most walmarts! They dont care about their customers or employees. All they care about is their bottom dollar and how much bonus is going to go into their pocket.
bad,I did not like working here. Poor manangement. Uncaring and cold. No set schedules not rotating schedules. Low pay and over worked. A very good learning experience.
bad,worst place to work they only cared about them self  worked there over a year and everyday was like the worst day ever the management was crazy would not do any work then would get mad when everything wasn't done
bad,"Not a place I would work at. Pay sucks. They are slave labor company. You domt move anywhere unless you kissing someones butt. Or having inappropriate  relations with your boss, whichever works best"
bad,"Terrible pay, awful management. The management seems to be a group of angry 40 yr olds who are mad they still make 16 bucks/hour. They take it out on us teenagers."
bad,i do not like walmart   i will never work there ever again the benifits are not good and you are punished for taking time off for youself or family members
bad,I would not recommend this place for a job because no one cares about the associates and how they feel or what's going on at home. I was terminated due to absences that I could not control
bad,A low paid hard working job.....................I don't like it.too much hard work for the employees...they pay low salary and a nominal bonus.Management is bad.
bad,As soon as you get hired on they tell you they are family oriented. I found out that is a lie. Just like they said they don't play favoritism which is also a lie.
bad,"Responsible for assisting customers with work orders for automotive department; Handling of hazardous materials; General cashier work such as keeping shelves stocked and helping any customer inside the store with questions; Helping other departments which included being responsible for the keys for firearms; Closing the department each night, making sure everything was locked up properly prior to leaving."
bad,"Good job if you are trying to get your first job or you want a job to work for a few hours a day when you retire. Not the best environment with workers, but this is with any job."
bad,"never work there, it does not have very much management, and there are horrible people that work there. worst place to work.  the store goes through management like tissue paper."
bad,The management did not care about the employees. They were never understanding in accidents or emergencies. They never explained their policies and never told me about the fact that we didn't get holiday pay. They were aweful. I found nothing enjoyable because they made it terrible. I was yelled at for things that the other employees would do. They had their favorites. No one was treated fairly. The managers were consistently on their phones or computers on facebook. They did not answer walkie calls and when you cash there is no walkies so there is no communication with the sales floor when a question about a price comes up.
bad,"stupid customers, stupid employee's, horrible management and horrible hours and pay. Unfair, and extremely biased management. know it all idiots. bad pay, bad hours"
bad,"Not only are they filthy capitalist swine, the family cartel behind Walmart are social parasites, unfit for participation in a civilized society. Were there such a thing as justice, they would all be in Guantanamo Bay."
bad,"The managers do not care for or listen to the associates or reasoning.  Everything, no matter what happens, seems to be always blamed as an associates fault."
bad,didnt work there long would not recomed did not like the enverment there wound not refer anyone to this store very unprofessional place to work did not enjoy
bad,"The management sucks. They were not helpful if you see them. The customers are the worst. They let the kids do what they want to do. If you are sick, or have it emergency situation, it is very hard to call the store. You have to call a 1800 number that will connect you to the store."
bad,"The company was stressful to work full! The hours where never enough to support a single person. The company would not work around your schedule, you had to work around their schedule. I have a hard time supporting this company!"
bad,"horrible experience. Not good management, bad job, unclean, bad pay, unfriendly, no action taken on complaints, instability, bad energy, unclean break area,"
bad,you are required to keep the store clean and safe for customers at all times. Keeping things well stocked and easily accessible to shoppers at all times.
bad,"I volentarely resinged due to wal mart employement practices was always working closing hours, was told at first there would be a raise and insurance it never happened"
bad,"The pay is not nearly enough for how constricting the job environment is. The managers are stressed the point of illness and it’s almost impossible to lead a team in that state. The absolute dedication to the slogan “the costumers always right” is insane and leads to the employes being treated like trash by tyrannical costumers. -5/10, would never recommend."
bad,"It has poor communication with their employees and they only trust their customers more than their employees to themselves. "
bad,i really didnt enjoy working for this company. They had way to many managers who could never agree on a plan which cause alot of stress upon employees.
bad,"I would never recommend anyone work at Walmart.  They don't care at all about their employees.  No matter what you do, it's not good enough.  The more you do, the more you are taken advantage of."
bad,"High stress, no training, favoritism. Pretty much as terrible as most people say. Worked in 6 different positions and none were worth while. Could not move passed bottom level."
bad,Walmart is a very stressful work environment depending on management. Not all stores are the same. Each store has its own environment depending on management.
bad,"walmart is a terrible place to work, the job isnt worth the low pay, management and the store overall are very dissorganized, and most of the people there seem like they hate you"
bad,Worst job i ever held well i mean the isn't to bad but the management thinks all employees should put them on a throne and bow and then comes the lack of
bad,Management at location is unorganized and job descriptions are not adhered to for all employees equally.  Management verbally berates workers for being slow as a tactic to get them to work more than the required quota for the day.
bad,"Busy place to work and management gives the light work load to people they get a long with the most, very unorganized and to much drama for a busy place. Yes i mind my own business and what not but somehow management tends to pick on the ones they dislike."
bad,I first worked upfront as a cashier at Walmart. The customers really enjoyed how i treated them and helped them. Then I was upgraded to a position unloading trucks ..
bad,this job gave me constant problems they told me I could only have one day off for my moms funeral then told me my aunts funeral wasn't worth to be taken off I went to my aunts funeral and was fired for it.
bad,"dont work there they suck. they dont care about their employees"
bad,Walmart is underpaid none should have to go through all of that working at walmart. I would suggest you find better unless you are a manger or in college walmrt isnt a stable job
bad,I enjoyed working as a cashier but Walmart is not a good company to work for. They do not care about thier employees or care about how hard they work.
bad,Walmart company wasn't fair with employees benefit very sucks and didn't work very right and I didn't really like that job I really wanted to grow with the company but it wasn't showing me away to and grow with it
bad,"It was a nightmare. Besides unrealistic expectations they wouldn't hire to fill the positions needed to complete the tasks. Those they did hire where the bottom of the barrel. For a time they stopped administering drug tests because so few people who were applying would pass them. Their solution was to stop testing. The store manager was a psychopath that would scream in your face if you didn't live up to his expectations. He would change schedules randomly throughout the week, not inform people of the change, and then scream at them if they didn't check their schedule daily to see if he changed it. During weekly meetings he would tell the department managers that we were not good enough, weren't hitting his expected sales, even if we were meeting company expectations, and would remind us we could be replaced if we didn't do better. within a year, when I left,  I was the last department manager that had been there when he came on because they had either quit or he had fired them."
bad,Wal-Mart would be a great ideal job for a high school senior or an elderly person seeking a job to stay active. It's for sure a busy place and one thing about any position there you must pay attention to detail
bad,"this place i wouldnt work at again, this was not my ideal job, managers played favoruites all the time, and the training was awful. The management was flexible on days off sometimes"
bad,vous être les pire payée et le travaille demande beaucoup vous être 1  sur  10    pas délure  merci
bad,"Did not enjoy working for this company. Did not think the store was run very well by management, big time turn over there. Very little communication with employees."
bad,You have to really kiss up and be in the right crowd to make a career of Walmart. Or at least that is how you were made to feel at the 0430 store. Wouldn't recommend that store for anyone
bad,Worst place ever panic nightmare inducing levels of unmanaged chaos daily. Management is a horrible word for that circus. No1 knows what 2 do day 2 day
bad,"Employees are treated less than inside of the workplace. The managers walk around as if they're are to good to stop and help out with a customer, that it just doesn't make any sense."
bad,Do not ever work there its garbage worst mgmt ever I would not recommend anyone working there because pay is bad work is outrageous and everything is a joke
bad,My particular store that I worked for had alot of racial issues with management and customers. The management team is ran in circles off of cliques...
bad,"the store I was at was awful. It has changed a lot since I was there. inconsistent scheduling, and management was horrible.I would not recommend anyone unless it a first job."
bad,"come in short staffed, keep being told I'm slow but seems I'm going faster then most people in the group, get yelled at because I was caught with nothing in hand just after I set the box down but no one else does and they move slower then me, I feel that I'm being yelled at because I'm not the favorite. I'm there to work not to be a favorite."
bad,"Working for Walmart wasn't the greatest experience, But it also wasn't the worst of experiences either. "
bad,"This company holds a morning meeting in which they brag about the millions of dollars they are making, all while paying you minimum wage & expecting perfect work. After a year of work they offer you a 12 Cent raise. As if that will help even remotely. "
bad,"I have been with the company for about 3  years. it started off great, but recently the management team changed. They've cut hours; I am a full time student, and they refuse to work around my school schedule.The new managers are awful and the store manager is very rude. Wal-mart is going downhill. I am currently looking for new employment."
bad,don't really like this place anymore you can't even shop early anymore the best time to shop don't really wanna write anything just wanna fill out apps
bad,"I have been employed with this company for close to 20 yrs, the downsizing they are doing is cutting my position out, and forcing me and others that have made the company grow to leave.  Very Very poor transitioning planning."
bad,the atmosphere was not pleasant management were never around if needed to many customer complaints about not having items in stock the culture was fair to much negativity the hardest was remembering codes for certain items and price checks no one was hardly in any of the departments and took forever to get someone to find out the correct price the most enjoyable part was meeting new customers all the time and seeing them come through my line every time.
bad,"Walmart distribution in Shelby NC is the absolute worst place I have ever stepped foot in. Everyday when I pull in the parking lot I have to talk myself into going in that day. I work in DA receiving (weekday nights) with the most petty, unhappy managers in the entire building. The production rate has almost doubled, and is impossible to make 95% of the time. The line is constantly stopping, but they don't give you down time, so your production is the same. They have taken our lunch breaks away, and left us with a 20min and a 15min for 10 hours or more, even though it takes longer than that to walk to the front and stand in line to TRY to order food. Training is also a joke in DA, so you have a lot of new employees with 2 days training and they have no idea how to do their job. Everyone that I have talked to including myself are currently looking for another job.....If you have ANY other options you may want to consider those first!!!"
bad,only if you cant find anything else days are long under appreciated backstabbing every man for himself.  wanted to be day shift they put you on night shift even if you dont want to be.
bad,Manager and supervisors lacked communication. Constantly screwing up my work schedule. One of the worst places I have worked. Almost got fired due to there lack of communication and constant schedule issues.
bad,"Very stressful"
bad,"Working for Walmart was awful. I only stayed because it was a paycheck. They refused to provide me with a raise but would frequently assign me shifts at high pay rate locations in the store (I was cross-trained) I applied for promotions and the outwardly denied me stating they could not promote someone with an open FMLA. I was electrocuted with on the clock, on the floor, and the manager attempted to refuse to call the ambulance, then insisted we contact the workman's comp nurses line first despite my shortness of breath and burnt finger. This job could literally kill you."
bad,I absolutely hated working here. I got used and worked daily and asked to come in on days off. I had multiple absences in the month of November because of my health and a few family issues. they fired me because I had to call out for a doctors appointment. would not recommend working here .
bad,"I like my coworkers but management just doesnt care. scheduled as a full time employee and they wont even give me 30 hours a week or benefits. For being a ""family"" store they sure dont care about your well being or your family."
bad,"This company is very unorganized, they cheat you out your hours and money. Management, as well as staff, was very focused on drama other than working as a team."
bad,i hated working for Walmart they tell you at the beginning that it might not be temporary but they give you no warning that they are letting yo go if you are a seasonal worker and then when it is time to tell you find out in front of everyone that works at the store that they don't want you working for there company and no notice.
bad,"Dont work for walmart if you expect to be treated fairly and decently by management. They look down on you and only care about their money as a whole. They dont care about employees at all. Work and benefits are not worth working for this company either. They dont pay enough for me to consider still working for them with the stress, and doing managements job for them as well. Hurt my back while working twice, got told i was lieing about hurting myself, and the second time that i lied about how and where. Then got told they didnt care what happened to my back. Lol. Point is its a miserable life working there."
bad,"Management and employees are very unprofessional. They gossip,  sabotage each others work and personal life if they can. Most time the management staff is in on it."
bad,"Worked here for a year, they made so many changes during that time, I can't count.  They do pay decent, but are always squeezing more out of you.  Hats off to shareholders and management."
bad,"the mountain view store is so lost. if they could just keep the same managers instead of constantly changing to disrespectful ones I may had stayed."
bad,"they don't give enough sick  days in the first 6 months. they don't take care of their employees, they are rude and don't always listen when something happens"
bad,"Worst place I've ever worked. It was a waste of my time and energy. When we had few people and an extremely large truck we were expected to get it done on time and they were not going to give us over time, if it wasn't in the budget. So basically we would have to work for free or be written up."
bad,No respect favoritism employees get wrongful dismissals either in first 3 months or after 12 years. No one works thier jobs they all leave work for others to do. No fair treatment. Gossip
bad,"Working for Wal-mart can be difficult and stressfull.  I have learned many aspects of the store I work for.  The company does not pay enough for the work provided, and I am not provided the opportunity to work full time to be allowed to have benefits.  The enjoyable part of working here is helping customers and working with my co-workers."
bad,"bad management all the way around"
bad,nous sommes simplement la pour boucher les trous!!!!!
bad,"The managment team treats you horrible, you unappreciated and management has no problem retailaiting or lying to get rid of people they don’t want. You have no job security and there is no life/work balance"
bad,never again it was horrible walked in on my on a affair happening between a Auto Tech and a manger it was cancer. i would never work for that one store again
bad,I hated my job. They fire at a moments motice and treat their elpoyees horribly. They dont care about their employees. They abuse the Pennsylvania  employment  laws.
bad,The thing about Walmart.
bad,Good job for a first job but is not something that would be a long term fix. You can be fired at the drop of a hat without really any reason why. Kroger is much better.
bad,Run as fast as you can.  Management does not get that without the associate they would not have a job. If you do not show an open availability you will work less hours
bad,i hated working here. It was the same stuff everyday with stocking clothes and people are inconsiderate and dont put anything back so youre constantly doing that.
bad,"Management walks pass you & never speaks! They look irritated by your presence. The company hires you as a “temp” so they can fire you whenever they want. (They don’t like you, you are DONE) I’ve seen it happen many time. They treat employees unfair, make you work long hours & give you NO BENIFITS WHAT SO EVER"
bad,"if they don't like there jobs why don't they quit...(managers) treat workers like peasants. because the store was opening they had us build everything, they has sweeping and dusting which was not in our job description"
bad,"After working walmart for four years they never promoted me, gave me a raise. I worked in five stores and held six positions. Their were  people hired after me making more. 0 accountability and management."
bad,Had to pass assessment tests in order to stay at Walmart. Walmart chooses who they want to stay because of the Assessment test instead of looking at how well they worked.
bad,Managers don’t know what they’re doing. It’s a terrible environment. Way to much drama. To much conflict in the work place. Breaks aren’t long enough.
bad,I wouldn't recommend anyone to work there... What a waste of a career !! Maybe for a kid just starting out or a college student or a physically or mentally challenged person but not for most people.
bad,"I would not recommend working here! The hours are inconsistent, the management is poor, overbearing, and sexist. They don not let you have an opinion! Its how ever management wants it and that's it!"
bad,Worst job experience ever.  People didn't show up for work. No managers to help when customers are yelling at you. Breaks don't get covered. You never work where you are scheduled.
bad,This is no longer around due to DHL Supply Chain's inability to invest in it's employees.Perfect example of what happens when you bring in outsiders to kill the morale on a job istead of promoting within.
bad,"Don't work here unless you enjoy working around some of the most toxic, immature, lazy, racist, sexist group of adults you've ever encountered. I would never recommend working here to anybody."
bad,"I went in just as the store opened."
bad,It was a good job until new store manager I loved the people I work with but the favoritism is unreal you bust you butt while other people walk around and do nothing ITS TRASH
bad,"this company is not what they are noted in the public to be. they care about the bottom dollar, and don't care how they get it or who is hurt in the process."
bad,The best time for me is that I had a chance to help different customers and help them the best I could and the was about the most of my day is with customers
bad,Walmart is one of the biggest chain stores to date. They don’t care about their associates. They treat you like trash and expect you to do everyone else’s jobs.  I was let go because my manager didn’t know how to fix schedules and thought Walmart was more important than my classes. It was very unfair. There are plenty of people that work there that do nothing but still have jobs. I would not recommend anyone work there.
bad,Wal-Mart has new management and are changing the way they do things they no longer want the employees that have worked there for years they want new employees so the can pay them less money
bad,"In fourteen hundred ninety-two"
bad,Typical day at work usually includes doing more work than one person should or doing the work of 3 people combined. What I learned is even though you do everything in your power to do what your supposed to do you will likely get in trouble versus those who don't do their jobs correctly don't. Management has their favorites. Nothing hard or enjoyable about my job other than a few associates I get to work with make it bearable.
bad,walmart has a really bad management team they are also very unorganized it took me for ever to get my w2 I was told that I couldn't receive it because I no longer worked there
bad,There is no opportunity to grow here. The management is looking down on you you are just a number and you will not be able to improve here now if you're looking for a job that you can just work the rest of your life away sure maybe I would recommend here.
bad,"They over worked you, if you had overtime they would send you home so that they didn't have to pay you over time. Management was rude, customers were rude. Corporate sucks the whole company sucks."
bad,"The management was not very supportive, always blamed the low man on the totem pole and didn’t strive to help fix problems. The front end management was responsible for everything under the sun even if you weren’t trained for it."
bad,"if you didn't kiss up to management you could not move up in the company, they out you on a time line to get you stock up. and they give you  more work that has to be done than time requires"
bad,Walmart will hire you only as a part time employee when you start. You cannot start out as Full time. My manager kept changing my schedule at what seemed like a moment's notice. I was glad to leave.
bad,"The level of anxiety that working at Wal-Mart causes its employees is crazy. They will overwork their good employees to the point that they breakdown. They break multiple guidelines about managers and personal managers having siblings employed in the store. They had certain employees who because of their ""special"" relationships with management never had to do their share of work causing more work to be piled on others."
bad,"The company has clear and well defined goals but fails to act on many occasions because of cutting hours and help. The managers manage on the seats of their pants and by that I mean they think short term gain and not long term. For Walmart salaried management think on a day-to-day basis. Their goal is to make it from one day to the next, often times they make short cuts or take routes that will hurt them long term to achieve the short term goal. To give an example, I worked as a Mod Team member. Some nights we work on short easy modulars and others on larger and more complex ones. At the end of the week I work 40 hours. 8 hours a night minus 30 minutes for paid breaks. Which means if I am working a mod that is going to take 9 hours to do and I need it done, sometimes I will take a 30 minute lunch and stay over 30 minutes and thus I am not 1 hour over my projected time. Well later in the week when I do shorter mods that require less time and finish early in the night, rather than allow me to take the hour off and go home early, I am given more work to do. In Management's eyes they get 7.5 hours of work out of me per day regardless of when and how I stay over, thus at the end of the week I now get in trouble for said actions. Walmart would do well if they would just stop thinking on a day to day basis and think more long term, weekly and monthly. Managers do a horrible job communicating clearly with each other, despite the home office's attempt to provide them with the tools to do it, email, notes app on the TC70 and MC40s, company cell phones, meetings...they still fail to communicate"
bad,"nasty management, bullies and liars, haven't set foot in any walmart since i left, had to go to the labor board to get the money they owed me, always short of staff"
bad,I just don't like working there. Favoritism goes on all the time. when people lower get raise the people who have been there a long time doesn't get one and that is not fair so the new people are almost making more than people that have been there for awhile. Walmart continues to take away things from the associates making were it is not worth working there.
bad,While working there the management over works the associates where there is no time to spend time with family.  This company doesn't care about their employees.
bad,I have worked at Walmart for Over 3 years i have taken and passed all computer based requirements (tests) to move up in the company but they would never offer me an interview. I had left in December of 2017 and have decided to move up in a different company.
bad,"Horrible place to work, may as well work at a Chinese labor camp. Walmart is basically a place for people with worthless college degrees to work at a slave wage."
bad,"Will not recommend this place to anyone unless in need of a paycheck. Management will straight up lie on any individual to save their behind, or lie on anyone that they don't like to get fired."
bad,"Horrible work environment."
bad,"The management was unorganized. "
bad,Just like any other jobs that I have worked with.  I didn't like managements and supervisor.  They tend to favor only certain employees.  They were not fun to work with.
bad,Management is rude discriminates disrespectful they care nothing about the employees and when you go to HR nothing is done it’s a horrible place to work if you want to be disrespected and treated very very bad get a job at Walmart
bad,"They constantly run a skeleton crew, us technicains were over worked and tires. Management did little to nothing when it was time to hire more people."
bad,this place is only good for high school kids for their first job. under paid no hours. they don't care about their employee. don't offer full time position.
bad,"If you do your job well, you will not be rewarded.  If you do your job poorly, you will not be punished short of overt negligence or criminal conduct.  Show up on time, keep your head down, don't get injured, and find a better job a quickly as you can."
bad,was nice employees it was very family oriented did all kind off fun things besides work it was very experiancing to me for costomer service and all manegment and employees weree all available to work as managment if wanted men and women were no difrienf treated all the same..............and we did all meeting  the very best to our employees
bad,"Don't work at WalMart there is NO advancement opportunities! The pay rate wasn't too bad, but it could be more seeing that WalMart is a World-wide Corporation. You do get benefits if you average 32 or more hours, but they're poor benefits. Management had no delegation skills, you did the same job everyday. There isn't much more I can say about WalMart excpect don't waste your time working for a company who has no interest in caring for their employees."
bad,"Experienced racism towards my tribal children and also wasa verified witness to boldly racist statements suck as nig*er day, referring to black friday witnessed donna rife asset protection associate of marquette store using said racist remarks.  Also, none I dare even write because I was completely disgusted with the level of compassion.  Employees are treated like cattle. Filtered through one after the other."
bad,"My time at Walmart was one of the most loathed times of my early working career. Hardly any shifts, bad pay, even worse supervisors, and atrocious working conditions."
bad,"At WalMart I would stock shelves and ring up customer's in the check-out line when it began to over crowd. Was divided into different areas of the store where I had to stock, lotion's home care items, and bath products on the shelf."
bad,"they dont care about if you have personal problems they want you to work you have the flu write up,near death write up, if its not helping them you will get written up. lord forbid if some one dies you have to bring the obituary to prove you was at the funeral."
bad,"So many managers show favoritism, they are not flexible with your work schedule. The business sucks/managers work ethics are poor. Good workers are extremely used."
bad,walmart is not a very fair and honest place to work.  They only care about how they can better themselves and not help their employees.  They would make the smallest person throw the biggest department because it was the hardest and their other employees didn't want it
bad,Management is disrespectful of anyone except for their favorite workers. Workers are overworked on a regular basis and not paid for the amount of work they have to do.
bad,didn't have long enough breaks always took your breaks to early and they wanted you to work you work your butt off for the little pay you got and after the holidays wanted to cut hours.
bad,"I was extremely unhappy working for Walmart! When I first started I had other Associates working in my department, after a few weeks I was the only Associate with several Managers in the department and was required to do the job of three associates in one shift. I felt taken advantage of and would not recommend anyone to work there."
bad,"Yelled at you all the time, and never gave you praise when you did extremely well. They even made scenes at the store at customers or to employees yelling at them"
bad,The worse place to work . Period. Everything is arbitrary and capricious. Walmart makes its own self serving rules and breaks it whenever it is convenient to throw out associates and that is right before full benefits are coming due.
bad,"Manegment is awful. They give you no support for anything, and that includes supervisors. You can away with doing nothing unless you’re hard working and actually do your job. So when you want to goof off for a bit you get yelled at."
bad,"Walmart is a terrible place to work. It's so bad I don't even shop there.  Management is a joke, customers are always rude and condescending.  Stay far away."
bad,The Wal-Mart I worked at were very dishonest. They would tell me one thing but document another. They do not care about the employees at all. Weather sick or healthy does not matter. They will write you up even with a doctor excuse. Its not the ideal job.
bad,Worst managment team ever! They do not fix the problems that happen and will find anything to blame on the employees. The employees also do not help the other workers or clients. They just walk away to say they are looking for help and will not come back with anyone else.
bad,walmart isn't a friendly environment. the pay was very low and didn't give out raises. the managers are not nice at all either. their min wage isnt fair
bad,Worked stocking shelves and keeping back room organized. Mainly worked in the hardware department. Every morning we would gather in the front of the store and do the Wal-mart cheer and go over expectations or voice our concerns
bad,I was pregnant and working in the pharmacy and my manager said I was self-centered because I needed to sit down on the stool. But then the manager let a technician that had a UTI sit down on the stool
bad,Management is picky. Coworkers are catty. Customers are a pain. Don't do it. Not worth the paycheck. Bust your butt here and they're not gonna care if you drop dead because they'll replace you that week.
bad,"No union so run. Hardly any raises. No holiday pay. Management sucks, no direction and rarely any promotions. I only worked here for a year and I hated it. ."
bad,Terrible company that doesn't care about it's employees. nothing but hefl working there. caused nothing but stress and panic attacks. there was no training. I was just thrown in
bad,Its Wal-Mart a huge companie that yes some people have there higher ups but there just never fully staffed and it's irritating then when they run the cashiers tired they get mad
bad,They fired me after telling me i was possibly going to be fired but made me work an extra two shifts before letting me go. I was not impressed at all.
bad,"No one follows up. Management doesn't care. The room for growth is very minimal and if you have a manager that doesn't like the way you do something, they will blackball you so you are incapable of moving up."
bad,Their whole issue is management. The Walmart I worked for had literally had three store managers in three Years. They need to hire people that know what they are doing.
bad,just a place to get by honestly. didn't really enjoy working there. too much and too many people moving around. didn't like being held for other lack of work
bad,While working at Walmart it seemed that opportunity for advancement was based off of favoritism vs actual skill and reliability. I felt heavily discriminated against many days while working at Walmart. When I reported these actions I was disciplined for speaking out. I was told i need to chill out before i get some one fired.
bad,"Walmart is corrupted by the higher up people , they pick & choose who they want gone & don't work with everyone great, their management skills are very unacceptable, they do not handle the customer situations accordingly"
bad,"Pay for where I live is decent, only reason I’m there other than customers. When I started there was a lack of training and I had to figure out everything myself."
bad,"Not too much to say about it, management doesnt care about your life or your needs. Employees that dont do their fair share are never or rarely dealt with."
bad,"A typical day working at Walmart would start with management letting you know you haven't done enough work and that you don't work fast enough for them. They will threaten to send you home if you do not work to their standards or if you talk or conversate with coworkers while on the clock."
bad,"The rules there constantly change. They had management that was not knowledgeable about daily activities or operating procedures. They do not promote by experience, it is simply who you know and who you suck up to."
bad,they work you way too hard for the pay their willing to give you. in my opinion it is not a good place to work for and while there i didnt feel like part of a team.
bad,management didn't treat Walmart right they really don't care about there employees. they are very serious when it come to there policy they cant keep employees.
bad,"My two years working at Walmart have been the most heinous. Upper management allow discrimination, harassment to run amok in the store. Hate this company!"
bad,"Honest, Walmart as a 3rd shift stocker has to be the worst job on earth. Maybe it was just the management at my site, they were lazy, disrespectful and just awful. Delegated work is very stressful, must complete all tasks pretty fast due to lack of time for the work. Just over all an awful experience."
bad,"Walmart has to be on of the worst companies to work for you're not treated fairly there, they don't give you enough hours, and the management is horrible."
bad,"Heavy lifting. "
bad,Some good managers but started to not care about employee well being. They want you to do management work without the pay. Lack of respect and responsibilities for actions.
bad,The management was changing constantly and expectations were not clear. One manager would require something and another would come and have a different expectation.
bad,managers were a joke. employees were even worst. no one ever knew what was going on what had to be done. no since of team. would not recommend working here.
bad,"pay does not match work load, management is not what it should be, insurance is too expensive for a company grossing 400 billion dollars a year, company needs to make major changes"
bad,Do not work here. The customers are horrible and always want to speak to a manager or get stuff at a lower cost. The management is rude and degrading. Your feet and back will hurt. Just please try and work anywhere else but here.
bad,I truly learned all there is to do in the retail business. I actually took this time to educate myself in an industry that has portential in growth. But poorly salaried.
bad,"At Walmart, you are nothing more than a replaceable face. I worked as a people greeter. I had someone threaten my life and their response to my request to move positions was to just get over it."
bad,Really wouldnt ever work for that company ever again. I did learn some stuff. But rather work where not being interogated and feel comfortable and understanding.
bad,"Bad management, constant production raises with no pay raises to compensate people get fired left and right for not hitting production and managers push you even when you say your back hurts and tell you to keep going"
bad,They want one person to do the work of 10 but only pay you the work of one. Refuse to give over time even when they are short staffed so you can help out. If they do give over time immidately after they cut everyones hours.
bad,They treat their staff poorly and the management is promoted at random. The workplace culture is terrible. Not a fun place or fulfilling place to work.
bad,As a woman I felt and was paid less that males who worked for the company. Management were taught to Induce fear to get results.  Overwhelming and unrealistic work tasks and a very hostile work environment.
bad,"Wal-Mart feels like a glorified High School, drama non-stop. Managers causing drama, and instigating it. Pressuring hard workers to do better but the workers who don't try are given everything to them."
bad,"managers dont agree with each other and employees get stuck in the middle, quick to write you up if you don't finish the immense workload they give you, quick to remind you you're replaceable, poor organization throughout company structure"
bad,"I worked there for 8 years. I was in school for the last 4 years. Towards the end of my schooling, I was fired. The reason was, because they knew I was graduating soon with a degree in the medical field. They knew I wasn't staying with the company. They said they wanted someone who can work there as a career. I wanted to at least put my 2 weeks in, but they wouldn't. I was told, to enjoy my new career. Which it took me 6 months to find a job, because I was fired."
bad,Don’t ever work for Walmart management will use you for what they can then let you go for any little thing they can find and if they can’t find anything they will make something up to fire you for I worked for Walmart for 2 years I was even a supervisor and they let me got because I needed a week off work to take care of a family emergency and they denied my days off and fired me Walmart is a joke.
bad,"People are very mean, and other coworkers are lazy. Seems like everyone in my department tried their best to avoid doing any work; hiding in fittings rooms, bathrooms, etc."
bad,It is only a place for retirees or school kids. Those are the only people to fit in with the culture of allowed work hours. Not a place for any sort of career or for a grown adult to maintain a livable or even below par sense of living.
bad,"There is a constant level of underappreciation at Wal-Mart. Departments are short-staffed with no intent of hiring, but the same amount of work is expected."
bad,the environment is very stressful and no advancement there .the work is very face paced and very straining .you can not express your concerns with the management team.
bad,"I did not have a great experience working for the store that I did. I was being sexually harassed by a customer and I reported it, NOTHING was done to remedy the situation."
bad,working full time hours. but was not made full time employee due to limited opening for full time employees. loved this job lots of heavy lifting and the hours were great.
bad,Average place to work good job for a student looking for employment. Hours are  all over the place and they are always under staffed never enough coverage
bad,The management was unfair! We are always short staffed and having to work 10 times harder. We never get breaks or anything. Management allowed customers to talk and treat us terrible.
bad,If you are a hard worker expect to be pushed to your limits. There were more times then I can count where I was the only employee covering several departments as well as working registers. Constantly called to help in other areas even when I myself needed and did not receive help. Management was hard to find and usually avoided actual work.
bad,This place were never up to par customers could never find merchandise shelves were never stocked employees were never happy customers were never happy just an horrible environment they dont care for the associate no one looks out for one another its just a place I wouldn't recommend to no one.
bad,"- Greet customers as they arrive"
bad,I hated working there because the managers were stupid. I felt like I couldn't grow there. I was there five years as a cashier and felt like my job was never secure. plus I couldn't advance to another department because mangers lied about what was open so that they could give it to the people that they liked.
bad,Worst place ever not enough equipment for scanning and capping the inventory bins and management they are very unprofessional and rude and they don’t train new associates and treat them like slaves.
bad,Buena empresa lamentablemente tienen gente poco preparada para las jefaturas de departamentos.
bad,Awful place to work. I worked there while going through college so I was part time. They scheduled me full time hours and when I asked to go full time they would never let me but made me sign this paper that stated it was fine I was working full time but without any full time benefits. Management team is poor and they don't care about anything. I would never recommend anyone to work here. Awful corporation.
bad,"Horrible, Pay is horrid, Managers are completely clueless.  Surrounded by morons both customers and employees.  If you like being a CNA Without having to do dirty Diapers(besides those in Infants) this is the job for you."
bad,lack of proper management training made the whole crew stressed       . The hours are way too many for the type of work. Heavy lifting and irritated crew workers
bad,"treated unfairly, asked to stay late and work off the clock. didn't receive back pay for 3 months of manger work i completed. unwilling to work with schedule. don't work for them"
bad,"Everyone's general attitude about working was a disappointment. It seemed like everyone's mentality was 'every man for himself'. It was fine working there for about a month, and after that the nightmare escalated until I quit. I certainly wasn't the only one to abandon ship. It was so bad, the stress affected my health. Management care about appearances more than anything. Working there made me unable to apply to similar jobs for fear of it being the exact same hostile environment."
bad,I feel that there is a lot of things that go on in this store that is not right. My personal integrity was pushed and there was a lot of favoritism between management and certain employees.
bad,moved up to customer service manager shortly after being hired crossed trained new cashier .....customer service lead for layway dept..stocker at night graveyard for a few months stocking shelfs
bad,I love working in the Asset Protection field part-time. But I'm not happy about working for Walmart. The company has a lot of changes that they need to make.
bad,"If you are working during peak and have any emergency don't call off or leave early you get a step, too much stress for the pay. They terminated me because I couldn't get out of my subdivision due to icy roads.. Then when I contacted higher authority they said it was a wrongful termination."
bad,"Wouldn't recommend Wal-Mart to anyone. When my mother passed away they refused my bereavement pay and my manager said It was lie. New scheduling system is horrible, cuts full time associates to part time hours which in resulted in me losing my benefits. When I had to leave work for family emergency I was told I could lose my job. Stay away, you deserve better."
bad,I hate working for Walmart the managers where disrespectful and would get in your face and spit in it thats kinda why i decided to leave because i got tired of the disrespect and getting spit on
bad,"would not recommend in boone nc.  unprofessional management. poor benefits, cut backs.  managers unfair, play favorites.  get personal, try to control employees at home."
bad,Terrible!! I didn't only see it at the Walmart I worked at but literally every WALMART I've been to management and/or customer service SUCKS. Sam would not be satisfied with what Walmarts become.
bad,Wal-Mart was the hardest place I ever had to work for...not for the job itself I was a cashier but the customers and managers. I spent so much time being told by management to do one thing and as soon as the customer complained about it I was in trouble for doing so. I am sure different jobs there were easier and you were treated better but my management liked to discipline and yell rather than help. You have to understand there is no pleasing most people. I have been yelled at for being to friendly or not enough..bag to slow or to fast or even in the wrong manner to the particular person. They also never followed the eight hour turn around law. I would work 5 p.m - 2 a.m and come right back at 7 a.m.
bad,"In this company you are nothing but a number. They don't care about any of there workers at all."
bad,Never a guarantee of hours and poor pay. Employees that slack are never reprimanded and employees that work hard are never rewarded. Management isn't particularly helpful.
bad,Walmart has very poor management they don't care about there employees they will bring you in for a couple of hours and send u home because they put to many people on the schedule
bad,Wasn’t a good place to work and the manager wasnt very caring . You never got to be able to say you had a good day and they ask to much but give very little .
bad,I didn't like this job. Management was disrespectful and condescending. They worked you just under 40 hours so you wouldn't be considered full time. You would work 39.5 hours a week.
bad,"horrible place to work, constant turn over of both management  & hourly employee's . employees are not treated well and the expectations are very unrealistic"
bad,very bad place to work benefits are not that good and manangment isn't very good to there employees Walmart s mostly aout sales they don't seem to care aout there staff
bad,"Getting on managers case to change schedule or extra, not taking lunches on time , sitting at the register for 3 hours waiting to be relieved , really rude customers, you don't get to have fun , one of the new frontend managers are in professional she will yell at you in front of customers."
bad,On a day to day basis you pretty much had to watch what you said and who you said it to. Working hard in your department wasn't enough they would not show appreciation to their employees. If and when you become a Assistant Manager its only to slack off while being paid more than the hourly.
bad,"i worked there for 4 years. it started out grate and promising. as long as your a good person they will most likely hire you. however the career advancement they preach about is a lie. it only happens if you have a go connection with the managers in charge of the store and if you don't have a good relationship with them they wont promote you. i myself tried several times to get a promotion after months of. coming in early, staying late, taking on extra shift, doing extra projects, training new hires, and doing managerial duties that were far above my position but even after working so hard they didn't so much as give me a chance because i was not there friend. simply put if you want to be professional and a hard worker you better off looking somewhere else because walmart is not a play for hard working smart people. they will make false promises and lead you on to squeeze out as must labor as they can from you then ether try to get you legally terminated or make you hate it so much you resine."
bad,"I would work 8 hours is what I was scheduled but usually 10-11 hours, we would unload trucks and management would come back and yell at us to go faster and not do anything to help when we had maybe 5 people for a 20 person job. they would not offer help and take members of our crew from the area to put elsewhere. I myself was taken to bring carts in, casher, run technical help, help the grocery side unload their truck, and janitorial duties."
bad,started out good  after a few years i found that the mgrs was doing there oun thing not the walmart way it did not help the workers to do there jobs the way they had to be done . the store has gone down h
bad,"i personally do not like walmart. i would not even allow my kids to work there."
bad,I got treated very badley there.and sid not like the people there at all bc i would stay over hours and dint get payed for it.so i left bc of how bad i was being treated .
bad,they like to run on few associates so you will be doing multiple things at one time a lot. sometimes the training isn't enough and the computer based training is hard to keep up with when you need to be on the floor.
bad,"Management is very bad. They bully you. You are been threatened not to talk against your store manager even if he or she is doing illegal or unethical work, and if you do that they fire you for no reason. Basically walmart need slaves."
bad,poor work environment  - too hard a job for the amount of pay that you get.  not very flexible  - did not like the company culture or the management - too far of a drive also
bad,"Walmart is a job you don't want to have. "
bad,It was great at first. They did a lot of computer training. Shadowing a person if you were lucky. Management was nice for a week. Then every thing went down hill. Mangers ignore policy and customers alike. Not enough CSM to help cashiers. Got terminated for being sick. They throw away doctor notes. Yes doctor notes do not count. Their records are laughable at best. Never noted my medical issues. Do not tell their employees about their rights either. I was told to literally Google them.
bad,"Very poor culture, no sense of urgency or understanding of what a real corporate workplace is. Poor management. Many people here have been promoted from a store and do not have the skills to be in management."
bad,Google walmart treatment of associates and you will find all of your answers.Every year it gets worse and worse. Retaliation is a huge problem. Market team doesn't care.
bad,"Pros"
bad,"management was awful! poor work environment, they  work you crazy hours and keep you from making 40 hours a week and make your hours so crazy you couldn't hold a second job"
bad,Worked you sometimes with out a break. Too much work for the pay. Worked many many hours with out a break. Something like slave drivers. Through you under the bus every time they got a chance.
bad,Do not work here. Very bad management and no respect for life events. I would never tell anyone to work here...........................................
bad,"The only phrase that management seemed to know is ""zone"" up this area. Very little positive reinforcement or training support. Management and employees always seemed stressed out and unhappy. On the other hand, customers were usually very pleasant and appreciated my efforts to provide them with quality customer service."
bad,"It was a nice job, minus the managers which did not spend much time getting the their employees to know and learn the ropes. It was a good paying job but i would not recommend anyone scrapping floors with something as small as a toothbrush"
bad,A meat-grinder that eats your hopes and dreams and tries constantly to diminish you to subhuman standards.  Management really does hate the people who work for them and actively tries to harm you.
bad,"Typical day at work is literally cleaning up others people's messes and fluids. I was paid minimum wage for a job that put my health at risk every day. If I wasn't cleaning bathrooms I was taking out trash that did not smell nice either. If you are going to apply to this job be prepared to clean all day and no one even notice, because people are that messy. To me the only enjoyable part was talking to my co workers and breaks."
bad,Walmart does not have much concern for its employees. Wal-Mart is not very understanding to associates needs. Walmart is good if it was to be needed for a side job to earn extra cash. No good.
bad,"If you want an easy first time job, go to McDonald. Walmart is horrible, they treat you like trash and fire you if you disagree or have open heart surgery and cant work for a few weeks. and Lord forbid you have to go on medication or need a set work scheduled, they will NOT work with you and will tell you to basically go f yourself."
bad,"Don't work at Walmart if you can help it. It eats away at your life-force and exhausts you emotionally."
bad,This company would physically pay as little as possible legally. It makes new employees sign a flexible contract which with little or no notice can make you do any jobs in their supermarket. The company currently pays 3% for employee pensions which is the lowest in the UK. The managers treat you like something off the bottom of your shoe. best part of your job would be getting a employee discount off your shoping and thats it. NO breaks are paid so they minus an hour off every 8-9 hours worked
bad,I entered this job with the condition that they would work with my school schedule; all of it was a lie in a hiring process to just hire. Management does is not considerate of their employees which leads to employees having a stressful burden on their shoulders.
bad,no matter how hard you work or how dedicated you are they still treat you like a number and just a warm body to fill the position to do their biding. they seem to think you are there just to serve them.
bad,"Work schedule was constantly changing. No benefits for part time associates. Very difficult to get assistance During my time there, several associates complained about the way breaks were mishandled."
bad,Will bring you in saying you have full time status. Then with no warning will cut your hours from 36/week to 8/week! Any training you get in other areas will be removed from your file so that you are unable to pick up extra time. Not worth the pay.
bad,Horrible company to work for. No paid holidays crazy hours expensive benefits that don't cover much. Not family oriented. Crazy hours that you will be scheduled. Only apply as a last option
bad,I loved the whole customer aspect but did not care for the way we were treated and paid. I hated my schedule because I never had any approved time off when requested.
bad,"Working with the public is always an interesting skill set, you can find rewards in helping people , but the tough times are maintaining emotional control with people that are difficult in their demeanor"
bad,I had a son have a seizure and there was no consideration for my situation.  I had to work no matter what and once surgery was over they fired me for missing work.
bad,The staff did not work as a team. Management was very rude to the staff. The managers did not treat the team members equally. They would hire you on the conditions of you working full time but would never give you full time hours.
bad,"i did not like it at all, the managers were really rude and did not even seem to really care about employees and it was just not a very fun environment to work in"
bad,working at Walmart is very stressful and the place has very poor management and the hardest part is dealing with the abuse from the customers it sucks
bad,Hardst part of the job was dealing with customers who thought they were right even when they were wrong or tried to cheat the system. Some of the employees were a joy and others wish you didn't work with them or even know them because they were two faced.
bad,i learned so much as reguards to management challenging associates . changing lives and inspiring indivuals lives to  better one self .encourages all employee to make positive changes
bad,"Working at WalMart is a filler job, I wouldn't even call it a career unless you like hurting yourself. The managers don't give the employees and respect."
bad,"absolutely horrible. don't apply here until you are all out of options and have nowhere else to turn. management is always awful, you end up with one or two decent managers and the rest might as well not exist."
bad,"Horrid place to work, I won't even shop there. I worked in the store for 2 weeks then got thrown back in the pharmacy department with no warning or training. Management is a laugh, overall a deplorable place to work when I worked there."
bad,At this job there are many task so you have to be physically in shape to complete most o the task here. There is always room to grow in the company if you show you excellent work ethics. There is never lack of hours
bad,"I worked as a general worker, usually being put out in the parking lot to gather carts, clean up the place, and then recalled to do anything necessary that they were short on hands in the inside of the place.  I didn't see my supervisor except two times-- when I was hired and when I gave my 2 weeks notice. "
bad,"If would be great company if they did not a buddy buddy system. There no room for grow with in the company. Place is very stressful, manger need more diversity classes."
bad,"They teach you nothing, and expect you to know everything, and to top it all off if you aren't a salaried member of management you aren't worth squat to them. Favorites are definitely visible, so much so that a few relationship scandals have happened within the last year."
bad,A lot of the managers talk down to you as if you know nothing. If you have to ask a question they make it seem like a hassle and that you are crazy for needing help.
bad,"No flexibility"
bad,There was not enough help for every one that needed they did not give you enough training they are very strick they never understood anything about having kids
bad,I was let go because I was overworked and did not have the proper documentation posted for techs in training.  I was rebuilding a new pharmacy and was trying to hire new people while growing a business.  We were growing too fast to properly train the associates and I missed putting up the required documentation.
bad,"the holland store was the worst place to work, the management does not care about anyone but themselfs and their favorite employees. the place is dirty."
bad,"It was a good first job, but they do not work with your schedule if you want certain days off. I would not apply there again. I did not enjoy working retail."
bad,Not a good place to work. Most of management were on there phone or no where to be found. when you wanted to go up if they did not like you you would not be able to.
bad,"Wouldn't allow overtime, cut hours drastically and couldn't care less about how you or your family are. I had Strep and they wouldn't excuse my absence even with a doctors not because I didn't have pto to cover it."
bad,Walmart takes advantage of its employees and the management is worse. too many chiefs and not enough Indians. most enjoyable about the job was the customers
bad,"management was bullying, but loved working with other associates. Management there was bullying to most of the employees. I had to quit because none of the other managers would step up."
bad,"Too many managers telling associates what to do, without checking with each other. Example: Put 4 shelves of bean soup on that end cap. 1 hr later, a different manager says, get the bean soup off that end cap and put Ramen noodles there. "
bad,"The Walmart I worked at is rather stressful and I honestly would not let my worst enemy work there. I was made to do my department managers work, and yelled at when that plus my duties weren't perfect. I would rarely get my 15 minute breaks. When I got injured, they would actually work me more, no matter the pain I was in. So, I wouldn't want anyone to work there. No one does anything, and the people who do, only get in trouble for everything."
bad,This was a typical walmart job that paid close to minimum wage and offered no benefits. No one should ever want to work this job. It should always be a stepping point.
bad,they lack what it takes to keep employees. Due to harsh work hours and inability to work with what you could do with having a family to take care of too
bad,I will never again work for Wal-Mart. It was a nightmare and I will never put myself in the position again. The mangers orders over lap each other causing issues. The employees are always complaining and don't want to work making your job harder. It was too stressful for me.
bad,"Bottom line, I'm outraged. "
bad,"Horrible pay"
bad,"Walmart was the worst employer I have ever worked for. They do not care about any problems that may arise, they expect you to work no matter what the circumstances. I was injured and had other medical issues and they did not care, management still expected me to come in. Managers do not communicate with each other so you are constantly pulled in different directions on how to do things and handle different situations. They are also very rude to associates and will speak to them any way and play favorites."
bad,"They set unrealistic goals from the beginning and change goals continually, they do not have paid holidays ad you work 3 12 hr days a week but get sent home early most of the days."
bad,"Not a good job if you want to go far. Managers have no idea how to manage, favoritism is rampant. Short hours even for full time employees. The customers are the best part of the job."
bad,I dont beleive walmart is a friendly work place. Hostile employees. They dont pay well. And the bennefits suck. I would not reccomend walmart as a job to a friend or anyone.
bad,"When I started my employment with Walmart, I was so excited to work for my favorite place to shop. Now sometime later I have a much more negative opinion on this retail giant. Walmart corp is all about making money, at the sacrifice of their employees, their families and all similar but smaller other retail establishments. Morale amongst employees currently is at an all time low and people are quitting left and right. Think very closely before you apply there."
bad,Not a great place to work the turn over rate is fairly high unless your in a decent position hours were horrible unless your full time ya never knew if you were going to get enough hours to afford the gas to work.
bad,Management is very childish and unprofessional I would never work for Walmart ever again. they were very inconsiderate of problems had at home. my 2 year old daughter had to have surgery to have her kidney removed and my manager was very inconsiderate about it. I worked for the Walmart in commerce city Colorado. 80022. her name is Vanessa. I will nerver shop at Walmart again because of her.
bad,"If you are placed in a  poor performing store you will not have the ability to advance or grow your talents.  Due to staffing shortages, management was expected to fill in the roles"
bad,I was harrassed by multiple managers numerous times at multiple stores and nothing was ever done about it. I never was given any pto no matter the amount of hours I worked.
bad,Talk about being walked all over. This place made me feel like an outcast even though they trained me from the front to the back. I still wasn't qualified to get an advancement and was fired for helping customers while other employees didn't.
bad,All the managers are AWFUL. They treat everyone there like trash. I am now blacklisted from Bellefontaine store. All because the manager was sleeping with my significant other.
bad,The management was very impersonal as the only communication with managers was during the hiring and firing process. Hours are automated so there is no consideration for employees out of work life with the assignment of shifts.
bad,"It is all about the money nothing else matters not even your health, i would never return to work there , they do not pay enough for all the stress you will receive ."
bad,I didn’t feel comfortable working there for a long period time. I feel they didn’t work with my scheduling for school. Like they advertised about working with people schedules so they can go to school
bad,"Terrible employees, terrible management, unfair and you get treated like dirt no matter how hard you work. The open door policy is a joke and you will never be taken seriously."
bad,"manager's talk and treat the employee's like they are not human being's.  Rules were never who to speak if you had a problem, there point system  out of the blue for me. then when asked the asst.manager what could I do,or what  was my status for the job. For over a month I waited for an answer over one month. I walked off  the job, so the company push you out the door,with lack of communcation. who does that WALMART"
bad,Walmart was a horrible job. management never wanted to assist the associates. they only walked around with drinks and talked and texted on their phones all day. it literally was the worst experience of my life. on top of going to work being bullied every day and reporting it but never having nothing done about it. plus getting mistreated when you open door an incident that occurred at work. their is no protection or security to speaking up without being mistreated.
bad,They raised and give bonuses but then they will cut your hours. Poor management. No career advancement. They treat you like sht. Too much job but they don't pay you good. Beware of this company
bad,the manager in the tire and lube would fool around with alot if not most of the females that he was managing and other employees and a couple other managers
bad,i was a fantastic speedy worker. i am also a fast learner so it took me little or no time to learn the register and get to work. i was given not enough hours to provide for my child but i still attended work.
bad,They think everything is an emergency. They think you are at their beck and call even when you are on vacation. This company does not care about their associates. The only thing this company thinks about is profit.
bad,I don’t want to say anything about this job at all I really don’t know what to say I just don’t want to talk about it at all I don understand why I have to write anything about it in I don’t want today
bad,Employees were not as friendly as expected. Loved working with and helping customers . Did not like how the atmosphere was not friendly and not welcoming.
bad,its ok to work there but some of the managers tend to let thier jobs go to thier heads and sometimes they can be rude not only to other employees but customers as well
bad,"I was working overnights and it was really busy and when ever i had a question about something on where it went, someone was always either really rude or just ignored me."
bad,"This place is a joke.....don't expect too much help from incompetent managers..right from the top down.......if you like a steady flow of the new faces of people to work with....this is your job...."
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work at Walmart due to the poor customer service and the lack of respect for the individual the managers there do not know how to talk to the associates you get treated poorly and no matter how hard you work they do not appreciate you. You have way too many bosses so you never know who to listen to it’s a company that doesn’t care about the workers and a company that will set you up for failure! All the managers are rude and very unprofessional.
bad,Walmart is the worst place to work for. Depending on the location the management is very rude and does not care about the associates. They only worry about themselves
bad,"i worked at this place as an overnight stocker in the frozen food department, they wanted me to stock on an average about 13 pallets of freight by myself, wouldnt have been so bad if i didnt have product from different departments that i had to get to them before i could do mines"
bad,"I applied for several jobs to move from the last position there (Modular crew associate) to another position/department but was always looked over and or not even given a chance to interview for said position, even though management 10 times out of 9 already had picked out who exactly they wanted."
bad,management not qualified in areas of work no communication unable to articulate required task contradictory company policies constant threat of loosing your job unable to properly guide employees in career advancement
bad,it all was crazy it was not work it was slave work you got paid poor money to do the stuff other shifts are supposed to do and management was always on people because Walmart has some insane expat ions that no employe could even get up to cause you have to be  super human to put a  dam pallet and a half in under an hour
bad,would not work there again not enough help for all the departments never could get task done on time being held responsible for other people tasks that interfered with mine
bad,Training is by throwing you to the wolves. They expect you right out of training to know what to do. If you want to move up you basically got to be liked by your store manager.
bad,I had a terible time working there. When something was wrong i would tell someone and then have to tell them again and again because they didn't listen.
bad,"Trained to assume asset protection management duties for a 1.2 million square foot Freezer, Perishables & Dry Goods grocery distribution center in Johnstown, NY. Responsible for all regulatory compliance, safety, and security of the center, with two subordinate area managers and 14 hourly associates as well as the medical and hazmat response teams."
bad,"The store manager along with a few other assistant managers are not who they seem to be. They may act friendly to you, but when you are in need of something they don't want to help you out at all. Not all of the managers are that way because I had a few managers who bent over backwards to try and help me. I would not recommend anybody to work there."
bad,The worst experience of my life.  There are never enough people working.  They wont give you time off for MAJOR LIFE EVENTS.  All management feels like they are out to get you.
bad,"i was treated very poorly at my store i was sexually harassed by a manager and underpaid and denied my raises because i spoke up about it, they refuse to compensate for sick individual and can careless of your well being"
bad,"i gave the place many years. they used to be ok but now they close stores left and right, cut benefits for part timers, wont give full time unless you are a favorite and if you are a department manager they really treat you poorly now days. i know several managers who have stepped down due to walmarts abuse of their associates. last resort place to work at best"
bad,"they do not care about their employees. they left me alone as soon as i was hired on knowing i didnt have experience in the bakery, they fired me after i was in a wreck and not able to come in to work because my car was totaled and i went to the doctor after being stranded, even though i called them several times to let them know what happened and they reassured me there wasnt going to be any negative repercussions because of the wreck,"
bad,I've never seen customers be treated so badly by the staff. Retail isn't just about getting your things and leaving as fast as possible. You have an impact on the people you see. The managers I worked with are extremely rude to the public.
bad,"Cashier and pushed carts "
bad,"I did not like this job at all,  the employees there are disgruntled from the low wages and stressed out from the managers who don't do any work but will manipulate their employees and turn them against each other... And to advance at this company is all political."
bad,would like the csm to be more understanding and also the managers when it comes to having to have a day off because of our kids getting sick. and there are some rude cashiers that need to be more understanding with the customers
bad,Managers were bad and everyone did what they wanted while all the new people had to do all the work. People would go and hide while others continued to work.
bad,The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers. The associates are extremely undervalued. The pay is not worth it. The management depends on the individual.
bad,"I would not advise any one to work there un less you have no other options. management is very poor and constantly turning over."
bad,Like any other job. Many task and obstacles that with hard work can be achieved.  It's a great starter to get your feet wet in retail and dealing with the public
bad,The managers lie to you and play the pass the buck game with each other. They take no responsibility for what they do. The employee turnover is ridiculous.
bad,They dont treat there employees qith respect  they have favoritism and you do more then your job title ask for they never have enough staff working and they treat some customers rudely  i use to love working there but now its like you are a slave no one should feel that way about a job the employees are amazing there to work with
bad,A typical day a work is usually the same. Management expects you to do the job of 2-3 people consequently over working their associates. After staying over your scheduled shift to get every thing done management will send you home at the end of the week so they don't acquire overtime.
bad,Extremely poor management and lack of proper training. I worked at Walmart for 3 months and received nothing but complications. I was forced to miss out on numerous breaks because they lacked enough employees.
bad,Too much management trying to do too much. Too many chiefs & not enough Indians. Too many people getting scrutinized for what they were doing wromg & not enough praise for what they were dping right.
bad,"Wasnt a bad place to work just unorganized and not put together, i enjoyed the customers and servicing them with what they need, Enjoyed the environment"
bad,"Managers were terrified of the store manager. He was unfair, they don't fight for employees. No chance for andvancement. But they'll have you ""helping out"" in other areas of the store that get paid more. Your pay won't reflect that though."
bad,Walmart is a very stressful place to work. There are so many rules that are applied that make no sense. No room for overtime and no advancements. Also no health benefits
bad,The managers would think they are better than everyone else. I will not work here ever again that's why I left. plus they tried saying I couldn't switch locations after getting married cause I was move from state to state.
bad,"Only thing about this job that's good is you get an hour lunch and two fifteen minute paid breaks which sometimes management won't let you take. Management sucks, they're unorganized stand around and do nothing but yell at their associates. Wonder why their turn over rate is terrible."
bad,"working there everyone treats you like garbage, I did my job and did it well, the hours they gave me, I really didnt have time to do anything a normal person would, like leaving work at 12 am, and for the pay of the work in combination with the work environment was not worth in to me to stay."
bad,I worked here while I was in college and had three children.  The company pays way to little and expects way to much from you.  You never work the department you were hired and are always being pulled in a million different directions by multiple different people.
bad,"management expected one person to cover all departments, while they took favorites and had them do nothing, one person was expected to do the job of 8"
bad,"You clock in, the managers are gossiping in the office about everything and everyone. Walks around and fixes nothing but belittles all associates unless ""friends"", has a meeting how we all suck then they go home."
bad,Don't work here. People aren't nice. The pay is bad. You'll work hard and you won't be thanked for it. I would not recommend working at walmart to anyone.
bad,My boss ddnt know how to treat me like a humans being and was very rude and disrespectful towards me yeah that old lady with the glasses who thinks she's hipped and young lol was a joke
bad,"I became disabled as a result of working almost three years for the company. The majority of employees never followed safety procedures or never held accountable for injuring other employees (at least during the time I worked there). There was poor communication and strategy from upper management. Poor strategy is defined as understaffed, disorganized, lack of communication, taking on multiple tasks beyond physical and mental limitations which resulted in cases of employees leaving early or resigning."
bad,And you wonder why there is such high turnover.  The good managers are few and far between and allow way too much to go on.  The three different shifts are spaced out in such a way that a social life is very difficult.
bad,I was a cashier and it was ok. You meet and greet the customers. You had to check for fake money as well check ids when people where using credit cards. A lot of shady business was going on so they made us look out for that.
bad,Stressful no hours over 15 Ima currently searching for something better I haven’t worked in a whole month because I have limited availability and I’m attending school for two days but I think that’s crazy
bad,It turned out to be a bad place for me to work. I feel that they treated me unfairly. Noone wants to deal with a theft that is what assets protection and management is for.
bad,"Management was poor, hours were poor customer service was fair employees were nice but because shifts varied you never got to know anyone personally.."
bad,"Terrible this job drains your life force and often gave me thoughts of suicide. This is coming from a person who is happy all of the time, I feel sad for the people who work here and relies on wal-mart to pay the bills. knowing that you have to come back is a bleek existence. To sum this job up, its slow genital mutilation."
bad,"I had never worked retail.  I decided to give Wal-mart a chance, seeing that I did most of my shopping there.  The deli work was fast paced and I liked that.  Unfortunately the pay was low.  The management had a hard time keeping our deli fully stocked.  This made customers frustrated.  It also affected our productivity and sales.  The Deli Manager resigned while I was there.  There was no replacement brought on board.  This caused more stress in the deli and also a lot of gossip and employee's trying to position themselves for the job.  The Managers were becoming more and more frustrated and it trickled down to the deli workers.  It was impossible to fulfill our job duties without adequate supplies."
bad,"Working at Walmart, there is no communication at Walmart whatsoever. The management does know what they will be doing and always places the blame on everyone else that is not in management. No one has any leadership skill. This company is a very ""do as I say and not as I do"" kind of company"
bad,worst place to work they treat employees bad no hours no vacation time no holidays off. no extra pay for working holidays very very hard labor for little money no lunch breaks
bad,"My first year at Walmart wasn't too bad but my second year was terrible. It was the same routine everyday with little to no respect from managers. I was miserable. Everyday was a fight to go in to work, and while I was on the clock, it was a fight to complete my shift. Working at Walmart is only a job to have temporarily. Happiness is what is important which is the number one reason I can not see myself settling for a job at Walmart. I encourage whoever reads this to follow your heart and achieve a career in something that you would love to do everyday of your life because that is what will bring you true happiness."
bad,Wal-Mart associates are very lazy and the managers do not have your back and they also speak to there associates any type of way in front of others.The Managers don't have the backs of the customers service managers.
bad,its walmart. my opinion on this job is irrelevant. has nothing to do with me trying to find another job. if you do not like people i would not suggest you working with the public.
bad,Only work there if you have to.  The managers will fire you for anything they can come up with.  The pay is terrible.  You will have at least six bosses giving you constricting orders and expect to complete all of them.
bad,Management dose not follow policy and constantly violates laws. I constantly had to inform supervisors about laws on animals in the store and they refused to inforce the state and federal law.
bad,"Worst job ever, low pay over worked. management sucked and the staff was lazy.had no training and was just thrown out to just work no help no nothing."
bad,"Very stressful"
bad,management was very poor and very unorganized when it came to dealing with work schedules. unprofessional behavior from managers and supervisors. no room for growth
bad,i will not refer any of my friends to work here. this is not a good place to work.overnight Asm makes working there realy stressful. there insurance is not good.
bad,"Lack of communication, got switched around a lot because no one knew what was going on, management was all over. Days were easy enough once you were actually put where you needed to be."
bad,Do fix what's not broken seems to be their motto. If it works why change it. Changed attendance policy took away holiday pay and now give you pto time makes no sense
bad,"night shift was not for me, I was in the bakery by myself from 12 pm to some nights 10 pm. The people who worked with me were nice but they were very messy and did not clean up after themselves and being the closer I had to do it."
bad,With the whole less is more attitude from upper management and the general hostile work environment everyday was a struggle. the company has continued to remove positions and cut hours making life stressful for those that currently work there.
bad,when  hird your promised very flexible hours once hired its very hard to get the days you ask for not enough pay management was horrible no benefits..
bad,I scanned return freight that comes down a converted line then I slot my own freight that I scanned. Iam a hard learning n a fast worker.I get along with my coworkers .
bad,Work there for 5 years never felt support from management. No real organization. This leads to good employees getting frustrated and a high turnover rate. Management is not responsive to employee needs.
bad,"I loved the work, customers and most coworkers.  I did not enjoy the  politics.  I love retail. I loved helping people. Merchandising and marketing were my favorite parts of my job."
bad,no respect for workers slavery system and workers are not rewarded managers dont do they jobs low mentality some managers take it personal with workers call out system suck
bad,"Its a great place to work.  The work hours are very flexible.  The managers are great and are willing to work out in conflicts you may have.  The pay was great, I real did appreciate the bonus."
bad,"managers are incompetent, HR ladies are hypocritical and borderline unprofessional. Why would you allow yourself to work long hours with, heavy work load with minimal pay? Stay away of this chain, work for another company. People are just not treated right and your basic rights will be violated if you allow it."
bad,i hated working there fine if your starting your first job there cool but not to py bills at all . under pay and little hours this is better for a high school kid
bad,The pay is low and the hours are inconvenient. The managers overwork the employees and it's generally a very sad environment to work in. The workers are generally treated poorly.
bad,"I have noting good to say about Walmart, I think this would be the worse job I have ever had.  if given the opportunity I would not work for Walmart ever again"
bad,"Negative Work Environment, Pay/Work Ratio were not very well compensated. This particular location is not very well kept, and Frozen food items were not portioned and stocked correctly, or safely."
bad,"The management was horrible, the pay was bad, the work they expected you to do was not covered in your pay. Overall the job is a no go. I would not recommend it."
bad,I did not like to work in this company because you do not learn anything. There is no chance of progress and all that they speak to staff lies and always have the manager right although it is wrong and bad management
bad,Walmart was really trash i didnt like the management team. They were to strick on some employees (i.e me). I was treated unfairly among other employees
bad,They will slave you like a dog let you get financially situated in life and snatch it all from you within a blink of a eye and refuse to let you get unemployment that company is all for themselves they don't care about employees let alone costumers
bad,working at Walmart was 1 of the worst jobs iv ever had the team of stokers were rood and very moody the job. didn't have much reliable help and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone as a starter job
bad,"Horrible Management, expectations are unrealistic, do not care about associates, cutthroat environment, poor moral, favoritism, cut benefits of long time employees"
bad,The walmart that I worked for was horribly managed and the staff was poorly appreciated and it showed in the work. A very one sided walmart location and staff.
bad,Number one place I would never work for again. The managers like to take their time when it comes to being needed at the registers at least. I was a cashier and every time I needed something from a manager it took at least 10 minutes for them to even get to me.
bad,"Sad, but true. Terrible working environment and hours. Give them an inch and they want 10 miles. Very unorganized. Sick? better be there infecting everyone else."
bad,"Working here is a nightmare, they give no benefits or persuade you to stay whatsoever. They terminate people to save payroll even though they absolutely need the bodies and keep their full time employees that are already stressed. If you want slave labor with no benefits, poor employees / managers, then this is the job for you. The only enjoyable part of the job is the fact that you can work without customers bothering you while you're stocking and staying far away from the other employees while they also work."
bad,"I liked the people I worked with, but mangers were different they acted like they paid us with their own hard working money. No I wasn't just complains i am making because I was lazy I was actually offer a manger position, but didn't take it because I have a different path in my career I am trying to achieve."
bad,"What can I said about Walmart my dream was to work at Walmart, but the dream become to a nightmare."
bad,A place that sets so many rules they don't follow unless they want a reason to fire you. They have a rule for every movement you do which they say it's for your safety. But they don't enforce them unless they are trying to retaliate for something you brought up in a startup meeting or you are topped out on there pay scale and want to fire you to bring in new people they don't have to pay as much. If anybody actually cares about human beings people would never shop there again.
bad,"I was considered a ""temp"" or temporary  employee but worked 40 hours every week for 3 months I was still considered a temp so I couldn't take off when my son was on the hospital. So I was told not to come back when I didn't get fmla."
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work here the management talks down to you and treats you unfairly I will never reapply to work there again they don’t ever give enough hours.
bad,They cut hours when they need to and work you to death when they don't. No lunch break sometimes only one break within a ten to eleven hour shift. PTO is NEVER approved.
bad,I never know what to expect there you got told one thing and then a different cam came up to you and say no do this if would be a better place it everyone  could  make up their mind
bad,"one of the worst places I ever worked, pay was very low and management was not very well trained. They spend hours training on computer for things like safety and all sorts of stuff but none of the training is ever used. This is one of the most unsafe jobs I ever worked."
bad,Walmart is cheap. They will tell you its very easy to move up but that is not true. There are people who work there that have been trying to get full time for years and still haven't got it. The typical work day is unorganized and sloppy. There are multiple managers that all say something different so it very difficult to focus on one task.
bad,Walmart was a good company to work for however they didn't pay enough and the roast you would have to do was just alive and someone to customers going to very nice
bad,Typical day would be starting at 6pm and logging on to the customer service desk  and doing site to store orders.  The only thing that made my time enjoyable was the co workers.  Creating friendships with them .Hardest part of the job was having to deal with the nasty managers that spoke to you in a demeaning manner and when you spoke back to let them know not to speak to you in that manner  they would retaliate by lowering your hours at work come  next weeks schedule. There was no moral or incentives . Was only working there part time at night .
bad,Management was not friendly and also I got cut from my paycheck. My first paycheck they didn't pay me for three hours that i worked. i t was not a good place to work
bad,"I would not recommend working at Walmart to anyone.  They work you hard and for the work they have you do, you are not fairly compensated.  I would not work there again."
bad,i did not like working there. the workers were not very friendly and the managers had their favorite people they let slide on things. the managers never stood up for the workers and allowed customers to speak to the cashiers any way
bad,"I did not like this job at all. Mt son was sick when he was a baby and they always give me a hard time when i needed to take him to the doctor, They only think of there self and not the employees"
bad,Everyday you had to do someone else's job along with your own. I learned to make sure I am always taken care of first due to poor management looking out for themselves. The culture was cut throat. I enjoyed helping the customers. And that is why I stayed.
bad,you either buy into the company or you'll hate it . tasks get mundane within a week. the key here is to be the best so you can climb the ladder. 12 foot rule
bad,the managers would mess with schedules to get employees in trouble and fired. they would put poorly trained people in areas they don't know and expect them to finish faster than anyone else. they will give you more jobs in the middle of the shift without notifying you getting you in trouble as well. over all do not work for Walmart.
bad,"Worst job I ever worked, shame for how long I actually stayed. "
bad,Gostei de trabalha lá mas o horário não dava pra mim é nem os dias de segunda a domingo por que fica sem poder ir a igreja e sem tempo pra estudar
bad,They don't look at their associates as people just bodies. They most defiantly make you feel replaceable and unimportant. Hours are cut almost every other week so there is no way to live off what they pay you. Management are lazy and refuse to work on anything themselves its all mostly delegating. ( no lie one manager walked past a piece of paper on the floor and then turn around called me off a register and told me to pick it up.)
bad,"Managers treat both employees and customers very poorly. They don't cooperate with school hours. "
bad,"The only thing I liked about this job was decorating the cakes themselves. Other than that, the place was awful. During my interview I had told them before I even was accepted that I have a planned vacation that was already paid for. I was told that it was not going to be a problem at all. I was told 3 weeks before my vacation that it was denied because my vacation was too close to a major holiday. (halloween) My vacation days were Oct 2nd thru the 10th....."
bad,"I’ve been with Wal-Mart for 3 years and am trying my best to find something better. It was a good job for me while I was younger, but now I just want more for myself. This place has taken it’s toll, however I am still thankful for the opportunities presented while employed."
bad,Don't work at Walmart unless you have no dignity.Walmart likes t treat people like slaves because they know people who work there desperately need there job so they push them and they just won't care.
bad,"No matter what time of day it was there was only one employee for the whole toy department, that's all that was hired and they expected you to unload 5 pallets and zone the entire department before it was time to leave if it wasn't done you were wrote up"
bad,Hiring young management with no experience or people skills.  Want Associates to have open availability or you will not get hours.    Overwhelming workload with no help.
bad,It was a very interesting job. Catching shoplifters in the act. At times it felt really dangerous because of some of the people you would have to confront.Stressful.
bad,Terrible work environment. Not allowed to even lean when no one is in your line.  Co-workers complain constantly.   The standing constantly takes a terrible toll on the body.  Supervisors are not understanding at all.
bad,Don't work there big mistake the managers suck they don't wanna work with you when you need them to I was trying to get a second job but they wouldn't help me out with my hours an the pay wasn't real good its like I was making minimum wage even tho I wasn't
bad,A very unfriendly place to work. Management has NO people skills. When I needed time off to take care of my wife after her stroke they refused to help me in any way.
bad,This job will teach you new skills and you will gain the necessary knowledge to continue with your search for a better opportunity. It will teach you how to deal with consumers.
bad,"I think the hardest part of your job is that you get too much work for one perosn. They overwork you, and expect you to help other employees. The management isnt that great, they lack time management skills, and communication skills, most of the work does not get done on time, and employees are to stay and work overtime to get the job done."
bad,"In the first week I was there, there was three harassment cases that were brought to management by different employees and nothing ever happened to the creeps that did it. The management doesnt care about their employees or where they work."
bad,Hate that place. Not a good place to work for. Unfair. Stressful. Management is unfair. Rude workers. Laziness. Inconsistent. Lack of professionalism. Wouldn’t recommend this place if business
bad,Bad management very unprofessional.  Also hours we're bad. Very dirty also bad vibes a lot of people had bad attitudes was never happy working.  Also manager violated my Hippa rights
bad,never work here unless you want to be slave. they dont support their employees. medical is ridiculous. scheduling is now done  by home office instead of the supervisors.
bad,"Was mistreated constantly by managers when I was pregnant with my first child,  I was given restrictions by Dr.  I was harassed to go on leave but incident because I couldn't afford it. I was also accused of adding restrictions and not listening to customer service manager when i did listen. Then my restrictions were used for someone else. The managers are rude and inconsiderate."
bad,Too much abuse and bullying from the management.  They do not appreciate when you work extra for them but have no problem disciplining you when things don't go as they want them to.
bad,Wal-Mart the company is good but they hire and promote poor management. The managers have no respect for individual and the open door policy doesn't work for associates
bad,"No one that worked there including management was older then 24. it was horrible. The pay was bad the everment was drama, Drama, Drama and no one bothered to take there job seriously"
bad,"Did lots of different jobs. .A typical day is putting freight away cleaning and cashier The hardest part of the day is that management will degrade you in front of customers, which is totally unacceptable."
bad,"Walmart is a cut throat company that does not care one whit about you, it's customers or even itself. You will be paid wages lower than a Burger flipper, given 2 to 5 people's jobs and fired if you can't do it.  Avoid this company at all costs."
bad,Cant expect much out of walmart. I broke my wrist moving pallets there and they just kept pushing me off instead of taking me to the doctor. I eventually had to go by myself and they refused to pay workmans comp. for the incident.
bad,"There’s a group of ‘cool-kids’ that have inside jokes, whisper in the corner and take frequent breaks together. Sadly, you’ve not been invited to be part of their group and are left as somewhat of an outsider. This, in turn, will make you feel sad and lonely and will ruin your working experience. It’s important to be accepted into an office and have good relationships with most (if not all) of your colleagues."
bad,Will never work for Walmart again if I can possibly avoid it. I never felt that Walmart treated its people good and they try to save money at the cost of putting their people in a position to never quite make enough to live on.
bad,"Good pay and lots of hours. But management let's some employees get away with alot of things, and punishes others. They play favorites with the employees."
bad,The Apple Valley Walmart is an atrocious place when it comes to working. Lack of honesty and respect offers nothing but poor management and hypocrisy.
bad,"not worth it, lack of management skills and high turn over rate. if there is any other opportunities to work for then do it, walmart is not the way to go."
bad,The company is very un organized and unpredictable. There is bullying going on. You have to be in the little click if you ignore the invatation to hang out after work they start to dislike you.
bad,Company doesn't care for its employees. preach about moving through company and then will not let you. I loved meeting new people but the management treated us like dogs.
bad,The higher ups don't care about anything. They will make you clock in later so you stay at 40 hours. No overtime and no care for the little guy. manger
bad,"A large company such as Walmart, should require educated management, better team leadership, and more benefits for their employees and families......."
bad,"Horrible lousy place to work STAY AWAY ask any employees about working at any Wal-Mart "
bad,Not a good place. Hours suck management sucks overall a very bad place to work i wpuld not recommend it to anynody. They dont work with you even in family emergencies
bad,It was a very low paying job. It was very difficult to get noticed for being an above and beyond worker. You are not compensated fairly for the work ethic you put in or for the work that they require you to do. There are strict working guidelines and they don't consider you to be of value to the company.
bad,"I was more than capable of doing whatever job needed doing but never got to advance to management because other people were favored more than myself. I am capable of building bikes and barbeques at a fast pace. I am very knowledgable in games and computers and the new types of TV's. Fun to work with a lot of people but unfortunatley some were liked more than others. Some of the managers were cool to work with but few that no longer work there never did their job right. If I can, I would love to return to work at Walmart."
bad,The boss won't work with your schedule.  They have a lot of unnecessary rules in the pharmacy because they have been sued so many times. I would never work there again
bad,Wal-mart was one of the worst work experiences i had in my life. Managers played favorites to other managers. Regardless of how hard you work or the know how you have for something if you aren't the managers bf you are not getting promoted. They definitely do not give you enough time to grieve when there is a death in the family. Three days of bereavement is not enough time in my opinion.
bad,The managers did not support associate needs or concerns. Employee moral went down every year. The company kept cutting employee benefits. Managers failed to implement and maintain company procedures.
bad,I enjoyed interacting with the customers. Greeting them talking with them and helping when it was necessary.  Also I enjoyed working in other Departments that enabled me to learn the store.  I got a chance to work with other managers that taught me about zoning.  I've learned about when customers come in and I'm given permission to help be their Personal Shopper for the Blind or those that had different handicaps.
bad,walmart needs to retrain their managers.  the management is awful!  no one knows whats going on or what they are doing.  everyone is so unorganized.  the managers are so rude and always in a bad mood.  it makes all the employees so unhappy to work there.  they expect so much from people who make pretty much minimum wage.  they also let me go when i was in the hospital for over a week.  its just a bad place.
bad,this company sucks I got paid less than door greeters and thats because I myself unloaded the trucks of freight. I would also stock out areas of mine plus more. this company sucks. the harder you worked the more they put on you. 10 dollars is all I made to unload stock unload other areas like frozen dairy. I made more as a night stocker at heb. I don't recommend this company to anyone trying to move up.
bad,Not a good place to work. They do not help employees. I would never telling anybody to go to work there. I have had a time there. Because my mom got sick and they would not work with me.
bad,redundant soul sucking place to work that does not pay the workers fairly. they are making billions while the employees make bare minimum. An unfair and unjust attendance policy ensures that they have a steady flow of hiring and firing consistently because it's to unforgiving.
bad,"Overall, I liked my time working for Walmart, I got along with my management staff and enjoyed the people I worked with. However I was wrongfully terminated after almost 10 years with this company. Favoritism does run rampant within this company."
bad,It was just a place where you were over worked with not enough pay to be hones not to mention there was never any consistence with this Walmart. Not professional attitude by upper management.
bad,When I first got hired at Walmart I was working 33 hours maximum 28 minimum. When they adopted the new customer care program it totally wrong to the employees. I went from 30 + hours to 13 hours and there is no fixing it in the computer because the computer was the way it is. Very little or no help from management they were just as frustrated too they were only allowed to fix so many things and we're not allowed to fix other things. Therefore I had no funds to pay my bills things are being shut off and I needed to go where I could work. They don't accept doctors notes Sedwick takes forever to compensate your points. I don't understand why Walmart would do this to their employees nobody will ever work full time unless you're grandfathered in or work in the warehouse or on the docks. It's supposed to be about the customers but the customers are mad too and because the employees aren't happy so they can't give good customer quality
bad,"Poor management."
bad,"just enough pay to not qualify fo assistance but not enough to make it without assistance, unwilling to work with you, Human resources fibbed about possible full time hours."
bad,"Managers would play favorites at the store I worked at. If you were not one of those favorites, they would find anything to get you coached. The favorites could do no wrong even if they were in a part of the store they were not supposed to be in or if they were just standing around talking instead of doing their work."
bad,"They expected blood, sweat, tears and your eternal happiness for being employed.  ""You get a check so be quiet"" type of leadership and personnel.  Fair well."
bad,"Walmart on appearance is a great place to work; however, looks can be deceiving. very unorganized managers and regular associates alike. not flexible, un-comprisable and slightly disrespectful. unwelcoming once you get in."
bad,Overrall Walmart can either make you or break you. If you're not a customer friendly person you want to reconsider working for this company. There are too many rules and restrictions and you get a coaching for just about anything.
bad,the customers are very rude maybe because i was on the night shift work place always cold never off on the time your supposed to be. just not a good place to work
bad,not a good place to work care more about bottom line than you your hours are not the same week t week and its like a high school it is grouped up even with mgmt they will put their friends in positions that they dont need to be in which makes the store not run smoothly
bad,Walmart is becoming less people friendly. It's seems be ran more like a corporation rather than a family friendly business. There is always new management some in which have no experience at all. Everyone is againgst each other rather than working as a team.
bad,They don’t care about their employees at all i can’t say all but their distribution center is horrible they take all your holiday pay in make you work every holiday besides Christmas
bad,I would never recommend Walmart to anyone they are a horrible company to work for they treat employees bad and do not allow you to miss work when sick
bad,"It really depends on what store you work at, but all Walmart are bad."
bad,worked under management that shouldnt be management. Same thing happens every night you dont see the manager all night then 530 comes around and then they ask Are u going to finish?
bad,Management do not know what they’re doing more than half the time and only care about the front end during holidays for their bonus. Unfairly treats employees but then tries to lie when you call a manger above them outside of the store. They change policy’s as they see fit and don’t give us any warning until an issue is engaged with a customer. Do not stick up for their employees at all. Don’t get paid enough to deal with rude customers
bad,Management don't care about anything. working on the same thing over again. no rotation at all. I would never recoomend anyone one working at Walmart.
bad,"Walmart is not a very good company to work for, the environment is not a healthy one nor is it in any way positive. I would not recommend that anyone ever work for this company."
bad,The workplace was different for me. I did not enjoy working here due to the management. I felt uncomfortable in some situations when it came down to constructive critics from my leaders. There were people who did not work half as hard as I would but I was getting told to do differently in my work place. I would sometimes have do extra work without team work from my leader. It was not a very good experience for me and I am glad the way things ended between me and Walmart.
bad,Store 2762 really needs a clean out with management because they do some shady stuff to people. Somebody in the company really needs to look into it..
bad,"I Learned that if your new they will put the blame on you. Very poor work environment. Training is bad, they just sit you at a computer and expect you to figure out everything else out one your on the floor. Just everything was bad, I did not have one good experience while working there."
bad,This job is fine in certain departments. I wouldn't recommend this job if you want to learn something about specific departments because there is no training and don't treat employees fairly.
bad,walmart is the rock bottom of starting work. it can be a place of growth but its all in how you see it. The work is mostly meaningless and grueling. customers and management often treat you terribly and that is part of the problem.
bad,at the time it was the worst possible experience that I could've had for a first time job. I was working night shift and getting paid $8.15 per hour. Not sure how I was supposed to live off of that. I was hired full time but then they started cutting my hours so that they wouldn't have to give me benefits
bad,"Typical day at work was stocking "
bad,They are always switching managers.  If your sick they do not care even if you bring a doctors note they will not except it and will mark any absent against you.
bad,"Everything was awful, the management didn't care about you, they mostly just yelled and if you asked a question they just rolled their eyes and huffed and puffed."
bad,"Horrible place to work, I would never recommend anyone to work here. They yell at you in front of customers. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL AND A LOT OF RETALIATION"
bad,"Working here was super stressful. Management was horrible, the customers were really bad and so mean to all the associates. I learned a lot about people and customers working that it prepared me for hard challenges in future jobs. So in a way, I think it may have done me good."
bad,The managers rush you through the process and don't get back to you or if they do it is mainly tossing you to another manager to deal with. Customer service lacks humanity.
bad,Out of all of the managers I have worked for Walmart is the most inconsistent. Never anyone to help or to talk to about anything at all. If management makes a mistake it's automatically someone else's fault.
bad,"Really not much of a review needed, walmart is really is what it is. A stepping stone to the next job and potential career. It's not meant to be a life long job."
bad,They do not know how to treat employees fairly. No communication and push until you quit or get fired for not completing the pushed task. Bad Bad Bad .
bad,"Unless you are a Department Manager or above, expect inconsistent hours and an unstable work schedule. I was one of the few fulltime associates and they cut my hours for no reason, claiming that 34 hours is full time. Look somewhere else."
bad,"Management at Walmart is not good at all. The company is not family oriented, they always want you there.When you request time off , you may not get it"
bad,Working here was stressful and overwhelming. There's no way to work here and live without much worry. It's hard to maintain sanity. I would not recommend anyone work here unless they absolutely must.
bad,"I stopped working here when I saw 2 people work until they died. this company will fire people for not coming in when they should be at the doctor. Walmart does not care about the employee as a person so it is no surprise the wages suck,but then again in Walmart what do you expect"
bad,"Not worth working for, with the amount of drama they put you through. People don't understand that is someone else business not their personal business."
bad,"management is horrible, nobody listens to the associates, the would rather listen to the customers lies. nothing is fair. they promote based on race.."
bad,I had a bad experience with Walmart and have no intention of ever working for them or any subsidiary of theirs. They are complete garbage to their employees.
bad,Every one was always wanting to gossip or complane. They never give good hours. They had rules about when you where able to request time off and what hours you can work.
bad,"No, I would not recommend any to Walmart. I would not recommend for some very simple facts: 1 they work part-time up 39 hrs.2 There is no gaining overtime with 39 hrs, being hired part-time."
bad,Never work for Walmart. I respect you if you have to because you are either student or need money. Otherwise it the WORST place to work at. Most managers are idiot. They act like they are in charge of Pentagon.
bad,Management doesn't listen to their employees. They expect too much out of people and talk to you. bad Not  worth the or effort I wasted in 6 years of being there.
bad,"The place sucked to be honest, the management didn't care about the employees they only cared about their own advancement. Anyone working in TLE are basically isolated from everything else to do with Walmart and all the equipment is worn out."
bad,"never had help in any department. had to straighten up. clean, get new and returned products out without help. had to leave assign area to go to another area to zone"
bad,Walmart has a very unique way or treating its employees.The managers would yell at you in front of customers. the managers would pretend they already gave you your break.
bad,Worked night shift for three months never had the same row the stack. Never had the same days off. The one thing I did love about working at Walmart was the people.
bad,This job isn' the best place to work at. I was pretty much thrown to the wolves. The newbies are not treated the best and get yelled at a lot. They don't teach you as well as they should.
bad,"I’m giving Walmart a bad review because you of the management. I didn’t like working for Walmart at all, and they never liked taking doctor excuses when your child be sick."
bad,Walmart is such a dreadful place to work. They are very rude to their associates and will cuss at you their very unprofessional. I don't recommend working at Walmart.
bad,"they do not work with schedule, its always wal mart first, no holiday pay, hard to use PTO even when requesting in advance, low pay with year raise of only 2%."
bad,"Bad hours, bad people, fishy things going on, pay wasn't worth my time. Although I was liked there by the customers, I hated the coworkers. They acted like they were way better."
bad,"Working at Wal-Mart was not an enjoyable experience at all. The anagers and co-workers were rude and not helpful. Being a female in the backroom was impossible. The men were rude and would try to run you off, and talking to management was not an option as they didn't help and would just send you back to work."
bad,"Horrible place to work, just horrible. Very sexist environment, towards their Male employees. If you are a woman here, you get everything you want on a silver platter, but if you are a male, you get treated very hostile and made to feel like you are worthless. The pay was very, very low and you never get any weekends off to spend time with your family. This place sucks."
bad,This job taught me a lot as far as being on time and hard work ethic can take you a long way. it demands a lot of upper body strength to be able to move some of the various heavy items they have there but I would definitely prefer this as a starter for any one.
bad,"I hated going to work on daily basis at Walmart. Associates were rude disrespectful and mean.  I did not like the management at the Wal-Mart in Cordele, GA.  I would never recommend anybody get a job at the Wal-Mart in Cordele, GA no matter how bad they needed a job it sucks."
bad,The managers treat you like poo and except you to take everything laying down and not get mad when your breaks are 30 minutes to an hour late every day and want you to help customers when they don't need help. None of the management has any sympathy or respect for employees.
bad,dead end job that hardly pay bills and very demanding work managers are useless and do nothing to help as a team very little bennys alsono room for advancement
bad,under paid and over work. average raise a year was. .22cents. could badly minding lack of advancement amd maager had very arrogant attitude and treated eployees like Nothing.
bad,"If you are trying to start working is great but you can't stay there, not only customer do not respect you but there's not help fo you or backup or even opportunities to grow."
bad,"Very stressful, not enough coverage or help. Terrible management that simply didn't care. Very fast pace and very demanding. Inconsistent hours, and no overtime allowed."
bad,If you are a hard worker do apply at Walmart. You will never advance. They will keep you in that position until you ultimately quit. Walmart has the highest employee turn over rate for a reason.
bad,"This is a company who thought it be acceptable to take away ALL holiday pay and sick pay from associates as well as punish people for having to take off work for family emergency and health issues, Management does not care whatsoever about anyones job only about achieving their bonuses while associates bonus has been at an all time low. For a billion dollar company to treat associates so badly is unacceptable."
bad,"A typical day at work was pretty stressful and fast paced. What I learned at Walmart was to be very patient with customers. The management was pretty terrible and hard to work around, although I did like some of the managers and they were really fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was trying to deal with angry customers, (that's never fun to deal with). But at the end of the day the customers become happy. The most enjoyable part o the job was the physical activity. I had to push carts almost all day so that was pretty fun and challenging."
bad,"nothing nice to say about Walmart "
bad,"good job for students, but not much else to be quite honest. very difficult to acquire decent wages based on skill or merit. Not much room for advancement"
bad,Really did not work like working for this place terrible management terrible place to business would not suggest anybody to work here really bad one of the worst I've ever seen
bad,"I dedicated 10 years to this company and was completely let down by the company and people I worked for.  They lie, they have questionable integrity and they do not care about their managers.  I lost all faith in them."
bad,Typical retail ...long hours.....demanding...low pay.....many hours.....theft...employee issues.......pulblic demanding.....long hours....stressful....
bad,Through the yrs working for Wal-Mart I have come across many challenges working for them. My favorite position was Over Night Stocker. But other positions I did not like so well.
bad,They have few they like on as personal as much a professional level they ask you do thinks outside job description they always gossip only if your not in with their cluck
bad,"Ooltewah Walmart has horrible management, not a single seasonal item was out on the floor when it was supposed to be. The shoe department was the most ridiculous thing in retail I have ever seen. The store manager was nice, but all assistant managers were incompetent and didn't have a clue what they were doing."
bad,"horrible work environment , horrible management staff does not work well with your schedule excellent  co-workers horrible store manager excellent department managers"
bad,if you wanna work in a place that doesnt care about people with disabilities go right ahead there terrible and mean nobody cares how you feel and if you mess up there expectations are extremely high they make it so your bound to fail i wouldnt wish working  here on anyone its an utter waste of time and its an absolutely horrible work environment for anyone with disabilities or anything of the sort your better off working from home and doing business there
bad,Not a family or people place. They care to much about money and not about their own staff. Will not recommend this a family place. Not happy while I was working there to much given and the job duties were not shares with other workers in the store. Unfair to their unemployees.
bad,"management doesn't care unless you're a brown noser which is also the only way to get promoted. the pay isn't fair, associates are treated badly and unfairly."
bad,"Worst Company I Ever Worked For. The Management Is Sorry They Treat Employees Like Dogs, Don't Expect Respect, They Are Just A Cruel Company and Its So Sad."
bad,I dreaded going to work for this company. They treated me like I was just another worker and not a person. Management was really evil and did not care about there workers.
bad,Advancing in this job is not likely unless you know someone. They do not work with you if you have an emergency or something else. They do not have set schedules. They do not care about anything. They do not have enough people to help
bad,"At Walmart, some of the managers in which I had many. Played favorites. I was a very hard worker for this company. I did my job to the best of my ability."
bad,"Where to start? I was forced to work on Thanksgiving with no extra pay, they constantly we're battling me about my school schedule at the time, they refused to give anyone raises, management would scream and yell at the employees in public and humiliate them at every opportunity. The management was constantly attempting to steal money out of my check, I was labeled as part time, yet I was working so much that I was not able to have any kind of life outside of work, I had to work extremely irregular hours. Save yourself the trouble, and don't work here if you can help it. I could write a book about what is wrong with this company. They need to be ran out of the country."
bad,i will never work for them again. they were inconsistent. did not hire with in the company. they were messy. my previous managers were horrid to all their employees
bad,"Walmart is not a good place to work if you are in school or have kids or anything that makes you not able to work at any time, they will give you one day a week if you cant open up you availability. The Walmart managers are not very friendly either, They do not care what you have going on they will fire you even if its a life or death situation. Walmart does not except doctors excuses either so i sure you you do not get sick, Walmart is just a horrible place to work for."
bad,I was paid 9$ an hour even with experience. The hours were honestly not great. breaks sucked. They weren't very understanding of real life situations. I asked for specific hours when I applied and they disregarded that completely.
bad,Walmart is a terrible company to work for. They only care about themselves and not the employees. On a very unfair point system that doesn't accept doctors notes.
bad,Walmart always do they employees dirty. They give you good hours sometimes but it depends on if your on their good side . With these jobs you just have to be careful
bad,"terrible place to work keep you under the amount of hours needed to be eligible for benefits, I would not go back to Walmart as benefits are a bonus to having employment.,"
bad,"A typical day would start with unattainable demands from management that was put directly on me to fix or work through. And my crew was consistently pulled off our duties to cover other departments short comings."
bad,Management and supervisors did not care about their employees. The environment was chaos of how management handled their business. Also management is not family oriented.
bad,Simply from my experience I wouldn't advise anyone to work for Walmart. I learned quite a bit but not because I had a choice it was something I was told to do. Associates were nice enough but management is VERY POOR.
bad,Can get you ready for something better. Gained the knowledge of working in retail. Learning how to adjust and be opened minded on situations. Interacted with customers and merchandisers daily.
bad,You were never guaranteed any amount of hours.  I had to resort to getting help for living expenses and food!   I would never recommend any one to work for this company
bad,i unloaded trucks and stocked shelfs it was a pretty basic job and to slow. i clocked in than looked up my tast for the day than went straight to work
bad,Go in be unappreciated . Get yelled at no matter what you do. Feel hated. Get stressed out .Want to quit but cant afford to. having C.S.M.'s that are the rudest people on the planet.
bad,"I only gave this job 2 weeks. After working 3 night shifts I learned that turn over is so high that they don't train or manage like they want to keep their employees. Come into work with the isles full of pallets stacked high with boxes full of merchandise needing to be sorted and put away. After 3days I am having issues bending my knees and so much pain in my hands and finger tips from opening box after box. The associates are nice, that's been the good part but that's about it. Here go do this and out this here bit with no real direction or explanation."
bad,"There wasn't really anything good or bad, just a simple retail job. Some people who work for the company took the job too hard to the point where they were hateful to others but that may have been just the specific store."
bad,"I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy as a place for employment. The management lies pretty consistently to their employees about coverage, especially during the holidays, the scheduling follows no rhyme or reason at all, and the work environment is not friendly at all."
bad,"I would start each day clocking in, then going to the area I had been assigned, Hardware, here I was left alone with no real training and it is my first real job didn't really know what to do or who to go to if I had an issue or problem. I stayed at this job as long as I did for the money and nothing more."
bad,there rude and mean. No fun to work for if your not in there click. Most of the bosses treat you like trash. They over charge you if there made at you. And if you have kids they will not let you off if the school calls and you need to go get them.!
bad,wouldn't work around my college hours. everyone there thought they where better then you or they just wouldn't work at all there was no team atmosphere.
bad,"no intregrity"
bad,"Until I was forced to be pushed into either cleaning crew or deli, unfortunately it seemed a bit insulting to be put into either when they had very little people to actually manage their backroom, from what I heard after I left, the backroom got into chaos."
bad,"Micromanagement out the wazoo. It's a mess, no one knows where to go or what to do. I did not like it, it was hard to find a secure sense of direction."
bad,This is a hard place to work and the employees that work there just seem to be so depressed and hate their jobs. Management needs to help improve things go to corporate and so them what it is like around here.
bad,"The pay was great , the management was just poor and it was very fast paced. When I tried to talk and upper hand it seemed like nothing changed. So I decided to leave."
bad,Walmart does nit take care of any issues. Walmart has poor managers that do not know how to treat associates. Most of the associates are good. Management is the problem
bad,Would never work here again. You aren't appreciated and are often belittled and berated by your managers. You can put in for time off but most likely won't get it.
bad,Walmart was a horrible place to work. I was afraid of losing my job on any given day due to the mood of the manager working at the time. I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,this is a horrible place to work for. there no holiday pay. you have to work every holiday. you have to do jobs outside of your job to cover management. Vacation times are denied even if you put them in ahead of time.
bad,Hated working for this co. Their management was the worst I have ever experienced ever in all my years of job experience in my opinion.   They had no regard for people  but that's corporate business for you now days.  Sad very sad.
bad,This company is an absolute joke.  All they care about is turning a profit. And could care less and treat their employees as less in the store environment. It is their way or the highway. The managers are long term employees that are uneducated and unskilled and this is a formula for castrophe. When it's all said and done this company will likened to giant falling on its face. I am just waiting for it to happen and it won't be long now.
bad,I hate Wal-Mart with a passion. They have horrible store managers that take their new achieved power of success to their overly confident supervisors .
bad,I feel as if I'm bullied a lot by a lot of the associates and management. Most of the associates aren't friendly. There's a lot of favoritism. Most people who work here complain about management.
bad,The immediate supervision was very disrespectful and showed a huge amount of favoritism towards other employees. It is 2017 and I simply couldn't believe the level in which this fact was displayed on a nightly basis
bad,"I highly regret being employed at Walmart. I was sick to my stomach daily, other employees got away with listening to music on the job while I was not able to."
bad,they make everything seem cool till the district managers come. Everybody is running around like a chicken with their head cut off and nobody has an answer for anything.. you beter off asking another associate for help because the managers are never anywhere to be found and they dont answer their walkies... worse 3 years of my life
bad,"Walmart is very unfair and shows a tremendous amount of favoritism.  Regardless of your attendance and write ups, if management don't like you or does not approve of you then they will terminate your employment."
bad,"MCDONALDS HAS A BETTER WORK ENVIRONMENT.......Walmart is no longer a friendly place to work......, You have to deal with various BAD ATTITUDES from Higher level Management, no one has your ""back"", and you are literally thrown to the wolves......."
bad,The management had no idea what they were talking about half the time and they never did there job. Everyone stood around talking and not doing there job and being unprofessional.
bad,Not being able to work my way to being a Floor associate in the department that i would want to be in.My sister use to be a a store wide type manager in the grand rapids area.
bad,hated working here if you're a hard worker stay away from this place because all tasks will be placed onto you will favorites just lounge around dont do it
bad,Worst possible company to ever work for. they treat everyone equally like garbage and pay you the same! Do not work here if you actually want to make a living
bad,"I got this job right out of high school stuck it out for over 4 years. If your lucky you made 7.75 an hour, with maybe a 30 cent raise per year. You are constantly verbally abused by customers and treated like we didn't matter. The management was always changing and never available for assistance, horrible working conditions."
bad,Great people fast paced constantly moving. Good way to learn. And grow everyone seem to pull there weight to help u suceed it was honestly an experience I enjoyed
bad,Walmart was an okay company as opposed to the lack of growth within their company. The managers weren't supportive of the general employees. The didn't want you to advance within the company.
bad,If you are anti-union company it is for you. But it is OK job. I work as a courtesy clerk help customers with groceries and packages. Help angry customers with solving a problem with a good solution.
bad,Sorry wages but flexible with hours if in school. The only way I would make Wal-Mart a career would be if I would become a Manager of sorts. It is not a fair place to work for some people get paid more and they do less then others that work harder.
bad,"management was very poor. too much was expected,moral was extremely poor,time expected between jobs was insufficient, manager was useless and unhelpful, not enough hours to make sufficient pay,"
bad,"They start you out at $9 an hour and after 90 days, they give you an extra dollar which I guess is a bonus but I can't afford to work for 90 days on that low of a salary."
bad,Wal-Mart was one of the worst stores I have ever worked for. I performed my job to the best of my abilities and yet I got punished for something that wasn't my fault.
bad,"Ok job if you want to learn the bare minimum about cars to get you by. You will hate going into work every day, management's a joke there's little to no training, pay is terrible, policies are laughable and ludicrous. None of your superiors will have any idea about anything you do and you will be left out of all important Information about changes happening in the store... overall worst place I've ever worked."
bad,"Walmart was a horrible place to work i worked there consistently for 2 years i did alot there to everything like front end cashier during the day, overnight frozen dairy and deli, also cap 2 (truck unloader) and Tire lube center, the management is so ""Crooked"" its a game of who knows who as for promotions and job safety, safety policys and regulations are blatantly disregarded, the fresh food is out of the safe zone primarily most of the time"
bad,"You will be lucky IG you get a ten cent wage per year. People who just get hired make more than employees who have been there for years due to starting wage increases. Good for students, not good for full time employment. Managers suck"
bad,they treat you inhuman like and don't know what they are doing themselves. they talk about you to other managers and talk bad to you infant of costumers.
bad,"Raises are 2% of gross pay once a year.  Your first 6 months you are allowed 4 occurrences, being late is .5, clocking in too early is .5, too late is .5, no call-no show is 3.  Being sick and having doctor's excuse is worthless.  If you call in that you'll be out, that's 1 occurrence.  Lost very many new associates because of this.  Morale is VERY low.  I cannot think of anything good about working here other than the friendships you make.  You have to complete CBLs (computer based learning) every day.  You're never know from day to say what you'll have to do."
bad,"When working you are always rushed and never get a good job or well done just you didn't work fast enough. Management was never helpful either when you ask for help they say it is about team work, but it isn't."
bad,Just don't work here.  I guess if you like to be mean to people and get paid poorly for it by all means join the management team but there are infinitely better opportunities out there.
bad,bad work environment. doesnt have a clue on how to do anything right. overstock out of control. inventory system totally screwed. overhead 2000% of store ordering system borked.
bad,"I had never been more embarrassed or treated like dirt in all my life. Management was terrible, company is about that bottom dollar and doesn't care about its employees."
bad,"Horrible place to work. Doesn’t pay enough, horrible hours, management isn’t incompetent and have no idea how much work to assign people. Overall is horrible."
bad,Other than your fellow associates and a few managers Wal-mart is the worst place on the earth to work. Dont do it unless your desperate I mean you could do better cleaning porter potties
bad,Management needs to be fair with employees and company work place should accommodate employees that are very hard working. Workload is always there some days would be very busy than others.
bad,Horrible work environment managment doesnt do their jobs constantly hectic they dont treat their emplyees well horrible pay way to stressfulway to much for to little pay
bad,I don't remember much about this job.  They wanted me to work and do things I wasn't supposed to.  I was told what I needed to do and how to do my job because everyone thought they were better than me.
bad,"Walmart is a place that starts out paying you well. It is a nice job to have, but it is very stress inducing. It also takes a lot of patience. This company is flexible with hours, they also pay well. But there are some things that happen at some stores not all that make the job unbearable."
bad,"Walmart is a great place to shop, but for employment it is a high stress environment. The employees were great to work with but the customers that came in were very difficult to work with."
bad,"The physical work of unloading trucks was fun. Staying in the stock room, playing a radio and working. That is all that I liked at Walmart. The managers were all cut throat and intimidated by anyone with a strong work ethic."
bad,lack of management and consistency. no leadership. favorites get promoted. has people work off the clock for no additional. will work you all day everyday odd schedules with no overtime will just ct off at 40
bad,"DC 6080 is a horrible place to work! Most people  are cut throat there. The management has no idea nor training so they’re pretty much just there for a pay check. If you’re sick and call out you get a 10 hour coaching which builds up to a step and after 4 steps you’re fired. The benefits are horrendous, if you need to use your medical benefits you’ll be in the poor house because not much is covered and I had the beter of the 3 that was offered. The work environment is dangerous and now they’re taking lunch breaks away. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this place."
bad,It’s was a nice Job to have a Walmart it was not a far distance to go the benefits where pretty good the management was fine the people are the bestpart
bad,Walmart doesn't care about their employees or their families when they're sick. Managers will not speak to you.. Walmart management is very dysfunctional. Walmart doesn't give you the proper training and will hold you accountable for it. Walmart doesn't back their employees up against irate customers. The managers take a very long time assisting you when you call for help. Walmart believes the customers when they lie on employees just to get a gift card.
bad,"Some days I didn't get a lunch or a break. I had a 45 minute drive to and from work. And I always had to work 2nd shift which didn't leave room for a family life,"
bad,"The rules change so much and become more and more confusing."
bad,"A typical day at work lasted longer than the hours scheduled.  The pay was minimal and the workload was always overwhelming.  The workplace culture was depressing, not a place I would recommend to work."
bad,easy work but the coworkers and management was not the very best to get along with plus the customers had very bad attitudes. not very clean or organized.
bad,"Pay is terrible. There is no consistency with the days you're scheduled to work. Lower level Management  Team Members are having to meet un-measurable demands."
bad,this place was terrible management hard to talk to. takes forever to get full time always messing up your schedule. all they do is walk around. management always expect the impossible
bad,"I hated working at Wal-Mart.  I pray that they either start treating their employees like human beings, or that people stop going there. It's disgusting!"
bad,Poor leadership from the GM to floor manager they have no faith in the people who their butts off and they praise the lazy ones who don’t do the job correctly
bad,"fast paced work environment , assisting customers , no down time , always moving , management is not good some of the managers are nice and sweet but overall not"
bad,"manger up here is terrible, they will definitely put u too work . they expect u to know the whole  store . but they don't  dont kno. they dont nothing but put theyre work load on u. even if u doing something. always short staff so they will put u into different area"
bad,Always busy and unorganized managers were hard to find i wasn't properly trained on how to do everything on the register and they're were never enough people working so lines would rap around the isles
bad,I hated it. Managers didn't listen. Some managers had favorite employees so they always got what they wanted as far a work hours are concerned. If you weren't like you got the short end of the stick. .
bad,"need better management"
bad,Wal-Mart is a good company to work for. I enjoy the associates at 5851. It's your upper management that makes it so bad. Work wasn't hard as long you do give your all.
bad,"I received no benefits except for a discount card and stock options as a part-time worker. When I was pregnant, management didn't pass the word on that I was pregnant with horrible morning sickness, therefore, one day, when I was experience a bout of morning sickness and wanted to run to the restroom, a manager followed me into the bathroom, told me that they were not playing games with me, and I was told to go back to work, even though another manager had approved me to do a different task that didn't require me to interact with customers so that I didn't have to worry about being ill in front of customers."
bad,"I worked at two Walmarts between two states and in several positions (Cart collector, Sporting goods, hardware, domestics, toys, pets, freight, overnight stocking) and the same issues occur between both. Management with limited or no prior retail experience and even less people management skills. Understaffed sections lead to strain with customers, even outright confrontation in some scenarios. No sick pay, vacation pay, or maternity leave (had a child during my time there and time taken off counted against my allowed call-ins for the year). You're almost guaranteed to start at minimum wage unless you work in the deli or electronics. Annual raises are a joke. They claim you can earn up to an extra dollar an hour if you've acquired skills to work in more parts of the store (mixing paint in hardware, making keys in Tire and Lube, etc) but they often fail to recognize these skills and will not allow you to negotiate when time comes for your annual review, so raises tend to be in the 30-40 cents an hour range. Last i heard since I stopped working there, they have even removed the extra dollar an hour you could make by working graveyard. "
bad,Management at this job is a living nightmare. For them to have so many levels of management you would expect them to coordinate and be on the same page but every manager wants to do things differently and it all results in serious issues for the bottom employees. Would not recommend personally unless the Walmart you are applying to has a good reputation around it but none of the ones around here did I and I ignored it.
bad,"used forklift to move fright ,stock or other material to and from storage or production areas I work in the warehouse  Packed and unpacked items to be stock on the shelves in the stockroom"
bad,"Management at the particular store at which I was employed, had unreasonable expectations of their employees and uncooperative with the employees.  Management had unrealistic time restraints."
bad,"I was the Customer Service Manager . I loaded self check out machines, made employee schedules. Did audits on each cashier, unloaded truck deliveries and stalks shelves."
bad,Walmart does not care about the employees. Everything has to be done as of 5 minutes ago but they love to dictate and not offer any help or pay. Nothing you do is correct and they talk down to you.
bad,"Working for this company is all of the things you hated about high school. Your low level suporvisors might care about their employees, any other link in the chain of command could not care any less about their associates. Favoritism. Childish drama. Rule bending. Not following their own policies. Trash place to work."
bad,Walmart will give you very little to no support when moving to a new position in the company. They also will not listen to you when something happens that you did not do and will let you go even if they do believe or know that you are a hard worker.
bad,"Supervisors would work us passed our lunches and would shorten our lunch breaks or even cut out our paid breaks. Wouldnt be allowed to complete on-computer assessments for pay increase. Directions were given with a very rude, sarcastic tone. Myself, along with fellow coworkers were always threatened with termination at the end of EVERY LIST OF OBJECTIONS for the day."
bad,"It's retail, some days are crazy and hectic, and others go by slow. You will be required to work over time, then go home early to kill it later. This is not the job for you. I have heard McDonalds is hiring down the street. Try there first."
bad,"over worked, underpaid, unreal expectations of employees. management does not take care of their employees. the good ones get pushed out the door, while the associates who stand around and talk all day are not dealt with in any way."
bad,Horrible management. Good work force great employees but some management don't like to intervene to help in certain situations. Clean store no complaints just horrible management amazing benefits and quick promotions
bad,A typical day at work was very fast pasted and busy. The management was alright. Nothing about the job was hard. Nothing was enjoyable either except getting to go home.
bad,Management didn't know how to motivate employees. Their idea of motivation were to make threats to have them fired. Can't speak for all stores only the store I was a part of. my job was easy and a pretty good fit for my personality because I am easy going and enjoying meeting and helping people. So it was not a problem to help a customer. Plus my management and marketing skills help me give sound advice to customers who wanted to know more about a product when know one else would seem to ant to me bothered. I made sure to learn as much as possible about the products Walmart sold and where things were just so I could make it easier for a customer.
bad,this job was very busy and you were expected to scan a lot of items per minute.  Management was not very understanding.  overall the experience was satisfactory.
bad,"full of miserable gossipers and careless management, irrational customers and greedy selfish corporate members.   "
bad,"It is a good job. However, if you have a family, it is retail so you will work according to customer demand. If you would like to move up and have a career it is very cut throat. Who you know will get you promoted and not the work you do. If they do not like you, then expect not to move up."
bad,"The training was inconsistent and confusing.  Management was inexperienced and very poor.  I learned a lot but it was not a good employment place, people working there are stressed and as a result are not willing to form friendships and everyone is looking over their shoulder and expecting the worst of everyone else."
bad,you are just a number with no value. They have no care for you as an employee. you are dirty under the manager finger nails.Always setting up for failure
bad,"treat their workers poorly, severely under paid. you are not recognised for the work you do and there is very little room for growth within the company"
bad,"Walmart is a very demanding company to work for.  Expectations are very high and unrealistic with the resources that you have. It is never a good time to leave, always working long hours without being fairly compensated for it."
bad,Not a good place to work. often understaffed. You will find yourself doing the work of 2 or 3 people because they are always understaffed. Managers do not help at all. Usually they sit in the office all night or they are outside smoking or on the phone.
bad,i worked here and the environment was very stressful. they had one cake decorator me for a two person job! you have the whole cooler that has to be filled and your responsible for. you have orders and if they get screwed up your the one to get wrote up. the managers watch your every move and if you dont have 30 days worth of products you’ve made in the freezer they are at your feet. they look down on you like your nothing. goodluck!
bad,Disorganized with staffing which lead to shorter hours and poor management. I don’t enjoy working there at times. Most people are rude and are not hard workers. Staffing process is poor and taking under appreciated.
bad,"There were good and bad days but it seems that nobody is on the same page. Too many managers making changes that you will never satisfy their expectations.  They will schedule you as a full time but be a part time on the payroll, therefore, there are no medical benefits."
bad,mangers or horrible. it was a good experience  i would not recommend working at Walmart its un organized mangers do not treat you with respect. working at Walmart you will not be apart of a hard working team.
bad,the store manager and the market are the ones who need to get FIRED they DO NOT know how to talk to people. they think of their associates as slaves. they have no respect for the individual. instead of bringing people up and saying positive things they are always putting the associate down and speaking to them not like a human but something less than that.
bad,"Walmart is stressful because there no teamwork, or enough people to do the work. And they  don't care about your family. But overall the department managers do stick together to help each other, because that all you have to depend on until you learn the job yourself."
bad,"not a place to work if you care about being treated fairly, compensated fairly, or if you care about doing a great job. the management is rude and insulting, and not afraid to ""joke"" about their employees in front of them offensively. constant overbearing workloads expected to be finished in far too short a time, (such as being expected to finish stocking 10 pallets of merchandise in half a work day oftentimes.)"
bad,"No Good.  Management and policies were unrealistic and unfair. Job advancement was based on who you knew not what you knew.  Unfortunately, I do not recommend."
bad,slow place to work the people are hard to get along with .I liked working there tho meeting new people all the time.alot of the food was free at times
bad,Bad job if you want to work hard . and put a lot of stress of yourself this job is very tedious and stressful this job is pretty bad and should pay you more.
bad,"This job at walmart was just a temp job, the pay was okay for all the work that I had to do. I probably would not recommend this job for anyone. It was some long hours and standing"
bad,"come in have a meeting do work, didnt learn anything, management has favorites, hardest part of job was getting managers to do what u need, the most enjoyable part was going home"
bad,It was a horrible experience I worked hard and received zero gratitude  while others did nothing and were loved.The managers were incompetent just a bad place to work .
bad,Walmart has the highest turnover rate. They are an extremely shady company with shady policies. Will frame you for a shortage without any proof and fire you without any notice. Managers think they are gods walking the earth.
bad,"The pay suvks, the people are grochy all the time. The hours are okay depends on what you work. I hated working for the company. It isn't worth it at all."
bad,I disliked working for this company.
bad,"It was my first job, so I was young and didn't know any better, but found out quick that Wal-Mart was not the best place to work at. The management played favorites with the staff. Gave terrible hours, and would hardly ever accommodate whenever you needed a day off."
bad,"Its a horrible place to work. Don't do it!! They take from the employees; time off, money, sick pay, incentives everything. You are a number to them and nothing more."
bad,"walmart is the worst company i have ever worked for they do not give you your allotted breaks or lunches, they do not give you paid time off and it is like pulling teeth to get any days off period especially holidays"
bad,Management sucks. Customers suck. Coworkers suck. I hurt my back doing heavy lifting here and not only they didn't provide me with a back brace but they kept me doing the same heavy lifting that got me hurt in the first place. If you ever think about getting a job at walmart you HAVE to be desperate.
bad,I did not like job. The staff was cool but the managers did not really have good attitudes about the employees. the did not care if you were not getting hours at all.
bad,This is a good job for a collage kid or someone looking for summer work. Their schedules are not flexible even when it comes to family emergencies. I had gas stolen out of my car and got written up for it.
bad,"local management do not care about any of their staff and seem to believe a high turn over is a good business plan rather than take care of their existing personnel, I saw associates who were almost to retirement terminated for in some cases seemingly made up charges weeks or a month before being able to retire, or things like leave or things like that falling through the cracks of ""Oh yeah i forgot about that"" so as to get rid of them"
bad,"Supervise front end cashiers, customer service and door greeters.  Learned to multi task managing employees handling customer concerns, workplace culture based on if you had a personal relationship with management."
bad,"No way, because of the sadistic unlawful unfair nature of the beast towards persons of disabilities and in general will not be discussed - unethical !"
bad,"Handled cash, checks, and credit cards for payment. Answer phone calls and directed them to the appropriate individuals. 	Verified open purchase order status and Expedited purchase order line items."
bad,"unfortunately my time working with Walmart was one of the most stressful jobs I've had. with the poor management i had to perform duties i wasnt even hired for, plus the lack of understanding and leader skills caused me to become stressed."
bad,Walmart has too many managers and not enough employees . They work you to the bone and expect everything to be done in a timely mannor.No one cares about anything. you tell management about an issue and that's it .. Nothing gets done about it
bad,Walmart is not a place I recommend to work at. There is lack of help from the managers. They don't give you enough hours. They also don't take doctors notes.
bad,The work environment was not conducive to fostering a positive relationship between managers and employees.  Pay raises were limited and did not meet the need of the growing economy and inflation.
bad,"Being disabled, it was always fun at Walmart, with customers taking off in your wheelchair while you are working at the cash register, to being fired for not zoning my department.  The manager inspected it 11 hours after I zoned it/"
bad,"Unhealthy, Non-supportive environment, your not support or provided with the tools you need to profrom your job as needed. The working hours are terrrible, always expected to come in on the rare occasion you get time off."
bad,"There was never a typical day where I would go into work and worked just on my task. Working for Walmart was overwhelming, managers never knew what was going on, very unprofessional. The hardest part of the job was working in a department without associates, so it was hard to get my duties done. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people."
bad,"The typical day at Walmart was full of stress, deadlines, terrible management, and a complete lack of leadership. Heaven forbid you do anything wrong.. Even if you were not trained properly. Good luck with proper pay or advancement opportunities here. Also, don't expect to be put into the position that you were trained for or know anything about because one minute you'll think everything is okay, and the next you're stuck in the meat department."
bad,"typical day was slow, learned how to interact with customers, hardest thing is standing on my feet all day in the same place, I love how sweet the customer were"
bad,Was not fun at all. Did not enjoy the environment what so ever. People were rude. Holiday season was the worst i had ever experienced in my life. Never again.
bad,Stressful enviroment with next to no support from management team. Issues with the training program. No time to participate in it as management continues to work you and give you no time to work on the training program.
bad,corprate continued to take away tools needed to perform job and expected the same quality of work to be provided. people that left for other jobs or were fired were never replaced added additional stress to the team that was short staffed to begin with
bad,"customer service"
bad,"not for me the management was rude and i had to swallow alot of stress they even got me to the point of crying "
bad,In a day of my work at walmart I would be greeted with a screaming manager who would yell at the entire staff and I also did not get payment for the work I had done
bad,The days are long and the pay is low. Lots of standing which lead to lower back and foot pain. Management is terrible. Customers are terrible. Overall not a good place to work.
bad,Just clock in the day and start unloading the truck until we get all the items out of the truck. Then we put all the items to its right place where it needs to be and un pack it and put it on its self
bad,The logistics side of the company is awesome to work for. The retail side is good as a second job or for someone in high school not as a means to support a family.
bad,This company is more concerned about making sure its shareholders are taken care of and not employees. No manager I worked for really cared about their employees.
bad,Wal Mart want to be the low price leader and enslave whom ever is willing to do this. They talk about offering great customer service but won't have enough help on the shift
bad,"Boa empresa"
bad,You are standing for hours without breaks. The hours are miserable for the pay you receive. I just worked here while going through college. I would not work here today.
bad,"Wal-mart wasn't a good experience for me. No matter how hard you worked, management always found something to complain about. It was hard to get everything done in the eight hour shifts they gave you. And they are constantly short staffed."
bad,The hardest part of the job was dealing with incompetent managers and team members. No one new how to do their job and everyone struggled with their tasks.
bad,i wish i had never worked here. and would never recommend for anyone to apply at Walmart inc. they do not care about their employees. only about their money.
bad,Worse place to work every. I would never recommend someone to work their. The managers have no idea what they are doing. They will tell you to do one thing a specific way and then change it up on you.
bad,"it was so long ago hard to remember. The one thing i remember well was I was in a department I had no knowledge of and requested  to be moved. that never happened,while others were hired on and placed in departments I was very knowledgeable in, so this was frustrating to me, because I was not able to serve my customers with the best care due to that."
bad,"this is a horrible place to work for, you have to work the hours given. management is cut throat, i would not recommend this job to anyone. do not work here."
bad,"Its a very stressful day since start working the schedule. The CSM are not helpful."
bad,"You are a slave. And if your unlucky and get hired full time ; your hours can start at 4 am!"
bad,At the time I worked at Walmart the  employees were treated unfairly. The management team had a lot of favoritism. They would pick certain employees to move up to management positions.
bad,"It was an OKAY job. Management team was not okay. Nobody did their job properly. everybody had bad attitudes. Co workers weren't very friendly, everybody was rude and nasty."
bad,Poor management. Low pay. Everybody is worried about cut throats. Management only cares about the bottom dollar....I was treated like a slAve with no appreciation.
bad,"The work environment, management, and overall experience was extremely poor. The work hours were scarce for some and highly demanding for others. Management was inconsiderate to those with health problems, or disabilities, demanded more work from already overworked employees while others did little to no work."
bad,They are a horrible employer that promises you the world but try collecting some of it.  I never got to use my sick time  or vacation.  They don't want you to  use restroom more than 3 times in 9 hours.
bad,Managment had favorites and if you weren't one you had your days numbered and were treated with total disrespect. you were made to work several jobs around the store due to lack of workers. They want you to have a completely open schedule but with this means you could close one night at 11:30 pm and open at 5:30 am with total disregard for employees personal time and without eight hours between shifts.
bad,"as i worked this job i have witnessed, the taking back of used syringes, the beradment of employees. blackmail done by personnel, unlawful off the clock work was common and in fact forced. I was exposed to bodily fluids all of which have been thrown at me and i was told my job meant nothing by management and if i were to report this i would be terminated. I have repeatedly filed with the department of licensing and labor as well as DEHEC about the conditions in which nothing has changed in 5 years."
bad,Job was easy but no matter what you did it wasn't enough. It was steady and department managers had a set schedule but never enough staff to help get tasks done.
bad,"I was injured while on the clock and was treated as though I hurt myself on purpose, I was pregnant at the time as well. My managers showed me no compassion what so ever and we're extremely rude and judgemental."
bad,"a typical days included working from 3 to mid night"
bad,Walmart is in need of new manegment as well as store managers because they don’t not have compassion for their employees and do not work with them when it comes to giving them hours as well as how they cut your hours and yell you to open up your availability in order to receive more work hours.
bad,"I would never recommend someone to working at Walmart.  They care nothing about their associates, they only care that the job gets done no matter how."
bad,I only worked there for about 7 months and hated going in every day. Really would not recommend anyone work there unless they absolutely need the money.
bad,"working for Walmart can be very exciting, but can be very stressful . especially in management around the holidays. it can be very rewarding in the end."
bad,"I had a horrible experience working at Walmart. I found out the day of my interview that I was pregnant, I was upfront about that fact to my interviewer. I told HR immediately upon being hired and even had a doctors note (two different times) state my restrictions. Even with all that being done, my managers on several occasions had me doing work that I needed assistance with (team lift, weight restriction) and required my ladder training, and without help, had me carrying boxes (full) up said ladders and stairs to put up into overstock. When I bought all of this to their attention, they say I had to take it up with the manager in charge. I did and nothing could or would be done. I immediately resigned. I would never work there again."
bad,"difficult to work when you do not trust your supervisor, sending you to multiple locations to cover at the same time.  Low pay and no advancement and no benefits"
bad,"It's not about hard work; it's all about who you know. They do no hire from within; they hire there friends from other Walmart stores. Some managers do nothing but watch cameras and play games on there phones.  If they do not like you, you are a target and they will get rid of you."
bad,Everyone at Walmart might as well be joining a cult full of idiots because they do not treat anyone fairly nor do they care about work place disputes or issues.
bad,there was not one single thing i liked about my time with wal mart.  The pay and hours were poor and there was not any communication between management.
bad,They dont care about you. They give you crazy hours and try to push you to the limit. They will give you an impossible job and get mad when you cant complete it.
bad,"I liked what I did, did not appreciate getting yelled at all the time and not being appreciated. It is fast pace which didn't bother me. I was not being allowed to take vacation even though every one else was being approved."
bad,"Overnight manager was a dictator until he was fired. They boost morale to get you to perform and then LIE about a so called bonus, yet to find out the managers received bonuses but not employees."
bad,"From the day I started, the horrible manager came and yelled at my crew daily. The work was never done on time,never done to their satisfaction. They didnt care that we worked our fingers to the bone. They kept us late some nights, and then made us cut those hours later in the week, leaving the department understaffed. This happened every week. Management was a joke."
bad,very fast paced work environment. very hectic and very demanding with very little pay your job is to give great customer service while also filling out empty spaces with products
bad,Very poor management and bullying in some locations allowed. Open communication provokes retaliation and hostile work environment.  Great lack of respect in many locations by poorly qualified management
bad,"I haven't worked there since the beginning of 2016, but when I left the company was in the process of taking away associate benefits and replacing associates (accounting specifically) with machines. The management team I had the unfortunate experience of working with was terrible and cared nothing for the customers or the associates, only money."
bad,When I started I loved my job. Over the past few months my husbands health has been bad and I'm less than a year in. An allergic reaction for me got me to my 9 days. Was first told the SM could work with me. The answer to that was changed twice. By he third convorsation I felt I wouldn't have a job when I came back to work in two days. I work very hard and helped several stores get ready for inventory. Sad that I didn't feel safe in having a job and decided to quit because that at least saved me on future resumes. To be honest I feel that was my best outcome and am happy to have left such a stressful situation.
bad,"Do not work here, its basically modern day slave work. it is not a good place to work unless you're a college student that really want a job. The managers and customers are rude and no one care about the employees, just about getting the work done."
bad,This is a company that works on  a buddy team if your not part of that buddy team your not treated equal everyone talks negative about others and people are Treated unfair
bad,"CSM's Cannot get along with each other, and treat employees poorly.  Too Much drama makes a bad work environment. Stress from customers is one thing, but from coworkers and management... NO WAY! They don't allow you any family time on the weekends. Hours are not consistent. They have you close one night, leaving close to 1am and turn around and have you open at 6am the next day.  They don't have it together at all."
bad,The management sucks and have very little respect for employees. No flexibility. I wouldnt recommend getting sick because you'll get fired. The working is a lot for the pay
bad,night shift is short staffed and over worked management tends to be poorly attentive to their employees and there is much favoritism in the workplace.
bad,"Asked to do to much, wouldn't allow employees to work the 2 extra hours for benefits.  They just weren't personlble and you can tell that you were just a number"
bad,"In The Vision Center did not get the proper training needed to feel like I was doing things right. It was not "
bad,I was working overnight its wasn't bad nobody bothering me when I'm working. The overnight manager she good leader and also zone manager. They're helpful to employee.
bad,Walmart has terrible management.  I was let go at no fault of mine.  A fellow coworker lied to the manager saying that I did not help her when I had. Then my unemployment was denied over more lies from management.
bad,"Bad management, no oversight, no teambuilding. The Marble Falls branch of Walmart should be absolutely avoided at all costs. Do yourself a favor and only work here if you are desperate."
bad,"Store Poor Management is to, its favoritism towards associates and managers about the unfair behavior that’s not work related and based on work issues.."
bad,They will use you up then blend something on you and see you out the door. They don't care about the people working for them in fact they use them to get money. Low pay to trap you into buying there products with your discount.smh
bad,"Wal Mart is exactly what you think. A first job for many, especially those without any true responsibility in life just yet. The managers are usually absent from the floor and they run their employees into the ground. The average employee (basic level associate) has more fun joking around with each other on breaks than the company can every provide."
bad,"This is the worst job I have ever had. (And I've had some pretty bad ones.) Management treats everyone like children, management consistently lies to the employees for their own gain, and management NEVER follows through with what they implement."
bad,Management lacked in communication. They never knew what was going on . One manager would say one thing and do the opposite. They had their favorites.
bad,The typical day was stocking shelves from 1030 pm to 700 am.  This was no easy task if you moved slow and had no help. The department I was in charge of was one of the biggest in the store. Paper products. If you can move fast the job would be perfect.
bad,"I had to go through Pathway training before I went on the cash register. I had no support or proper training on the register. One of the Pathway videos tells you to ask if you need help. Also, covers associates supporting each other and the best way to help. It is hard to learn the register on the computer.  After 4 weeks, I had to quit. Walmart is not the best place to work. I have worked for a retail store and got the best training from co-workers. I didn't realize what I got into. I should have done more research before I applied. Mangers will not help you or co workers. You are put out on the register and have to figure it out on your own. To many codes to remember. I can see why Walmart has a big turn around in employees."
bad,When I first started working this job I couldn't believe I was working for Walmart. But then everyone expected you to do they work and also yours it became very stressful and overwhelming that I have to find something better
bad,"Turnover rates are incredibly high and with good reason: management can be very difficult to work with and often condescending. As a student, you are guaranteed to work every single weekend and they will be very suspicious if you call in even if you are genuinely sick. They will ask for doctor's notes even if you have not been away for three consecutive shifts (as per labour law AND their own contracts). They will not guarantee you religious time off, student-related time off, or family-related time off. If you call in sick, they have been known to call your house to try and catch you in a lie and if you tell them the reason for your absence, you will still be accused of lying. "
bad,"Overworked and underpaid.  Management played favorites.  Management lacked communication and respect for it employees.  They would pick and choose which customers to help and send customers to someone else if they didn't want to help them, with management being aware of this practice."
bad,"The hours are way to random, they will tell you to work till midnight one night than come in at 6 the next morning. The managers play favorites. While your working your butt off other associates waste they're time bsing  with the managers."
bad,They didnt know how to treat people and the paid is horrible while you do a lot of work. Managment was terrible. They didnt care about the employees. When it was time to go people would forget to replace you. I dont wish my friends to work nor family. I hated this job.
bad,"The treatment of associates at Walmart is unfair and inhumane. One person may be entitled to call in sick every week, only do half of their work, or show up late without consequences; meanwhile another employee may call in sick 3 times that week for honestly being ill and will receive a coaching."
bad,"Worked in a unclean food service environment, health department there several times, flies and gnats everywhere(dead and alive). Horrible Managers - call for help and no one comes half the time. Massive turnover, uneducated and unprofessional staff and management. I'm not sure how they are staying in business at that site. The worst thing I've seen in a long time. I had to get out to keep my sanity."
bad,"the people that walk and talk get moved up, while the associates doing the dirty work get unrecognized. supposedly there is room to grow but very slowly, till what all the talkative people that suck upquit? I do not recommend it. maybe it was my management that just sucks, hope not all Walmart's are the same but we shall never know. every job has there pros and cons."
bad,"A lot of complaining less work getting done. "
bad,"prepare daily bake with employees(when they showed up).Make sure full bake was prepared everyday and out in the store by 8:00am daily. inventory control, keep bakery clean"
bad,Extremely poor management with very disgusting habits. Found moldy hot dog and old dirt food trays in the coat closet. Ants crawling around and fruit flies everywhere. Most management act like they cant assist others or do their actual job. Was harassed by other managers for getting a cup of water because the heat was blasting on a summer day. Do not and repeat don't come here.
bad,"Not enough staff to carry the load of customers"
bad,"It became too much and way too stressful. They expect you to work like crazy with very little pay. Some of the managers are hard to work with, I did move up in the company so that was a plus. They change the policy so much you can't keep up. Overall it was stressful most days."
bad,Management there doesn’t care and we’re rude to employees and not understanding and didn’t care about employees. They always treated me poorly and I was bullied by management there.
bad,"One of the worst employers I have ever worked for.  The fact that I was literally stuck there made it even worse.  When they find out that you are trying to leave, they change your schedule in such a way that you can't make appointments for job interviews.  The genuine lack of care coming from the management staff is really bad.  They only care about money and don't care about the general well-being of the staff."
bad,"If you wanted to go see flirty girls that act like they are still on high school it's an ok place. Besides that it's horrible. managers sleeping with each other an employees, cashiers flirting with people's husbands, drama and gossip all day."
bad,The hardest part of the job was being trained. I was sent to three different department managers because they all refused to train me. I finally spoke to one of the assistant managers and he stepped in to make sure I was trained. This took three months.
bad,"Hours were very inconsistent, management had there favorites. Customers were very spoiled co workers were very lazy they never wanted to get on a register"
bad,"this place was nothing shy of a nightmare, management treated us like dirt, hours where long and gruesome, the store was unimaginably dirty and there was never any rasies, or advancement opportunities."
bad,i did not like working for this company it can be for some people but it was not for me others have liked it and it helped them out but it was just stressful
bad,"Welp, it's Wal-Mart. You know the pros and cons, it's not a glorious job but it's a great way to max out hours and get some immediate cash in your pocket."
bad,The staff pick and choose what workers they want to use for the day; the rest get sent home. They also pick and choose when you can take your breaks and lunch plus what rules to follow.
bad,I was employed with walmart for 7 months. They purposely do not allow you to work full time and earn any benefits to avoid having to pay for them. Pay  at walmart is very very low and they do not care.
bad,working at Walmart is horrible. the hours are unflexible. hours are far from family friendly. the managers never seem to be on the same page as far as desired tasks.
bad,"they kept changing the rules. "
bad,This was by far the worst job I worked at. Management was self-serving. Employees were treated as expendable items that could easily be replaced. I refuse to support Walmart in any way.
bad,"The employees are cry babies and the management team is inconsistent and over bearing. The customer complain about you doing what your job is and the management discipline you for it, even though you are literally trained to do it the way you're being disciplined for."
bad,"I learned nothing. I was constantly harassed and belittled by my manager, who was female. I am female. Misogyny at its finest. Nobody should have to endure what I did."
bad,I have to say this is probably the worst job I have ever had!The pay is very low considering the productivity they expect out of their employees.Management very inconsistant with each other. You will get several different answers depending on which manager you talk to on any subject.
bad,I don’t even know where to start . I was only there for 3 months & so much happened within those 3 months. The managers are garbage . All of them. Customers are also garbage. All of them as well. Get paid 9.00 to do everything under the sun. I used to work in the men’s department. They would want sales associates to get on registers as cashiers . Like just hire more people
bad,"If you are not friends with the manager, then you might as well consider yourself to be fired soon. They had accomidations, do not like veterans and are quick to blame employees for theft before a customer does."
bad,It was a hostile working environment. There was a big blanket over the harassment issue which the management had created. Management had many miscommunication issues.
bad,Again I work side by side with my co workers and my crew. The crew I had respected me for this. I shared my experience in my field and at the same time learn and respected them.
bad,"I tried for 4 years to move up in the company, the only problem with that was they picked the favorite each time and never gave the people who wanted to make Walmart a career a chance to do that. I got tired of the management choosing the favorite so I left."
bad,it was a real negative place to be in the way manigment worked it would drive you insane the way nobody could make up there minds and no communication between anyone everything was crazy
bad,"Wal-Mart was, at one time, a decent place to work.  Not any more.  The entire culture of the place has gone completely downhill.  Managers are concerned only with their own advancement, and are more worried about losing their jobs than they are about assisting associates with theirs.  Corporate policy has foolishly determined that fewer and fewer associates can handle the same number of customers.  Sales have declined as a result of less and less customer service available.  Honestly, I expect Wal-Mart to close more and more stores within the next ten years as they continue to gut their own workforce."
bad,"Very clicky. Promotions/wages are not based on being a great hard worker and knowledgeable about your job, but rather on who you know or being a certain type of minority who does not need to know the job or follow the job description or directions.  "
bad,Not a good place to work if you have children and not flexible under rights by law to be able to take off for Medical needs of you or your children not a family friendly company
bad,The management was horrible. They did not live up to there on policy  The hours where not flexible and the off days where scattered. The store manager was biased when it came to workers and other managers .
bad,"I was placed in the bakery with two amazing women, that didn't speak a lick of English. I was expected to know how to do everything with no training and no support. Our section manager was never there, except to yell when we didn't finish our work load. we had 3 people(me untrained) doing a 6 person job."
bad,The management staff was always lecturing me about stuff that wasn't my job to do. They always complained that we had no carts but they wouldn't buy more carts for us to keep in the cart area.
bad,This company had no care for its employees. This company did not care how employees were treated as long as quota was met. No matter what a complaint was made would be disregarded.
bad,Nothing I can say would be positive of Walmart. Their focus is on cheap labor and cheap goods. Nothing of significance could be said to be positive of my employment there.
bad,Walmart fills average 300-400 prescriptions a day I like a busy day because make time fly. this job help me on my pharmacy skills and working with the insurance. Walmart can never keep a pharmacy manager it was very unorganized and they don't appreciate the hard work tech put into the job. the hardest part of the job was keeping the lines down especially when there very in patients.
bad,"working with Walmart, made you feel like you can be replaced at anytime you don't feel like putting in 100% of work.i was being told what to do, by 3 different managers, which led me looking like a dog chasing its tail. plus they weren't able to work around my school schedule. to top it off, the managers was so disrespectful. belittling everyone, even the customers themselves."
bad,The managers weren't too mean on the joking around part of the day although this wasn't too much of an issue for me as i take my work seriously. Although this somewhat brought down morale.
bad,"Read the summary, it sucks. Soul destroying and I am suicidal because of it. Every day I think about what i have done to be in this situation. I cannot stand another day at this place."
bad,the management is bad. they dont treat you right at all. The Mattendance policy is the worse thing they put there. The dont hire you after youleave an
bad,The company's values and the metrics which they use to measure with are shoddy at best. I would not recommend seeking a long term career within that company.
bad,"I was a department manager there. I received no help from my upper management, even after repeatedly asking for support. I had to take care of 4 departments with no Associates everything was left up to me. It sucked so bad...."
bad,"The atmosphere I work in is toxic, the two years I've been at this specific store our AES score has been a 46 and 49. HR comes in to investigate, nothing changes"
bad,"Walmart management was very poor they did not care about their employees; Management would have relations with other associates, management would work off their emotions. The management would also be rude to customers and employees."
bad,"I would not recommend Wal-Mart for work to anyone, they are not employee concerns. The management only have their sights on the money they can bring in."
bad,I would never recommend anyone working at Walmart. I was wrongfully fired according to unemployment office. Pay was about the only thing that was good at my local store.
bad,This is a very poorly run company. It is all about profit. employees are throw away unless you learn how to suck up to management. Management does not care about employees or customers.
bad,Terrible place to work. Wants you to finish all your duties as well as everyone else's duties. Will change your schedule without informing you of the change.
bad,"i found that most of the people that work at Walmart arent people, people i love being around people and getting my job done while having a pretty awesome work day and it will not happen at walmart"
bad,I worked at Walmart for almost 3 years. everyday I got yelled at by customers and employees. I was always offered a promotion but never got it. I learned that people are massively two faced and only want to cover their own tales. I consitintly put myself on the line to work outside of my job description only to get told that I was not working what so ever and the people who never did their job and always talked bad to customers and other employees would get promoted.
bad,"management is full of themselves and doesn't know how to do their jobs. Department managers do it all and get no credit for being the ""Heartbeat"" of Walmart."
bad,nothing to share it was ok not much to say when you are there to help people dont hae much to share sorry didnt learn much management is not ok hardest thing to impress
bad,I would go in go to the office get a set of keys go up front and get money ready to reset the registers for the next day.  Once we get that done we would set up breaks and lunches for the day.  then we would work on putting up returns and helping customers when need be.
bad,"This was the only job I have ever had that I absolutely Hated. The management was mean, rude and totally unprofessional. They didnt give you enough hours. The pay was not even close to being enough. It was just Bad all the way around."
bad,They are short staff and they make it hard on the staff they have. They expect each employee to do multiple jobs at the same time. There are too many managers telling employees what to do and all the managers are not on the same page. They are only concerned about what they need.  Which one does the employee listen too?
bad,"most times you were always busy. "
bad,I wouldn't recommend for anyone to consider it for full time or permanent.  I was there for 15 years and my opinion I wish that I wasn't.  Walmart has a thing where they redo there rules anytime that they want .
bad,"Employees are given 12 hours worth of work to do and 8 hours in which to do it.  Hard work is not rewarded, however if a small mistake is made it won't go unnoticed.  It was always either too hot or too cold, I assume in order to save money on heating and cooling.  I was verbally abused by customers on a daily basis.  The only person who seemed to enjoy her job was the store manager who I assume was hired for her lack of compassion.  They are VERY careful to follow every labor law, only so that they won't get sued, not because they care.  Even the discount was only 10%.  Barely worth using."
bad,The management there really didn't care about employees. They wanted so much more out of people then was really possible to complete when they wanted. Overall they was only worried about profit and not employee's.
bad,As a sales associate there the company was do as i say type place and wasnt to caring for employees. i wouldnt suggest working for this company or any of their subsidiaries.
bad,Walmart was not the job for me it was a very stressful work place they don't pay enough to be talking to you any kind of way in mistreating people in making them feel like they don't won't them there.
bad,"Been a while since i worked there not sure how it is now, but my experience was Management was completely incompetent and the night shift was never adequately staffed."
bad,I do not know I do not like it they will drop be you crazy and work your nerves to the core and make u run around the store all day long and just holl
bad,The managers dont do they job.there rude and don't know to do their job .they do not protect you from other coworkers. They are not organized.they have certain people they like the managers do.certain shifts get more hours then the other shifts
bad,"Clock in work the cashier station. check customer out with merchandise. "
bad,"I wouldn't recommend anyone to work there. They literally push their employees to work like they are five people, being in five places at once doing numerous jobs."
bad,There was no opportunity for advancement. You were not appreciated for the job you did. You were only recognized when sales were down or management disliked how you did something.
bad,"I did not like working for walmart at all"
bad,I would not recommend working for a company like Wal-Mart to anyone.  If you are college educated you will often find yourself being managed by unqualified people with middle school level education and it will drive you insane.
bad,Walmart is an very bad place! Too many people work there that don't need to be there. Management is strict and only know one way and that's the Walmart way
bad,I will never work for another retail establishment ever again due to the way this particular store carried themselves. Upper management was awful and the culture of the company was a disgrace. Never again!
bad,Insane mean customers with awful management. I didn't get many hours at all so the job wasn't even worth it. I loved Walmart until I worked here and its honestly sad. All of my coworkers hours were cut and they all told me to get out as fast as possible.
bad,"Horrible place to work!!!"
bad,not always fair. Overlooked several times and took the blame for allot things.  To many task giving to a single person with no help and told to make it work.
bad,I regret every day that I went to work for the company.It is beyond badly managed in general and it isn’t worth the daily stress. I wouldn’t recommend it as you first job and you won’t be able to move up in the company unless the managers like you.  This company would rather give a higher up position to someone they like then the store instead of giving it to someone who will get the job done and while give you an excuse that they gave the job to someone with more experience when the reality is that they gave the job to someone with less experience then you just because they like him/per.
bad,Only if you must do it. At least the stores in Naples were not well administrated. It was fun but extremely exhausting. Customers are nasty and know-it-alls. I dont recommend it.
bad,Worked at the one by Jacksonville Airport. It was a very tough work environment for bern little pay. Their system for ordering seemed to make quite a bit of overstock that management couldn't get a handle on.
bad,Would not work there ever again never help there employees with anything ...whatever they say go's always....I would go there to shop but not for a job
bad,I loved working there but hated the fact that other employees were always trying to compete and were brown nosers. that is a place that in order for you to get hired or advanced you have to know someone
bad,"Management was poor, and they demanded to much , racial profiling and i dont recommend this job to know one ,i wont even shop at the store any more never again."
bad,I enjoyed the peers I worked with however the salaries managers are a nightmare. The store manager was always yelling at someone even cussing at times on the sales floor. They say they have an open door policy but they don’t. You’ll just be ignored. Leaving Walmart was the best decision I ever made.
bad,management doesn't back up employees. never get time off because their excuse is they don't have enough help.depending on who you know depends on if you make a major mistake whether you get to keep your job or not. will work you for as much as they can then take hours away so they don't have to offer you full time and they don't have to pay benefits
bad,it is a cut throat company no matter how good u are and how much u show u wanna move up its really hard to move up and if u show any shows u wont do what they say then they will get raid of u
bad,"Walmart in my experience was as awful as standing at a funeral all day long while rubbing a cheese grater on your forehead. The pay is decent for the work you perform in my opinion but as far as the conditions as well as the management, it is unbearable. Management demands far too much for far too little. They are demeaning and also not empathetic when it comes to things such as family emergencies and fatigue due to overworking. I once worked from 7am to 10pm and was expected to arrive for work at 4am. When I brought this to management attention I was met with utter and completely disregardful. As if I was a child complaining about homework."
bad,They do not value their employees whatsoever. Management does not help their employees who are struggling in an area. I injured the back of my head at walmart and all they did was ask me to still work instead of sending me home
bad,departments are never staffed correctly. low pay. managers need more training on how treat employees with respect. customers treat you like trash just because you work at walmart and I don't get that and managers let them get away with it.
bad,"Typical day starts with no coverage so your it to get everything done plus other task that other managements have for you, and if it is not done because customers always come first they hold you accountable for not getting done and no excuses. You have overtime to get it done and then cut it that week. No communication among store manager to co manager to assistants to support managers to supervisors. No in-depth training then hold associates accountable, store and upper manager have no respect for associates and retaliate when you open door. "
bad,provide change to the staff make sure the counts are right approve bank cards register audits address any concerns and train employess facititatedthe authorization
bad,"This company had poor pay, poor benefits, poor management ,no vacations and short hours. All these make it difficult to support a growing family.I found a better paying job."
bad,"They will make stuff up to get you fired, they did it to me.  I was not the only one this happened to this happened back in 2001 but I've heard their management is garbage."
bad,Walmart was the worst place I had ever worked at. The managment was rude and not productive. Never did I see any managers doing any type of work they were always on their phones or outside smoking.
bad,"Not very fair to the employees as far as benefits go, you have to wait 1 year to qualify for any benefits. Walmart expects you to be on call for them 24/7, if you are not you will not get many hours."
bad,messy stores disorganized nonsensical management not on same page on regular basis was told not to put any out if we couldn't fit all of it on the shelf.
bad,Muy mala sólo explotación laboral malos horarios malos y rola je entre semana
bad,It's a poor place to work. You aren't appreciated at all. I would never recommend this place to work at. Always short staffed and management only cares about their paychecks
bad,I was treated poorly by upper management. Nothing was ever good enough for them and the dayshift crew always left tons of stuff to be dobe every night. They also complained if we left them anything to do. Management basically treated you like a dirty dog. Only made $350.00 for two weeks.
bad,"Consistently scheduled past available times. was told several times my management that i ""wasnt good enough"" and that i was ""making them look bad"" and had very minimal training."
bad,"Too stressful, less opportunities for employees to advance or move up. At Walmart, you can cap out very easy and stay in one position for years. If you want to grow, develop, and advance in life, Walmart is not for you."
bad,If you are interested in a stressful work environment poor management favoritism cut hours conflict of interest gossip and being surrounded by drug and alcohol inflicted associates then walmart is the place for you no room for advancement just a pull the wool over your eyes mentality and horrible culture Walmart is bad for the economy and for your own health.
bad,"Supervisor the electronic department, prices chance, using scanner for checking prices, updated prices, chancing label, stocks report, status in sales for your department and whole store. cap your bins, loading truck, customers service, cashiers, meeting, assignment for your employees, set-up end cap, chancing signs, set-up new items, updated new release movies every Tuesday morning, walking your areas."
bad,Don't recommend this job these people are rude the managers are not professional..................customers always cursing and rude I have nothing else to say above this company
bad,"One of the WORST companies i have ever worked for. Managers show favoritism to certain individuals and give you more work than a person can handle and then writes you up for not being able to keep up. General manager has given us twice the work load since his arrival and switches employees hours around and has them work mandatory overtime for months on end. The company as a whole could care less about your family, Walmart comes first, employees and their families come last. everything is always the employees fault regarding injuries, so they don't have responsible for workers comp."
bad,"throught my time here, I learned so many helpful things.  I also had a wonder experience that enhanced my career goals.  This experience will take me far in life."
bad,"Horrible culture, reminiscent of pre 1900's ""management by intimidation"". Shameful that this company allows its employees to be treated as if they are ""subhuman"". I have discussed my experiences with Walmart employees who worked  at other Walmart stores. They agreed with my assessment. I would dare say this type of ""mismanagement"" is pervasive and indicative of this company's management practices."
bad,No need to say anything but don't do it! If you have any self respect then this nite the place for you.  Wal-Mart tends to hire people in desperate needs cause they knits they can do you any type of way
bad,it was completely horrible wish I never went there in the first place. Always better options than Walmart. the managers and employees do what they wish without following rules or having order in the store.
bad,"They beat the did horse on wanting to fix issues that the employees have, but issues that may vary from store-to-store are overlooked by corporate statistics that the company gets from social sciences that they employ. It would be fine as a temporary job, but once you become a Department Manager you get put under the radar for a lot of managers who will bully you. My mom worked there, I worked there, and my children will not be working there."
bad,"Horrible managing of employees, everyone just seemed to do whatever they wanted with no repercussions. I was let go from this job due to a scheduling error on my managers behalf, they said I wasn't coming to work on time but my manager was the one personally telling me what time to come in. Wasn't even worth the hassle of trying to explain the situation to them. I will never work for this company again"
bad,"I got tendonitis in both my ankles for working so hard for them & they fired me for it anyway. I had to go to a doctor and everything. It didn't matter to them, they pointed me over the limit anyway."
bad,"The jobs easy, if you're hired directly through walmart thats the way to go, if you're through an agency don't even bother.They say they will hire you on but really you'll just work for dogs wage doing the same job as everyone else while also being treated like you suck."
bad,"No organization, poor management.  Work was not distributed fairly in the location where I was.  May have been different at another location.  Would be willing to work for Walmart again at another location."
bad,It was a hostile enviroment. I was not trained for my position as department manager at all. when I had a question about something I was told to figure it out myself. was not given the help needed to finish projects or tasks on time if it required more than one person to do so.
bad,"doesn't matter how much work you ever do, if you're not friendly (smoochy-smoochy) with any type of manager you'll go nowhere and get all the less than terrible jobs"
bad,Did not work well with my overall goal of wanting to achieve new heights and go to college. Manager did not allow me the time that I needed to go college course.
bad,I would not work at Walmart again because the management  did not treat the employees like they should. They did not evaluate your work performance. It just isn't a good place to work.
bad,The managers there were so unprofessional . Most times they didn't want to work around your hours. It was hard to get overtime. Also they really didn't care about he customers.
bad,The time i worked there i was not treated even like a human managers would never actually listen to you. they treated there employees like they where just basically machine that should never complain.
bad,"typical day :stressed and rill did not want to be there ."
bad,"Walmart treats their employees terribly, they don't care about them. You are just a number in the system. The managers left me in the electronics department by my self, which they were not aloud to do."
bad,"The average day at walmart includes. "
bad,Management doesn't care about employees all they care about is how much you will do for them. Once something happens and you can no longer work long hours they find any reason to term you.
bad,"I was working at this Walmart through a temp agency, it was the worst time of my life, they had a manager that did not know how to manage, yet gave him the full responsibility to manage a brand new warehouse."
bad,"walmart was a horrible experience"
bad,wal mart was a very stressful job. They were understaffed and worked the very few employees they had to death. There are very few benefits and the managers are greedy and only care about themselves. They were not willing to work with your schedule and did not treat their employees fairly.
bad,Walmart is a terrible company to work for they dont care about there employees dont offer holiday pay wants you to work your department and any 1 who is a slacker puts people in frozen and dairy without the extra pay for fresh ridiculous company.
bad,this job was a joke no one there does there job if you try to request off weeks in advance for a family emergency they will ignore it then tell you to call off and they will approve it what they wont tell you is they will still count it against you and you could be fired
bad,"I learned how to perform many task, also my department manager is awesome. The work location is well orientated with all cultures & is very open to all religions"
bad,cool place to work. its fast paced...the downside was that the hours suck...if you changed your availability then you were able to work the times that you needed.
bad,I only worked her for around a month. I worked a temporary set up crew. The Supervisors I encountered were unkind and made me feel uncomfortable. I do not recommend working here.
bad,"Walmart was a terrible place to work , Walmart does not care about their employees , only yearly-quarterly numbers. I will never shop or work for Walmart ever again."
bad,"Boring"
bad,Management does not care that you are one person. They expect you to work like a robot and get everything done with too little time. They don't care.t
bad,"walmart is just a stepping stone . I did not enjoy working here but it was a job."
bad,they play favorites. they would work you 6 or 7 days in a row. they would not give you what you wanted your avalibility to be. They are not easy to work for.
bad,working at walmart was a nightmare. when it came down to a few hours left in your shift and didnt complete your task you had to stay after till completed. They over work you no matter what.
bad,Over all hands down worst job I have ever stuck around for its the perfect job that you tell yourself its not that bad and then your stuck. It was terrible.
bad,They micromanage treat their employees like slaves they are very disrespectful and rude to their employees management at store 5184 is horrible they have a lot of work that needs to be done definitely treat employees better it's very very very bad treat your employees good they'll do more work
bad,"i needed a job my store was closing I took what was available to me at the time. the new hires got hours and I was told I couldn't work more than I was scheduled, I always worked hard at my job. I tried to be the best at what I did,"
bad,A very poor run company that allows workers too be treated unfairly and i would never go back to a company like this and i would never recommend anybody to work for this company.
bad,the people are friendly but it not a job a want to spend doing the rest of your life. you get a good discount and you can eve cash your check there...
bad,"there was no advancement. no communication with managers and employee. not allowed to work the job you are scheduled to work."
bad,"The management there is full of lies. No advancement, no raises,no intensives,no thank you, no positivity at all! The management will not let you advance if you are good in one area. They put you down never telling you what you do is good. It is always why is this not done, you are not good enough. They other thing that I see is that they management all wants things done their way so you have 4-5 different managers tell you what to do and it is always different. There is not support and the managers don't defend you at all. They expect you to do you job and any other that are thrown at you! You never know when you are going to get ripped into and when you are going to get passed by. There is no respect at all.You are not trained but rather thrown in to the work and expected to know what it is that you are doing."
bad,Company expects excellent customer service but don't treat their employees fairly. Employees are underpaid and the hours given per week don't allow you to make a decent paycheck.
bad,"I worked for walmart on cap 2 for a few years. In my experience it is like a military style boot camp that you get paid for. Under paid at that, For all the stress they place on you with their insanely time limits that are unrealistic they scold you no matter how much of a hard worker you are. If you didn't match the time frame you will be belittled, humilated, in tears wanting to rip out every hair you have. They make you feel worthless, useless, they play favorites. & for some they will not fire you they will make the work place so intolerable & unbearable you are forced to resign. If you have low self esteem this job is NOT for you. Management gossips about you behind your back. Barely any days off & if you tell them you have a family they will guilt trip you. Overall horrible place to work!"
bad,Working here was terrible. I would not tell anyone they should work here. It was too stressful and it was not fun at all. I did not like this as a first job .
bad,"They expect way to much, treat employees very poorly, and management is a joke, every one tells you to do something different...so unorganized, I would never recommend working for this company"
bad,I was practically forced to run an entire department by myself most of the time. I was given little to no help. I was always under a lot of stress. I never want to work there again.
bad,Wal-mart is a billion dollar company and can afford to pay its employees top pay but it does not.  Who wants to kill them selves working everyday for minimum wage?
bad,Working at Walmart set a guideline for me in the real world. that was that not every company will pay as much as you may need them but you do have to work for what you want.
bad,I use to love working there I dislike coming into work every morning everyday I work on cap team 1 not enough workers everything is always blamed on us it’s just not worth it anymore
bad,worst place to work for. They do not care about employees are all and only want to make money for themselves and could careless what happens to the employees or customers
bad,"I did not enjoy working there. For me, it was not as good job and the hours were not good for me but it is still a great company. I left because I worked nights and was getting no sleep."
bad,"todo muy controlado y organizado, como empecador no daban salario por ser menor de edad solo lo que la gente te daba en propinas, walmart solo te pone el lugar de trabajo"
bad,other dept. Marnagers tell you how to do your job when they dont even know how to run the dept you work in. wont allow you to have a set schedule. And wont do anything when co workers harrass you when you have proof.
bad,"Walmart is like a high school environment where you are rewarded for who you know not what you know or your abilities. If you understand the Business concept of ""The Peter Principle""; it is alive and well at Walmart."
bad,A fairly toxic environment with very little focus or care for the people that work there. Constantly cutting good jobs and good people to hire lesser people for lesser positions.
bad,I hate working for Walmart.  The paye is bad and the managers are even worse. Their is no respect for one's life. The managers do not care whether you have families or not especially when doing the schedule.
bad,"In Wal Mart many management are very realism with associates so this job is really poor job  I think no future with Walmart . So I try to find a better job also to have a better future. I will never engorged anybody to work at wal mart because too much work and bad managements,"
bad,"They treat you horribly there, and you literally do not matter to them. They do not care about your wellbeing whatsoever. They also aren't very willing to work with you on your schedule. I am honestly surprised that they aren't shut down because of all the health code violations I saw."
bad,They are bad at scheduling with my school hours. They don't schedule enough help on weekends. They don't pay enough compared to other retail places. I asked to change my availability and they wouldn't let me but let others.
bad,"If you are a high school dropout, someone who can't pass a background check or someone who's given up on life in general then this is a perfect place for you to work. For everyone else out there, you can do better."
bad,"They don't give you any guidance, they don't have friendly employees. Management is terrible. They let you pick your hours, and give you a lot of freedom."
bad,They put way too much responsibility on you and won't pay you extra for all you have to do. Does not allow overtime. Will make you take extra time on your lunch or leave early if you do more than 40 hours a week. Expects you to come to work sick and then sends you home early for being sick but add a point or half a point to your attendance. Co-manager and some other managers  are very rude and disrespectful towards associates. Even customers have noticed this behavior. They expect you to do way more than you can handle with little to no help.
bad,"A typical day at Walmart is stressful and no help from associates or managers. I worked by myself most of time because as soon as I came on everyone went on break or lunch and I was left to cook, wait on customers, and slice meat."
bad,"This is an extremely stressful place to work at the distribution center. You have production accountability and if not met, they will fire you. The managers are not friendly and only care about production. They are only concerned with safety and how it effects the company. If you get injured on the job, they push for you to not say anything and take care of it on your time."
bad,"It is not a career job.  They play favortism with certain employees.  Pay is low, and you cannot support a family on the salary.  Managers talk to you like a child and demand respect."
bad,"I did not have a good experience with walmart, which is extremely common. My sister got fired from the same store when she failed to call in while taking her extremely sick boyfriend to the hospital in the back of an ambulance."
bad,"I really disliked working here, the atmosphere was not likable and the managers were far from great.  "
bad,"No management at all, no job security, store manager has no manner they will put you down every chance they get  "
bad,"I could not stand my job at Walmart. The employees are treated unfairly and it was like no matter what you did, it was not good enough for the management. I would not recommend working for Walmart to anyone. The only good thing about this company is that the pay is good."
bad,"Poor environment, very stressful and the shifts are very inconsistent and that's hard when you have a family... Not really room for advancement unless you have been there for years"
bad,"People were overworked and treated unfairly.  If you were a woman you were least likely to be promoted or paid the same as men in the same position.  There was very litte recogition for a job well done, and there were always staffing issues."
bad,"Managers are disconnected from the associates. When asked why certain tasks are not done and ask what can be done to improve the situation, constructive feedback given is ignored and not welcome. Programs and procedures are only followed when it's beneficial to managers. I would be able to make a career out of it if I adapted the following mindset: work harder, not smarter and make friends with management so they overlook the shortfalls that are put into place."
bad,I never worked in Six flags before. I'm always wanted to work there. I didn't like working at Wal-Mart because they didn't give me the hours I wanted.
bad,"Smart Styles at one point it was great place to work. However, smart styles change their prices often which is a issue for the guest. Recently there has been a huge change in the guest due to another increase in the prices. The price change was not only services but product as well. Due to this I am lucky to get two guest a day. I've also worked for the company for a little over a year as a manager and it was the worst experience. I as the leader of the salon did not have the proper district leader which did not allow me to do my job. The most enjoyable part of working there was stepping down from management back to stylist. Doing this allowed me to just come to work and go home at the end of the day. I love management however, with all the work that comes with the title, the proper income needs to come with it as well. Also going by the book is not such a bad idea either."
bad,"You can not count on the time of day and hours that you will be scheduled.  very hard to make plans and appointments. One day you could be scheduled till midnight and next day you are scheduled at 7:00 am. You may be scheduled 30 hours a week, then only get 8 hours the next week.  You must ask for time off a month a head of time."
bad,I feel like they get rid of they best employees because they dont like competition. They never listened to you. I learned almost everything on my own.
bad,A typical day at Walmart consisted of nonstop work especially in the cold freezer with no help or time to heat up. Many times I would have to work over night with no help and no breaks.
bad,"This is the worst place i have ever worked.  poor pay, they treated all their employees like robots, and the managers pawned their work off on those beneath them in rank.  You couldn't pay me enough to work for this company again."
bad,"i learned how to stock. the managers promote the people  that dont work at all. they always gave me a 4 people person job and i had to do it on my own, i love the co workers i worked with."
bad,"hated it, and I'm a friendly, compliant person. Walmart is the worst company to work for, careless, unreasonable, I had to hold back my freshman year . management  is the worst.. just all in all bad"
bad,"While I made some FANTASTIC friends while working here, The job was harsh, and often dangerous, with unrealistic expectations from management, and poor treatment of the workers.  HEAVILY underpaid position."
bad,They only allow 4 full points in a 6 month period. So if you're in a situation that you don't have much choice but to miss and then end up sick. Kiss your job goodbye. They don't care and will say you can re-apply in 90 days. Doesn't help when you're freaking homeless and just got kicked out of their parking lot at 6 that morning and then you go into your shift later and get fired an hour and a half in.
bad,"Management at dc 6057 robert , louisiana "
bad,"I was denied a raise because the manager told me I needed to wear make up. Pay was poor, I worked harder than must but was denied a chance to be promoted."
bad,do not get treated with respect. poor management. horrible work hours. rude customers. rude associates. pay is awful. benefits arent very good. no holiday pay.
bad,"As an ASM with Walmart you were required to work 12 hour shifts 4 days a week, which never ended up just 12 hours and with an hour commute you did little but sleep between shifts"
bad,"When i started at this store, it was a fun relaxed, laid back place to work. By the time i left it felt almost like the regular employee didnt matter.  The new store manager basically had a dictatorship attitude."
bad,"The job was reconciling bank to store deposits. Since it was starting a new job function they were training us for, they made up step by step guidelines to follow which was nice except they made 27 changes within a 2 week period which made it impossible to learn. Had they perfected the job details before they brought people on, it could have been a very nice job. But as it was, it was very stressful."
bad,"I had worked for a Walmart,doing the same thing I was doing before,and had no issues what so ever.When I started at a brand new Walmart store,it was pretty bad.My department manager never liked me,as I could do her job,I was always blamed for t3rd shift coming into the bakery and messing up the back room."
bad,This job was only temporary and was not a job where I could progress. I found another job after this one and it paid me more. I was looking for a better opportunity
bad,La empresa es buena pero la gerencia no tanto ni la gente que la conforma
bad,lots of work to be done training is zero be prepared to work over house and there only care when you selling great co workers pay is horrible all the best
bad,"The job was very stressful and demanding, holidays were mandatory, set up for failure, lack of communication, if you aren't a favorite employee you were treated poorly."
bad,"Working for walmart (Milledgeville, Ga) was stressful and demanding with childish managers.Low pay grade for all required tasks. Floated in departments with no training in the area."
bad,I was injured on the job with them and fired. Took me 2 years to receive any compensations for a failed surgery after the injury.You are a number and treated like that.
bad,Would not recommend a job. It is unfair and unbalanced. Smoke and mirrors. I have worked for the company for over 10 years and the things I have seen are just one sided and that's the side the management is on. You are separated from others and not allowed to have friends at work if you work in certain areas.
bad,working at walmart is very stressful and annoying. Employees do not get a paid sick day at all. The management at walmart are pretty decent overall and nice tho.
bad,"its a nice first time job, and nice pay for a beginning worker, co workers are nice and managers are reasonable be on time dedicated and have a work mind."
bad,The managers where bullies treated me out of everybody else like a child. I got fired for being slow when everybody in the whole entire store is slow. The managers would talk about me too other people I even got called slow in front of a police officer.
bad,"Most days involved trying to explain electronics to people who didn't understand them, while my managers complained about my tendency to find the item customers needed, rather than indiscriminately selling everyone the most expensive apple product on the shelf."
bad,"Terrible management sums walmart up. Managers have no proper management background, its all walmart courses that tech them how to be a manager and even still they think they are better then everyone else, they hardly do work, on their phones, Talk about employees badly, treat them like garbage. I pity anyone working there."
bad,Not a good working experience with the lack of security and the poor management skills established or presented by upper management. I wouldn't recommend this working experience to anyone.
bad,"Working at Walmart was one of the worst mistakes I ever made. The first time I worked there was fine. But the second time around I worked in sub-zero coolers with very little protection from the cold provided by the store.Thin, white meat-department robes were the standard regardless of temperature."
bad,Busting to get things done for inventory working over time to get the department all ready and told we would be keeping our o er time then the next day inventory day was told had to leave early due to now they're told no over time....
bad,I worked at Walmart while I was in college. I couldn't wait too get out of there. Management treats you poorly and absolutely no benefits. It is an absolutely awful place too work.
bad,"Was not a very good place to work. Constantly changing schedules, had favorites, poor management, tell you to do one thing, then they did something else"
bad,"violated many basic laws, was sexually harassed and when I told my manager they told the man doing it outside of work. Do not work here if you can help it."
bad,Walmart was the worst work environment I could ever experience. They treated me and the other workers poorly unless they favored them. I would not recommend working at Walmart to anyone.
bad,overnight managers really have no clue how to do their jobs or treat their staff.they also make their overnight maintenance clean up after all their overnight employees.
bad,"sucks, really really sucks as a place and the culture and people are substandard, substandard low live people unworth getting to know."
bad,I hated this job and the managers and the fellow associates and they were not supportive when I had to be out of work due to my pregnancy and forced me to quit
bad,Après avoir travaille pendant 6 mois walmart à changer aucun avantage social pas beaucoup d heure même pour ceux que sa 20 ans qui son la walmart exploité ses travailleurs....il n'est y a plus de temps plein tout le monde à temps partiel le et ne respecte même pas le ancienneté.....un beau magasin mais très mal diriger il devrais revoir leur priorité..
bad,"they always keep you running around to all kinds of jobs, so it was hard to keepup with everthings.when you went to work you never know where you was going to be,"
bad,When I was employed at Wal-Mart I was not treated fairly. I had to do some things that other workers didn't have to do. I was picked on by the bakery manager.
bad,A Great company if you need a job.   People were nice to work with but company policies could be improved.  I got flack a few times and accused wrongfully.   Still worked but left as no room for full time hours and the environment of working there effected my health.
bad,"walmart should pay better an give benefits instead of being greedy warehouse workers get hurt more often an dont get paid no better than any other. will not go back.but liked the super, an made good friends.learned how to use pallet jack. If you get any over time they made me take a longer lunch or home early."
bad,so much and you get paid very little the upper staff never say great job and you always get in trouble for some one useless mistakes culd not wait to leave this place
bad,Walmart do not pay or treat employees will. Management want you to fit in as a team but the managers do not have good team building skills. The company is also pretty bad at placing employees in the correct position basined on the skill level.
bad,"Worked there for a few months after basic training. Management asked me to clock her out, then other management fired me for it. Horrible Horrible Horrible. Thats the way you treat someone doing what they're told?"
bad,"Jobs in Walmart are very stressful.  You work a lot of hours and are not appreciated for that.  As an hourly Associate, you don't know how many hours you get per week."
bad,"Middle Management , if you don't brown nose, you get screwed over, the lead man in DA Receiving cannot process or receive a truck, somehow he got a job that put him in charge of a work crew."
bad,one more time here I go just typing filler to get to the next part this is so ridiculous the creator of this sucks you all are wasting my time not appreciated
bad,"Training is non existant, expectations are too high, verbal abuse, mental abuse daily (from management) pressure ignorance and hostility are the daily routine."
bad,Don't work here if you can avoid it... You end up sacrificing a lot for no positive end result... Rate 2 out of 10 and definitely do not plan on telling anyone to apply
bad,The particular storebi worked at was poorly ran.too many people were allowed to make managerial decisions in regards to your job.alot of favoritism and you never xould get a promotion
bad,When working at Walmart I was constantly talked down to. I was only able to meet the manager of my department one time and was unsure of who he was when I met him. I acquired this job over the summer and when trying to return to school in the fall they would not accommodate my school and sports schedule and continued to schedule me throughout the school day and during practice even after speaking with the scheduling manager several times.
bad,Aright place to work as a stocking poor management nice work area the hardest part of the job is working in all the areas when it's time for lunch and getting ready to go home
bad,"You will be treated like less than a person.  If you stick with the company long enough to make a non-poverty wage, they will find an excuse to fire you."
bad,"Purchased a home thought I was transferring only to find out after already closing on house I could not  transfer because all stores have their own policy....nothing universal."
bad,"Wal-Mart is a terrible place to work. Poor management, horrible pay. Just overall a terrible company to work for. Completely unfair to their employees/"
bad,"good starter job for anyone who needs a job but personally will never work there again. managers are rude and hateful, and make you do you rjobs plus theirs never keep people."
bad,Nothing to say this company is not about their employees that do not take care of you my last raise was $0.11 that is a joke I have been here for many years and they are starting new employees more than me
bad,"The managers are hateful, they expect huge amounts of work to be performed in small amounts of time by as few employees as possible. They will assign a person to work in a department even if that person is allergic to the products in the dept."
bad,"Managers have no sense of direction, which then they blame aimlessness of workers on the workers, when we are never directed to what to do or trained how to"
bad,"Show no loyalty to this company, if you do they will NOT return the favor. They tried to take money out of my paycheck for price matching for customers. Price matching Managers approved. The managers refused to confirm that I was following company policy and through me under the bus. I was fired for not giving walmart money out of my minimum wage payceck."
bad,Okay to work there. You have to work really hard to be promoted to a management position. I would not recommend anyone to work there that is above 30 years old.
bad,"Wal-mart in general could be a great company, provided you have a decent group of managers. We were often mistreated by the managers. They talked to us however they chose to. I felt like a number and no matter how great I did with my customer service and metrics, I wasn't valued. You could easily be replaced. I loved my customers and fellow coworkers. They explained to the public that everyone would receive a raise, but we had to jump through hoops to receive it."
bad,the WORST place to work.... they let the computer run the stores......have you stood in line and looked around and saw many cash registers NOT open and employees standing around....well the computer says to not open them......every thing about them is BAD....I was an Asst MGR.......hated it....
bad,"Very poor pay and management. Bad treatment of Their disable employees. To many family members work together, favoritism when it comes to advancements"
bad,Horrible pay for a stressful and hardworking job. Expect you to do so much in so little time. The pay should be enough to live off of instead of paying employees just enough to get by but not make a living.
bad,"never again, if you show up for work everyday you end up doing your work plus another who calls in all the time."
bad,"Management does not keep up with where all the associates are on the clock.   One area might have 4 people scheduled to cover it, but only 1 is on the floor.  Rest are elsewhere talking on the clock.   Management does not discipline those who do not work or slack off.   Some managers even show favoritism towards some employees, in essence allowing them to slack off on the clock.   They also promote those who don't work, instead of the ones who go above and beyond."
bad,"management sucks really bad, horrible organization skills, don't mean to judge but some people be on drugs, too many unreliable coworkers, customers are almost always rude and offensive"
bad,overworked and underpaid. Upper management not great at communication with hourly employees. Standard operating procedures not equal for all employees/
bad,"Scheduled shifts for cashiers, changed out drawers, made money change, fixed issues with customers, separated items for departments, sent money through western union, money orders, etc."
bad,Hostile work environment and retaliation are a code the store manager lives by. Plus he's a drunk that enjoys screaming at his employees and not making sure the store is operating correctly
bad,I was a salaried member of management. My salary was based off a 45 hour work week. On an average you will have to work 60 plus. No you don't get paid overtime. Most days I'll work 15 hours no lunch.
bad,"Management was always awful, they didn't care about anything and didn't inspire me to care about anything either. Constantly being pulled to departments I wasn't familiar with or comfortable in."
bad,i was treated very bad at this job. the managers didn't like me because i never kissed their butts like everyone else did. everytime i complained all i would hear is tat thats how such and such was.
bad,"If you are in desperate need of a job do not let anything stop you from working here. But if you aren't, I would apply to this job as a back up. The management is terrible and you get left doing all the work of nine departments while the others slack off at the fitting room."
bad,Would not recommend any one to work there unless they want to be something they are not. Too many people get away with stuff and the ones that work get cropped on while others play all day.
bad,"Unfortunately the biggest issue with Walmart was the lack of advancement opportunity once you made it to salaried manager level. If you didn't know the upper management on a personal level you were left in the middle, especially if you were a night manager. Out of sight out of mind."
bad,"Poor I wouldn't refer a mouse to this job, they're horrible doesn't even work with you with doctors commands and that's sad  because jobs shouldn't be like that and your health is more important"
bad,"Worked changing tires, oil changes, rotating tires, customer service and general sales. "
bad,as an overnight ims associate the pay was rediculously low and any time you stayed late the next morning you had to burn by coming in that time late the next night in return the dominoe effect come in late stay later pay was insulting to say and management was a total joke
bad,Started off as an okay place to work  Poor management and the corporate big wigs that refuse to employ people full time ake it a difficult place to work.
bad,"The culture is not as company projects."
bad,"There was no order in Walmart stocking department, and the pay was very low. I learned very many things, via shipping and receiving, and fork lift driving."
bad,Fast paced work environment. I would only recommnend wal mart to someone if they were planning on being full time associates with no outside life. Wal mart is very competitive community and very cut throat
bad,Not a good place to work everything is very heavy to lift . Work by yourself. Not a nice break room. Overdoing with the security. They hire anybody without checking background.
bad,High pressure to perform more work then time allotted. always make the store appear to be never been shopped in. Plus consistently cutting hours for no reason at all.
bad,stacked shelves and load and unloaded trucks and leran too scan items and work well with culture and the hardest was working with others employees they were very bad to work with .
bad,"Tell me if you have ever seen an employee at WalMart that is happy.  No, I haven't either.  Employees are under paid, treated very poorly, in a very stressful environment."
bad,they did not want to promote people that were worth promoting. I was only 17 or 18 years old but i knew i could perform tasks that the managers they hired instead of me better than them.
bad,"inconsistent hours, incompetent managers, poorly trained staff, constant harassment from all associates, the only good part of the job is the customers"
bad,"Management is about as useful as a horn on a scooter.  The CEO seems to me to be letting his father's company fail miserably just like so many previous supermarket type stores that have failed in the past.  On top of that, during the 2008 recession, our managers were celebrating how all of these other stores were going out of business because they were selling American goods while Wal-Mart was buying products to sell from countries which regularly use child slavery to produce goods at factories.  "
bad,they don't care about the employees the don't recognize hard workers they do for certin employees and not others you don't get holiday pay and you use to they take benefits from you
bad,"Worked in 3 different stores across Canada and all 3 had the same overall negative atmosphere. There is a lot more to be said, but this company is not worth working for in any capacity. I'll NEVER again take a job with them."
bad,Treated like a dog. Had and injury went to the hospital had to get an operation. Was told I might be fired for missing work because I had no sick days left. Mind you my injury happened on the job. Told by management to go home. No health coverage provided by the company I quit.
bad,"This was not a good job. The managers move around a lot and play favourites who are allowed to get away with anything. The ""policies"" are more of a set of loose guide lines rather than rules."
bad,"Management was laughable. The pay was menial. Work was excessive. Management was very hands off, and you were expected to do a whole lot of work for very little pay."
bad,"Walmart does not care about its employees. If you or your children get sick, it will still count against you. any overtime hours you may end up doing, will not be counted as overtime but instead moved to the next week to avoid paying overtime payments. The management does not care to help or care if you get cussed out by the customers. The only thing the store manager cares about is money so there will always be a lack of employees and a lack of pay."
bad,Walmart was very horrible to me. My work schedule was all over the place no set hours. The Managers where very rude and disrespectful.   They treated employees badly.
bad,Walmart does not value its associates. You are demanded to kill yourself and it is never enough. I would get done more than what was reasonable and the store manager berated me every morning. You can't have holidays with your family because you are expected to be at work.
bad,Walmart is not a good place to work. You become stuck there with no end in site. I would not recommend this to anyone who is wanting to grow in there job.
bad,"While they have done a lot to improve their image over the past decade, the truth is that this company is only about the bottom line.  You are expected to get a hideous amount of work done in a single day, on top of trying to assist customers and being pulled in five directions.  You have multiple managers and they each expect their directions to take priority.  And the third shift stocking program does not work at all, the employee turnover rate for third shift is obscene and people work in different areas so the restocking is quite often haphazard at best.  There is more than a slim chance that the pallet of freight that was left as 'overstock' will fit right on to the shelves."
bad,Wal-Mart is a terrible place to work at. Management is terrible as well. Every managaer I came across lacks communication along with potential drive for employees.
bad,"Walmart is a greedy company. They say they care and value their associates but its all a lie. They made a huge deal about how much money they were investing in increasing wages but then they cut everyone's hours drastically. People are rarely even scheduled 40 hours a week. They only give you a 10% discount that only works for junk food and some general merchandise. You get no discount on groceries. Quarterly bonuses are never given to associates.Most managers seem uneducated and inconsistent. One manager says to do one thing then another says to do something different. There always seems to be a lot of confusion on what needs to be done. There priorities always seem off. People are lazy. No one is ever capable of putting plastic into a bag or get a knew one when the bag is full, instead it just gets thrown on the floor. Very few people are trained to make a bale and don't care to learn. Getting promoted is never about your job performance or how qualified you are, its just about who you know. Raises aren't fair and aren't really based on job performance or work ethic either it just goes off how long you've been there. someones whose worked there for a few years and helps out all around the store, crossed trained in several departments, and cleans up after lazy people makes less than someone that's been there 10 years but is lazy, complains and cant ever get the job done by themselves."
bad,"Working at Walmart has been a good experience, but management does not know how to do their jobs along with some putting employees down for their work"
bad,Walmart was a wonderful company to work for if i can go back i would enjoy working the company again just to keep going also for a second income. With distance also not full-time i was looking something closer to home.
bad,"This company is very bad at management. They over look, and play favoritism."
bad,It was just a job. It was never meant to be forever for me. If you are looking just to have a job until you finish school then Walmart is the place. in order to get ahead in this company you have to be a favorite.
bad,"When i worked there we werent allowed to have any color in our hair the one manager was once in the army so he acted on that role when he would manage us. he would even kick the backs of our knees, i was pregnant at the time too. Also i was having complications during my pregnancy and called in sick (this was only one time doing so) and i got in trouble for it. They dont treat employees right at all."
bad,"I was hired on as the only maintenance worker to clean a 50,000+ SQF store alone for the first 2 months I was working there. I was in charge of cleaning 5 bathrooms, 15+ trash cans, the employee break room, the back room, and everything else on my own for a part time job. I was being called over the loudspeaker ever 20 minutes. I was treated like trash. I was put on with a worker that refused to do ANYTHING. He was taking a spot on the roster and everything was left up to me. There IS A REASON people quit after a week. I also ended up training 5 people and then my hours were cut to 12 a week."
bad,a typical day at work not always the best but i always did my best to maintain a positive attitude and get my job done.The hardest Part of my job was making sure my customers were satisfied
bad,"Terrible associates and management. Write-ups were given for any reason of absence. I was in a car wreck and the doctor ordered me not to return to work until I was physically released. I was written up due to the fact that ""they don't accept dr. notes"". Also, management has 'favorites;, meaning if your'e a manager favorite you could get away with anything wether it being calling out for no reason, no call-no-show, taking 30-40 min on the clock breaks without disciplinary actions. Also, CSM's refused restroom break to cashiers, unless that person was a ""favorite"". I will never work for Walmart again."
bad,Management doesn't care about associates hard working hours work harder then the body allows no change in management team cuts corners doesn't take care of customer base bullies associates treats every person different expects more from some and not from others.
bad,I worked in the pharmacy dept. you would think they would be compassionate and have a sense of ethics to the customer's needs being that most of them are ill and already stressed but sadly not even the Pharmacist/ Manager has the ability to conduct herself with any professionalism.
bad,I advise you please never work at Wal-Mart it is beyond awful and miserable. I worked there my whole pregnancy and even came back after my leave and they tried to force me to work midnight shifts with a newborn!!!!!
bad,"while working at walmart I often see how some people who did not qualify to be promoted gets promoted, not because of their skills but because they are friends with someone at the upper management. Though I am not sure if the corporate office know this situations."
bad,I would not recommend anyone work here. There is so much drama and management does not do their jobs. They are always changing your schedule around during the same week and changing management.
bad,"Wouldn't want to go back wasn't treated fairly the productivity wasn't broken down and showed properly "
bad,"Poor management, promotions and advancements not possible unless you're acquainted with or have family members working in same facility. Evaluations are done, not as individual basis but by dept. reviews. Hard working people are always overlooked when it comes to advancements."
bad,"Management doesn't let to do work. Any manager will pop-up out of nothing and put you on do something and then another manager will pop-up and put you to do something totally different. They don't like productivity. They are not even that smart to find out who is hard worker and who is not. Take them to lunch and you are thier favorite. They have favorites to give promotions. Overall, bad experience."
bad,Like being in a prison if not worse. Change your schedule with out warning. One week you have 40 hours next week you get non. Told you must stay if jobs are not complete or you will be written up when in not related to your area so you depend on other to finish or you must help them. By doing this you are not allowed overtime and have to loose the hours somewhere in the week. Then when yu come in late or leave early to cut those hours yu where get coached for coming in late etc. The place is also ran by kids that have no clue or should be in management and at times rather play around on their phones then actually manage. This is my second go around with the company and this time has been far worse then ever.
bad,"Our management team isn't a team they are all on different pages, one will tell you to do one thing then another will get mad at you for doing what the other told you to do. I have been there for two years and have been passed over for several job advancements I feel like I will never be a able to move up at this particular store"
bad,My boss was not considerate. They denied time off constantly. They did not care if you had a family. I made just over minimum wage. Only got 1 quarter raise. The discount was nice.
bad,"The day started with management giving assignments. After everyone has the assignments I proceeded to my destination to begin. I spent my shift stocking shelves with groceries and other  products. Our day was always stopped to unload trucks and then we could go back to stocking. We later zoned shelves for the day,"
bad,"Management didn't care one bit for their employees and gave us outrageous safety expectations. They didn't try to help you get better at your job, they just got mad at you if you messed up."
bad,"Very stressful places"
bad,"Typical work would consist of work for 4 hours straight and then one break and the last 4 hours of your shift. Management threatened me that they would fire me because i missed work. I was rushed to the hospital from work in the middle my shift. And when I came back with a doctors note and paperwork they said they don't accept doctors notes. Later on, that week I was still on pills and I felt like I was literally going to fall on my face and they didn't care. I said with the medicine I am taking I should be sitting down . They said well I can't nothing about that . So I threaten them with a lawsuit but they said It wouldn't work. I just quit in the middle of my shift because I didn't as if i could resume with the daily routine at work and I had to work until midnight . I thought I couldn't go on , so I called my husband and explained to him that I have to quit because they were thinking of firing if I missed any of my shifts anymore. I said my health was more important because not only do I need to be well to work but I also have a baby at home. The most enjoyable part was having a couple of friends that I could talk to while I was there. I learned how to use a register and customer service ."
bad,"The managment sucks. They dont give sick days, cut your hours, no raises, no moving up, hires to many people so they have to cut everyone elses hours."
bad,They Treat the staff bad. You had to wait long time periods to use the bathroom. They Don't except Doctor notes. There Point system sucks. I have nothing nice to say about that company.
bad,"As a employee of 2 years, I have experienced the situation of ""bad investment"". During that time the location  went through 3 store managers and more than 5 department managers. The more honest employees are usually the first to get cut loose. Fowlerville MI is a location i personally would not recommend to anyone and for those who apply in the near future consider this a heads up. The auto care center was a nightmare and known for their lack of knowledge and customer service. After servicing in their auto care center for 2 years, it became very evident of the liability taking place. Its a dangerous environment and no accountability from your shop manager or department manager. other techs are careless and reckless as well as not showing any respect or concern for you ethics and safety."
bad,"In all honesty, this is big-business, all they care about is the bottom line, not how the employee's are treated. The turn-over is high, morale is very low. Working in the front end, employee's of Walmart would pay for their groceries with WIC or foodstamps because working fulltime wouldn't pay them enough to afford food for their families. It's very sad."
bad,"It's a very stressful job that requires a lot of work and time. Yet you are not appreciated for all of the work that you do. You are required to meet goals, work over time, and will be laid off. Your job isn't promised to you for long . Walmart doesn't care about anyone, they will use you"
bad,"It felt like I was working in a sweat shop. The ac in the back room didn't work so during the summer months it was incredibly hot. It is a very negative workplace and management didn't take care of their employees. I didn't enjoy my job at all, I stayed because I had to. I was able to improve my work skills and organization."
bad,I found myself walking around Wal-Mart searching for things to organize or clean because half the time I could never find my managers or they wouldn't have anything for me to do and they would end up searching with me for something. I had asked several times to be moved to a cashier and was promised three times in the course of a month that I would be promoted to cashier. I quit the end of that month.
bad,Walmart was the worst job I everhad so far. u get paid same amount as a door greater and it was fill with poorly trained managers. I would not recommend working there as a job of any position they had to offer.
bad,Absolutely get no overtime and management doesn't care about doctors notes you get accounted a whole day of missed work no matter what the reason. Also no teamwork between basic employees and management.
bad,"Walmart pays their employees next to nothing for a position requiring a degree, the annual raise was 0.40.  That's right 40 cents an hour.  8 dollars a week .  And the health benefits are awful."
bad,some days are just stressful when you need a break. You tell the boss an its just whenever they feel like it. i felt like i wasnt cared for there that my position did not matter to the company
bad,"When I first started at Walmart it was a great place to work.  The longer I worked there the opportunities for advancement decreased, expectations increased without a commensurate raise in pay.  Inconsistent work schedule and poor management as well as the expectation of doing the work of two people."
bad,No retirement plan. Schedule could change at any time. No job security. Day to day events depend on the mood of upper management. A lot of mandatory extra days and hours.
bad,They dont care about their employees. They wouldnt let nobody go home when they are sick or accept any doctor excuse. They will work you to death. I did not likr working there because their manager has thd worse attitudes every... I hate when they was cutting people hours.
bad,Poor management.... How does cut time even that we didn't have time to cut when we didn't get things finished because of the employees that we managed didn't help out as much
bad,"I started as a front end supervisor and was in charge of breaks lunches and customer complaints at service desk. I would make sure the lines were maintained and under control. i would audit registers. i worked in various positions including cash office, balancing room, counting cash for the day  creating deposits and resetting bags for all registers and atm including self check outs. i worked as a photo specialist developing pictures. i work in back room checking in the vendors making sure inventory and invoice match , i also was a price verifier . i would find shrink fro the store and make sure managers were on top of their prices changes"
bad,its a dog eat dog world inside of walmart. Managers do what they want when they want and the fire you for anything if you are not friends with the managers.
bad,Management will constantly put you down because they're too incompetent. It seems as if you are being constantly overworked and do not receive any compliments or anything like that.
bad,"terrible work environment"
bad,Walmart is the worst company for anybody to work for. They treat their employees badly and if you speak up you get fired for it. Management was very lazy unknowledgeable of there areas. I worked for Walmart in Simi Valley Ca. as a service writer when I was hired I explained to Management that at the time of my employment I did not have a drivers license. I was told that would be no problem turned out the had no clue what they were talking about. 5 months later I was fired after myself and several co- workers complained about our treatment at the hands of management.
bad,most stressful job their is. stressful hours. takes forever to get any help. managers are nowhere to be found. pay is unbelievable . should really be making more.
bad,"Te sobre explotan, el sueldo esta muy mal pagado, a 17.40 la hora como cajero siendo el sueldo más alto por ser cajero."
bad,"Employees are treated as expendables; people were promoted beyond their capabilities because they were well liked, not because of their job performance"
bad,"I didn't like the environment the co-workers were nice, the management wasn't good , the demanded alot, didn't give much back one headache after another not worth it."
bad,Honestly I kid you not the CSM are filled with poo all they do is sit and gossip about cashiers. The management is awful look somewhere else for a job
bad,"Long stressful day, management was always never there always on smoke breaks. Having to deal with bad employees all the time. Always had to do the grunt work even though I was a customer service manager."
bad,Better management +happy associates =excellent customer service . Benefits don't kick in until after a year of stress and disrespect.  These employees deal with allot and are expected to act a certain way but management is horrible.
bad,Will never work there again management sucks..i would tell  any body to work there cause They don't care about there employee they have no respect in the company.
bad,"Todos los días en el trabajo habia una gerente que era grosera y despota con los trabajadores."
bad,They have gone downhill drastically.  Cut throat environment.  Mgrs. disrespect  you and talk/yell at you as if your a 2 year old.  No compassion!!!!!
bad,the lack of respect for their employees makes this place a terrible employer hard working hours with short breaks and terrible pay constant arguing between management and staff
bad,"Its not a bad place to work but hours not guaranteed, like you would have hours 2 weeks prior but next schedule drop you would be highly upset. I wouldn't reccomend the amite store"
bad,A day would start out stressful.  Never enough help and more work then people.  Management very clicky.  Culture was said but not lived. Hardest part was being on your feet after a 15 hour shift.  Most enjoyable was the people customers and employees you were able to meet.
bad,I would not recommend working for Wal-Mart at all. I felt like the managers were being promoted for the wrong reasons. The people that actually worked hard were being overlooked while those that did not work were promoted.
bad,"i had a horrible experience, worst company ever. The managers treated employees really unfairly. Will never work their again. The overnight manager by the name of kaseem freeman at conyers walmart need to be fired."
bad,I would not recommend Walmart to any one that has a family or pregnant because Walmart and their management team do not care at all. You can be on your sick bed and they will still go on about their business. Walmart does not take doctor excuse especially if your children are sick and management will not work with you
bad,"Walmart sucks, the managers do not know what they are doing unless they are told. To work at Walmart you need to be spineless."
bad,"temp job was only hired for the holiday, it was busy and crazy everyday. very unorganized  not very friendly. dysfunctional and not a very pleasant place to work around the holidays"
bad,Working at Walmart was a job that I wouldn't recommend to anyone but high school students or someone who isn't looking for a career advancement. The management team has very high power struggle issues..
bad,"You unload trailers all day and you do not know how many you are unloading, the hours are always shaky, the management was very not up to par, and they do not listen to the employees"
bad,"Co-workers were always started fights, one of mine kept trying to get me fired because I learned the job faster and more efficiently than he did. I was promised advancements which was always taken from at the last moment."
bad,I had a variety of problems working for this company because bottom line is the company in and of itself was just about the money and maximizing the profit
bad,"Bad managers, ridiculous policies, low pay, being forced to do things not in your job description. Being told one thing and then they do another. No support for management."
bad,"Horrible management "
bad,"Employees seem unhappy, unorganized, and unproductive. Company needs improvements in employees moral. It would be a fun place to work. Theirs hour are not long. Their pay is fair."
bad,"Got hired during holiday season, then transferred out to Lawn and Garden.  Because of the store's insistence on under hiring cashiers for the majority of the year, we'd get pulled to the front frequently to handle rushes of customers."
bad,One of worst jobs I've ever had. Pay is ridiculously low for amount of work. Almost impossible to survive on such low Pay. Treat employees more like cattle than human beings.
bad,Constant complaint and and cost cutting. Job duties change an increase constantly despite corporate polices against it. Management encourages rude and abusive customers.
bad,"Managers play favoritism and are extremely vulgar. Manger would allow new employees to clock in two hours before their shift was suppose to begin, but I was not able to clock in twenty minutes early."
bad,Bad manager and not very flexible on hours or sick days very bad benefits and work almost every holiday constantly switch days and hours you work very unhappy
bad,"Nonprofessional work setting."
bad,"Walmart was a very good company to work for,  but they are going more towards hiring young people for part-time positions so that they don't have to pay benefits."
bad,its a place where you must watch your back from other co workers and management they'll get in to your head and have you thinking your doing you're job and its supposed to be done by another member
bad,"The management is horrible  they didn't want to work with me because I had a miscarriage, so I had to take days off and they wouldn't accept my doctor notes"
bad,"terrible management, awful hours for a student, you don't get paid enough for what you have to deal with. if a manager doesn't like you, will cut your hours to an unlivable salary"
bad,Not bad first job but I wouldn't recommend working there for the long term. Manager us running the place down and runs the store like her own dictatorship.
bad,"i have learned while being here is:"
bad,"Don't do it. Walmart is a cult. They will control every aspect of your life, and demand 100% loyalty, but show almost none in return. They are nearly always deceptive, frequently lying outright, and do not care one iota about your personal life. They will act like they do occasionally, but it is all superficial. Lots of politics and long hours."
bad,"I worked at the Wlamart in Dillon, SC and the management there is terrible. Hated going into work everyday. At this store favoritism is shown too much, and you will get coached for the craziest reasons. Did not enjoy working here the year that I did."
bad,"Typical day at work was fast-paced."
bad,"The don't appreciate  their hard workers. "
bad,"Superama no es buena empresa para trabajar, hoy en dia en sus tiendas tiene gerentes y subgerente con poco profesionalismo"
bad,"Depending upon the day and who you are working with defines ones day. Management was not the greatest, and never took the time for the employees. Fast, and hard..."
bad,"This company is awful. From the ceo down, no advancement, no benefits. The store management does not care about employees. Corporate only cares if you do not get a bonus."
bad,"Horrible customers. Your manager is never there, and never listens to those under him. The pay is alright, but everything else is just bad. they dont train you correctly and you have to learn learn on the job."
bad,The management were very very disrespectful towards their associates. Slavery was a better word with an invisible whip. Working conditions were terrible
bad,"Wal-Mart is a decent store overall to shop.  I would not recommend the job place for anyone to work. They don't give good hours, and they do not have good benefits."
bad,"At first i loved my job after about 7 years things change for the worst for the hourly associates and the management. I figure it was best for them (home office, store managers) definitely not hourly associates they took away everything we earn, holiday pay, they change three weeks paid vacation to pto time which was less the raises were fifty and sixty cents a year to a percentage so you'll be lucky if you get ten cents some associates got nothing, you use to get paid time in a half on holiday's i could go on but what's the point Im on to bigger things to come"
bad,management sucked no hours and min pay also we wer over worked and yelled at by numerous customers .. management was never around and always angry! Walmart sucked
bad,"I clock in. After I clock in I go to retrieve my returns for my department, which is never less than a full basket. After that I work out the basket, help customers, and zone the area."
bad,Pay is terrible. Managament is terrible. No time off. Hours are inconsistent. Dress code is irrational and almost impossible to abide by. Generally bad place to work.
bad,I would tell anyone thinking about working for this company to not do it unless they have no other options and it is a last ditch effort to pay their bills
bad,Walmart does not accept doctors notes or make exceptions for worker's compensation claims. I have worked for Walmart  for almost 3 years and they always promote the lazy people who don't do anything and then do less after they're promoted.
bad,I would not recommend this work environment for any one. Working 7 or 8 days straight. Not being able to ask off for any holidays or weekends. Being threaten regular about job placement. Management has horrible work ethic and has no respect for employees. I have struggles with school because they didn't care about my school schedule. I missed many family events and school activities due to lack of staff. This place had the highest turn over rate.
bad,"over work their employees."
bad,"Trabajar como cajero es lo peor, ya que son muy horas para estar de pie, te negrean siempre, ni un minuto de descanso, y cuando eres hombre te sacan al acomodo de carritos de autoservicio con un solazo y que decir de su disque cultura, ni la respetan, los gerentes son muy prepotentes, hablan de calidad de vida siempre en fin puro cuento chino... esta empresa lo que quiere son esclavos....."
bad,I would not recommend this place for anyone to work at. This place does not care about their employees. And if you have a child and are a single parent. This is definitely  not the job for you.
bad,"Horrible pay, treat workers unfairly, say that it's not about favoritism but if you dont kiss their butts they wont even acknowledge you. Highschool mentality all over, managers don't know how to come correct and properly talk to you because they sit on their high horse. I learned that a successful company can be the most stingiest"
bad,"Poor management"
bad,This was the worst place I have ever worked. employees were not treated good and there was not any good benefits. it would be okay for a part time job.
bad,A typical day is go to work have a meeting clean the store and be miserable. I learned not to work there. Management was not that good..The hardest part was not getting upset
bad,not a fun place to work really poor managent i would not recommend working at walmart for any one. the only good thing about working at walmart was the discounts.
bad,It would get bad to keep wanting to go back when management did not seem to care about their employees. The customers were easy since most are human and just help.
bad,"Wal-Mart is the worst place in the United States of America to work. First, they tell you, that you are only working part time, but quickly move you to 40+ hours a week. You are allowed 2 15 minute breaks per shift and 1 hour for lunch. You are approched by multiple managers daily, asking about your day and so forth. They all have a different opinions of how things should be run."
bad,This position I did not enjoy at all. Management was not nice to work for. Our jobs were micro managed and the staff were not friendly at all. The training fr new employees was just not there
bad,They over work their employees and have no understanding of life. under paid and left to do the job of a manager yet paid at a entry level. the business or store is so unorganized
bad,"Unqualified management who date each other. "
bad,Lack of management skills. Do not care about employees. Not enjoyable. They ask you to work overtime then get angry that you have over time. Do not work here
bad,"Managers were very rude. Even when you gave them your schedule they would schedule you outside that schedule as they saw fit especially around holidays. The pay was horrible. They advertise that they raised wages but only after requiring people to work certain hours, reducing benefits, reducing overnight differential, and cutting other corners that affect the lower staff."
bad,Walmart was fun at first until customers started being rude. Late on giving me breaks. Was never allowed to call off for any emergency's. I tried to get more hours and they didn't let me.
bad,"Treats the employees bad, and the breaks are short and so are the lunches, they don't work will with the schedule, and top it off the management is bad"
bad,"I didn't work at Walmart long, but it was the worst job experience I've ever had. I have health issues that make it hard to stand for a full shift. They didn't make any accommodations for it. They sometimes forgot breaks. They made taking a lunch break hard. The managers would forget when someone is supposed to go on their break."
bad,Probably not the best person to ask about this.  I had a workers comp accident that was poorly managed.  It's amazing to see how people are promoted not for their ability to do the job at hand but by which derriere they are willing to kiss.
bad,norco is not a great place to work there is no one to go to when there is a problem because we are just working gor norco in a place like amazon warehouse
bad,"Working at walmart was like a reality TV show, the camera was always rolling on you and there was a boss on the other end of the camera praying that you would take more than 30 seconds to get from the register to the time clock so he could come out and yell at you."
bad,"One week you would get 40+ hours and the next you would get 10. There was not job stability and, people that need time off are not given reasonable amount of time off."
bad,I worked for walmart on and off for nearly 5 years. Horrible management lots of favoritsm over all not a company I would suggest working for they treat their employees terribly
bad,worst place ive ever worked at. the managers are inconsiderate and they dont do their job but expect you to finish your task properly without the proper training
bad,"I would never recommend anyone I love or care about to work at Walmart. They are the most unfair and discriminatory company I have ever worked for, Management is very unwilling to help out and the ""open door policy"" is a total joke."
bad,"I worked at Walmart for few months. the job itself was not fun. I had to stock shelves, greet people and run cashier. some people at work were very lazy so I got stuck doing double the work."
bad,Management does not communicate there is constantly problems with my schedule and availability as well as other associates not doing their job and management not doing anything about it
bad,"it paid my bills..... awful place to work for, the phrase, throw you to the wolves about sums it up.  more management, poor work hours,poor accomadations."
bad,Management at Wal-Mart were not customer focused just task focused.  It was hard to get support to cover the front end if you had to get on a register.
bad,"Terrible uncaring management, low pay, no room for advancement without brown nosing. Benefits are bad since the elimination of the gold program, weak staff discount."
bad,"Walmart is a very unprofessional work place. they do not follow there company policies, nor there strict dress code. the store is always dirty, and the associates along with staff are very rude and unprofessional. the management is lazy and they don't help satisfy customer needs."
bad,"Wasted time and resources from all employees. No flexibility, unhappy staff. Dirty and old equipment. Overall not a positive experience for my first job."
bad,"I did not enjoy working a walmart, i was not treated fairly and the mangement was not very good at there job. I would never recommend working a walmart to anyone."
bad,"If you want to go to college, Walmart is not the job for you because they do not work with YOUR hours. You can get in a car accident and WALMART, will be like "" you still coming to work though, right?""."
bad,This place was awful to work for and I would not recommend to any one except high school or college students.  The management was hands off and only spoke to you when something went wrong
bad,the management team constantly cut down hours to 8 hours a week because they didn't have enough hours to give out even though they were under staffed and they were very rude and inconsiderate when i practically begged for more hours and all they could tell me was i shouldn't be in school if i want more than 8 hours
bad,This was the worst company I have ever worked for.  The management plays favoritism and does not judge anything fairly.  I was terminated and then asked to stay to finish my shift if that states anything.
bad,They treat you like dirt because you are in an entry level position. They have you do an impossible task and when it cant be completed its all your fault. They dont care for your well being and will have you do anything to get the job done.
bad,"The managers are really bossy, and they have a really bad Attitude to the workers. They dont do anything, and hardly see the, on the floor, they are hated by the customers and workers. The workers work themselfs to death, while the managers do not do anything."
bad,was happy to gain experience from them they have the wildest customers they offer very low prices they do not excuse medical doctors appointment or dentist appointment
bad,Set hours snotty managers drama fueled co workers and terrible pay no benefits and if you quit you'll never be rehired as if you were fired. Better as a temporary income not a career
bad,The management was aweful. Undertrained. Unclear tasks. Very hostile environment. Woukdnt recomend anyone to work here. It isnt worth my time definitely underpaid.
bad,nothing is organized they change your position all the time they are always low on staff they overwork everyone and are very disrespectful they to not care about you health or life.
bad,Nothing positive to say about this company.  Walmart treats their employees terrible.  No consistency.  If you're a favorite you can do anything.  If you're not than be prepared to get in trouble all the time.
bad,You are put under such stress and worry about making sure your manager doesn't get in trouble for getting the work done. Its very stressful and a lot of gossip between employees.
bad,"It's basic retail. boring and monotonous, til you make decent money. then they want you out. You can change departments and shifts easily, but it's pretty much all the same. It's easy to get promoted, but the pay isn't worth the headache."
bad,Subir sueldo que el trabajo sea bien remunerado  que  horario no sea tan extensoWww
bad,their only care was production and just made it look as if they did anything about safety health or the welfare of the people that worked there. they were all about being a retailer and that is not in the good way
bad,The pay is low and when they promote with a new job title only more responsibility with very very low increase in pay. After Christmas they slash your hours to 26 hours a week. Hard to pay bills when you are used to a 40 hour a week paycheck.
bad,"Stressful, management only cares about numbers, fellow employees back-stab and try to get other employees in trouble, never know what is going to happen from day to day."
bad,Complete lack of care for their employees. Not much room for advancement. Most crew members don't want a job so if you happen to be the one good employee you are going to somehow end up in trouble for everything that DIDN'T get done reguardless of how much you tried.
bad,"Very poor customer service, with very little employees to work at registers, extend wait time in check out lines due to very few registers open. Benefits are great with the longer you stay with the company"
bad,"If you lick boots youll go far, if you dont they get rid of you.  Was fired one week before my wedding they dont care about the associaes they only care about their paychecks."
bad,"a good first time job only, not much help when you fist start off. Staff minds own business and not very helpful. no benefits or chance to advance or pay advancement."
bad,"Ever since sam past away, the company just been falling. Its all about money and nothing else. Don't even waste time shopping there, high turnover rate and more"
bad,Working at this company is an eye opener. Total train wreck. You have people in departments making out on shift while working. Disappearing Management when waiting for a final check at night sometimes waiting 45 minutes. All about sales and getting people to apply for mastercards. I worked here for a month and left. This walmart puts the fun in dysFUNctional. Wow
bad,"Never have i ever had such a bad/unprofessional work experience as i did when i worked for wal mart, Employees are mistreated and talked down to like they are criminals."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job were the few good customers who came in. I enjoyed interacting with the regular shoppers."
bad,"Not enough hours, but the coworkers were friendly and the work environment was fair. Great discounts, but the insurance wasn't acceptable. I would recommend this for someone who was able to work physically."
bad,"Micromanagement by my 4+ managers"
bad,They get all zeros. They are an un oraganized company the one in hood  is the worse far as customer service and finding someone to help and lines are always long no matter what and not enough employees on front end
bad,The management was horrible. Everyone was treated like trash. Unless of course you made 100k a year. Then you got treated like you were on a pedi stool.
bad,"management was rude, no one knew what to do, and no promise of full time work.workplace was nice, but unknowledgeable. no real hard part of the job. enjoyable part was leaving."
bad,The management is horrible they refuse to accept hospital and doctors notes for time out. They also fire employees prior to them transferring positions out of vendettas. And when notified of an employees threatened miscarriage they still require u to work and then fire u when u prove u can't at the time. Horrible management and horrible policies
bad,They treat they employees very unfairly they are giving less and less benefits and they are very disrespectful to their employees and they let customers treat you in any way they want to
bad,"Would like to speak one on one about this. Had alot of things happen I didn't see coming, and still don't understand. I learned alot and felt I put 100% into my position everyday."
bad,I do not want to work for this place again. They offer almost no benefits but expect the best from you daily. Most of the pharmacists that I've worked with have all left.
bad,"as long as you go to work, do what is told and expect to not get help doing it. Often too short on staffing in all of the difficult and important areas"
bad,"Management was not willing to work with any work/home conflicts. Management also changed schedules after originals were posted and failed to contact employees to inform of changes. Wages were on the low end to begin with and after 3 month reviews, no additional wage increases were given. Co-workers were rude to new hires and treated majority of them disrespectfully."
bad,i became very ill and at one point i tried to explain to them what was going on. i even ended up in the hospital. they fired me because i was a liability. i will never work for them again and i do not even shop there anymore.
bad,"walmart is a terrible company to work for, i cant believe that i work there for so long if i was you i suggest that you dont work there at all for your own sake"
bad,"If you don't kiss butt.you go no where.if you work hard and they don't like you no promotions.they will hold you back especially if you are a threat, meaning you are smart enough to take there job.also so you can't advance in walmart they will put a target on your back and then fire you.they keep the lazy,thieving bums,but get ride of the hard worker that want to build a career."
bad,This is probably the worst company that I have ever worked for.  The management was very shady and tricky.  The job was never consistent with what my title was.  I never received any benefits.
bad,"I really genuinely enjoyed this job at first. Met a lot of wonderful people and loads of friends! The stocking was super fun too! But all this went bad when new management came into play. Unfortunately, it made a majority of people quit. The store manager was very fond of this new manager and didn't really take action against any thing they did."
bad,I haven't be treated well there  manger  and co workers was disrespectful and I have trying change positions and they said they don't have any and lie to me about it
bad,Walmarts problem are deep rooted and will not change overnight. Not one manager is on the same page and advancement only comes to those that are friends of assistant managers. Jobs are posted but no interviews are done because they have already given the position to who they have chosen to have it. The front end employees are underpaid and over worked. Not enough cashiers are scheduled to work and no one has very many hours and the schedules change all the time sometimes the sameday with no notice
bad,"Walmart is a okay job, just do your job and go home"
bad,The job is horrible the mangers not fair they have Each Other side I would never pick a job like this again I would not even let my kids work there for They frist job
bad,"The bad attitudes of the managers made Walmart a stressful place to work. I was under paid, and over worked at Walmart. I was expected to do the work of four employees by myself, and the managers couldn't understand why I wasn't getting things done in a timely fashion."
bad,"Walmart is horribly run through all levels of management. Employees could care less about getting work done , supervisors are never around and do their own thing , and the other higher ups sit around giving orders of all kinds regardless of the position title."
bad,"Would never recommend working here. Customers are especially rude and managers are not as helpful or effective as they should be, with the exception of a select few. Policies are ridiculous and Walmart will take any and all opportunities to come out on top, to the detriment of the customers and employees. Overall poor experience."
bad,Management looks down to you asks you to perform completely unreasonable tasks and refuses to even so much as accept you as a fellow human being.  I will never in my life work for them again and I urge others not to apply.  Seriously if its between working there and sleeping under a bridge take the bridge it wont talk down to you at least.
bad,Stressful and not a healthy environment to work. people work. I personally had a bad experience working there and will never recommend. Managers are rude and staff are so lazy
bad,"Not a good company to work for. they will work you hard until you complain or get injured, then you are gone!"
bad,"Walmart from the start was not a enjoyable job for me and got worse with time from disagreements with management and a lack of professionalism they had in situations made it a place I didn't want to work at. There was lots of arguments over equipment with management and other co-workers, and some really rude customers. The environment at Walmart was really toxic for me and not good for my health."
bad,"When transferring to another location, it takes months. Still waiting.. I usually have to resign before applying for another job with Wal-Mart. Other than that, I enjoyed working with new people.."
bad,it's all about them making money not about people that work for them. pay was horrible you can barely pay your bills when you ask for a raise for working hard they say you get a discount how can I use it if I can even make bills
bad,"Even though you're only in one department they make you go to others you have no idea on where things are or anything. Then they give you just enough hours to keep you under full time. And since you arent full time on paper or officially you cant get benefits. They even give you 4 hour shifts to get you to work all week with no days off. I worked in the salinas, ca on n. Davis"
bad,do yourself a big favor and do not work for this company every thing they tell you is a lie managers either dont know or give you some completely un do able task beause you still have to interact with customers then you get bludgeoned and threatened because you couldnt meet ther needs
bad,"- a typical day at work:  Long"
bad,"Fast paced most of the time, I learned that all management is not fare. The workplace is filed with diverse cultures, I enjoyed helping the customers and putting a smile on their face.  The hardest part of the job was the changing work hours without prior notice."
bad,stressful unfair management. mostly phillipenoshated. unloading trucks liked  the customers didn't like the hours never had  weekends off  that's alll
bad,the managers are unprofessional and treat employees poorly. they never made me happy to be there. the store number is 5882. managers and support managers try to make you stay late and deprive you of breaks.
bad,"extremely stressful"
bad,"No existen planes de trabajo, descripción de puesto, un plan de control, limites, alcances, ayudas visuales, diagramas de flujo ante operación o problemas, equipo de protección personal, etc."
bad,Walmart needs to do a better job with better management I've never seen in such a horrible place their management team shows so much favoritism it's crazy if you're not kissing their butts they won't have anything to do with you if one of your family members get sick they don't care but if they family is sick it's okay they leave work and do whatever they want to I would not recommend anybody working here who has kids because Walmart is not very family oriented
bad,"There where multiple situations that mad it unbearable to work for them. They are unfair to there employees, even the ones that have been there for years will tell you they are a awful place to work for. It is sad to have to go to work every day dreading what chaos or bad environment you would be walking into next."
bad,The management is so bad. Most of them don't do they jobs in the time given. They always talk down on me as if I'm nothing and when I ask for help with a problem they refuse to help or even give me a solution. They make going to work so hard.
bad,a lot of training hands on not computer base and stop having favorable associates over others. I liked it when walmart was in mamou which was closer to my house I dnt like to travel one hour away just to go to work
bad,There isn't much I can say about working here since it has been several years. What I do remember is that I hated it. They expect you to work weird hours and if you live a couple of towns away like I did then you were out of luck if they decided they wanted you to work for 4 hours.
bad,I worked as a cashier and customer service ad a people greater at the entrance hardest part of the job was working holidays it was busy and management were rude.
bad,Worked in multiple departments. Worked very flexible hours. Had amazing customer service skills. Worked hard to move up to management was told after two years Im not qualified.
bad,Stressful depending on who you work. improper training for employees so you have to learn things on your own. Unfair treatment of employees if you need something done
bad,Walmart is nothing like the commercials an a bad place to work for an the mangers only give hours to the ones the favors even if you work your tail off for them
bad,"Highly unprofessional work environment, little to no positive communication in terms of addressing concerns with management. Always have work to do but issues are not handled accordingly when brought to management."
bad,aprendi e desenvolvi muito nas areas de desenvolvimento da empresa .
bad,"Always have to be looking for problems with other people, very stressful and cut throat attitudes with most managers. Front end assistant manager is rude, and demeaning towards customers and employees alike."
bad,"I like working there, but staffs wasn't every nice and some of the employees want either.  I learned how to run the register and greet the customers, and learn stocking. It was a easy job. Talking to the customers. I t wasn't a hard job. the management wasn't nice they never say you did good, but they would say if did a bad job."
bad,"I worked there for a short time and from the start I was harassed and made out to be stupid by managers.  The store manager allowed it, and so I quit."
bad,I would not recommend working at Walmart to anyone. The management at this store is very unprofessional. When you change your availability because of your kids they don't like to approve it.
bad,The customers and working on Black Friday were the best part of the job. You never knew what a customer would do or say to get an advantage during those Black Friday sales
bad,"every day would be a same regular day at walmart, i honest learned a few things from walmart like codes for the products and a opportunity to work there."
bad,"Walmart talks a good game, until your hired. Management has their picks, they say they have an open door policy, that's not true. They teach you unions are bad. If your manager is having a bad day you are too."
bad,It was a job i worked for about six or seven months. Good pay Great benefits there. Fast past business the hardest part about working here is the clean up part.
bad,"MGT Sucks, none of the employees are friendly, no-one cleans up messes, and worst of all, everyone is not treated equal, you either gotta be in a ""click"" or suffer the horrible things that's management does towards you like working alone and assisting multiple customers with no help. everyone i worked with blew off customers. its a horrible experience there. PLUS i worked in garden center, you don't just water flowers and be done with it, you drown them until they are dead. Walmart doesn't care about there garden center at all!!!"
bad,"It is as I said you work long hours, job is physically and mentally punishing. Management is not appreciative of anything you do. The more you produce the more they expect. The goal is to get as much work and job titles out of each associate as humanly possible but the treatment not so humane."
bad,I think this is a great company to work for it's just the management could be a little better. They need to put something together for there employees in some type of appreciation
bad,"I truly feel you need a thick skin to be a Walmart employee. The unpleasant work environment included long monotonous shifts, rude customers and management. 0/10 recommend."
bad,Management over works the associates with little pay. No overtime pay. No holiday pay. No flexibly with schedules. Poor fairness with distributing hours. Overall nightmare to work as an hourly associate.
bad,worst company to work for.. no appreciation. no communication. no respect for others. no training. the management is horrible their very rude and they talk down to you. they  promote you then expect you to learn everything on your own> they move you to different departments while they are still a mess and expect you to clean it up and still do all your task theres no help what so ever. tooo much favoritism!!! if you haven't worked there for years and if you don't get along with the right clicks there then you won't make it>>
bad,The work itself was not bad however management made life horrible. You got wrote up for petty issues...like an upside down bag of marshmallows. Worked 3rd shift grocery stocker
bad,"I can only summarize my experience at Walmart by saying it is literally just a very poorly organized circus, continiously preaching values of respect and communication only to practice those values the least."
bad,i hate working for this store they are nasty the treat maintenance crew like they are slaves. They don't care if customers comes in the restrooms while you're cleaning
bad,Management treat the associates like that are beneath them. The store is disorganized . The store is filthy and unbearable to work in . They have all types of sexually harassment going on round the store with managers.
bad,"Managers don't kno what they doing. Over work employees, don't hire enough employees to get a job done correctly. Don't pay there employees enough for the work they give. Managers dont want to listen to employees when it's the employees that kno what's best for the customers."
bad,"I would never recommend working at Walmart, managers did not respect or appreciate employees hard work. Store managers were unfair with employees and took out work related issues on employees."
bad,I didn't like working with Walmart because I feel they don't really care about their associates and most of the higher workers can be rude. They don't respect when an associate is on break or lunch.
bad,treat employees terrible and always late for there breaks and lunches. The front end supervisor  is over worked everyday without  andiquite assugnments
bad,"Wealthiest company in the world, yet they pay their employees like they are the poorest company in the world. They do not care about their employees, will not let you get any overtime, and if you are going to go into overtime for the week, they will make you take longer lunches."
bad,My typical day at work consisted of me starting off in the department I was placed in. To being moved all around the store because other departments was slacking. I learned that when working for that particular store if they know that you have good work ethics they will abuse you more than trying to get the people that doesn't work at all. Management was the worst. We had an open door policy where an employee could come to management and talk to them about what ever problem they have and anything that was discussed is kept between them. I did an open door once and all my business was spread around the store and highly exaggerated. My job was pretty much easy I had a lot of down time so I didn't mind helping in other departments as long as my work was done first. There wasn't anything enjoyable about this job.
bad,You cannot get over 32 hours unless you know a manager personally. They cater to that have been there longer way too much. I can understand seniority but not to this extreme.
bad,never again will I ever work for Walmart unless its the only choice at the time. I dont personally like being *aped by the fat cats in the ivory tower. They are utter bs.
bad,"This working environment was stressful and the pay did not match the amount of work expected. There is no support by the management team, which leaves you feeling even more stressed."
bad,"Would highly recommend working anywhere else in the world. Walmart is a whole other ball park of work. Never in my life have I seen a company run this way and it is more than understandable why the turnover rate is so high. For so many reasons... please do not work at any walmart, anywhere."
bad,Well was little bet of fun.well it was another day at work and a lot of tress. But I learn to work with costumers and be alert how to be work along in the department.
bad,This was the worst job I ever had. I was treated awful. The manager never did their job and was not capable of answering any questions the employees had.
bad,Depending on your location will determine the type of experience you have with this particular company. The best thing about the job is the 10% discount
bad,the managers didnt care what was goiong on in your personal life. they dont except doctors notes when you are out they are very harsh and they dont gove you any leway for anything
bad,The main problem at the walmart I worked at was lack of communication with their employees.  No respect for their employes.  I didnt look forward work
bad,Didn't really learn anything. Managers was always negative. Not a nice environment to be in as an employee. Was always blammed for something or anything I didn't do.
bad,you are  number to this company the benefits are awful an the managers are hateful an rude i will never work for Walmart again i have worked at 3 different one they are all alike.
bad,Worked me just under full time so I didnt get benefits. Management was rude and ignorant. Wouldn't recommend to anyone unless they got the tolerance for the rude people.
bad,I think that it is very racist and did not give me a chance to advance. I really have nothing to say about this company wish I did not have to shop there.
bad,"I worked in the Walmart deli for a long enough time to say that this was the worst experience I've ever had, and definitely the worst one, in terms of the quality of the clientele.  In addition, the managerial staff simply seemed not to care for their employees, at all.  They would often times come over, however, simply to say that you will be covering someone else's closing shift.  The managerial staff didn't seem to care about looking into any customer discrepancies either, as they would immediately after hearing from the customer, coach the employee in question, without trying to hear their side of the story.  This job is a high-volume job (people quit often) as it doesn't pay enough to deal with the kind of, antagonistic, patrons the employees face every single day."
bad,"Walmart managers misinform staff about work schedules as well as blindly take the customer's side of the argument without any proper evidence, customers often antagonize the staff, most often, without provocation (they are having a bad day).  Overall, Walmart's Delicatessen in Waukesha is a horrible place to work, for too many reasons to state."
bad,This was not the ideal position for me. I wanted a position in management and I kept getting part-time work as a cashier. The atmosphere was not a match either.
bad,the only great thing they have to offer is the fellow employees and the customer interacctions. the management team was horrible. I woulod never work for them again
bad,"No benefits, Pay was very low, management doesn't work well, short break/lunches, no full time positions, work load was not worth the pay, no consistent schedules."
bad,"not working with your times off or vacation, hard at getting promoted and the pay wasnt there not the best place to work for but an alright place to start working when you get out of high school."
bad,"It's a cut-throat place full of favoritism and butt kissing. If a manager doesn't like you, you're screwed. Their open door policy is a joke and is more likely to lead to a coaching than a problem being fixed."
bad,I was an overnight stocker employee. Nobody cared about anyone else. Morale was always low.  I did not learn anything new. Management was not the best to the employees either.
bad,"I was warned, will not recommend. There was lack of communication in a very big way , I was terminated per failed evaluation from 2 managers whom were new and had not been there my whole experience."
bad,Walmart will suck the life out of you. Don't let them see that are a hard work because they will abuse you. The people that hardly are do anything are the ones that get promoted
bad,"I wouldn't even recommend my enemy to work here, terrible management, treat their employees awful. No follow through with raises and moving departments"
bad,"Political ties among the managers and certain employees made this a terrible place to work,  understaffed causing write ups for going into overtime.  Employees were quick to vanish when needed most"
bad,They treat there employees horribly and the only Syu to move up is to make friends with the right people.. your work ethic and job function have nothing to dom with your advancement.
bad,"10 hour days, too high of productivity standards, hard physical job, management isn't very professional. Insurance isn't the greatest for being a huge corporation.  "
bad,"When I worked at wal mart there were way too many bosses telling you to do 8 different things, make end caps, stock this isle, go to the front register. give this person a break etc. and you have no idea who to listen to"
bad,""" it is what it is '' a famous quote used by most manager at Walmart when something is brought to there attention and they don't feel like even attempting to fix it."
bad,If you want to work hard and advance in a career be ready to be disappointed. If you are lazy and hide in the bathroom 30 minutes at a time surfing the internet then you found your home away from home. If you are in the habit of helping yourself to things that don't belong to you then you found your heaven.
bad,I really hated this place. I worked really hard there and was cut short of time because of my daughters medical issues . the hours were terrible and the management was rude
bad,Walmart is nothing like it's suppose to be . I disliked the managers they are so unprofessional. Cursing each other out etc . They employees don't even respect the managers . They have favorites who they let do whatever they want .
bad,i loved everything about Wal-Mart. i loved working with people. there was no hard part of my job. the people were great.i was allowed free rein to do my job. people made it easy to
bad,I was on leave for three months and they pulled the mold filled produce off the shelf and left it sit in the back room for the entire month until i returned instead of throwing it out they left it for me.
bad,"expect too much for minimum wage. expected me to do managerial work regularly, covering shifts ect, and refused to give me a promotion or raise for the 2 years I did CSM work."
bad,"needs new management, workers act like they own the company cant find help when you need it most every one of the workers are rude, and try to put there work off on someone else. never no more than 2 registers open beside the self checkout. new management might help."
bad,The companies current focus and vision clashes with its core beliefs. They have steadily lost its respect for employees and continue to reduce hours to the work force expecting the same work to be done.
bad,"I didn't like my job at Walmart, Management  didn't treat there employees very well.  I learned a lot.  it was my first time using a cash register.  i met a lot of people working at Walmart that was the best part of my job."
bad,"Good for teens going to school, not a life choice. Management team needs lots of work as well of be more for their employees instead of them selves . not a fun environment to work in."
bad,Management leads with their egos and with their integrity. Great pay but don't plan on getting recognized for your hard work.Wouldn't go back or recommend.
bad,"I was pregnant when i worked here, they denied me maternity leave telling me i had to quit and be rehired. i was then rehired at a dollar less than my previous pay. would never work here again."
bad,They dont have any cares about your family life. If you are a single person there is no way you could pay your bills and work here as they dont have flexablity in their hours for you to have a second job.
bad,the managers where rude. The atmosphere was uncomfortable and the customers were awful. It was a good first job but after a while the place started to go bad
bad,"no full time possibilities, irresponsible management, promotion for  predators but not hard workers. discount isn't worth it, no health care options, bare minimum pay, wont work with your schedule."
bad,"the wages are very poor, I've been there for 5 years and i only make 12.50. you get a 2% pay raise once a year. there is no incentives to work hard at this store."
bad,Not a bad place to work but the downside is the benefits do not come in they are not worth the job in the stress everyone there is so competitive it's not even funny Plus on top of that they hardly ever hire full-time and if you're wanting to become an assistant manager or some type of management or customer service you have to have experience and they hardly ever hire out of job you actually have to be working there to get that and it is hard because everyone there has favoritism if you do not make friends or know the right people you're going nowhere with the company
bad,"With a combination of favoritism and policy violations this is the worst job I've ever dealt with, coming from someone that was robbed at a different job."
bad,"I loved what I did and that's why I am thankful for the opportunity but the company and workers have a lot to learn about how to treat each other. Sadly, I don't forsee changes being made in the near future."
bad,company close shortly after I left .  ok to work for but out of my way. it was a good learning experience. but would not want to work that far again..
bad,I don't even know where to start. The management is contradictory. You are asked and expected to work outside of your job descriptions. You are discouraged from filing accident reports. They do not always use proper FIT or FILO when rotating perishable inventory. If you are asked to stay late to help out you will be forced to cut hours at the end of the week to prevent overtime. I can continue but there is little point.  Do not work here... and avoid shopping here if you can.
bad,A typical day as a department manager at walmart consist of taking care of the customer and processes. I enjoy helping customers espcially the elderly.
bad,Don't work at winder Wal-Mart in the deli dept. Nothing but drama and no hours unless you kiss assssss.my experience there was horrible. Girls always lying starting drama.anuba the manager she's right along with it.and the bakery manager to.
bad,Is a different kind of world. Its hard to walk anywhere in there off the clock and not have people harassing you just because you are wearing Walmart dress codes colors. Taught me a lot about how rude people are.
bad,"not flexible. leadership was poor and would often be left to my own devices to figure things out. pay is minimum wage or slightly more."
bad,"Management has no clue on how to manage or treat their employees. They make it clear from when you start your nothing more than an expendable pawn. Instead of working to solutions they tell you what you've done wrong and nothing else, leaving employees clueless on how to fix mistakes. Not only have they lost my respect they’ve lost my business."
bad,"Horrible place to work! Management could care less aout you or any other associates. CSM's take their jobs to their heads big time also! Time off is like asking them to pull teeth , its almost ALWAYS denied!"
bad,"I really dislike Walmart as an employee and the staff as well. Horrible  management, wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless it was the last resort.  If you like being overworked and under-payed Walmart is the place to be."
bad,"The relationship between workers and management was not conducive to a positive work environment. There was very little communication. Additionally, the customers were the worst I have ever had to deal with."
bad,"Walmart Was My Second Job i Started When There Was Only Shelves No Customers Or Anything I Helped Stock The Shelves , The Labeling And Everything . I Meet New People Almost Everyday '& I Love To Communicate And Interact With People As Well ."
bad,"This company know exactly when to let you go so you are ineligible to collect unemployment benefits. They do not reward employee loyalty. They will let you go, then say you can re-apply in 30 days. This keeps you from accumulating benefits through unemployment. DO NOT fall for their deceptive practices. They WILL lie to you!"
bad,I enjoyed the employees I worked with but the company overloads the pharmacist and underpays the pharmacy technicians. We were expected to work for minimum wage pay while taking on way too many tasks.
bad,"bad company, horrible managers, bad policies. Treats employees like overworked dogs. Refuses to give any off time, and not even a cheap place to shop."
bad,The management was not good. I worked graveyard and was basically a bunch of kids and the manger was not experienced at all. Just some one who moved up the ladder.
bad,"Management was not stable. I didn't like the work environment, loved working one on one with customers but walmart management was always worried about shelves being stocked instead,"
bad,Where to even start. I started out likeing the job and it quickly went to down hill!  You have to have an open schedule to even vet hours and the second you close it. You are lucky to even get 4 hours a week.
bad,I learned how to use the cash registers how to stock clothes and how to do inventory and returns. I got interact with all races and cultures. The work demand was consistent without much change.
bad,i hated working for walmart i got fired for turning my boss in with her boss and they lied about it and patted charges against me so i get fired. managment only cares about themself
bad,"Management is terrible. My work schedule fluctuated every week. There was one week where I was not scheduled at all. I called in to inquire about it and was told that the schedule is final. When I arrived at work the next week, I was scolded for not being at work or trying to pick up hours. The job was very inconsistent."
bad,"They cross train you in everything, and make you do everything for a low pay, and the people are not nice at all. They hang in groups, so you can imagine any worker in a group with a manager is shown favoritism."
bad,"its a great place to shop not so great of a place to work the store i worked at is one of them"
bad,Walmart is not a fun place to work. Associates make fun of each other and put others down worst than a high school bully. Management shrugs off any request to make complaints against inappropriate harassment or harassment in general. They do not hold anyone accountable for their actions and they let the best and hard working associates walk out the door without batting an eye.
bad,"worst place ive ever worked. Started off with 40 hours a week and got cut to 8 hours a week. Drs, notes are not accepted while working there and management was not flexible with circumstances."
bad,Management never has a clear goal from day to day on what needs to be completed. If the shift before you leaves a mess and you walk into it you clean it up plus do your job.
bad,"Management sucked, didn't want to give enough hours. Never approved PTO or requested days, very rude attitudes not strong on policy. Very lazy people working in the store."
bad,they pretty much expect you t do everything for little to no pay. hard to move up or even be recognized for hard work. of course this was years ago but i'm pretty sure its still the same. crabs in a buckt mentality at this place.
bad,No job security. There is a lot of backstabbing and fighting to get to the top. Consistent unethical behavior from supervisors. No respect for individuals. Consistent retaliation for associates that utilize the open door policy.
bad,Worked at wal-mart through college. Very poor work environment. Very unorganized and management was rude and very uncomfortable to work around. Was a very stressful work environment.
bad,"Management is a nightmare, policies are ignored until they become relevant to a visit from market or corporate management. Stresses are placed on the associates to just accomplish the jobs they are given with little to no direction or instruction."
bad,Some of the people who work for walmart are very good people who need work but for all the hard work that is done it is not recognized nor is it appreciated.  The only people who get paid is upper management.  And as a manager you were told to get another manager to make the call on issues.  So being a middle manager meant nothing.  Your word was nothing it was always about the customer even if they were standing there calling you a thief or a liar or any other name they could think of.
bad,"The experience of working with Wal-Mart's company was not so good. Their company is falling down the drain I worked at Wal-Mart in Fayetteville Arkansas and they was so rude and disrespectful to their customers. I was an over night stalker and I worked with a lot of people most of the workers would tell customers to ""back off"" and ""leave them alone and find it yourself"". I can't work with a company with so much hate!"
bad,"Work was challenging and very fast paced.  Managment does not apprecidate associates and the job they do.  It is hard to be promoted and you are always asked to do more, which I don't necessarily mind but not having the ""hey great job, you did excellent,"" pat on the back was very frustrating to someione who is a perfectionist."
bad,There are pros and cons but the cons out way the pros by miles! You go out of your way to do a job well done and even though you reach your goals and performances you get written up no matter how hard you try.
bad,"They give no craps about their employees. They see them as simple a step to further themselves and they don't care if you have a problem with a manager or other employee, they will simply fire you and move on."
bad,"The benefits are great, I get to work with many different people. I get to meet very interesting people every day. My job is located right beside a high school so I get inter act with a lot of young people."
bad,"work was always heavy and the team shift leaders were very unproductive and lazy, too causal. Never wanted to help or train new employees, managers were rarely there so if you ever had any questions too bad, customers were very rude and nasty and foul, would allow there kids to complete destroy merchandise and not pick up any thing ,would leave all kinds of clothing in the aisle and floors, the shoe department was always hideous , unorganized, they would always fire the good employees and keep the lazy , instigating , nosy , always on their phone on the work floor,"
bad,"i worked outside for 8 months and it sucked. it was hot and tiring, I tried to get moved inside on 3 different occasions and they didnt let me switch, yet they kept hiring new people inside."
bad,"Walmart is the worst place to work, especially over night. The manager treated everyone like slaves. She did not care about any of the employees working there unless they were her ""favorites"". Did not receive any benefits while working 40 hours a week."
bad,"Worked long hours, paid very little. "
bad,"This had to be the worst place I have ever worked for. The managers are incompetent. They think they know everything but they do not, hey will boss you around and have you go do pointless stuff. I would never work here again."
bad,"The managers were horrible and incompetent. Most of the times, the working conditions were poor and the pay was very little. The minimum wage was a back burner for me."
bad,Walmart does not stand up for their employees unless you are in with them and do what every they want you to do for them. Poor mangers and do not care for the employees and their families.
bad,Un environnement de travail où personne en fait jamais assez ce qui fait que plusieurs quittent cet emplois
bad,"Spiteful managers, cutthroat coworkers that stab you in the front, bad pay, bad benefits, unless you're telepathic and on meth, you won't like it here"
bad,"working at Walmart was hectic and gave me anxiety. They don't appreciate how hard you work or acknowledge all the good you have done. Plus, all the employees worked very hard and were nice to be around."
bad,"Store #1620 is one of the worst stores to work for the management is absolutely horrible,there is so much favoritism it's ridiculous. I definitely wouldn't recommend it as a place of work to anyone."
bad,"the managers did not care about their associates or customers. They hire strictly part time workers so they do not have to provide benefits, including disability, and they can cut your hours as much as they want to. They can also work you 34 or more hours a week, up to 40 and still list you as part time."
bad,I worked here for a short time but did enjoy my time there. My coworkers were great to work with and very helpful to me. I worked in the lawn & garden center. I enjoyed being around people.
bad,They put money before their people. Not enough pay and very little hours. The hardest part of the job is staying with it. No communication... management is poor.
bad,Was always short handed and had to fill in and do work above my pay grade. If you were not in the right clic you were a nobody was asked to come in on my days off & was treated unfairly if i didn't
bad,"I started with the company December 16th 2003 and I am still employed with the company as a maintenance associate cleaning floors, restrooms. The particular store Sulphur Springs Texas 417 shows favoritism if you use open door policy you could be retaliated against."
bad,learning about new products and meeting new people learning about customer service and doing returns and getting to learn how to be a supervisor and know customers needs
bad,Walmart used to be family oriented but isnt anymore for the people wanting to get a job there just remember its ok at first and then they start acting crazy.
bad,"the harder you work the harder they push you."
bad,"I was supervisor over 5 Departments... way too many for one person to handle."
bad,"its an easy job to do. but stressful environment and not very good compensation. but if retail is your goal job, then im sure it would be ok. there are worse jobs im sure"
bad,"I found this job to be good, but a good job can be damaged easily by poor employers and that is the case of Walmart. Fortunately I need say little on this one as most people have heard the horror stories and I can only say that they are true."
bad,"Management is rude and nasty, and they could care less about you or your family spending quality time together. ........................................"
bad,This company places no value in employees. They under staff and expect employees to take on job loads that are unrealistic. There is no accountability for ethics violations at any level.
bad,they do not take care of their employees. they are not as good as everyone thinks they are. they are rude and never ever let them know you are hurting. they will not pay you a dime.
bad,Work anywhere else but here if you can. In order to advance at Wal Mart you need to know some one who knows someone . Better off working at a fast food restaurant.
bad,"I was 7 months pregnant . I was having some issues with my pregnancy and was give a note that I needed to do my job sitting , which would have been totally achievable . I was told no and wasn't taken seriously . A few days before my ""lay off"" I was given a stool and then I was laid off. I wouldn't work there again . They were rude as well."
bad,"Walmart is an evil, EVIL company. They exploit people who have made a few mistakes in their lives by working them to death for minimal pay. They also kill small business, creating a sort of mini-monopoly in every moderately-sized to small-sized town they place one in."
bad,"Very rushed, Little training over all. The management is very condencending. High turnover like most retail. A different kind of dynamic in customer base, and how they treat the employee's. Usually very late nights, and long shifts with no back up."
bad,Do not work at wal mart. Ever. Walmart is the worst place on earth. The managers are overworked so they treat associates like garbage. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,"The managers are rude and could care less about you and what you go through on a daily basis.  They love to write you up for anything under the sun and always  assume that you are lying about anything you say only because they want to be in your business.  No compassion,  sympathy, empathy nothing.  The absolute worst. I will tell anyone to not wotk there."
bad,"As a flexible employee at Chino C.A. be prepared to learn multiple jobs . If you mess up , you will be read the riot act . Some departments are very bias . Your probation period is 90 days . You will not receive vacation time & health care until your reveiw . This may take more than 100 days . They do not pay time & 1/2 for holidays . All you receive is a hamburger & chips . They have lots of temporary workers at the facility .There is lots of people walking around doing nothing ."
bad,Walmart was not the happy place you see in TV adds. Many of the management were unaware of what others assigned you to perform as a task. They repeatedly had issues with time off for employees personal issues such as funerals.
bad,Bad management. Too much favortism. Racial problems. Building repairs are not kept up. Many Osha violations. Poor work ethics for many in management positions. Poor work enviroment.
bad,It's a terrible place to work it's unorganized unsanitary and poor management. I hate working there 110000% I would never suggest anyone work there. A typical day involves having my shift bumped around or changed without notification
bad,"Store manager has favorites and treats the non-favorites with disrespect or ignores them. Get treated as a kid if the do not like you "
bad,"No support or assistance from management, and very long hours, poor conditions and inflexible scheduling.  Although my manager seemed to value my work, that was not enough to make the long hours and strict employee policies worth the poor pay and lack of benefits."
bad,the job was exhausting they treated me like a slave I was not getting paid the right amount they took out a ridiculous amount out of my cheeks each pay period
bad,there was no appreciation for how many shifts i filled in for. managers don't care to know their employees. and the pay was embarrassing. and i was promised a full time position with benefits and was denied
bad,Lazy lack of leadership who don't know how to maintain dept but I've met alot of cool customers and co workers and learned how to maintain a dept on my own and became a trainer and a leader
bad,Had no department manager for the first 5 months I work then got fired after we got one for not knowing how to do my job. Never got trained learned my job for other associates by watching them.
bad,"No matter how well you work, it isn't good enough. The rules change without warning, so what works one day will be different the next. Management will not always tell you about new procedures. Over worked with no breaks. Only some people are allowed to take a 2 week vacation. If your not one of those, a week maybe. I tried to take 2 weeks so I could go to the doctor. Rejected."
bad,pays very little with very little appreciation  for there employees did not enjoy working for this company just not much good to say about them at all
bad,Hard place to work challenging a lot of standing and back problems. Management okay. Fast pace to work and had to be focus on the job especially cash handling.
bad,Its a good place to meet new people but everyone is for themselves and its not like being in a family like work environment. Need more better management and more higher pay salary and better working conditions also need better hours and full time postitions.
bad,If you can go anywhere else please go there instead. I reported a coworker for harassment and was fired in retaliation. And because there is no union or support you are left high and dry.
bad,Walmart will overwork you and underpay you but if you are willing to climb the ladder you can do so very quickly. You can go from a department manager to a store manager in under 5 years.
bad,There was a high-turnover and an inconsistent team of management. The call-off rate was very high doubling workload on a constant basis. I would not recommend working here.
bad,"its walmart.  what you expect it to be, it is exactly that. management does not care.  terrible pay, bad hours.  hard to get medical leave for any reason."
bad,Walmart does not care about their associates.We were all over worked and under paid with no benefits. While Walmart made billions of dollars off the sweat on our backs.
bad,"This job is a very fantastic job, and I love to work here. This is an exciting place to work for and they have fun people to work with. Anyone would enjoy this opportunity."
bad,Most stressful place to work at. Management team is the worst. They don't listen to their associates. The jobs itself are great. Too much to put on one person to do. Management doesn't appreciate their associates.
bad,not enough benefits for workers or pay especially for the overnight stockers it is allot of work in a short amount of time very tiring management not to caring of whats going just want work done
bad,"The company wants people to be available every hour of the day to get full time. The cameras focus on employees instead of thieves. Don't ask for a break, you won't get one. Expect to have no days off when you need them and to not be allowed to use vacation time. These multi millionaires are too poor to pay their employees enough to afford to live. The HR people help you sign up for food stamps and welfare."
bad,this is the most stressful place to work manger do not care about there worker at all and I will never work for this place again do to the fact of the work you hard for less pay and don't care about you and your family needs
bad,stand in one spot for 9 hours with 2 15 mins breaks and an hour lunch. The hardest part of the job is stand in one spot doing the same thing for hours on end. When you run out of money in reg. you have to wait 5mins to have someone bring you money to restock regs.
bad,"Walmart is the type of company that will fire more than half the staff of a location without hiring replacements and make the rest of the staff work 2 or 3 times harder without any kind of compensation. If an employee cannot do the work of 3 people, they get punished for it, and if someone tries to say anything about it, they are replaceable. Employees who excel at their jobs can work there for years without any kind of pay raise.  "
bad,It was OK Im just in a difference of opinion on something's and have to speak my mind about certain things I'm not one to bite my tongue but overall its a good place to work
bad,"Employees are as easy to replace as toilet paper, and treated almost as well. Those who have worked there long enough to move forward won't budge from the positions they hold."
bad,Management sucks you have four different managers telling you all different things no communication and you get blamed for what the other manager tells you to do
bad,"the most enjoyable part of the job for me are the good workers and customers the select few managers that are above the department managers that treated us with the same respect that was given, the rest were cut throat and wrong in all that they said and did i learned how to run my departments inspite of not having the help of upper management i also learned to keep going after what i want and deserve"
bad,"walmart is not a good place to apply for a job i was not notifey that i was hired during the holiday season, when i got sick they (management) didn't let me go home"
bad,What can be expected from a Walmart? Late breaks if you even get one and extremely late lunches. overworked for minimal pay and being expected to do so much more than you were hired to do.
bad,"Job needs better management, Job needs better on job training, i have already filled this out once, period the place needs to work on how the treat people."
bad,"Backroom inventory room should have at least 4 experienced workers. I trained 3 workers on a daily to work the backroom, 3 different workers on a daily, never getting all work done on a daily."
bad,"A typical day at work was very frustrating. I learned nothing new. Management is of poor quality. No one really cares about the business or it's employee's. The workplace has no culture, everyman for himself. The hardest part of the job is trying to be the best at your job and or what you have been assigned to do and not being acknowledeged or compensated for it. The most enjoyable part of the job was my last day working there!"
bad,Most importantly you do not get 40 hours. Typically at this Warehouse. Pretty friendly environment. Fair Wages pending position. Overall Organized Corporation
bad,Definitely a friendly environment. Face paced. None of he cashiers really like the supervisors that much. Be the cashiers all worked together as a great team.
bad,"Work place is terrible, people don't know how to work with each other. "
bad,Dia like totally bad invarment never recommend no body there to work dirty and Favortisim.....no training to people... bad service in management no family work wise
bad,The culture and the actions of the company are in total contradiction of each other.  I would not recommend this as a place to work and it was not a positive experience.
bad,"i hate dealing with rude customers, people are all ways trying to get over on you with the pricing, your open on every holiday and you get no weekends off"
bad,No es una empresa que le importe el bienestar de sus empleado rutinas de trabajo falsas y cargas de trabajo muuy pesadas.
bad,the managment are not good about keeping your schedule and sticking with the schedules the choose not to listen their employes and have them work not stop
bad,"Walmart is an extremely stressful environment, with unrealistic labor requirements at a minimum wage pay rate. management is unprofessional and advancement often depends on contacts, instead of hard work and qualifications."
bad,Worked with different people But it changed with different management with bad attitudes cutting employees and time and adding more services and constinly complaining about not getting the work done
bad,"Very poor place to work. More managers than workers.  Unless you can get full time, 12 hrs or at their discretion a week does not pay bills. They will schedule you for 3 hrs. a day, does not pay for gas to get to work."
bad,underpaid for too much work at a fast pace less days to work young workers do not take their job seriously will be told to finish their job other wise will be told to stay a few mins longer
bad,It's just a bad job I've worked there twice totaling at least one year. They will fire people at the drop of a hat. Demand more work from one person rather than hiring enough people.
bad,"They only live to compete with Target so expect to get anew job description every quarter and new management too, one of the worst places ever to work"
bad,"A typical day is to be short staffed, and then yelled at by management asking why specific tasks are not completed. Since they are consistently short staffed, there is no hope to advance in the company if you are even remotely competent at your position."
bad,"Worked full time hours"
bad,"If you want to be treated like dirt here, doesn't matter where you work they will treat you like dirt and your life outside of there does NOT matter.."
bad,Walmart is a terrible place to work. You work long stressful days and nights with no appreciation.They treat workers like kids. Cart associates have to most stressful job assisting everyone around the store and management dont even provide proper water and Gatorade.
bad,Managers are terrible they never keep promises to workers. The work conditions are not good they are dirty and never promote from inside like they say they do
bad,"Management hard to catch, expected to do high volume work for very low pay. Management tells employees not to join a union because their paycheck would be so much less!  No performance reviews."
bad,"enjoy always getting to meet new people and getting t know your work family. I learned a lot over my year of working here such as new medications and what they do and a whole lot more. The workplace is a good environment but can be a little crowded at times. The hardest part of my job was telling someone that they couldn't get their medications if they was not due yet,, I enjoyed getting to meet people and learning more about my job."
bad,Only worked there because it was the only place in town besides fast food joints. Was overlooked and ignored continually for a year. Asked for additional training in several departments - nothing.
bad,Pay was extremely low.  The management was terrible.  Strange working hours.  No incentive to perform well as they seem to just fire people at random.
bad,"The list of terrible choices is not a short one when speaking to the functionality of the worlds biggest conglomerate. Seniority hailes over competence, organization is exchanged for labor saving."
bad,The job was hectic. Poor Management. Not enough workers. Pay was poor. managers are very rude. Long long lines. Fighting and shootings in the store. I did not feel safe.
bad,Leadership very unprofessional and rude. Too many chiefs.... Alway calling me out - telling me they're overstaffed.. probably trying to force me to quit. Don't waste your time. Some supervisors roll their eyes back when you ask for help while other refer to you as he or she and not by name when they in your company. Very insulting.
bad,"The management seems to believe that their employees are easily replaceable and treat them as such. Always complaining, yet never praising for a job well done. "
bad,This job plays favorites horribly ! Better get in good with your managers or you'll be harassed and mistreated. Customers are backed up to the fullest no matter the situation.
bad,"Upper management is very underhanded with time off, and transfers will lie to get you to work for them. Crucial keep documentation of everything hours time off promises. Harassment is overlooked or swept under the rug. If upper management is involved, they will only transfer them to another store."
bad,"I worked at Walmart part-time"
bad,Extremely tiring work that required lots of strength and stamina. Most of the management put everyone down constantly. Not everyone would work as a team so the ones who wanted to work had  to work unbelievably hard to finish the task every day.
bad,It was an ok job for me the pay rate was good if i had too I might reapply & go back undecided at this point depends if I find something better making more money
bad,This job is the worse job I have ever worked at in my life.  they gave me unreachable goals. They blamed me for things that were not my fault not even a week from the day I started.  Stationary is unorganized and i was made to be the fall guy for the managers not doing their job. I asked them for a hardship transfer to get away from the negative work enviorment and to be close to where i stay and they would not give it to me and then wondered why i would be late making it to work the whole job was a joke if someone tells you that they need a job transfer so they can stay in the company and do their job to the best of their ability and you wont give it to them you are setting your employees up for failure and i was not about to continue to be their scapegoat. Work there at your own risk
bad,"Typical day at work requires always picking up the slack of fellow employees. Also, one will have to deal with the under-qualified managers. Overall, this workplace needs to make major improvements."
bad,"Management is not good to work with. They are not understanding, and they are very nasty to  customers. The benefits are useless, and I never received any benefits from this company."
bad,"Each day was very daunting towards the end of my employment here. Management was cruel and would place loads and loads of work onto one employee where as they would let another just waltz around and do whatever they liked. If assaulted an employee could not defend themselves, only run away. On top of that when my Uncle was sick and lost his battle to cancer I went to call out and they reacted very coldly. They told me that because he was 'just' my Uncle I could not receive bereavement for him. This is not a store location I would recommend for anyone to work at."
bad,The job is not as fun and well paying as the company would like you to think . Only management is promoted never regular sales floor associates. Equal opportunity does not exist within this job. Managers cannot be expected to assist regular associates unless it is of a benefit to them. Management often disrespects and undervalued it's associates. There is a never ending cycle of power within management due to the fact they never promote from the outside of management ranks ensuring only management salaries rise . So a manager that is already making 16 an hour may receive  a pay raise by transferring to another department instead of promoting a sales associate that is only making 9 dollars an hour . Management has no reguard for employees lives and expect employess to he at work everyday for little pay amd hard work in any condition of weather ..there is no rationalizing with management also because they refuse to hear any regular associate out
bad,the work place is not fun to be around and the management isn't that great they are not very good at all they pic favorite people to take care of the company isn't good
bad,It's really not a bad place to work for. This was my first time ever working somewhere like this I did not like it at first but if I wanted to make money then I ahd to do my job so I grew to like it and went to work did what I had to do and leave. Everyone is friendly staff and coworkers.
bad,"typical day at work was standing at the end of the register."
bad,It's just not a place where you are treated as a person. It's more like a prison rather than a work place. In my experience I wouldn't work for this Store again. If another Store was ran different in the terms of Higher Management then I wouldn't see a problem with giving the workplace my all.
bad,"short staffed, not enough pay , hours are not good, customers not happy when short on product or the wrong price comes up, also not many registers open."
bad,"Worked as cashier but we would have to help other departmenrts stock products that are in a mess. "
bad,management never listened. would get written  up for filling injury reports. if a manger didn't like you  you never lasted long. excepted impossible  results from their ppl and pay was inadequate.
bad,"No one is on the same page ,don't want to make improvements ,too many managers etc, lots of favoritism to some select individuals The manager is clueless on store issues"
bad,The stress level is unbelievable at this establishment. The work load in some departments were unbearable. Management was a complete joke. They did not care about their employees.
bad,they treat their employee's like doodoo. they want to give you slave work and never want to help you out they look for you to do everything while the managers sit back have coffee and laugh at the workers who bust their butt. they have women working harder than the men and they make the working work like slave horses. if you want to be a slave come to walmart in woodbridge NJ their great for that. also they hire people without manners and who are very rude. they  have nasty attitudes and want to leave work early so they take out their frustrations on the customers.
bad,They fire you for being pregnant but put a different labels on give fake reasons they are unreasonable an don't have good knowledge in how to treat their employees
bad,Es una empresa que ofrese mucho pero desafortunada mente solo es superficial pues ocurren demasiadas faltas de prioridad dentro de la empresa y son pasadas por alto ya sea por algun parentesco o por motivaciones peraonales
bad,"They treat you like a number, offer next to no advances for promotions, give terrible benefits, and the managers do not care about you or your well being at all. The hardest part of the job is keeping your patience, both with the employees, managers, and customers. They have a terrible flexibility program for students or those who just need to change their availability. Enjoyable parts to the job are the 15 minute breaks. The heathcare is a joke, too."
bad,they treat there employees extremely terrible my dad has worked there more then cappable to be a manager but have refused him for so long i cant w8 for walmart to be shut down the founder of walmart would be ashamed of what walmart has become....
bad,"Working at walmart you are literally working as a slave in the new era, the pay is bad for all the hard and stressful caused upon workers.. if walmart didnt have dedicated workers that place will look like a good wheel!!!"
bad,working for the walmart I did made me feel disposable. they treat you poorly and expect you to kill yourself for them when they wouldn't even swing a bat for you.
bad,Walmart is the worst.  Especially when the manager will not believe that you are allergic to items in the store and makes you work anyways even after you show him your chart.
bad,"Fast job needed. There is room for growth in company but you are paid below standards. It is hard on the body and little appreciation from you management,"
bad,They don't care about you.  Bad management practices.  Hours are hard to get.  Impossible to change departments and move up.  You have no voice and you better hope your not sick for more than a day at a time other wise you get put on probation for attendance.
bad,"low pay,bad management/they micro manage your work.limiting your time in stocking.lie about wage increases.the training is done by video.lack of promotional opportunity"
bad,One of the worst companies to work for. No training. No help. You are given a job and expected to perform at the highest ability possible. Without any training and you are held accountable for things you don't know.
bad,"Management changed three times over a few months, making it difficult for associates to adjust to different manager style. The workplace culture became very stressful and intimidating, in my observation. No breaks and constant reminders from management that you ""could be fired"" for various actions. I saw two other associates have panic attacks during work, as a result of workplace stress.  Extremely nonprofessional and critical behavior towards myself occurred without a proper response. I learned not to put up with this kind of treatment from employers or managers ever again. When someone cannot control their actions or words then just leave the job. They don't care if you're in an inferior position."
bad,I will not work at Wal-Mart again.. I think that a job is a place to work and treat people with respect. I did not get treated with respect there. I think customers who are waiting on a csm to help with a issue in line should have higher priority than having the csm talking to there friends outside of work.. They do not feel that way.. This happens on a daily basis...
bad,I hated working here. My coworkers and supervisors were annoying and not helpful. This place really drained me. Would never work here again. 0/10 dont recommend
bad,just don't waste your time unless you have someone you know that works there bad with people and don't tell you if they give your hours away. other than that work goes by quick when they are busy.
bad,"I've worked at the greenwood Indiana Walmart and it is one of the worst places I've ever worked. You are constantly bellitld by the managers. I worked third shift full time frozen and made $10/hour, that wasn't bad as long as you don't have bills to pay. I was constantly being yelled at for being slow all the while they knew about my mental disability. They don't see you as a human they see you as live stock."
bad,"Supervisors and management in general always had an attitude, nothing about this place was good, pay isn't good at all either,  they try to take your breaks"
bad,empresa boa mas não oferece reconhecimento pra os funcionarios
bad,"I am not usually one to bash a company... However, my experience working at Walmart has been quite displeasing. Lack of professionalism, disorganization, lack of ethics, absolutely ABHORRENT management at the store I am employed at, they don't send us to our breaks or lunch in a timely manner, we have recently received time cuts as well as TAXES that are over the roof!!!! Sadly, this is just to name the least of my reasoning to seek employment elsewhere."
bad,Just a overall terrible place to work. The higher ups could care less about the people below them doing all the work. You rely on your coworkers more than you will management.
bad,"I've never been so disrespected as I was working there. "
bad,"I was stuck in Frozen and Dairy for two years, only saw a 50 cent raise every year, never asked me to be a supervisor after I worked my a*& off. Also wrote me up for ""work production"" after "
bad,"At first everything was good. But a few weeks in the manager became verbally abusive. When I tried to talk to other employees about the situation, they said to not even try to report it. That I would be fired. "
bad,"working here was like being in high school again. lots of employees engaging in inappropriate behaviors on breaks, lots of clicks. Management was very unfair."
bad,A really horrible place to work for. They treat all of their staff like preschoolers.  You are not treated well at all.  You need to have a completely open availability to work here.  Basically be available 24/7.
bad,Their point system is terrible.They dont excuse dr notes they count against you.They cut hours n expect their associates to live on few hours.When you recieve nine points your fired.I was at eight points n was really sick.So i quit instead of getting fired.
bad,They don't appreciate their Associate work. And expect for you to go above and beyond but they don't compesiate you with bonuses or full time hours. They offer overtime then want you to cut them.
bad,"It is probably one of the most stressful jobs I have ever dealt with. You finish one task and there is over 50 different tasks to do. You will not be able to finish your tasks because other managers will pill up the tasks. By the end of the day when your shift is done, your manager will not be satisfied with what your suppose to do. If something bad happens to the store the blame is on you, if not the management get the credit for it. Its mandatory to take your breaks if not they will give you a written consent. If you do overtime they will give a written consent. If I were you I would avoid it."
bad,"Es una empresa en la que no se puede avanzar, ya que al término de contrato despiden y vuelven a contratar y así todo el año, es poco el sueldo, y el ambiente es malo"
bad,"Apparel which included, men's, women's, infants, infant furniture, infant foods, girls, boys, jewelery, shoes, underwear, socks, uniforms, and night clothes. Unrealistic work goals and demands on the older work force and threats made to employees that can't handle the heavy work load with losing their jobs to the point that staff is crying. If you have family emergencies or sick timeyou are always in danger of job loss. Constantly told to help with theft rate which affected associates quarterly bonus. The managers never did anything when we found someone stealing they just let them walk to the door and we were told if the manager didn't see the theft it didn't happen. Theft didn't affect their quarterly check only ours. Very short staffed for the amount of work needed."
bad,"The lack of ethics is disgusting. You work in ""backup"" positions without compensation indefinitely. Rules only apply when Management benefits. You do the job of multiple people, but still depend on food stamps and Medicaid to get by."
bad,Stressful place to work for Management does not tell you your doing a good job just if you can't get it done you will be written up. They threaten your job
bad,"Started out at the bottom and worked my way up. Was great starting out, then they put more pressure on you, never saying great job. Sales would go up and still wold not get a bonus."
bad,Business Strategies are horrible. Also treatment of  their employees is inhumane and unacceptable. They try not to offer  advancement  within the company.
bad,"Typical 7 hours a day"
bad,all management is sleeping with other associates and raises and reviews are unfair. Very negative culture there and management makes drug deals in the store with other reps.
bad,Management was horrible and the work load was too abundant for 1 person. When i asked for help management just laughed and said get your work done or your fired.
bad,they don't care about anyone they have no compassion for anyone they treat associates poorly. they provide poor security for associates and do not appreciate anything its all about who you know
bad,Friendly staff until i met my supervisor. He would follow me and my family around the store and flat out harassed me. Then i had lost two friends in a week and they wouldn't let me take the day off for the funerals so I quit .
bad,"managers are rude, they don't show any concern for their employees or customers. really bad management. benefits were horrible. facility was never clean."
bad,Would never consider working for Swift again. Walmart was a different story for the most part. Office personnel were very pleasant to work for and appreciated my hard work and customer service for them and their customer base.
bad,i loved this job just had alot of issues while i worked there. the people can be great there are a few bad apples just like anywhere else. you get paid decently enough.
bad,you know how horrible the place is it literally drains the soul from you because of how rude everyone is and the company generally doesn't care about you at all.
bad,"Employees we're very stereotypical. Managers didn't know how to do their job professionally. Managers will take money out of your check and you wouldn't know about it."
bad,walmart is not that bad it just wasnt a place for me but at one point of time i loved it until they change all mangers. sometimes i miss working with all the different people but not the job.
bad,"From the day I signed on at Walmart I was looking for better pay, and within 4 months I found it.  Don't settle for such a meager income.  It will sneak up on you if you don't find something better.  And you can in most cases."
bad,"This place is a horrible place to work for."
bad,I would recommend working at Wal-Mart if you would like to work plenty of hours. They are usually really good would this and are sometimes flexible with schedules if you let them know ahead of time.
bad,"Walmart is terrible. they have no morals, there is no work ethic, a friendly work environment is persecuted by managers. any promises made about a job are immediately trampled on. breaks are never made fairly or with any forethought. i had a 12 hour shift and had to go on break in the first hour"
bad,"The management does not value or appreciate the workers.  Through this job, I did learn to manage time and a large group of workers and customers. The management made the job difficult and unenjoyable, however, the customers and fellow associates made the job enjoyable."
bad,I would unload the Walmart truck and put the merchandise on a pallet. I learned how to work in a fast pace with quality results. The work place was full of drama and supervisors who wanted to be our friends rather then lead. I would get cussed out dail
bad,There is none. No one knows what they're doing. Work environment is toxic. There are no transferable skill to be applied to anything. Lowest form of clientele.
bad,"Evil, terrible company I will never return to. Favoritism,  lazy employees getting special treatment, and hard workers getting screwed over by management."
bad,"everything about this place is bad. I know all Walmart's cant be bad, but the one I worked for was. Managers didn't care about employees. Managers couldn't make up their mind, about locations on product being placed. 90% of the time we did triple work"
bad,"Sorry I have nothing nice to say about Walmart. The only good thing about working in there was, I really enjoyed working and helping the customers. I met a lot of wonderful people."
bad,"The system makes the schedule. Sometimes we work 4 hour days, sometimes we have a full time schedule but don't get benefits. The managers don't seem to care about the well being of the workers"
bad,"Company was very demanding and unfair to their employees , Worked with the company for over 13 years , both me and my wife in separate locations . Not very family friendly at all"
bad,As an employee with Walmart you are just a number just like in a prison setting. You will work your tail off in many departments and will not be given one thanks from management.
bad,"literally a horrible place to work. no overtime, no time off, and the working conditions were extremely unsafe. i was frequently harassed if i went over my hours which was pretty much required because management would often make employees stay past their shift."
bad,"Working at Walmart was not the worst, but my manager was not the greatest at relaying information to the workers that it effected and did not show up when she said she would."
bad,this is the worst job i ever had in my life the pay was terrible for the amount of labor and responsibility they give you. the hours were terrible all the emplyees would always be mad.
bad,"Hated this job, but had to do something during hard economic times to be a productive citizen, father, and husband while looking for a job when I was laid off."
bad,Walmart is an ok to place to work. I feel as though they don't pay enough for some of the positions. Walmart makes too much money to pay 7.50 an hour for cash register workers.
bad,They do not care about their employees at all! I would not recommend that anyone with a family ever work for them. You don't get any holidays off. Bad
bad,"wasnt enought hours, and what hours you got, you had to work those hours. there was no wiggle room at all in the schedule. it was tough, fun to work there."
bad,They don't really help employees when they are in need. They have no flexibility when it comes to family or injuries. They have no sympathy for life changes and offer no support.
bad,Not impressed with the managerial attitude in my short tenure at this company.  Pay is very low and little understanding to be found from direct supervisors.
bad,"Enquanto estive dentro da empresa estava bom so que eles nao nos dao oportunidade de crescer."
bad,"Work hard, show up on time and ready to work. Good work environment to be around, good people to work with. If you have a question do not hesistate to ask"
bad,"Walmart is a company that only looks out for itself, cutting corners when it comes to taking care of employees and pushing them to see just how far they will go without being well compensated. At my store, management was stale (same store manager for 10+ years) and believed they knew everything there was to be known."
bad,"Store manager and assistants don't care about employees."
bad,This is a good place to work if you want a position with no growth potential.  Unless your in the management program you can expect to work your back side off for close to minimum wage with no recognition of a job done well.
bad,In simple to the point terms you are a tool. The management is so poor at the store I worked in it is a wonder it even remains open. I didn't mind the work I enjoyed it but I could not handle a schedule change the day before with warning  which happened several time.
bad,the managers do not care about their employees. it is impossible to ever get a day off and the way the point system is set up you'll be fired just for leaving because of a family emergency and they won't excuse it
bad,"They take advantage of the employees, overwork them, no advancement unless you are in good with management. They terminate for invalid reasons. do not process termination papers promptly, delay or deny unemployment benefits."
bad,"Management can be very unprofessional at times. "
bad,They will not respect when you have previous scheduling conflicts and often over schedule people. Their compensation is minimal and the managers are very flaky.
bad,Always felt like your job is on the line. Upper management is no help to you at all. They do not give the staff you need to do your job. Have the time will not even say good morning.
bad,This company lost its license because it was a run down facility with roaches and no respect for employees. Its hot and muggy and you barely get any breaks.
bad,Working at Walmart was a terrible thing for me. Everyday I dreaded going to work because I knew i would get yelled at for a very small thing whether it be by a supervisor or customer. I learned how to be patient and provide excellent customer service. The management was honestly terrible. I was in high school when I started working at Walmart and would need days off due to Business Competitions I participated in and they would be denied. I had even requested for the day of my high school graduation and they gave me every day off that week but graduation day. We were instructed to have a coworker take your shift but everyone would decline. Thankfully I had a friend who would help. There was nothing enjoyable about the job.
bad,"my experience at Walmart was not a good one, the treat their employees terribly and I would not suggest a job here to anyone no matter their situation"
bad,horrible schedules and management was not helpful at all. customer service sucked and It felt as though everyone was running around with there heads cut off.
bad,I remodeled stored and stayed in hotels 25 days a month. Management had never done the job and had no clue what they were talking about. The travel was fun
bad,I would not recommend any Wal-Mart to anyone. At least not the one on Austin Hwy. They work you like a dog and don't pay you enough for it. They also do not work with your schedule at all
bad,"short breaks, management has issues with communicating with the rest of the so called ""team"" they're absolutely lazy and non existing unless cooperate shows their face, open door policy is a joke to them, nothing gets done when you have any problems, they tell you they will try and fix the issue but they just blow it off and hope you forget about it."
bad,"Of all the Walmart stores in the CSRA, of which there are quite a few, this is probably the best organized and maintained. So with that said the checkout being the reason I refuse to rate 5 stars, I shop here 2-3 times a week, I've never seen enough checkouts open to handle the heavy shopping periods. Clearly the store has more than enough employees, but time and time again lines stretch beyond department after department."
bad,No matter how hard you work they will put you down and say it is not good enough and will run you  into the ground every chance they get. They praise the slow workers that do one thing a day and treat the harder workers who pick up the slack like they are worthless. They don't care about family or anyone else unless it is making them money.
bad,My coworkers were great management treated employees very poorly and required you to do jobs that you were not paid for also people start after you and make more than you.
bad,Pharmacy manager cares more about personal issues then he does work issues. He blames everyone else but himself . Trys to write up anyone that makes him mad or didn't go with what he says or does.
bad,"One 2% raise per year for everyone. No motivation to exceed job perfirmance. Management is always wanting you to work faster, no matter how hard you work it is never enough."
bad,"I couldn't stand management and I never had days off, it seemed like all I did was go to class and work. Some of the people in the shop were great, and I still miss them, but most of them I'm glad I don't have to see or deal with."
bad,Do you enjoy being yelled at by people of all ages? Love being looked down upon even though they need your help? Want to get cursed at when you did nothing wrong? Then Walmart is the place for you!
bad,"If you want the innumerable stress of your bosses not knowing how to train you or even do their own job correctly or within the moral compass of considering the law, do not work at Walmart."
bad,"Walmart is god awful. I don't have to write details for most to know that. Management is terrible. The place is packed 24/7 and when its not, they only have one cashier for like 80 customers. The management gossips, as if thats professional. Schedule is completely NOT flexible. They won't work around anything, they don't think having infectious diseases is good reason to call in. They don't care about doctors notes, you could be on bedrest with lymphoma and they will still expect you to showup. Managers are TERRIBLE. Mean hearted, half wits with little attention to detail. They don't care about employees, or customers, only that they get to make their 50k a year without having to lift a finger. Also, the immense amount of smelly, unkempt and poorly dressed slobs that visit this establishment while buying smart tvs and ipods with government income and cookies and pop with ebt is reason enough to never even apply here. I wanted to delouse myself after each shift. 0/10 would never work here again or suggest it to anyone who favors their integrity."
bad,"Very friendly and courteous atmosphere, most managers are understanding and flexible. I enjoy helping the customers and they always keep a clean store."
bad,"stressful nights, learned the ""10 foot"" attitude where if a customer is within 10 feet of you, you greet them and ask if they need assistance. management was never around not helpful at all. work place culture is not enjoyable . hardest part of the job was stocking all the shelves . most enjoyable part of the job was the hour lunch break."
bad,"The management was the worst, and one of the managers seemed to have it out for me. I was left on a register I did not know how to use, and the manager I called told me to, ""Get over it."" I learned nothing other than to stay away from Walmart, especially as an employer. Co-workers refused to help me learn the job I was doing, orientation was unhelpful, the ""workplace culture"" added up to a worship of the company's founder and treating anyone below you like garbage. Terrible place to work, if I could give it less than one star, I would."
bad,"Long hours not paid enough, high turn over. No morals or values. People just quit, not show up to work. I learned valuable customer service skills during my time here."
bad,"Management changed recently. I handed in a request to change my hours so that I can help my grandfather on the weekends and was not granted the hours. I was not approached by my manager for a compromise - just had to stick to my hours I have had since I changed it in school to the weekends only. Work is exhausting - you're on your feet the whole day except for the ""gracious"" 15min breaks or lunch breaks. Management (CSMs) aren't the greatest either. You're either on their good side or you're not. You get treated poorly by everyone. It's a joke. "
bad,Wal mart is a big preschool from the management to the employees. They are not professional and pay isn't good. high over turn in hiring and firing ...
bad,I will never work for Walmart again. there management is the worst. they treat their employees like trash. they never give pay raises or hours. they make you chose between spending the holidays with family or having a job.
bad,"Everything here is bad.  Advancement, pay, workers, everything,  Dont work here.  Find something else.  You are better off if you do.  Believe me, it will save you the headache,"
bad,Treated unfairly. CSSs are very disrespectful! Very unprofessional as well. Registers are broken down and sometimes shut down while ringing customers up. They promote anybody which is SAD
bad,"I did not like this job looking at a computer mostly all day long with a 30 minute lunch break. The training was terrible, it did not prepare you for the job. The manager was just about the best thing they had at Walmart .com"
bad,"There bio-metric hand scanning devise violates religious freedoms and it violates the right to privacy. They suck, the worst company I have ever worked at. They violate humane rights issues (freedom of religion & right to privacy at work)."
bad,Absolutely sucks. I worked here because I needed the money but management was the worse and you can tell that people don't care about you even when they say they do! Not a very good experience for me.
bad,"Working at Walmart at first was fun and I really enjoyed working there, but the longer you work there the more it sucks and your learn that they don't care about their employees. Management isn't good at all. You get yelled at for doing your job but yet some of the CSM's would just stand around and talk and then turn around and yell at you for doing the same thing. I am so happy that I am done working there. Now some of the people that I worked with I miss but I will never go back to Walmart to work and I would never tell anyone to go work there. The pay was good but it wasn't worth all the hassle of having to work there."
bad,"I made friends with a few of my co-workers, but one co-worker made sure I did my job plus hers and I would still get in trouble for not doing 5 other peoples jobs. My dept manager stuck up for me because she knew what was going on but higher management did nothing about it."
bad,"Not a good work place, families come last in this company.managers make their own policies. Associate pay is not a livable wage. Hours are cut without notice."
bad,"empresa mal comandada ,gerencia mal estruturada ,uma empresa q deixa a deseja"
bad,There was terrible leadership at walmart.  It was always scheduling you and you could not live a life.  It was either walmart or you would be without a job.
bad,The rules of the job change from manager to manager and from one month to another. The company makes changes to benefit themselves not the employees and taking away PTO to make you pay for time they don't want to schedule you.
bad,A typical day at work at Walmart was to go clock in as soon as you enter the backroom. All the workers would wait for our managers to give us all our daily first meeting. Then after they fill us all in they would call names to tell us what section we would be working in that night. I learned how to use a baler and make bales out of cardboard boxes throughout the night. The management there was terrible to say the least. They always chose favorites even when they told everyone they didn't and cant because its against their job descriptions. Not only that but they would tell everyone your personal business and lie to you about mostly everything that doesn't have to do with work. The hardest part about working at Walmart was working with the managers. The most enjoyable part about working at Walmart was the discount.
bad,"There is a lot of negative energy and racial tension, primarily in the department I work. Harsh and unnecessary comments from supervisors and management. This job is more mentally straining than physical. Employees are constantly left in the dark when changes are made."
bad,Could have changed by now but when i worked there the pay was super low and no benefits. Some of the people were okay but the sole focus is sales goals.
bad,They had me clean up toxic chemcials without anything but a squeegi and spill magic. They often were very short staffed and I had to work in the back to cover.
bad,In the start of working for Wal Mart store 1312 was amazing I loved it. When we got a new store manager everything changed. You could not trust anyone including managers and it was like every and anyone was hurting anyone to get to the top.
bad,Walmart is a terrible place to work poor choice of managers and employees and under paid for the job you do. it would have been a better work place if they put people in leader positions that are really going to preform their duties.
bad,"horrible management no extra hours and if you get any the take it out next week schedules are always random. and forget taking time off. "
bad,"I love working with people, I had a lot of regular customers.  "
bad,Had the worst experience there. Only stayed as  long as I did cause I had a child to take care of. Got to the point where my hrs were cut to nothing. Spent more in travel then I was making
bad,The worst place to work no management or leadership whatsoever.. a lot of favoritism personell department don't care all raises and reviews are decided from corporate office in Arkansas
bad,"A typical day at work required to clock in precisely on time, and I was required to stand behind a cashier and bag groceries as well as handle money and change/processing payments."
bad,"Very stressfull place to work, esp. When they expect for you to work 20hrs worth of work in 9 hours. You have no life bc when you get out of work you to tired to do anything else."
bad,Well we all have to get our foot in the door some where. But treated terribly management was terrible. Just another number try investing in a carrer else where. Be better!
bad,it was an ok job.they made us work like dogs for pennys on the dollar and thats always annoying! under paid and over worked! complete annoyance! not valued as an employee at all
bad,I have been at Walmart for. Almost 6 months at first it was great. I feel that some associates are very rude to customers and managers should be more strict because some of the associates do as they please. I say keep it professional at work. And play on your own time.
bad,I wouldn't recommend this place for no one because the CMS's are slow an mostly lazy an when your needed them to get you more money or something they huff like its killing them that probably exactly why they don't keep employees there to this day I even hate going there for anything
bad,"this place is a horrible place to work"
bad,"Filing, Faxing, sorting prescriptions, cashiering. I learned how to fax and how to file prescriptions, and customer service."
bad,"They don't treat their employees very well and their communication could use a lot of work. They pay better than most jobs but for the things you put up with, it is almost not worth it."
bad,"Management would not communicate with anyone, they ask for your work availability, and then don't even go off of that. When they do not like you they cut your hours to 4 hours a week in hopes that you quit."
bad,"The company as a whole is selfish. I did not feel valued as an employee or as a human. Management played favorites and I spent all my holidays away from my family. Even during a family emergency, they refused my time off work."
bad,"You can ask any employee in the store about their Personnel Employee  and everyone will tell you the she is rude and always has an attitude, not to get on her bad side, other than the higher management employees, everyone was really kind and friendly."
bad,"Duties, Accomplishments and Related Skills:"
bad,"Do not wish to complain about the ethics and politics of working for this company. I did work in the deli and enjoyed my position at the company. I could not grow while working for the company considering school, and my family."
bad,"Walmart does not care about their employees, I feel like a slave working their. No chance for advancement, It just a job not a career sad to say. I did not learn a thing from this job"
bad,That wasn't the job for they were so unprofessional and disorganized.    Its been a bumpy road working there its been fights arguments etc..Managers in my department disliked me for no reason at all and always found something to bother me about i stayed their until i was let go because i needed the job i had a family to look after.
bad,Never ever work for Wal-Mart it is terrible and torture to work here even for a first job it is terrible and the absolute worse place to work I HATE  it here
bad,"The best way to describe this job is slave work. Cart pushers literally work in extremely cold and extremely hot weather, however the managers expect them not to take a lot of break even though it is necessary."
bad,pay was nice but it was a nightmare breaks were never on time. customers are the worst. sometimes the co workers were worst then the customers all in all it was ok
bad,I only worked at Walmart so I could go back to college.  I worked as a cashier and it was nice talking to the customers and I helped in other departments when needed.
bad,"Employees are treated like dirt. Terrible pay, terrible hours. I would never EVER go back to working at a walmart in my life. I would rather work at a mcdonalds before another walmart."
bad,Hope your ready for a stressful environment with little lee way of anything and be ready to here side barking about how every little thing you do here as it will make you want to quit.
bad,"Unwilling to work with college schedule at the time, managers unhelpful and unwilling to teach, customers always rude, breaks never came on time, co-workers unwilling to assist in any way"
bad,"I hate Walmart. there were things that went on on the daily... they wanted to work you to death for years and not give you a raise."
bad,I was fired because I  fell of my horse and broke my leg a day I had to work and I was not excused for the absence. The managers for the most part are unbelievable rude.
bad,Wal-Mart in my opinion is not a good place to work if you have disabilities. The management is very rude to their employees. They want everything done by the end of your shift but they are asking you to do everything else and can't do your own job. Wal mart for me has been the worst place to work at they only care about their jobs and not the employees.
bad,poor job.does not take time to care about there workers.put hours all the time does not givde you any help.they expect to much with no help.i ran the whole store by myself so man
bad,Absolutely love the people I work with but the company and its self is a joke all they care about is profits they don't care who they step on and those who are in charge do exactly that they only let their friends move up and everybody else be damned
bad,This company is awful and they treat people awful. The customers are awful and the pay is worse. The best part is the healthcare is actually affordable.
bad,"Management at this walmart is horrible. They only pick favorites. If something happened and cost the store money, the management will try their hardest to make you quit"
bad,walmart is the biggest exploiter of workers in Canada. Their management is poorly trained and horrible to work for. They have the lowest wages in all retail.
bad,"Unless you are desperate and willing to be walked all over, please apply. Be my guest. I worked there out of pure desperation for a job and I regret it. I was on anti anxiety and anti depressants because of Walmart."
bad,I worked for 7 years and I just could not take it anymore. Management does not help team members with tasks. Store manager is rude and disrespectful. No room for advancement. Working conditions are poor.
bad,This company could not care less about anyone working for it and the unpaid hours or overtime they work. You can do better. There is always something better than walmart.
bad,you cant get anything done and people could slack off whenever wherever they wanted. if you wanted to get of a day you couldn't work you would have to tell the manager ten times before it got looked at.
bad,It's a job if you need one. If you don't need this job and can find a better job run. This job doesn't deserve to have anybody working there. Run Run .
bad,a bad place fire you for no reason they favor people the place isn't managed right no weekends off they put a whole lot of work on their employees very strick on people they don't treat the employees fave they faver  people I wont recommend anyone working there they don't even know how to talk to their employees with a little respect
bad,"very unprofessional, they dont know how to talk to workers and "
bad,i wouldnt recommend no one to work for this company. unless you just need a job..they will hire any body suck management aint nothing just a bunch off nobodies
bad,"If you are looking for a workplace that will emotional and physically exhaust you, then Walmart is the place for you. "
bad,Would not recommend working at Wal-Mart....EVER!!! Always understaffed. The managers and CSMs are extremely lazy and nasty. Find employment elsewhere because Walmart is not worth it.
bad,Walmart is great. is upbeat and demanding work and depending on the person that could be a good or abad thing.i recommend working there and meeting a great staff.
bad,No Manager of store for almost year. Management picks who that want not for people that are qualified for the positions. Rude and don't treat people like humans
bad,"The position that i held may have been the most back breaking and demanding job in the plant. If you are into constant physical labor and lifting heavy items then this is the job for you. The work environment is a friendly, but not so safe environment. The job itself would not be so bad if the management at the plant took suggestions from those who actually partake in the physical labor and if members of management actually knew how the job that they are managing worked."
bad,"Just an overall irritating place to work. The management and employees behave like high school children. No regard for personal life, no matter what the reason you will get an occurrence. Not worth the headache"
bad,"this was the worst job...management was terrible, and they wanted us to work full-time hours even though we were part time associates. we were treated horribly and we knew our jobs were not secure at all."
bad,The hype is real. Management throws everyone under the bus. The wages are horrible. Benefits are expensive compared to wages. Nobody is happy because they are not getting a good work/life balance.
bad,"The pay is horrible, management is unprofessional and they treat their associates bad. They don't like working with school schedules and they decline certain individuals vacation time. They act like they own their associates."
bad,en esta empresa no hay dia q no te digan q te van a correr y q no hay pago de tiempo extra siempre esta todo mal y los gerentes nunca te apoyan y el area de RH.siempre esta de lado del gerente asi q no hay quien te apoye y el sueldo no se diga es de los mas bajos......lo unico bueno son las prestaciones no digo q la empresa sea mala lo malo es la gente neofita q esta al frente de las sucursales.
bad,"It was horribly annoying. I constantly had more duties added with only a .40 pay raise yearly. There was almost no flexibility in my schedule, and management was rude."
bad,very unprofessional no time to communicate worked you with no breaks got mad when you went the bathroom no protection of glbt community  would never never work there again
bad,"Walmart doesn't care about Employees, Everyone there hates there job. They want you to work very hard with little pay, no appreciation. Overnight workers get it the worst."
bad,Working for Wal-Mart is terrible theres no room to move up the pay is very poor full time doesn't exist and management is unprofessional and don't care about work place issues
bad,"everyday your job is threatened. you are undervalued, under appreciated and over worked. you are lied to on a daily basis, your pay will be cut after being there for some time. "
bad,"Terrible management, Terrible work conditions, Just plain awful."
bad,Unorganized unprofessional made it hard for anyone who worked there over worked for the amount they pay wouldnt go back if they paid a million dollars
bad,"I really prefer to not even explain thanks.  There i have nothing i would like to explain, i rather for get the time id spent there thanks again but i would not recommend any one there for employment"
bad,Nice job to have that come with pretty good financial benefits. Does a lot of internal promoting. Upper management tries their best to be available and considerate to any situation.
bad,"This company, after two years of my life was given to them practically threw me out onto the dirt. I was transfering stores and the new store wasnt going to take me so the store i was currently at decided to just fire me, im sorry ""terminate"" like that makes a difference but seriously the managment is horrible, and work place is hostile because youre constantly having to walk on glass(try not to hurt someones feelings) and all in all 1/10 would not work here again"
bad,"I was a bakery employee. My manager taunted me and asked me ""are you autistic or just stupid"". I would NEVER work for walmart again. All employees were also terrible. Mind you I did WAY more than expected of me in the short few months I was there. Over all management was okay. But my specific manager was a mean old woman."
bad,"If you feel like crying in the morning, during lunch and after work because you're in so much pain you can barely stand, I would recommend this job. This is a corporation that only cares about how it can make more money, with no regard for its employees. They can, and will, work you to the bone if they get the chance to take advantage of you. I was lied to about how promotions worked and missed out on a raise because of it. I wasn't allowed to take a break if I needed one outside my strict 15 min breaks or strict 30 min lunch break. My ankles and calves were swollen every day because of that job, and what they pulled during tax season was a serious joke. I couldn't get my W-2! They wouldn't let me have it no matter what I did. Called HR, called my Walmart, tried mytaxform.com, went to the IRS building in CO Springs, and still couldn't get it! This company is a joke. Oh, and if you skipped more than 3 days work in an entire YEAR, you would get fired. Didn't matter if it was because you were terminally ill, or a death happened in the family - you had to use vacation time you accrued to get off. The only way to get vacation time was to work 40 hours to get 1 hour vacation time. And before you could get that, you had to work for 3 months with no vacation time accruing first. AND they demonize unions like they're such a bad thing because they don't want to be ""fair"" to their employees."
bad,"wasn't the best place to work but it was all I could find at the time, there were a select few managers you could trust, most wouldn't work with you but against you."
bad,"péssima, muito preconceito e exploração, por um salário ruim. Te colocam em outras funções, te cobram, mas nunca te registram (promovem) p/ o cargo designado."
bad,walmart is not about family. A lot of drama and family working with family and extra marital relationships. no teamwork and poor management. Their systems are poor and management tends to pass their responsibilities to others that aren't trained. no hands on training and expectations are held to high for someone that has no experience.
bad,Walmart was very fun to work at. they are very flexiable with work schedules . even though you are part time you usually get decent amount of hours and I really liked that
bad,"You get nothing but they expect a lot from you!  Short breaks whenever they feel that you need one.  No extra hours, no full time and no vacation or health insurance."
bad,Pay is not good for what you have to do. Managers are horrible do not help their team at all find meaningless things to complain about towards their employees. There is barely in opportunity for advancement good employees get treated badly and bad ones who do nothing get rewarded for ding nothing.
bad,The managers showed favoritism. Managers actively tried to find reasons to fire good employees. Training was weak at best. Poor communication between employees and managers.
bad,"Walmart has potential, as far as pricing of merchandise. The way the company treats their associates is lower than being homeless. The managers would just bark the order and leave the associate to do the tasks of ten people. I have a been told by my district manager what he wanted me to have done. A zone manager wanted me to leave what the district manager ordered me to do. The zone manager then got mad and reported it to my assistant manager wrote a coaching and telling me next time my job would be gone. It didn't matter my orders came from the district manager which is over the assistant manager."
bad,I do not like the company. They do not care about their employees. They do not care about home life only about the company and it is really hard work with little reward.
bad,We stayed busy. But the management was hard to talk to about problems. And could never find one. The company is unfair with the hours and the pay and unfair to the employees
bad,Honestly was the most stressful company to work for. Theres always something your not doing right even when you try your hardest. Managers are out to get people if they don't like you. I would not recommend to anyone as a job
bad,Treats you horribly not enough hours benefits are just about gone now no holiday pay and no overtime . But you can advance pretty quickly if you wanna put up with the headache
bad,It was ok working there. Management was very bad they were very disrespectful. They were all over the place. Co-worker are very nice to work with. Besides that it was ok.
bad,The people in charge of you ... You gotta watch because they will throw you under the bus quick they only care about themselves...  They act like they are on your side its bull because i worked there 2 months and had to leave to go to hospital to get blood work done because i was really sick told my super and he said go and came back next work day to hear that i was fired for walking off the job
bad,Terrible company.  the pay is terrible as well as the hours. I would not recommend it to anyone. If you can afford to hold off for another job while looking I would suggest it.
bad,"Upper Management was inadequate to assign/follow though on tasks on a daily/weekly basis. Employed here for 2.5 years. Never satisfied with my daily routines, in that management had their own agenda that was to be completed before I could start on my responsibilities."
bad,"The managers there are very stressful. Try to over work you. They barely want to let you take a day off, emergency or not! The only good thing about it was the breaks."
bad,"When needed, management would not back you up in reference to a customer.  Managers knowing situations would not defend you against other managers.  constant threats of coachings, or reprimands, led many to anxiety disorders."
bad,"Wlamrt used to be a fun great, happy place to work but as of late the environment is toxic. and management is highly lacking order, and needs serious help. not a happy place anymore"
bad,they don't value employees at all the feel as though your opinion and you as a person don't matter because you can be replaced constantly by someone who doesn't know how to do half of what you do.
bad,Constantly working to maintain presentation of product as customers continue to disassemble displays. Dealing with prank calls and rude customers on a daily basis with little reprieve and disproportionate wage.
bad,"They did nothing for the employes at walmart, they made one person do all the work and they are always short handed and poor mangement. Treated employes like slaves"
bad,Walmart is all about the bottom line.  They do not care about there employees at all.  If you call out sick they hold it against you.  They do not show compassion for their employees at all. Worst company in america
bad,"In my experience with working at Walmart, managers are poor and play favorites. No opportunity for advancement unless you were a favorite. I worked 40 hours a week, but was only considered part time, therefore I was working full time hours with no full time benefits. Your work load can take more time than you have to work. I was pregnant and still required to pick up 40+ lbs even though I was restricted to 25. I only ever got to work late shifts because of the favortisim, even though I asked to work some early shifts so I could spend time with my son. The only decent things about Walmart was you always got the correct amount of time for breaks and the pay was decent."
bad,"Will not work with you on your schedule. Fires people that actually want to work. Managers go through power trips. No matter what you miss work for, It is always unexcused."
bad,As my first job didn't have high standards of what to expect but it was not a good job one bit. I worked very hard over time 13 days straight and would have the whole next week off the work environment was skeeming around legal labor rights.
bad,"The company itself was excellent, however all of the staff at this location was horrible.  People were either stealing, or showing favoritism.  This company held high promises until it forced me and my whole family that worked there to quit due to improperly managed staff."
bad,I was placed in sporting goods (which I know NOTHING ABOUT) because I was old enough to issue hunting and fishing licenses. No training was provided and no one to help me.
bad,"the turn over rate is terrible, no overtime barely 30hrs a week working, management is a joke, i would rather be driving trucks than dealing with the chaos in that place"
bad,"My store was poorly run.  The management was inferior and immature and micromanaged every one. If you had a question, you were ignored most of the time."
bad,This job Is unber paid misuse of there associates the managers dont like working they blame everthing on there associates and never take Initiative for their own work but overall the company itself is a great company to work for just needs to be straightened out just a little bit more
bad,Overworked and underpaid. It might be a decent job for kids in their teens or early college students trying to make a little income while in school. No benefits with this job.
bad,"i do not recommend working at Wal Mart. The company does not value its employees, it values money. The working conditions are terrible, Often have to work through without breaks and can not get help when needed."
bad,Trash needs help that's the people working there the management sucks all I know is that it is not fair an the accuse yup of alot of things an moving up is impossibe
bad,Most positions at Walmart are understaffed and you are expected to do 3-4 persons worth of work. You arent respected and often talked down to. Very unreliable job with long hours. Usually make part time work 39 hours just under letting them be full time with benefits.
bad,"don't work for walmart. they hire the worst people for managers. they have no idea what they are doing. they don't care about your sick kids. and get upset if you work in a fresh area and take time off because you are coughing and want to stay away from the food, coworkers and customers"
bad,It is a nice place to work amongst other associates but the management is horrible and only out for themselves iinstead of the well being of associates
bad,"company has a lot to improve on, whether it comes to customer or employees, which are the true ones that don't get the benefits they so rightly deserve.  All monies appear to go straight to the top."
bad,Great Job !! Love it a great job The people are nice love the job the sale staff are tremendous and the work atmosphere is great love to work here at this store
bad,If you are a young kid who needs a few extra dollars for school or are retired this may be the job for you but if you have bill to pay the only thing this job is good for is gas money
bad,I don't really want to write this review because it's self explanatory but for some reason I'm being required to do it. Walmart sucks unless it has changed in like a year.
bad,"I wouldn't work at this store(04153) again because I had money($300) stolen from me and nothing was done about it. Also, the probationary period is six months and you can't apply for benefits until a year after you start."
bad,"My supervisor hit me and kept her job with no repercussion whatsoever. I would never work here ever again I'd rather live in a box!!! I wouldn't recommend this place for anyone, ever!"
bad,I can't really say that Walmart on me a lot working there for the past three months also you work with excited people someone was always happy someone always treated you right it was full of joy
bad,The company is to big to care about its employees. They recycle people all the time and dont care about the employees sense of employment stability or security.
bad,they had very little concern of your well being nor did they provide time to listen to your concerns. they did not care about any of their temporary employees
bad,Walmart is a bad place to work there are managers that tell you to do different tasks and get mad when you do them for each other this place is very stressful to work at
bad,This company cares more about there money then they do the people I would work for there tle again for sure it's all bout there money and they want workers but dont get the good ones cause there to busy counting money not there employees that make them the money
bad,"This was one of the smallest walmarts , a lot of favoritism and shady things going on. The management would always Waite till the last second when home office or someone is expected to tidy up things and fix all the ""no-no's"" they were doing."
bad,"It was my first job. Great experience working with people. However, the management didn't seem to care about their employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers, however. Nice and very friendly. Hardest part was working holidays."
bad,The safety culture is not all that great or at least not enforced. The pay is extremely low for the amount the company makes every year. The only way I would recommend this job is to gain experience.
bad,"Extremely unprofessional management, do not notify you upon schedule change. Not willing to work with available, even though it was given in detail in advance to management."
bad,Busy! Busy! Busy! The job is very frustrating and its more like customer kiss butt then customer service.The management is just the worst you can never find them when you need help at your register. The job is not for anyone with a life overall I didn't like working at walmart.
bad,"Walmart will be a company of my last choice to work for.They work like a dog and pay you very little.The bosses have their own picks and favorites. Very unprofessional place to work. Always telling about the wrongs that you do,never reconizing you of the good deeds."
bad,The management was very poor. the store is also very unorganized dirty store has no respect for costumers. they have a lot of favoritism no respect for employees.
bad,Walmart on 646 league city is horrible!!!! They treat their employees bad and have no respect. The store manager doesnt even care he lets one of his managers run the front end and give these 18yr olds all the credit when others that have been there longer are the ones that deserve it.
bad,"They treat their employees badly. It is bad enough that customers treat employees bad, but the managers did it as well. I was an cashier there. My other employees (cashiers) and I were never told that we had to get credit cards apps from customers. All we could do is ask right? So we asked. Majority already have Walmart credit cards and some didn't even want one (which is understandable because I don't ever want one neither). We must get a number of credit cards apps a day. The managers would houndge over us until we get them. Whenever we didn't get credit sales, The manger would threaten us by telling us they will be firing people."
bad,"A typical day was spent trying to fulfill high expectations for sales calls and visits, while fending off complaints and cramming in ridiculous amounts of computer entry. I learned a lot about closing business - excellent sales training. Unfortunately the company is poorly outfitted and capitalized, so your promises of even average service delivery were often unfulfilled. Hardest part of the job was dealing with inventory shortfalls; most enjoyable parts"
bad,"I was Doing 4 peoples Jobs on top of my own. I got Fired for doing my managers job that she wasn't doing.  they would gripe about overtime but not hire enough people to fill a schedule. and ask you t cover but make you cut at the end of the week"
bad,I worked at the Walmart in Taylor it was a lot of computer training so u can learn the register how to do checks use gift cards it was a little complicated but I did a good job there
bad,"been there awhile it only gets worse. the management is horrible. and they allow horrible managers to keep their jobs when they are unfair, judgmental, inconsiderate, everything you can think of. I have made great friends through this place but also some who just talk behind your back, when the tough gets going, they choose the one whos ahead or winning"
bad,never got any type of recognition no thank yous no nothing. it was almost like i was in a prison i would go to work and be depressed asking why am i here
bad,"I hated working for this company"
bad,Has very poor management they give you tons of hours when you first start then they cut them down to nothing they don't take anything seriously and they don't really care about bullying of the work place
bad,Did not care for my work experience there. I loved my customers very much but would prefer to never work there again. Management was great but company policies are not good for their employees.
bad,"My Experience with Walmart Canada - Morale was kept low with below-par management.  Employees, hired at minimum wage are still working at minimum wage years later as the cost of even the most frugal lifestyle spirals out of reach.  I started in the grocery department, responsible for stocking one aisle - paid minimum wage.  Fast forward 5 years, easily handling the workload of one department  plus assisting in other departments - paid minimum wage.  Requests for training routinely denied - the wage one starts at is the wage one stays at.  Potential for advancement is slim."
bad,The experience I had in this establishment gave me a very sour outlook on life in general. Our customers and employees were not treated fairly by our employer or the management hired by the company. It was extremely stressful not having any training particular to positions and having to learn your position as you were being scolded for not knowing the ins and outs of the business.
bad,"Worked there for at least 13 years years. It was a job, had to make changes in my life, family first. Ran mostly Auto motive and hardline areas of the of the of the store"
bad,Walmart is not the place to work if you enjoy actually liking yourself.  The company cares only about making its money and will push employees to the ground in order to climb higher.
bad,"Everything about Walmart was inconvenient and uncomfortable. "
bad,"Working at Walmart was a waste of time.There was no chance of moving ahead in the company,and they never saw any potential in me,as so many other companies have,before them.They used me,and misled me."
bad,"the pay is horrible, no training, they expect you to do the work of 4 people, you have to use broken equipment, lift way to heavy things, and at the same time have someone yelling at you. They only care about their profits and they're liars."
bad,"I did not have a good experience working there. The people they hire as lower down people just order fillers, etc are good people. There are some managers that are good as well."
bad,"worked in the heat or cold weather to retrieve and restock baskets for customers shopping. "
bad,Walmart was not one of the best jobs. You are worked like a slave and some not all but some of the managers treat you like you are beneath them. Favoritism plays a part as well.
bad,will never work their again poor management skills and no one will listen to your concerns they treat workers like trash!! Never in my life I have ever work for a company and got treated the way I did!!!!
bad,"They treat their employees like the gum on the bottom of their shoe. No support, not professional. Very disgusting bathrooms, horrible schedules. Trust me you're better off working at target."
bad,"I worked in Rochester my experience there was very good but then I was moved to St Cloud and I didn't like the environment, I didn't got any experience."
bad,There are a lot of job opportunities at Walmart if you choose to work there.  The drawback is working holidays and weekends even though you get earned time off for another day off.  The benefits are great.
bad,"stocked produce, cashier, help customers with problems they encountered while shopping throughout the store. quickly responded to those customers in need"
bad,Working at Walmart was a great learning experience for. I wanted to try something new and being a cashier definitely taught me a lot about retail sales. Thank you Walmart.
bad,"Very oppressive atmosphere of work."
bad,Walmart is actually a great place to work i just believe they make poor decisions when choosing their management crew. I also believe the place can be better organized and the communication is lacking and communication is key.
bad,i work in the electronics area but that never really mattered to any of the mangers there. I was constantly being moved all over the place being asked to help in departments i knew nothing about. i would only recommend to someone who's in high school or wants a side job being long term i would say this isn't worth it
bad,"Ok job as long as you keep to yourself. Come to work, do your job and don't speak to anyone. People you think are your friends will tell on you in a heartbeat."
bad,its Walmart. we all know how Walmart is you get your crazies and you get your normals. I had fun working there but wanted a job in the medical field so went to school and got one.
bad,honestly i loved the fast paced environment while unloading trucks but the management there was poor and none of the managers ever wanted to give direct instructions or even the time of the day always pawning employees off on another manager and soo on
bad,Quick paced environment with poor management and poor benefits. The other employees and managers are very uneducated and rude to both employees and customers
bad,Walmart needs better management and to be more respectful to their employees and treat them like they would want to be treated. I do not like working at Walmart
bad,No teamwork with the CSM'S. A lot of work was put on the employees with only one break in a six hour period. Never could get any help from the management as needed.
bad,"Managers Do not care about their workers, we were understaffed and managers were trying to hurry us up and three items off our line and made us bend down to pick them up!"
bad,The hours were overnight which caused it to be slow paced and it was boring. Having to lift heavy boxes was very overwhelming to say the least. The upside of it were the discounts
bad,I was not satisfied at Walmart. I was not given a satisfactory amount of working hours during the day and week. I was also unable to work with my co-workers as often as expected.
bad,Making sure to keep the receiving neat. Keeping store shelfs stocked and making sure too keep my cart full with work. If I don't have work too do I make sure to go and help in a department.
bad,walmart  dose not respect  their  employee . they  work them in to the ground then they fire you.they ask you about what your available for hour then they give hour you can work  then they fire you.
bad,management was suckythey treated as receiving associates exist we play the way you are under staffed a lot of days were rough on my body and the fact that we couldn't even get a discount on cooked food blew me away
bad,I worked overnight in a face pace environment. The first 3 months went well but once I reached 6 months management pressured me to work harder than humanly possible and lead to a lay off.
bad,I worked for the company a long time in different states. Every Walmart I worked at the Management wasn't very good. They don't take the time to properly train employees and they only look out for themselves. When you make a mistake or have a question they don't take the time to make sure you understand. They will throw an employee under the bus to save their own job.
bad,"They don't treat their employees respectfully, will throw people under the bus.  You are just a worker there, if you get into the management side you are given a lot of responsibility for little pay."
bad,"The job was just filled with too many toxic people "
bad,They have the strictest attendance policy meaning you can't even be sick for 4 days in your first 6 months without being fired. Extremely unfriendly to families.
bad,"Good place to start out. Manager wasn't all that great. It was just for Christmas, so I wouldn't go back there. The hardest part was doing the truck. I had to put clothes on a z rack and put tags on them. The most enjoyable day was leaving for the day."
bad,at the time I worked I wasn't to happy that It was only seasonal but the workers were very friendly but the management I'm not even going to go at seasonal not worth it
bad,I had never had an issue with anxiety or an issue with being social. The customers don't care about you. Half the time management doesn't care what's going on in your life out side of work and will schedule you when they need you. So you better not have a life outside of work!
bad,"Horrible management "
bad,What you see is what you get here! When I worked here it just worked for my family. They over worked the employees which worked cause I needed as much ot as they would give. Management isnt much help and wiggle room to move up is very small.
bad,"Department manager, work with the customers, management team,i nventory counts, price changes, ran a register.  Always running and keeping up with the custmors"
bad,"Working at Walmart was a huge disappointment.  The job was miserable every day, the management constantly berated you on anything and everything, including things that you weren't responsible for."
bad,"Terrible place to work for. Poorly managed. The backbone of the company, the actual associates are treated poorly, management however can do whatever they want (usually nothing) and get away with it all while complaining and telling associates that they don't do enough. Terrible pay. Terrible hours. Terrible atmosphere. Just. Plain. Terrible."
bad,One of the places that was not a very good place to work just got the experience and was young while working but what I know now how to be treated while working
bad,"Lazy and rude managers. All of the management there is aware of people stealing company time and they those workers get away with it. Some managers remove points from workers records because it would hurt that department if those people would be fired because we have a horrible turn over rate. Lazy co- workers and when you tell management about those horrible workers they do absolutely nothing to make them work. There's favoritism. Extra breaks being taken and management is aware of it. Some management won't even look you in the eye when you're talking to them or they try to speed up the conversation by saying ""yeah"" or ""okay"", they'll even be on their cell phones when trying to talk to them. There is an open door policy at Walmart and managers have told workers before when they have needed help or questions that they ""don't have to time for this/you"" Some managers sit in  a back office and do nothing just to hide from their workers that they're supposed to be there for when needed. I would never recommend anyone to work at the Shepherdsville Walmart. It is a complete nightmare."
bad,"The company does not respect its employes, gives stressful work environment, poorly managed team, full of unprofessional managers, etc.   "
bad,do not work here bad company ok pay nice people. ok environment managment sucks. Bad benefits for part-time. dont hire full-time. management sleeps around with employee.
bad,"This is one of the worst places to work. The managers are incredibly dense and do not have even the most basic organizational nor management ability. The assistant managers will send you all over the store to work while your home department is left in a mess, which of course you will get yelled at for by your department manager."
bad,"The rumors are true, Walmart is a horrible place to work for. Management and customers alike are rotten. NO BREAKS and they don't respect your schedule. sure you get a bonus but it comes at a price, low hours."
bad,Deli cooked food sliced meats cleaned served food and closed not very nice co workers but good bosses and willing to work around your scheldual and a few people were ok to work around
bad,Management was completely incompetent. The only way to be promoted is to be one of the favorites experience is meaningless. The insurance covers almost nothing.
bad,"When I first started the job at Wal-Mart, it was fun and entertaining. Then towards the end it became drama filled and awkward. When I worked there, I had friends that I enjoyed seeing and working with. Through one day I would do picking, binning, stocking, and I even did customer service through out the day. The main reason I wanted to leave a lot of the times was due to poor management. A lot of the times they would sit in the office when we needed help on the floor. The hardest part of the job was to find countless things to due even when their was nothing for us to do."
bad,not applicable there is not much  could say it was a dull and crazy environment. management is no help they pick favorites and pick on workers. they cut people for no reason and set people up
bad,Terrible place to work. The management is cruel and unjust. The work load is okay but they don't well. They will fire for anything even if it's nothing.
bad,"you either love or hate working retail, there is no in between. Walmart has many different areas of opportunity whether you are looking for something temporary or long term."
bad,"You will not get a raise. You will usually not get a promotion. You will rarely make it past the first year (i.e. when you get benefits). Your schedule is randomly generated by a computer. Management is either suicidally depressed (I am not exaggerating) or so dead inside they forgot how to treat you like people. And more than even normal retail, Walmart customers will treat you like garbage under your feet."
bad,"it was very grueling, lift 100 lbs boxes with no assistance available. Rushed you before you start your merchandise. did not allow you to use restroom without permission"
bad,"Walmart is one of the worst places you can work. Their drive to save money is passed on to the employee...low pay, understaffed, and cutting hours."
bad,i had so many issues with management i was on workers comp and they tried to fire me for not coming in while on leave. some people could take more time on their lunch and not get introuble. none of the managers communicated to each other and the training was way too long with all the same info.
bad,Wasn't a bad place to work but the thing was them following you around the store and some of the managers have bad attitudes.But they do let you work freely and offer opportunity to move up just at another location.
bad,"Don't expect to really go anywhere if you work at Walmart. The pay is awful and the management only care if they have their own days off. They will work you to death but pay you nothing, lie to you when you are hired telling you they pay 10.00 when you do not get that right away not until you complete pathways and they don't tell you it takes 6 months to complete until you have signed all the paperwork and have started to work. Some people didn't even know it until they saw their first pay check. They will say and do anything to lure people in to hire them. "
bad,Job is basically a entry level job that should be more towards high school graduate and less of life time career. Management will not work with you much. They made me quit school otherwise lose my job because I had close avaliability
bad,"Work conditions are awful, management is awful, wages are awful. I got injured on the job and they handled my claim absolutely horribly. Refused to give me time off for my doctors visits pertaining to the claim, had to just call out, which I got written up for."
bad,It was a long drive. It always ended on a short day. The crazy hours I could not deal with. I earned I never want to work in a large retail company again.
bad,"I never got physical training. Manager embarrassed me on my 2nd day at employee meeting. The staff wasn't friendly to new employees. Management wasn't helpful, and was hard to find."
bad,Inconsistent scheduling. Not enough hours. Low pay with weak raises that are few and far between. They don't have the benefits they used to have. They expect everyone to work every major holiday with no regards to family. No communication between management. No accountability for anything. Witnessed several safety violations on a regular basis.
bad,Walmart is a big fat lie. they tell you there is place to grow in at Walmart but there really isn't. you can work so hard to try a different area and they end up hiring someone else for that position you were working for. i know an employee who had that happen to twice. walmart is a joke .
bad,Wal-Mart has the lowest employee satisfaction rate. You do not get paid holidays or over time. If you do not become buddy with a member of management you will not move up and you will not receive the respect you need. never a good job being said or a thank you.
bad,"The worst work environment.  management is unorganized"
bad,My managers at walmart were unorganized and undertrained. I felt as though my training was not applicable to my position and I wasn't taught many of the essential functions of the job.
bad,"If you looking for a place just to receive a paycheck do it if you want to more advise  not tp do management.. They will not work with your  college, they are very rude to their employees,"
bad,"Horrible place to work and the management are all on power trips, they don't know how to treat their employees, everyone is overworked and burned out."
bad,the coworkers were very rude and also the managers and supervisors had terrible attitudes i would not  recommend this job to anyone they all lie to you day by day
bad,"Don't get injured there, they will give you workman's comp then fire you shortly after with no explanation. The management is rude and there Cashier system sucks. A lot of the Cashiers don't have very good attitudes either."
bad,"It's Wal-Mart.  They want everything and give nothing in return.  Sure, there will always be a few cases of people who were given promotions early, thus it makes them complacent.  Most managers who seem ""cool"" eventually buckle under the pressure from upper management and turn against the associates they manage."
bad,"I know many people that have enjoyed their time at walmart, I was not one of them. It may work for some, but not all. There is not always room for growth or enjoyment."
bad,They are cold blooded snakes when if comes to employee fairness and respect. They are too slow in promoting and or transferring in another department.
bad,Did not like the company. I like corporations but there was no room for advancement. You were just a number and no real learning happened and no coworker kinship.
bad,"It's very stressful and not worth the pay that you will be receiving. But, if you do work for this company. Defiently wear comfortable shoes and be willing to deal with some rude customers and management."
bad,I hate Walmart. This used to be a good company to work for when it cared about the associates that make the company run. Now all they care about is cutting the amount of associates and adding work. They want all profit without caring about their associates. Less workers are making the shopping experience for the customers horrible.
bad,"I worked many different front end areas at Walmart for over 3 years.  I learned how to multi task, how to work different jobs and how to train new employees and csm's.  It was almost impossible to advance and I felt like whenever I tried to advance, I was deterred.  The job was fun talking and helping customers but the overall advancement was nonexistent."
bad,I lost a baby and received nothing but management being hateful and rude. They refused to move me departments while I was pregnant due to me being high risk.
bad,The most enjoyable part of working at Walmart was helping customers. The hardest part I would say is trying to work around the customers when you are stocking. overall not to bad of a place to work if you don't mind small wages
bad,Poor Mangament and hours are wishy washy. I got fired for a day that they had scheduled me and forgot to mention it to me. I was still in training and they didn't know what was going on.
bad,Really it was not a good experience when I work with them. There is no set schedule and effect in my life balance and we get many different direction for the task what we working on .
bad,Do not work for walmart run away it's not worth your time trust me you can and will find something better walmart cares about no one but the money that ceo recieves and they will make your time there misreable I'm serious I wish walmart recieve a law suit for how they treat their employee I wish the media would lay into them for unfair treatment of employee.
bad,This was the worst company I ever worked for. They treated every employee like gutter-slaves! I was fired because of disagreeing with management. I'm glad I no longer have to endure their treatment!
bad,I had disabilities in my arms. They were unwilling to accommodate. The employees were rude. The management was a mess. The benefits were god-awful. The money wasn't worth the time wasted.
bad,"It's Walmart. I'm not sure what else to say. I, and my fellow employees are still confused as to how the company became a consumer powerhouse and inadequately as its managed."
bad,Basically to sum it up no one cares. This is  one of the worst companies to work for. I will never want to work for them every again. Since I have been working here it is has been a waste of my time.
bad,"Low wages. Way too much work, not enough time. Too may chiefs telling you to do too many different things. Lack of communication. told to do one thing, then get in trouble for doing said thing.."
bad,"The ability to move up in this company is slim to none, and the management team is an absolute joke. Management is constantly threatening job security when things go wrong instead of taking a moment to teach for improvement."
bad,This company treats their employees horribly. Management is rude and talks down to everyone. I had a very bad experience working here. The hardest part of the job was unloading the truck because it takes a lot of energy to do so in the time they want which is under 2 hrs.
bad,"Don't work there. Management is terrible, they don't care about you. HR manager says you don't have to be smart to work there. They tell you that you are replaceable."
bad,This is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. You don't get paid for working holidays and you best bet you will be working a full 8 hrs on each of them at your regular pay.
bad,"Terrible and unprofessional management, awful work environment, inconsistent and unreasonable hours, and policies that made no sense. Not only will I never work for Walmart again, but I will also never shop there again. I have not stepped foot inside a Walmart store since I left the company, and I will not in the future for any reason whatsoever."
bad,"Terrible and unprofessional management, awful work environment, inconsistent and unreasonable hours, and policies that made no sense. I will not only never work for Walmart again, but I will never shop there again. I have not stepped foot inside a Walmart since I left the company, and I will not ever again."
bad,This company should be ashamed of the treatment of their employees. Instead of doing anything to improve the situation they just fire and hire new workers every time their ethics are question.
bad,"Walmart has a potential to be an amazing workplace. Management lack professionalism with staff and treat staff with no respect. Managers think they can come in your face and disrespect you without you taking up for yourself. I was told that i would go full time and checked to make sure and personnel told me it was changed. Six weeks later I found out it wasn't, personnel apologized, but it wasn't acceptable because i was denied a day off to take my child to an appointment. My pharmacy manager was sneaky, showed favoritism and had picks of who he would approve absentees for."
bad,I was constantly harassed by management to complete impossible task everyday at work. I was threatened that I would not be able to leave without completing the task on a day to day basis.
bad,"Day after day co workers are slacking off making my work load greater.  The management does nothing about it, and is an A hole.  Management likes to pick favorites, and allows them to do as they please.  No one is professional and they are all childish and immature."
bad,will never tell anyone to work for this company they management sucks!!!!! they do not care about there employees. if you get sick they will not care and will not excuse they doc note
bad,Working at this wal mart was absolutely disgusting and just a horrible work environment. There were rats and the employees had no idea what they were doing.
bad,I worked in the Deli so it was fast and stressful..  Management  had no idea what working in the Deli entailed.  We got yelled at on a daily basses.  and given more work than could be done in one day.  We were always under staffed.  therefore customers had to wait.
bad,"Responsible for overseeing products. Coordinating the outflow and inflow of inventory. Responsible for shipment, loading, and storage. learned a lot here. not just work ethic but human relations as well."
bad,"I had broken my ankle while at school, proceeded to go to my shift at walmart after when my foots pain was becoming too much i asked if i may go home and was asked to bring a doctors note, i did just that and the next day i was fired."
bad,"For a company with a profit of over 400 billion, they are not willing to promote and advance within the company. It's a shame. I invested 8 years of my life with Walmart and was constantly looked over as a pharmacy employee. Pharmacy employees are stuck there getting treated horribly by the patients and management indefinitely.  My suggestion is avoid the pharmacy at all costs. Retail pharmacy is nothing more than pushing metrics and numbers. It's not about helping people any more."
bad,This is a very stressful job with lots of demand. They ask you to work overtime but then make you leave early to even out the hours so they don't have to pay overtime.
bad,"Didn't like it, was attempted at being brainwashed that ""Unions are evil and if you join one we will hate you forever and hate your children"""
bad,"the stress level they put on their employees is amazing.  They actually doubt your integrity.  When you tell the truth they assume it is a lie.  you have 5 supervisors all telling you what to do and if you don't do what one says while doing what the other tells you to do, you still get in trouble."
bad,no one should aply there they will do them wroung they dont care bout there people all they care about is them selves they dont care about the people that work there
bad,"working at walmart was torture, the people there were petty and unprofessional. they treat employees like dirt, and the managers are all friends so if theres ever a problem the managers sweep it under the rug so that their friends dont get in trouble."
bad,Working at walmart I was a cashier and my job was to ring people up and bag their things. in the down time I wipe down my area and put things away that are out of place
bad,Management has a lack of respect for its hourly Associates they cut hours to the point where you cannot pay bills and they do not give you decent equipment to do your job
bad,"Despite working in a separate department, if you are cashier trained, you will never work the job you were hired for. Instead they will have you be a cashier."
bad,Not a good job. I didn't like working there very much. Didn't have a very good time working there. Had people boss me around that was not my boss! Had a very hard time
bad,Waltmart was a hard job. I was the only one that had a high school degree. The job required to move boxes and push heavy creates around.  It was hard also the pay was low.
bad,Everything is OK with this job. Just don't like the environment at this job nor do i like the management at this retail store that's here. The most enjoyable part about this job is greeting the customers and being able to talk with them through the day of your shift
bad,"Below market rates for pay."
bad,"Unrealistic production goals, poor management, petty employees, and zero positive influence makes this job a horrible place to work."
bad,The atmosphere was terrible. There was only one good manage on my shift. the other were garbage. the managers pandered to certain employees and worked the new employees harder
bad,ive never met anyone that worked at a Walmart and left that had anything good to say about working for them. most people that I know that currently work for Walmart hate it.
bad,Pésima gestión de recursos humanos. Muchas complicaciones para lograr un aumento salarial.
bad,"you have to have perfect attendance to keep your job, if you enjoy your job no problem but if you don't it can be unbearable to work there and once you've hit that point attendance becomes an issue,."
bad,"I worked for Acosta strictly doing merchandising in Wal-mart stores. The pay was low and travel, extensive with very low mileage reimbursement. Did not like that it cost me more to work than I was being paid."
bad,No Not at all told I could come back at anytime after i settled things down at home and promised a rehier no such luck never a call back nothing I worked my a** off and kicked to curb
bad,i worked here for three shorts months and got wrote up three times for things that weren't my fault. i hated my life while working her. they don't care about their employees at all. my mother was lifeflighted to a major city in pa and i was allowed to take the shift off to go see my dying mother.
bad,NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER will i work for this company again. It may be a great job for some one looking and in need. not a good job if u dont work well with others or customers
bad,"i would not refer friends to work at walmart due to how the company has changed. the company  is no longer about the associates and more for management. the vacation time , personal time, & sick time were taking away and the PTO program is not very good for the associates."
bad,"The working conditions are deplorable, they keep asking us to do more with less help, and are unrealistic in their demands. Their benefits are the lowest possible."
bad,"Working for Wal-Mart has been the worst job I have ever worked in my lifetime. The morality, management, job security, career advancement, the life balance, compensation and benefits are terrible. I have never met or heard anybody personally or any acquaintances that had a good experience with Wal-Mart. The only positive say I can say is that you have a job and you aren't unemployed, which isn't saying much."
bad,I had a horrid work experience working for Walmart. I am a disabled person and was never accommodated for my disability (required a chair to do my job)  and the management where very hard to work for. I was always set to work on days that I had said I was not able to .
bad,"It's Walmart.  Wages are terrible, management was ok.  At night, we threw freight and the AC was never turned on.  It was miserable hot inside the store and it was a 24 hour store.  Customers would complain about how hot it was inside."
bad,"Timed tasks are assigned"
bad,"Was the absolute worst job i have ever had, very disrespectful management and very unkind to you if you even call in sick once. Very dramatic place to work as well."
bad,"Horrible place to work unless you have nothing going for your life. NO benefits that make it worth working for, managers are dishonest and will not work with you. DEFIANTLY NOT A FAMILY FRIENDLY PLACE!!"
bad,"I enjoy my job, but there is no benefits for part-time employment. Managers do not praise their employees for a job well done, and they are not respective to their employees. If the work environment was different and fun it would be a great workplace."
bad,"Management sucks, a bunch of young kids that don't know what they are doing. They need to get their heads on right and learn how to treat associates. even the simplest task for them is the worst for us."
bad,Encouraging one another to make the day throughout the district. Celebrating achievements throughout the district . A learning experience everyday with the customers.
bad,"I worked at Walmart for five years, mostly as an overnight stocker. While I enjoyed the job for the physical challenges and fast pace environment, overall it was a pretty terrible job. Good workers get rewarded with more work than is possible to get done, and those who are lazy get to continue being useless without consequence. I would not recommend working here to anyone."
bad,"Richest company in the world and they pay their workers poverty wages, living on the help of the government costing taxpayers money. 10% on merchandise except for food, the soul thing you need to survive? Selfish, cutting hours, jobs."
bad,I didn't really enjoy working for walmart . Too much work for low pay. The management team wasn't the greatest. We were short handed on worker a lot of nights.
bad,Worked very hard from the start and almost was never recognized for good work ethic. Wasn't even able to attend school because I had to work to much..
bad,I was only getting paid 9 an hour and it sucked I work for the Wal-Mart at Miami Gardens store 3397. ! worked there 5 years and i was still making nine an hour i mean can you imagine??? management there sucked they treat you like garbage and they look down on you
bad,the whole management crew was awful and rude. i will never refer anyone to work for ANY walmart. Theyre rude to all of their employees and i had a manager ask me how i was doing and i replied with okay and she said it didnt look okay. very disappointed but not suprised
bad,"I was let go from this company because I broke my foot!  I requested to be allowed to sit on a stool while working my register so that I could continue to work.  My request was refused and I was told that I could either stand and work or lose my job.  I was terminated for following doctor's orders."
bad,"A typical day for me is not knowing what I will be facing and being able to adjust solving problems with equipment as well as providing great customer service. being able to learn news things and continue my training to new things. Balancing inventory and maintaining sales. Receiving reports, contracts and audits. Programing Cell Phones."
bad,"The company is focused on making money, and a constant turn over rate. The people of Walmart are more focused on getting the work done, rather than done right. No matter how many are alienated in the process. Rather than making the workplace more favorable, the sole focus is on getting done. There are very few in a place of authority who work hard, and the entry level employees are treated as if they are scum..."
bad,"Not a good place to work for. If you do not put out product at a certain pace, you are told to do it faster. "
bad,this job did come through when I desperately need a job and I did gain a little knowledge of receiving/inventory practices however such a terribly ran place and the pay is nothing to brag about.
bad,"How do I try to word this, I had worked with Walmart off and on since the 90's and my recent experience left me in shock. the management has no idea what professionalism really is, they treat their subordinates like slave and fail to uphold the company policy of respect for the individual"
bad,"I have worked at Walmart Pharmacy for 2 years or so. Overall, my experience with management was subpar. My fellow coworkers were stellar; however, that is a small consolation when the those you work for only care about the numbers and money. Walmart is constantly cutting employee hours all while expecting employees to do the job of three people. It is an awful work environment. On the bright side of things, I was able to learn how to constantly increase my productivity."
bad,"Walmart showed me what a business shouldn't look like. the management doesn't care, i practically had no help learning what my job duties were. it was not a good experience"
bad,I like what i did do as unloader but not friendly enivorment for deaf and management created miscommunication and failed to provide the interpreter. I would not recommend deaf work at walmart as long if they provide the interpreter.
bad,"A typical day included unloading and stocking merchandise. I didn't learn much. Management was terrible. They sat in the back office all day while we pretty much slaved on the floor to empty huge pallets with little to no training. The workplace was quiet, boring and you felt like you weren't being supervised or helped at all. The hardest part of the job was constantly having to ask other coworkers for training after being put on the floor untrained. The most enjoyable part of the job was break time."
bad,Bad experience all around.... Suffocating to work in the environment ..Lack of management an all around..No respect for anyone an treated horrible...Your not important to them at all
bad,"Very unprofessional , no organization associates are ruder than the customers. not a friendly place to work at. Gives you full time hours but will refuse to make you full time."
bad,At one point in time it was a great company but now they are a total get over. Really don't want to give you good benefits and will work your eye balls out
bad,I don't want to fill this in. There would be no good reason to list Walmart's shortfalls until they are willing to work on their flawed processes an procedures. Which I don't see happening.
bad,"I worked for Walmart for 6 months and turned in my 2 weeks notice as soon as I could. Management didn't make smart decisions, my coworkers were lazy and apathetic at best. There was little encouragment when something good was accomplished, instead they would pile on more work and scold you if you couldn't finish the extra. The customers were rude and impatient. The enviroment was toxic! I couldn't liberate myself soon enough from that monster corporation. I was sick, and had a doctors excuse but was threathened with firing if I didn't stay for my whole shift. I tried requesting time off months in advance and was denied, even with plenty of notice. My overall experience was negative."
bad,"I did not like working here at all, it was very unorganized management and poor customer service. They placed people, including me into departments that we had no knowledge about so there for we were no help to customers that had questions."
bad,"If you are smart guy and hard worker walmart management will take advantage of you they will give you a lot of assignment and you still got paid 9$ per hour Florida state , and they can fire you with out any warning if you calling out , AND the Worst part they pay you each two weeks , when you start with them they will promise you higher position but you just gonna wait and waste your time be ware and don't work at walmart"
bad,"The only thing i would say about this job is that they have wonderful pay"
bad,"I felt it was an awful place to work. "
bad,Working at Walmart was not the best just because the management did not like to work with you .walmart also was not good because of the way the drama is through the job
bad,Working here was ok. I am no longer hirable here due to the fact that I had a doctor's note to quit my job and basically it backed fired.. Otherwise I wouldn't mind going back to work for them.
bad,wasnt a very good place to work for.. i had a severe family emergency and they did not care .i even had a doctor note and they still did not care. the management team was not friendly well i should say one out of the few that were there was pretty friendly.
bad,"no way for advancement, very corporate no values that i can see first hand. People work there for decades and get paid the same as someone whos worked there for a week"
bad,"working in an American sweat shop. they hire at full time and then cut hours for their benefit, work you like a dog."
bad,"Its walmart. It served its purpose as a job by providing a paycheck and a lot of overtime."
bad,Very poor management and communication!Never work there if you don't have to.You always have to check your schedule cause they change it whenever the manager wants..As cap 1 you would show up at 4am and work till 1 pm...NEVER NO OVERTIME they would just give you a longer lunch throughout the week...So you don't have overtime..I had. 3 hour lunch one day.. Manager will ask you to stay late and then coach you the next day on working to many hours.pay is horrible and benefits are a joke...Worked over Thanksgiving and was promised there discount and then was told I didn't qualify..STAY AWAY there are better companies to work for.
bad,its a horrible place to work the employees are slow and the lines are tway to long there is nobody to help the customers nd the mangers are horrible people.
bad,"The skill level required for this job are very minimal. The work is repetitive and very easy to learn. At the location where I was employed there was a lot of favoritism and very little chance for advancement. Even with multiple praises from customers I was not recognized, neither formally or informally but one time. You are told there is room for advancement and current employees will be given first consideration in open positions, this could not be further from the truth. The most likely person to receive a new position is whomever management likes best, nothing is based on qualifications, ability or whatever aptitude you may have that could benefit the store if you were put in a hypothetical position. With the exception of two managers the rest were rude, condescending and treated workers as if they were meant to serve them personally in an almost slave-like position. Yelling and just a general sense of unprofessional behavior are expected to be a part of everyday life at this particular Wal*mart supercenter."
bad,"i went beyond my designated break times multiple times, and sometimes didn't even get a break or lunch. management very rude and unwilling to help. no opportunity for advancement at all"
bad,Wal-Mart is the worst company too work for and I would never work at Wal-Mart again. There's a lot of improvements needed before I would ever reconsider working their again.
bad,"Management exploit workers very much.,If you go the restroom to use it.you will be watch.Total slavery even before lunch time finished.like one minute to return work, management is want you to return to work."
bad,"Not a very good place to work. Management was hirrible, and expected too much from employees. Management did not properly take care of employee concerns."
bad,"After working here, I told people if you could survive working at Wal-mart, you could probably pretty much survive working almost anywhere. Never again will I work in a place like this."
bad,"Management is all in it for themselves. They treat you like an idipot, and make you feel stupid. They love a good scape goat. Wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy."
bad,"The most miserable management ever, they want you to work faster and do more and they pay the bare minimum allowed by law. The hours you work are always reduced at the last minute. They hire you full-time and say 37 hours a week but you only get 27 hours. That way they can tell the world they 'employ' thousands of Canadians but they are all just minimum wage part-time jobs. Over worked and under paid there is a very high staff turnover and the Guelph, Ontario new store is a mess, the management only care about their bonuses."
bad,would never work at another walmart ever again.  there are a few good managers there but most will only see you as who you are and not how hard you work on a daily basis
bad,"They treat employees infairly, they have no good benefits. Its a little ways from my house . Not good pay and just not fair to employees. They need to  treat employees just a little bit and they may keep employees."
bad,They kept me at part time to keep from giving me health benefits and other full time benefits. I worked full time hours but when asked to be fulltime they cut my hours to nothing.
bad,If your a single parent you had better have some people in your corner because if not you are going to eventually have to choose between work and your kids honestly
bad,"I was a pretty much a replaceable commodity. The customer's always right, even when the customer treats you like you're not even a person. I hate this company."
bad,Wal-Mart is a good place to work. Got to work together to get things done. Walmart is a fast phase environment. Also great customer service is needed.
bad,Management is difficult to work for.  You always feel as if you are walking on eggshells. They find any reason to terminate you and make up the rules a they go.  Other employees are nice to work with.  The job can be difficult if you are not used to lifting and working at a fast pace/
bad,"the company has poor managment. walmart is not a good place to work there is no team, the day at walmart starts with complain of customers about the poor managment"
bad,"Management had no respect for employees. Would not stand behind employees when making decisions in when those decisions were per company policy. Poor scheduling of shifts, no cross training"
bad,"horrible pay, hours are long and miserable, hardly any room for advance, have been know to spy on employees for wanting to start a union. It is a good 1st job but DO NOT STAY"
bad,"This was probably the worst place I ever worked at. Lets just say I came home every day depressed. You were basically treated like trash from management and sometimes customers, but mostly it was from management. It just seemed like no one cared about their job. I wanted to grow into Walmart but management didn't care about me growing. When I was working at Walmart I was cashier and customers loved me because I was the fastest cashier and always nice. Customers were only getting rude if they did not get there way."
bad,I would recommend people to work at wal mart because of the environment. You're never just around a certain group of people you're surrounded with a variety of different people daily.
bad,I would honestly prefer not to speak on the matter. All I can say is it does pay the bills and I am absolutely positive it could be worse somewhere else.
bad,"You can work as hard as you possibly can, but unless you're friends with someone you never advance. I was told I was never to have a real shot at management because I was ""black listed""."
bad,I was with the company for 4 years and they wouldnt transfer me. i moved because my husband is military I've been trying to get a job for a year with walmart but they said they didnt have any transfer in my area although their is 3 wal-marts here.
bad,"Not well organized at all, and training was sub par. Demand on employees was outrageous. The expectation for you to be in ten places at once was crazy. Never enough help for any department."
bad,"Horrible pay, not even close to live on.  Management changes faster than the weather.  Employees are treated like cattle, they could care less about you because a hundred people are waiting in line to replace you."
bad,"my first job & my worst as far as culture, fairness and respect. The company was more focused on getting more stores than improving stores they had & the employees who have been apart of expansion (never a easy time)"
bad,you are over worked and underpaid and you will never be recogized for your work and they use your job against you if you dont do everything they want you to do even though its not what you job required you to do
bad,Management was always unfair and expected jobs to get done at a certain time regardless of how many people are working in that area which is unfair to the employees.
bad,"They propagandize everything they do and manipulate the public's view of them. As a company they hate their workers and cut benefits at every opportunity. They keep as many employees below full time as possible. They push out the elderly workers and they pit workers in various departments against one another. Its a shameful place, and I feel bad for anyone who still works their, I hope they can get away from that awful place."
bad,"Aprendi muito trabalhando nessa empresa e um dia de muito estres ainda te proporciona um conforto que não te deixa estressado, pois o ambiente de trabalho proporciona uma harmonia incrível."
bad,Management was unprofessional and rude to customers. Belittled customers and employees. It was a very uncomfortable place to work. I will never work for Walmart again.
bad,A typical day at work was very busy. I have learned to move fast and get things done faster. Management was very bad. The hardest part about the job was the managers pushing the little bit of co-workers harder and to move faster when we was short a lot of people. The most enjoyable part of the job is you get a workout from it.
bad,"Hours were all over the place not much of a job if you have kids they like to work you a lot in the evenings, csm think there better then everybody else.if they don't like you they give you hassals. my most enjoyable part of the jo was acting like I didn't care what csm thought.higher management some were nice but as soon as they noticed I was having problems they quickly figured out away to get rid of me.the hardest part of the job was grinning and bearing through getting through the days knowing I wasn't gonna get a chance to do my pathways to get my 10.00 a hour raise. I learned everything on my own wiith very little assistant csms are suppose to train you but they make casjiers do it.I honestly can't sayanything good about this company and working for it besides stay away you don't want to work for Walmart!"
bad,"Walmart was the WORST job experience of my life. Supervisors were rude, I was barely able to take off for my OWN baby shower even though I had already asked off that day, they DENIED letting me take off for MY baby shower. Co-workers were ok, only because they were in the same bat as me."
bad,"Management is alway rude to their employees and very bad with boosting moral, store is so disorganized which causes stress on the customers trying to shop and also the employees while stockings down managing daily tasks, and no matter how hard you try your best they always let you know that you should be going faster to accomplish more even if your constantly progressing. Overall I mean the pay is decent starting out at $10.00 an hour but the abuse you go through on the job comparing to work load vs how your treated by your management team I wouldn't honestly recomend this place to really shop at much less work there"
bad,The management at this store were horrendous.  They show no concern about employee safety.  They show favoritism and retaliate if you bring up a concern.
bad,"The title really says it all. You could never get use to the boss you had when you worked their because they would either leave or be fired before their second week. The other workers were great, Customer could be a bit have a bit more curtsy but that what you get in retail."
bad,"Management is unorganized and extremely unfriendly, scheduling would be off and we wouldn't be accommodated, bad training, personnel workers were disrespectful and unwilling to help out, and I would be put in positions that paid higher than my actual one but my pay would not be raised even if i worked the other position for hours."
bad,"Horrible place to work, terrible management, high pressure no reward system.  The manager at the sotre I worked at vowed to get rid of all workers over 50 years of age.  I worte depisitions for co-workers that were suing them.  Dont even ask me."
bad,"Management is terrible, they try to get you to do things that are against the law and they have no clue what it is like to work in certain departments but they try to tell you how to do your job.  When you tell them why what they want you to do won't work you are labeled negative, a poor attitude, or uncooperative."
bad,Please do not apply to walmart. They do not treat there employees good. If you get promoted to another position you will lose money instead of gain. More work but less money
bad,Understaffed with management all trying to do different things. Major lack in teamwork causing a super high stress environment. Little to no training but required to just know how to do a job you may have never done. Management is very big on favoritism causing a poor team atmosphere.
bad,Management is poor.Especially the store manager.He is such a fraud person.Once he told me something else and asked me to sign on the other thing.They are totally non- professionals all of the management.
bad,I hate this place with a passion. There was no room for improvement unless you were close with upper management. The customers expect the world of you that you cant give
bad,"This is the job you take when your only other option is homelessness. There are no rewards for hard work and a sound sense of ethics. The pay is not worth mentioning and it never will be."
bad,"Little to no chance of advancement or wanting to advance in company, little pay, full time work gives you a chance to live on your own but only if living in subsidized housing."
bad,It may be for you but it is not a career. It is a summer job or temporary kind of place. The management was horrible when I worked. Full of lying jealous people who are afraid of someone promoting or being more qualified than they are.
bad,"I was young and this was not the job for me it was seasonal and I had found out I was pregnant with a special needs child , it was not the place for a woman of my age to me working"
bad,"I applied to be a stocker at walmart, ended up taking on every position in just the first week and was treated horribly by staff and management. Had a very bad experience."
bad,Walmart is a good place to work with great benefits but just like most large corp. they tend to see employees as a number and not an individual. There is tons of favoritism within the local management so do your research before applying for a position.
bad,Working for walmart is a joke I'll never work there again the management team is a joke they have a favorite crue the CEO needs to re evaluate their management staff
bad,The managers don't care about their employees or the store. It barely gets cleaned. It's horrendous. The managers are rude. If you come to them about an issue they ignore it. I honestly wouldn't work there again.
bad,My job is to help out the customers and to stock the products. I learned how to be open for change and to really work hard. The management I feel like it could be better because there is no good  Communication.
bad,"Worst place to work, Managers were so unorganized. If a manager discriminated against you, or sexually harassed you they wouldn't take it serious, they would find any reason to fire you after reporting complaints."
bad,"Management was always unfriendly, everyone made the minimum they could be paid, and it was just overall a place I'd never want to work again."
bad,"Walmart was one of the worst places I have ever worked for, poor management, lazy people, The work environment was awful."
bad,"The turnover is high because management doesn't treat their employees fairly.  A lot of the customers are very rude to the employees, and management doesn't stick for the employees.  However, we get talked to regarding the situation."
bad,dont work there  it a really bad place to work you have to earn your pay raise by doing computer work and management  is the pits . your co workers are the ones who train you . some day you might not get a brake or a lunch brake
bad,"They constantly cut your hours to nothing, They constantly tell you you are replaceable. They don't pay or consider past expierence, even if it is with them. And the managers are the worst."
bad,wal-mart is a joke. If you need to work here then i understand. I was in a position that i had no other option and no other offers and working for wal mart got me back on my feet. there isn't much that i can say that is positive about the experience except that is made me appreciate my next job 100% more
bad,Bad management. No training. They throw you on the floor and say do it. Managers pick and choose favorites and harass the others. No one answers their walkie. No one is in their department and they never give their associates hours. They'd rather hire new people and give them 10 hours a week
bad,I had to learn a lot of departments. You have to learn to multi task. Cashier was fun you get to learn about your customers and they get to know you. Bonus are really nice too
bad,you are just a number to these people. Management has no respect for any of its employee's just a terrible place to work they took away the employee lounge area to build a liquor store.
bad,A typical  day was long and busy. I learned  how to deal with a stressful environment . Management wasn't ideal . The job had no hard parts and I enjoined engaging  with the people.
bad,"My typical day was ringing up customers and processing their payments through check, credit card, debit card and cash.  They trained you for one day and make you work on your own after that.  Management treats you badly.  Not a place to work customers treat you badly, The job is pretty easy.  Their is no most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,"Even if you do well on your job you are still told how much you suck,  how you can be replaced or just talked down to because your boss is bored.  They also fire people to avoid giving bonus out."
bad,Wouldn't want to work there ever again. Don't care about the employees management was horrible. This job is not to make a career out of.
bad,The experience i had was not very pleasurable. I felt that the management had no care for the lower people in the company. Walmart prides themselves on caring about their employees in orientation but i soon found out that was an exaggeration.
bad,"When I worked at Walmart, I was a cart pusher. We only were allowed 5 cart pushers total. When it came to making the schedule, they needed to cut hours for it to fit in the budget. Since I was new, I was the first one to get my hours cut and have to hear them complain that they needed me to stay longer than my shift to cover the opening."
bad,"I made sure that the customers left happy and had a pleasant experience shopping in the store. Also made sure they found everything in the store that they were looking for and made sure they checked out, paid, and left with a smile on their faces. I learned that there is always something extra you can do to make sure that the customer is satisfied with what they came in for. And, that you should always take the extra step to make the customer happy and always find a way to help if you can. The management was very inconsistent. Something that I did was praised one day, and then scolded the next. Also couldn't really talk to management about anything because no steps were taken to fix any problems. The hardest part of the job was making sure that the amount of money in the cash register was always accounted for, and make sure that if you were running low on certain bills, that you request change a little ahead of time because sometimes it took a while before a CSM could get to you. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to interact with all different types of people. Always heard a ton of fun stories and got to help people out with something that they were struggling with."
bad,"store management is useless. very rude. "
bad,I liked my job but didn't like the managers they don't do their job and they lie to their employees. enjoyed wrking with the customers and fellow workers the job itself was great I enjoy mechanic work.
bad,"this place was horrible. no safety gear, the manager would play magic the gathering in the break room and have other do his work. I requested time off, go it ,then was almost terminated because they forgot they gave me that week off. i really should have sued them but it's better i just left. work at Walmart at your own risk."
bad,"horrible managers and co workers. night shift was even worse, managers think they own the store and expect you to work the whole store with no experience."
bad,Worst place to work. Run away from this terrible company.I regret every single minute i worked there. Walmart sucks all the way
bad,"This company is by far is the worst company that I have ever worked for. The management would treat all the employees like they are worthless and would work them until they got hurt or they would quit before they could. The place is going downhill, they are cutting down hours and want all the same work done in a 2 hour shift that you would get done in a 8 hour shift."
bad,Its an ok company to work for. Lots of long hours because they don't want to work a lot of people for insurance reasons. They don't care about your family.
bad,"get to work take my post do my job go home"
bad,"The company treats you like trash, then to top it off you have absolute idiots that you scratch you're head wondering how in the world did you ever get promoted doing the trashing. No paid holidays and new hires take forever to get pto. Overall a bad place to work"
bad,this company is a good place to start to gain experience. as well as a good place to teach job performance and team work if you seek part time hours I recommend a different company.
bad,"A typical day as a Walmart employee consist of stressing because the management has scheduled you to be the only person working your area, and no one else to give you lunch brake. Another stressful thing would be having to finish other peoples task simply because you were told to do so. But it is not right because the person who did not finish the task is irresponsible and is not told anything."
bad,they are not good to their employees. there is barely any peronal time off for familly emergencies and do not get sick you will be fired..............
bad,This company is all about profits there is no work life balance unless you like working every weekend the benefits are horrible unless your entry level management which has such a high level of rotation that would scare of anyone looking to advance within this company
bad,"This is probably the worst place to work. They cancel shifts all the time just before you about to leave the house for work.  No preferrence given even if you have years of seniority. There is no work yet they keep hiring new drivers. As i am writing this there is ""Sponsered Ad"" for their hiring even though they have cancelled my 2 shifts this month. They have no clue whats going. STAY AWAY FROM THIS MESS. you cant have stable income from this place."
bad,bad management. no real training. They don't give you a lot of hours of work. not a good environment to work in.  only thing good is the they offer 3 day 12 hours and get 4 days off.
bad,This job was just asking to much because the pay was not only every two weeks but was not enough to injure your back at all. It was a dead in job more less. no overtime unless it was in season an vacations was impossible to get.
bad,I would never work for Wal-Mart again due to the way I was treated when I worked there. I am Hypoglycemic and will pass out if my blood sugar drops to quickly and it did and they didn't care. I would come in for my shifts and my shifts would be changed without notice.
bad,"Was suspose to be the celebrations assistant however it turned out I was doing the work of 5-6 different departments every day! None of the other people in their departments would put up their returns, zone their areas or even bother to walk around and see if something did not belong in their area. I got tired of going into a messed up store everyday so I walked out!  Also your pay sucks for the high volume of work you do for them! Horrible place to work they treat their employees like dirt!"
bad,"after a customer injured me at work, and they want me to continue working there. i stopped and walked out and never went back horrible company. i ended up with a fractured wrist."
bad,Very chaotic no organization. No teamwork there is only a few employees that will try to help the customer. The workplace is very dirty and unsanitary.
bad,working at walmart was fun although management and the work place were a little up tight and made it hard to enjoy the job some days
bad,The management on the Walmart at Highstreet Mall is too arrogant and disorganized. They don't have respect for employees; and make them feel like slaves.  Worst management I've ever worked for.
bad,Walmart is one of the worst jobs I've ever had. I would not recommend this place to anyone. The pay is bad and the management does as well. They'll work the **** out of you for close to nothing.
bad,Walmart does not offfer a good work life balance. Currently CEO's no longer care about the work culture of the employees. Walmart continues to make money but cut employee hours.
bad,"No one ever work for Walmart. The pay and benefits are terrible, management is a joke. Worst years of my life. I will never work in big-box retail again because of my horrible experiences here."
bad,training in all the areas and people be working with in the floor. long hours if you have good performance and great diversity in environment. helpful managers
bad,"Walmart is a horribleplace to work and they do not care about their employees at all and will flat out tell you that you are the ""slave"" of the company and that you have to do whatever they make you do."
bad,"The day is full of mean managers, heavy lifting , and minimum breaks.The employees were always nice and kind. Most enjoyable part of the day was speaking with customers."
bad,Walmart really didn't care about their employees. They would take forever to answer questions or help us. They didn't understand if we had issues. They also played favorites a lot.
bad,it is a high demanding but low paying job. You are always on your feet and have to deal with rude people while working for minimum wage.
bad,"I gave this company 2 years of my life and I don't know how. They do NOT care about any of their hourly employees. All of the Salaried(managers) workers get paid the big bucks to sit in the back of the store and be in hiding for 8+ hours a day.I have medical problems that stemmed from a non caring job. Never, I repeat.. NEVER work for Walmart or any of its subsidiary's."
bad,"Unloaded truck "
bad,Management was nice and coworkers were nice to work with. I enjoy working with the public. You get to meet a lot of new people and see a lot of the same customers daily.
bad,Tis is one store you don't want to work for because they treat you like trash and if your a shopper you have to deal with rude cashiers I always shop over night and I just stop going to this Walmart because of the managers and cashiers are rude .
bad,"If you like your soul being crushed then this is a great place for you, otherwise just steer clear. There is a reason Walmart has such a bad reputation. What's wrong take your pick of any and all things you've hated about a job and i am sure you will find it there"
bad,"Walmart was one of the hardest places I've worked at, I had to beg to even be moved up to customer service. And once I was up there I didn't get the pay, I was also MADE to work weekends, they didn't work with my schedule at all."
bad,"I have had 2 years and two months in the company before I was terminated/rehire able. this company is a joke as they like to play mind games and peg you to one job. the management is a joke too are only wanting you around if they want something from you. they love to coach people for no reason. they also don't care to give you very little hours at times or they may give you too much overall take it from a previous associates experience, put yourself through school and push yourself to have a way better job. you will come out much better than the management, associates, and supervisors. main thing to learn out of all this, don't walk on eggshells for them and don't let them push you around! hopefully this review helps others to make a smarter choice."
bad,I prefer not to discuss such matters unless there is a specific question that is being addressed. An answer can be provided at a later time.
bad,"There is not a typical day as a Wal-Mart Manager other than working 15-17 hour days 5-6 days per week, which is what made the job so difficult.   I learned to be patient with others, the ability to read people and how to approach them with the right words and demeanor. I learned how to properly manage other.  I learned cultural diversity as well as how to take constructive criticism and grow from it.  As a manager I would not ask my associates to do anything that I would not myself do.   I really enjoyed working with the different personalities from associates to customers."
bad,The store is run like a circus and there is absolutely no respect for the individual person. I will not be returning to work for this company again.
bad,It's a bad culture. They don't like for you to take lunch breaks and respect for the individual. I worked at Wal-Mart for 6 months as a assistant manager and it was the wrong move for me. Hope I can save you person for making the mistake that I made.  Don't do it
bad,The staff are rude and from the staff being rude it makes the costumers also become rude and the entire store is a huge fail.
bad,"they cut corner everywhere "
bad,typical day consisted of doing the same exact thing every day but getting to see different faces daily as well. Company was outsourced.
bad,Management was poorly organized; time was very often wasted; Operations were poorly exercised.  Quality control was most definitely compromised there.
bad,"This company has no happy employees, low hours and low pay. The work for the most part isn't hard but very demanding. Management lies to the employees, the most enjoyable part is getting off work."
bad,I didn't like working here. The management doesn't treat their employees properly. Always asking to conduct unsafe work and breaks are being covered all the time.
bad,Walmart does not appreciate or value their workers. The management and other members of management are very unorganized
bad,"Customer Service/Sales is stressful, you don't get paid enough, management doesn't back you up if customers are wrong, they don't care about their workers, and they have to put up with too much for too little money for the hours that they get. Walmart will work part time employees just under 40 hours a week just so they don't have to pay them a full time salary and give them benefits. Ridiculous. Don't work here."
bad,Nothing about it was good. Lunches were terrible and the people smelled awful. Everyone their had no one to look out for each other and no one really had any common sense.
bad,the  time at Wal-Mart was a very stressful time and as far as the pay its no where near enough to survive on. the manager have no communication skills and there's always favoritism involved
bad,If management doesn't like you forget any advancement. There is no balance between work and family life. It's all WalMart or nothing.
bad,"As is in most places, Walmart mangers and support managers would pick their favorites. If you weren't, they made sure to make life extremely difficult."
bad,i resigned due to the fact that no security measures for password and money handling where followed. I was told to use other associates passwords and to audit cashiers under other persons passwords. money would not balance to many hands in the drawer
bad,"The management is horrible.. All of the employees are miserable and are treated unfairly. Its complete chaos. They continue to work all their part time employees full time hours with no benefits. There is absolutely no overtime, or holiday pay. And Human Resources at the store is the biggest joke of all time!! Trust me you don't want to experience it."
bad,"you are left alone for hours,schedule hours drop to 8 hours a week, the management has favorites and doesnt acknowlege the hard workers"
bad,"Never know what you will be doing."
bad,"Management treats staff poorly.They have terrible policies, and are unprofessional about everything! Breaks and lunches never ever on time."
bad,"Working at Walmart you quickly learn just how little management cares for its employees, especially the ones towards the bottom of their pay grade tiers. They rather like finding any reason they can to fire the older employees whom which they have to give a pay raise to every year and hire on and train new people back at minimum wage and never at full-time because then they don't have to offer benefits to part-time employees. I've seen corruption and greed the likes of which I've never seen before working for this company. I feel truly sorry for everyone working there."
bad,Typical day would be not enough employees for the amount of work that was tasked for everyone. Many new employees did not receive proper training and left within two weeks of being hired.
bad,"I loved my co-workers hear.  However, I and several others did not like the style of management hear.  I don't suggest working hear.  Not at all for a long period of time."
bad,I hated working for this company. I worked long hours and management was not understanding to my needs after I suffered an ankle injury. I asked for a chair for accommodations while working at the cash registers; they denied me of this.
bad,the management takes advantage of the workers and never want to help and they get away with a lot of things they get mad if you ask for help and they never want you talking to anyone
bad,"In this economy, money is necessary to survive. Working for Walmart may not provide a stable living but it is a job. When I first started associates were being promoted because they were qualified for the position. Now if you are friends with a member of management you will most likely be promoted."
bad,The people who run this store are absolutely horrible and treat their employees like dirt. The store and parking lot are both dirty and its overall a terrible place to be.
bad,"They use you, Don't care about you, Favor certain people, Unorganized, Terminate you for false reasons, Discount there is like nothing. Hated working here."
bad,"It's something, but. Horrible management, people gossip, customers are worse than management, would not recommend to anyone. For the love of God, never work there."
bad,"i had previous experience in a retail environment, had just been laid off so i took the first job i could get. most discriminatory workplace environment i have ever seen. this walmart was in the hood mostly african american associates and hispanics and whites were treated horribly. job duties included unloading of freight trucks, stocking and customer service"
bad,"Manager were very non professional, assign you to different areas with out giving further instructions, pushed back breaks where you wouldn't have time to take your break."
bad,I don't advise anyone ever work here! They do not care about you or your well-being. they will also put as much work load on you as humanly possible.
bad,It's a good place to work but they have favoritism. If your not there favorite you get treated different than others. It starts out as a good place to work but as time passes everything changes.
bad,"I worked overnight stock, constant moving, not a problem. With the overnight differential i still made less then $9.00. The issue with the store I worked for is that everyone there knew each other from childhood or were related so it was impossible to advance, most of the time i was refused help in the 3 isles i worked alone while every other isle had 4 to 7 people. I have been forced to stay later then i was supposed to with promise of overtime but at the end of the week I was told to either clock in later or home for a few hours and come back losing my overtime or be fired."
bad,"The managers are not properly trained, the cashiers never know what they are doing, and the hours are terrible. I worked here for over a year and helped set up the store, and never got and appreciation for it. The company only cares about making money."
bad,"I liked working for Walmart I just didn't like being a cashier... I would definitely work there again, but not as a cashier."
bad,"I found that all the negative publicity about working at Walmart was true. I was left alone for 3 months, working as a bicycle & grill assembler, as my mentor instructed, and  doing very well.  Then the Assistant Manager saw what my pace was (very satisfactory to the first line supervisor) and decided to up by productivity goals to a level that would not produce a quality assembly."
bad,"worst company to work for the management team does not follow proper protocol when things happen to associates, they do not care if you have family that passes away or your current family situation including yourself, to them everyone is replaceable"
bad,"From what I had to work with the management was very under qualified, loss prevention is lacking big time and the store in general was unorganized.  The hiring process and interview process are not done well at all, very high turnover rate and they do not to pre-employment drug screens."
bad,the management could have been a lot better. lack of support when you do need help. poor employee recognition. managers are very reluctant to help adjust your schedule if things come up.
bad,"*to many Chiefs and not enough Indians."
bad,I worked at Walmart for several months and was injured while on the job then had to get a lawyer in order for them to pay my medical bills and time out of work
bad,"I was a cart pusher for 6 months. I worked harder then all the others and everything was my fault. If the insides going bad its the cart pushers fault. anything wrong with the store? blame the cart pusher. You are the most over worked, under paid, under valued person there as a cart pusher. You dress, talk & act more professional then your Superior others and yet don't get advanced because here in Yakima, WA at the Nob Hill wal-mart it's not those who work hard that get promoted it's those that they personally like. They turn bums that have been working there for a few months into CSM's when theres VERY HARD WORKING people there thats been cashiering for years that would do it better & easily deserve the job. But hey thats what wal-mart is they choose favoritism over hard work. Yakima, WA Nob Hill Wal-Mart is a horrible unprofessional unfair place to work."
bad,Walmart is not a good place to work for. They have had a high turn over rate for management. They do not treat their employees with respect or dignity.
bad,They work you like a slave nd its hard move up. The manager's talk to u any kind of way. They make u do things that not apart of your job
bad,"Granted, this is my personal experience working at only one WalMart location. I realize that each location has its own culture based on local workforce pools and doesn't reflect the culture that Corporate WalMart may have in mind or may portray. WalMart Distribution, Terrell, TX. however, pretty much did their own thing. Many times during my 18 mos. there, I was told by mgmt., ""We can't possibly adhere to ALL the company rules. We can't tell you which ones not to adhere to, but we can't tell you which ones we adhere to either."" In general, I found that mgmt., across the board, was ignorant of corporate policy, and discouraged and badgered anyone seeking deeper understanding of the policies. The maintenance department was very negligent of Arc Flash policies, continually disregarded lockout/tagout prodedures when it suited them best. "
bad,"It's walmart. Not much else to say. Management is horrendous, wait times for customer was unreal. You are considered a peon unless you run the store. I only lasted 5 months for good reason."
bad,"I hated every minute of it.  They could care less about anything but money "
bad,Did not enjoy working here. The company does not properly compensate employees that are educated. The people with which I was surrounded judged their customers rather harshly behind the counter. I did not appreciate the attitudes.
bad,Attitudes and equality sucked. supervisors disrespectful the most enjoyable part was the customers. the hardest part was the co- workers and the team leaders
bad,walmart is ok but the management team could be better but it also has good benifits its ok to work at ive been there for 2 years and its been ok  but im looking for a better job
bad,Couldnt stand working for Walmart there mangment was like spoiled children there soil concern was for there wallets not to the satisfaction of there coustomers or staff
bad,"its probably not in all Wal-mart locations but co workers and admiration, everything that has to do with working there  is just not good. Racism, favoritism."
bad,Not recommended.  Retail jobs are low paying and very tedious. Management was not professional. There was a very high turnover and employees were not valued.
bad,I was the only employee assigned to the toy section so my work days were very hectic. We had employees who would take off and quit which left me covering many shifts without a team to work with. I learned time management and to ask for help when needed. Department managers were extremely nice and supportive. Store managers were rude and unsupportive. There were times of strong teamwork and communication when needed amongst departments. There wasnt much workplace drama and everyone who showed up for work came focused. The hardest part of the job was being the only person in the toy department. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help customers and learning valuable work skills for the future.
bad,Expected to do more then just ur job title.. Management is lacking in customer service..Not enough employee for the size of that store..Much needed change and more employee s
bad,"an absolute waste of time 3 years no advancement even while being the only one qualified for it no real benefits even for full time staff management a constant thorn and source of incompetence, Impose ridiculous rules force you to break them then get mad because you broke them"
bad,"Worst place I have ever worked. Everyone treats you horrinle, there is no pay or benefits and the hours are horrible. No balance between work and family."
bad,Walmart is a horrible company  to work for they recently had to pay my in a class actions suite for not giving people there breaks they are the worst ever
bad,Worst employer of the decade goes to ... bum bum bum ... WALMART. They treat their employees like absolute garbage make you work terrible hours with no type of consistency. Not to mention they constantly threaten you with your job. Management gets bonuses for cutting hours on employees around the holidays!! Don't work here unless you don't have any other options.
bad,you work hard for little money at minimum wage no matter how much experience you have. They constantly cut your hours and your hard work is not appreciated.
bad,They work you like sheep. Never considerate about scheduling. Sometimes you only get 6 hours between shifts. that's not enough time to sleep. Horrible but tolerable because they do give you enough hours
bad,Company wants you to be like a robot.  There is no room for error.  Will not ever recommend this company to anyone.  Nothing good to say about this company
bad,The shift that I was on is called Cap 2. Cap 2 main job was to unload a general merchandise when that was done. the employees then stocked the grocery shelves in a certain time.
bad,absolutely no training given when promoted  no help given when asked Strathmore is not the best place to work wouldn't recommend it plus all hours cut to very part time
bad,"Do not work there. It is not worth your time or effort. Low pay, incompetent management, overall a terrible experience."
bad,"walmart is a great place to would great people and its just fun the people are great the work is hard, but its worth it. I worked there for years and I lpve it Im just looking for something new at this time in my life"
bad,"At UPS Freight i was a loader , no one ever came to help if packages were coming to fast. no one really spoke to one another . and it was hard to tell who management was"
bad,Walmart is entirely to focused on its immense profits rather than the people who work for them to the point where they will cycle through employees rapidly so that they don't have to pay them fully or have to give them benefits that they claim to promise. The base workforce is worked tirelessly while management sits back and complains while not assisting the workers in the slightest. The company only cares about it's profits and will readily fire any and all employees that present a legal issue.
bad,"My job was to apprehend shop lifters.  During one incident a customer got involved despite my telling the customer not to.  I was terminated and the manager who terminated me lied about the situation, despite having camera footage showing what actually happened, witnesses of the situation, and multiple called in complaints about how my termination was handled incorrectly."
bad,I had fun work there i had my up and down there meet a lot of people n learn a lot about customer service and how to manage a lot of task that come with it
bad,Was a People Greeter and was always dealing with customers and their problems and trying to help as much as possible. As well as dealing with managers who may or may not have the skills to even be a manager
bad,Do not care about their employees hence why people leave and it's always so understaffed. Will not work with you if you have a problem. Run people to the ground.
bad,"if you can help it don't work there they care not for their employees but about their own success, snakes all of them. poor management and poor attitudes from employees"
bad,I worked for Wal-Mart in my younger days.  I then had a newborn and I cannot recall any time when I was given any of my breaks on time and the pay was absolutely horrid.
bad,Horrible company to work for bad benefits... very little chance at getting promoted.. only assistant managers and above make decent money however you live and breath walmart
bad,The place is very unorganized management doesnt do what they need to do.  An personnel  is very rude. The work load isn't evenly spread and favortism isn't shown alot.
bad,Wal-Mart is very stressful. They give 1 person the job of 5 people. Im on Zoloft and Xanax and take an Loa due to the extreme stress and my asst.mngr treating me like crp.going to the store manager only made her treat me worse.
bad,This place is really unorganized about the store poor customer service & the managers fool around all day this is a nice summer job but not a career to have.
bad,"If you are a full-time student, do not expect to have a job very long. They do not care about your availability. They will in tell you that if you do not show up when you are scheduled, it's a no call, no show. Their perception of this is that you quit. They will not look at your availability when doing the schedule."
bad,"its very bad and hostile and i hate it and i never want to ever go anywhere near it ever again. No benefits,tons of getting yelled at - have to sell credit or hours get cut"
bad,Terrible environment to work in. The managers were always expecting way too much out of a single employee and were not flexible whatsoever.
bad,At first I loved going to work was early and stayed late and then realized how crooked the management was and Un considerate about others and there family even had a manager tell me how much she hated children that's why she didn't have any then why are you working at a family store I did make some good friends there but other than that I would not refer anyone there
bad,treats employees unfair when it comes to help the customers. I wouldnt recommend to anyone besides a high schooler that needs a decent job
bad,I have worked there over 4 years and I never seen a member of management work or help out. They work you to death while they are in the back eating or talking bad about the people who work there.
bad,"First we stretch,clap, get on are PE machine and order pull.They monitor you on a computer,each order you pull you had a time period to finish.But ever time I was doing well I was called in to the office after that my time short and I got in trouble.This kept happing until I was let go.I wish the company took care of there worker better but  there as no union, so there was no hope."
bad,Walmart is great job for students that is looking for a part time job with free time . The company has several career paths and advancements.
bad,"Workplace was very dirty, cluttered, immature and lazy. Management as well was very unprofessional as well as associates."
bad,"Typical assignment in the store varies with the manager on duty - not necessarily a negative. Most problems stem from upper management , and Walmart culture and expectations in general. Manager hardly allows more than one day off at a time and never a particular set day off. Hour cuts are common and the open door policy is useless with current management when addressing these concerns. Pay is often inadequate, and other associates are routinely cut from the schedule when they are needed in the store - creating unnecessarily high workloads. Overall experience is negative."
bad,"everyone that works here is hate working there. customers are rude,mangement  usually  don't know what they are doing and treat you with disrespect"
bad,Not enough pay and the benefits do not meet the what you need to live a good life the management treats you like you are a second class citizen expects to much from a person
bad,They never hired full time. Your days off were never the same. The pay was very low you couldn't make a living only working there. If you wanted to move up it wasn't about what you knew it was about who you knew.
bad,enjoy working with people and meeting new people. Show more concern about employee reward when they did a good job. Have there back
bad,"very stressful work environment, not well managed, cannot keep anyone, you get thrown in to everything you do and you are not specifically trained on the task that you need to do to complete your job"
bad,Wal-Mart is a place to work at if you don't plan on having a future .It is not a place to stay at because you will never leave.
bad,Walmart is not the best place to work. They do not care about your family or anything in your life. My husband was in ICU and they fired me for wanting to be by his side.
bad,I did not feel like Walmart cared about the employees I worked with.  If you complained they told you they had more people wanting to get in.
bad,"Working at Walmart was possibly the worst two months of my life. Management was constantly pulling me away from my duties to reprimand me for things that absolutely did not matter and did not pertain to my duties (most common was leaving the register with the light turned on), even so far as to reprimand me for being in trouble too often, which was their doing, not mine. The customers were even worse- I got sexually harassed on a near daily basis and because I was such a ""troublemaker,"" my immediate managers didn't care and in some cases even facilitated the abuse. You could not pay me enough to work at Walmart again."
bad,"A typical day of work is working very hard non stop, it was a very enjoyable experience. i learned many team building exercises."
bad,"Working here is close to dying. No one works together, management does not seem to care, customers are always grumpy because of poor customer service. Anyone who has shopped at any Walmart would say its overcrowded and rude. Working there is worse. Not to mention when I worked there I only got $8.50 an hour, definitely not enough to work a job that you hate."
bad,"very high volume retail drug store"
bad,terrible working environment for employees. I found it hard to make a real contribution to the company. It wasn't the best use of my time. Fair benefits.
bad,"The co-workers start rumors, half of the associates do not do their work. No incentives AT ALL. It takes months for anything to get done. Also the associates that are new are not being trained correctly at all and not given time to do pathways."
bad,Company sponsors foreign workers and pays them more than U.S. workers! Told me they needed a different kind of person going forward in their business model!
bad,"It is a job i spent 3+ years of my life to and i can honestly say the store i worked at was decent to start but with recent changes to policy and new management taking control of the store it turned into a nightmare. expect no social life or set schedule, and during holidays you will either be pressured into working for no holiday pay and no benefits or wont work but 10 hours that week. very high turnover on employees and no requirements to be hired so most fellow associates will be inexperienced and need direction."
bad,This isnt a family orientated company as they said they dont care about employees there is no room for advancement UNLESS u know the person who is in charge the store manager is rude and unprofessional
bad,"As an employee you are overworked. Proper training is not given, you are just thrown into the job. The company offers to real advancement opportunities, especially for the overnight team."
bad,I don't  know if it was the one I worked at or if it is everyone but I thought the management lacked terribly. It was a very bad experience for my first job.
bad,Constantly understaffed and there is basically no training. The management all seem to have given up and even go as far as avoiding responsibility. So whether you have experience or not you are given heavy workloads and expected not to ask questions. Loved the store and the fast paces environment but wished there was more guidance and opportunities for those who actually took the job seriously and wanted to move up in the company.
bad,"No hours, managers never around when you need them despite how much you page for help, minimum wage pay, training is very poor from any associate, working there was easy, co workers weren't very friendly."
bad,"I loved my invoicing job . But I don't like being in a negative environment. I want everyone to succeed and would help any one to do just that . Walmart treats there employees as failures. I wanted to work with a company that you can advance . Walmart advertises that you can grow with the company , this is not true . Health benefits are outrages and can not afford medical care , deductibles and out of pocket are to high. Holidays are not spent with your family. In less than a year 8000 people have loss there jobs to out sourcing , and given to younger and new  hires . Jobs taken from employees that some of  have worked for Walmart  for upwards of    10 to 30+ years."
bad,"I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. I definitely wouldn't wish this for my friends. this job is good for high school kids and just going to college. The management treats EVERYONE like a kid."
bad,Walmart is a slave brigade. The do not respect or care about their employees what so ever. There is no schedule flexibility or any understanding that people have lives outside of work.
bad,"Not really professional,  races,  disrespectful. Inconsiderate of others personal reasons when they are really serious personal problems"
bad,The management is rude and disrespectful. You are not considered a person or employee to them you're just considered another number. The work hours are extremely unbalanced. There is no way to carry on a normal routine life outside of work while working there especially if you have kids.
bad,"Fast pace "
bad,"I did not enjoy my time working for them. They did not stand behind their associates, and I felt more like a number than an individual. I left the job as soon as possible."
bad,"I have nothing good too say honestly. But it may have just been the Wal-Mart I worked for."
bad,"Horrible place to work under paid over tasked and management does nothing to help nor allow u to succeed in they're store but expect you to bend over when ever they ask "
bad,Too many conflicts issues among associates i felt like i was in junior high school again with all of the drama that went on while i worked there.
bad,"When I started with this company eight years ago, I really enjoyed my job, but the company has changed a lot, they do not value the employees as they once did."
bad,Wal-mart is a bad place to work. They never treated any of the employees right and never listened to them. worst job I've ever had.
bad,"No one cares about you. No one cares about your family. No one cares if you get sick, No one cares if someone in your family gets sick. No one cares if you can't get to work because of weather. No one cares about anything at all expect making a profit. You are a drone. You are to do what you are told when you are told, regardless of comfort level. You will be threatened with job loss if you do not complete ridiculous and lofty goals, even when you are woefully understaffed. Seriously, work somewhere else for less money, Walmart isn't worth it."
bad,The work place was run by inconsiderate supervisors. The often gave us 45 minutes to complete a 3 - 4 hour task by ourselves.
bad,The management expects you to be able to do multiple jobs in one day and do it on base pay with no benefits. There is also no overtime you are forced to take every minute of your overtime off during your lunch at the end of the week and they dont care if you have one minute or three hours of overtime you have to take it in the middle of the day and cannot go home early. If the overtime is not taken off then you will be written up.
bad,Enjoyed working with some of the employees. Enjoyed meeting some customers. Really enjoyed working in the photo lab. Helping customers to enhance and make different photo projects.
bad,If anyone is deciding to be an assistant at Walmart PLEASE DON'T!!!!!!As a former assistant you basically work(or told to) all of the time.You are only scheduled 48 hrs a week but you work(or told to) 60 -70 hrs a week with no extra compensation.You never get back to back days off unless your lucky(and i mean lucky)to get a weekend off.So basically you never see your family and friends.Oh and what they pay you and you divide it by how many hrs you work(or told to) you make like $8 a hr.So if you wanna work all of the time and be told in a nice way you suck by the tyrants I mean Store Manager and Co Managers (that just sit in the office) hey this job is for you.
bad,"The overnight management at this facility are a joke!! They do nothing but beat down employees unless it's their ""favorites"" who can do no wrong."
bad,To many rude and disrespectful management and management has favorites and they will lie to you very unprofessional  and  they let thefts keep working
bad,Had hard working labor to do but would get in trouble based on the whole teams performance instead of your individual performance.
bad,"There is no structure of management at Walmart. Each Walmart is having staffing problems. Walmart managers would never hire enough associates because of they are more interested in earning their myshare commission of 50,000-80,000/year. Walmart is a worst company to work for."
bad,"A very difficult, biased and demanding job. Management would hire and promote friends and family members to manager jobs and ignore long term associates going for positions. Constantly made to work outside your job code."
bad,Walmart is the worst place to work. The management style is for salaried managers run around barking orders and threats at minimum wage workers while brown nosing megalomaniac upper management.
bad,"Typical day at Wal-Mart is having rude customers, dealing with managers that do not want to do their jobs.. "
bad,"They made it clear from orientation that customers and money are above all else. Just handed me a box cutter and a vest, and sent me to the backroom. The pay for the work done was abysmal. The benefits are a joke. Management is always looking for a reason to get rid of someone. The safety culture is nonexistent. I've had countless boxes fall on my head while unloading truck. Have had my fingers crushed more than enough times by employees and management ignoring common sense."
bad,I was an cashier and store associate I learned how to handle a register and also stock. I also was a cashier in the MoneyCenter.
bad,"it was a lot of fun get to meet a lot of people, and as well help people that's most important. The most enjoyable is getting to learn something that you didn't know."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers and some co workers.  Management needs more training and hard work does not get you promoted.  Being lazy and one of the favorites is what gets promotions at Wal-Mart.
bad,Very sexist environment. They do not keep promises of raises like they say they do. Management is very sexist against women. Do not care about their employees. My Fiance was given 2 raises in a month for no reason and he very much agrees that the place is very sexist against women as well. Another one of my Co-Workers got sexually harassed by a male department manager there and HR as well as the store manager did nothing about it. I would have to say it would be the worse place to work for women.
bad,"A typical day involves dealing with difficult customers. I have learned how to use a cash register, which anybody can learn. Management does not care about people doing their jobs. The other workers pretend to care about their jobs. The hardest part of the job is thinking everything that you want to say to difficult customers, but you actually stay positive with difficult customers. There is no enjoyable part of this job, which is why I am looking for a different job where I can use my education."
bad,Does anyone actually read these things??? Besides this was a job at wal mart their working environment is well documented
bad,"Do not, listen to people who say it is a fantastic place to work and advance your career, because it is not! it is for people who have nowhere to go and nothing to do with their lives. "
bad,was very long hours need to get better pay and better supervisor  to explain the work and what is needed to be done need better incentives to keep staff
bad,"A typical day here was scanning and checking customer needs (groceries), dealing with a huge spectrum of different people, and moods. I learned patience here, as some of the customers were either elderly, young, in a bad mood, etc. This also taught me how to communicate effectively. Management was very poor, they were only there to make sure everyone was working but was not willing to step in and help those where needed, they were poor on training in departments of the store as well. I'd say the co-workers there were 50/50, some were really easy to get along with and welcoming while others were not. The hardest part was dealing with management if there were ever a problem, at times they were unreliable to showing up to where they were needed and would take up to 20 minutes to get to you and the unhappy customer. The most enjoyable part was going home."
bad,"A typical day at work surrounded me checking out items and providing people with cigarettes and alcohol.   Although I enjoyed working with the public my main supervisor called me incompetent because I didn't understand the couponing policy but they refused to explain it.  Now they don't even use it any longer.   I found myself miserable dealing with people who weren't treated like human beings and there wasn't any opportunity for promotion.  Even if there was, it seemed to be more than a headache than it was worth.  As for benefits, they were laughable at best and the pay was not even commiserate with the service we provided."
bad,"Honestly Walmart doesn't treat their employees the way they should. They work you so much and you do an give your best everyday, when they are tired of you or used you for what they wanted they fire you. Their teaching n training practices you learn on your own as you go along."
bad,Nothing worth saying here. poor company to work for. did it because i simply needed a job. If you're a kid getting his/her first job sure go ahead and work here. you'll get plenty of experiences with all kinds of people. you'll definitely learn patients there that's for sure.
bad,"during a typical day of work at Walmart we would move the pallents out of our way so we could unload the rtucks, unload the trucks, move the merchandise out to the floor,"
bad,"Store manger only concerned about her bonuses. I had been interrupted assisting a customer on several occasions to immediately dust shelving or replace an end-cap due to one item being sold (end display no longer full).  Department/Zone managers routinely used to unload trucks while wearing ties/heels suit jackets/business attire .  One minute of over-time and you were written up, even if it was due to helping a customer (expected to abandon customers at the end of your shift).  A third offense of 1 minute or more and you were dismissed. Morale was absolutely horrible.  As a department manager you were expected to adjust your hours to stay within hours even if it meant clocking out for a 5 hour lunch at the end of the pay period so you were there at the start and end of the shift.  I had never worked for anyone that tracked time to the hundredth of an hour!  A paid day off for Walmart does not mean 8 hours paid day off for Christmas day, but the average number of hours you worked in a day; my ""paid day off"" equaled 6.42 hours worth of pay.  Walmart is the evil empire!  Seek employment elsewhere, you're better than this; respect yourself!"
bad,i have been work while i getting sick clot bleed they hire me i was asked for quit for a while. but i miss work there with people and mangers. iit very good area and cool work too.
bad,Try somewhere else the pay is minimum wage the schedule is not set at all you might work until 11 pm and be expected back at 7 am the next day they want one person to do the work of two or three
bad,Worst company to work for hate it and is people they really went down hill. I wish that they cared about their employees but they don't and they really don't pay good and now have no time in a half or paid holidays with no sick now.
bad,I've only worked for Wal-Mart for 5 months and I'm tired. The managers don't care and work you like a mule. Never care about your family. Always forced to work holidays with no holiday pay. I'm already looking for a new job. Store 1585 is horrible.
bad,"Managers were really rude , either it was their way or no way . Never gave attention to the workers . And again they don't work with your Hours . It's whatever Hours they wanted"
bad,"working at Walmart is like riding a bike, except the bike is on fire and everything is on fire and your in he#."
bad,"It was great at first couldnt complainan. They have a thing called the open door policy, which your suppose to be able to talk with a manager without where no one knows what you talk about os very untrue. I was there for 8 months and a person im acquainted with started at walmart after threating my children and i lives i would never work for the company agian"
bad,"Horrible the customers, the managers. Really didn't care about you. I don't recommend this place especially in valley stream. Don't go even to shop. The hardest part was the customers. Really pure stupidity."
bad,"This place is a very stressful place to work, they have no care about family, and management is not friendly or helpful if u have a issue"
bad,"this is a very bad company to work for.  they treat there employees very badly. i learned nothing, the co-workers were nice.  the hardest part of the job was the supervisor, she was just mean to everyone. i did not enjoy that job at all."
bad,My experience with Walmart was horrific. I spent three years there and at the time the pay was terrible. The management was even worse and general care for the workers there was basically non existant.
bad,"poor management, management don't listen to employees, get written up for dumb stuff, customers yell at you for something you as a cashier don't have anything control over"
bad,"I worked for Walmart through a staff agency , so getting regular hours or benefits for the company was not possible. I recommend getting hired directly through Walmart if working there. I stocked merchandise, organized isles, and helped costumers with questions. It required a lot of hard labor that was not worth the pay."
bad,"Management is terrible and does not do their job. They are strictly there to scold never to help. They let their senior workers, who are lazy after being there so long, tell new employees what to do."
bad,The schedule was never ever the same all over the place. Long hours for days straight. Nasty co workers and management. The ONLY thing enjoyable about working for this company were the customers.
bad,This company uses people like an assembly line in a factory. No benefits and low pay. The training is terrible. They don't train they're workers thoroughly or properly before putting them on the floor. Everything is rushed. The management was very poor at this particular Walmart. They were unable to deal with the diversity of their workers. There was a constant turnover in workers and always a shortage of workers leading to the present workers being overworked and under payed.
bad,"this place was the worst retail job i ever had, they treat their employees really bad, would never work there. I was pregnant and they refused to let me sit in the fitting room to answer the phone, brought a doctor note and they still told me they didnt need people there"
bad,Managers were very unfair. They showed favoritism and the overall morale of the employees was horrible. The job was okay. Management was very unprofessional and threatened the employees all the time regarding job security.
bad,Walmart is probably the worst company to ever work. Management is the worst. They are worst to the employees that come to work everyday and show up on time verses the ones who don't come to work and call off.
bad,"managers try to over work one employee when they have others there also. employee always called off. and it was a far travel to work from home, and from home to work"
bad,"Experienced providing customer service by phone and in person"
bad,it was very unorganized and they didn't appreciate their employee..and their management staff is young and immature. They Don't really work with you and they are not understanding.
bad,I did not like working there. They were very rude and disrespectful to their employees. They treated everyone differently and most of them had attitudes towards the employees.
bad,Walmart is ok place to work you just have to stay to yourself but the goals they give you a not reasonable to work with some managers are not easy to talk to either
bad,Management is horrible at managing their associates. Most of them date their associates. They do not follow rules and they do not pay very well. They have their associates working in three different departments and they will not pay them more money for working in other departments. If family means everything to you then you may won't to avoid working at walmart. You will not get the weekends off and neither will you have time for your kids. You will always be at work. They do not pay their associates for the holidays and they make their associates work every holiday except for Christmas.
bad,"couldn't stand working there, 10 managers telling you 10 different ways to do things and unless it's done that way your are getting written up."
bad,"Management on all three shifts are terrible. They do not ensure work gets done after my shift 1st shift. Second and third are terrible. We come into loads of stuff to do to clean up after the other shifts, which keeps us behind, they do not help they sit bark orders all day long instead, give you unrealistic work things to complete or you cannot leave work until done, and then make you take 3 hour lunches the next day from working over to avoid paying over time, and the long lunches to take time worked over off put you behind the next day. They are in no way shape or form good managers to properly run a store."
bad,Walmart is an evil corporation. They don't care about their employees at all and their managers are expected to live at the store. Cut grown people to eight hours a week like that's even worth bothering.
bad,"I was hired as a college student just as many others. They did not provide any documents stating that a college schedule would not be approved for six months. I was then asked to bring a copy of my class schedule for approval and when I turned it in, no one approved it."
bad,Walmart was a okay place to work because you meet new people everyday but what I learn most at the job is how to catch a scam or a shoplifter at the job but other than that it was a okay job
bad,It was ok but didn't like how mangers watch you while doing your job. I am an adult if you tell me what to do I will do just that don't need someone watching me all day.
bad,"HORRIBLE JOB !! "
bad,They'll try to take away your vacations without paying you for them. They won't pay you for your approved time off without you having to go in and making them do their job. They'll find a reason to fire you if you tap out their salary guidelines. They'll fight you on your unemployment bennefits even though management says they'll help you get it. Their insurance is absolute garbage. Management doesn't care about their employees. The pay is horrible for all the physical demand of the job. The list goes on...
bad,"A typical day at work was to attend customers, merchandising items, going through reports and having the report completed. You had to keep area clean and organized for associates but most importantly for customers."
bad,"Es una empresa que busca gente mediocre y conformista que desea vivir con un mal sueldo, un ambiente rodeado de chismes donde no valorarán tu trabajo con un sueldo muy bajo"
bad,I was fired for bbeing sick during my pregnancy. I find it unfair and completely unethical to let someone go because they could not control being sick.
bad,Company pays salaried management less than hourly positions at any and all competitors. Health insurance is only for catastrophic situations. To much stress.
bad,hiring over staff for drivers at Mississauga DC6002. Give a call to tell cancellation of shift in morning before 2-3 hours when you are going to start shift. both Tiffany and Casie dont know about any transportation. Around 10 drivers quit within one month.worst company ever
bad,The amount of work They expect you to do for the amount of money they pay you is absurd. Then you have to practically kill yourself to earn benefits. Thanks for the opportunity to know where I don't wanna work again.
bad,Definitely a job to use a stepping stone until you find your dream job. Always meeting new people. Management goes by own set of rules.
bad,Typical day at Walmart consist of helping customers and maintaining work space. Also maintain the safety of our customers. The most enjoyable is helping customers and making them happy.
bad,"terrible job, no benefits, pay under wage. There's not much more to say. Walmart is a horrible place to shop and a worse place to be employed. Working your butt off for peanuts"
bad,They treat there cart pushers rudely even when we were having bad thunderstorms with hail and heavy winds the still required you to stay outside picking up carts
bad,Absolutely the worst place to work!  They don't care about their employees and will screw you over every chance they could! They have no medical leave or care bout any medical conditions
bad,"They did not staff as many people as they needed. when i was pregnant they refused to move me to a slighly easier job or give me the less active jobs in my department. I had a miscarrage because they rifused to take my doctors concerns seriously. there was one good manager but even on the days that he was who we reported to, they had him covering three other managers butts."
bad,"I loved working for WalMart only because of the customers, i loved doing customer service and helping others but i did not agree with how management treated employees."
bad,"Worst job I have ever had. Incompetent management team, No room for advancement. Instead of promoting with in, store manager had transfers come in from other stores. My  health insurance was 12 percent of my income. A lot of drama. Denied vacation time (after three years of employment. Coaching system is totally unfair. Totally pathetic."
bad,"major, major, major, major, major improvement needed. This place definitely does not care about their employees. The pay is awful. And the daily work schedule does not allow you to have a life."
bad,"Walmart was a good way to get back on my feet, but that's about it. I hated the fact that they lied about every new employee getting at least $10 starting out. You actually only get $9 and you get bumped up to $10 once you do Pathways. This is Walmart's training program that takes more than 6 months usually. The manager would constantly harass me even when I'm doing my job. The manager would also never give me any time off even if I put in time off 3 months in advance. Also, Walmart constantly would pull you from your department to go do work in other sections you have no knowledge of. Meantime, while you're over there your department is usually unmanned because Walmart never has enough people on staff for the day. That means I had to do 3 people's work most of the time. I was the photo lab associate initially, but I also had to be an electronics associate unofficially, get fish out the fish tank, work freight, be cashier up front, and cart pusher. Unless you are desperate for cash and are willing to take $9 an hour and lack of hours available on your work schedule don't bother. Trust me I worked there for 6 months and I can honestly say you're better off being a garbage man cus at least they get paid more."
bad,its not what walmart use to be. the management went down hill. i transfered from tx to az and when i got to az they didnt accept my transfer so i was struggling in a new state and town with no job.
bad,Some are unorganized cut hours they have a lot of favoritism they wouldn't give transfer when you need help they don't help you they ignore you and treat you like a child
bad,"it was a good job at the time but i was looking for more benfits for my famliy an Iand i was Responsible for loading and unloading trucks, assisting the customers with carry outs when needed, maintaining a clean store, keeping shelves stocked and keeping a good work attitude with co-workers."
bad,Working for walmart overnight is not something i saw myself doing. typical day of work is coming in working with my team and getting the job done hardest part is trying to work and give customer service at the same time.
bad,"A typical day at work would be arriving and immediately clocking in and beginning work. Often times if a new manager was on that day, many of us would have to walk them through what they had to do, and assist them in doing their job, on top of doing our own. I didn't learn anything positive or helpful from this job. The management was under trained, if they were trained at all, and instead of doing their jobs, had the overnight maintenance crew do it for them, or instruct them on how to do it. I didn't get along well with my co-workers and chose to do my own tasks each night to avoid conflict. The hardest part of the job was dealing with incompetence. The most enjoyable part of the job was clocking out."
bad,"Don't do it. They show you fancy positions and joys of working in retail, but this taught me about my hatred for people. Don't let Walmart take away years of your life."
bad,"absolutely the most horrible company to work for. "
bad,Bad job bad experience just over all a pretty bad experience the only thing it did for me is give me money while going to school
bad,It was a very good job to work at.  Also it was easy to get along with the coworkers and the managers . I also love the hour breaks we got to to take and the raise we got. The hours was very good to.
bad,Low pay but they ask a lot from their workers. No room for growth in this company and the management is not good with business.
bad,"I loved it at first, it seemed perfect. Then I began to regret it later on in the months. I do NOT recommend. The managment was very poor and would just sit in the backroom and talk about other employees and customers. If you need help, expect to sit at your register with a full line for at least 20 minutes before they decide to get up and help."
bad,the job that is required to be done and the pay that the they are willing to pay is not worth the stress and the enviornment and people worked with is more hostel than fun.
bad,"Walmart is not a place to work. It's gross and we had rats and mold in the back.Co-Workers go on breaks to often, smoking weed and tobacco in store freezers and coolers. Workers have bad attitudes. They make you do there work. Just not a good job."
bad,"Some employees get exceptions while others suffer the consequences  "
bad,"IF you have bills (like everyone else) than it isn't bad. The pay isn't terrible. But if you don't get along with the management team, than you're work day will be really rough."
bad,"I had a shoulder injury that slowed my work, and caused me to have trouble lifting heavier items like big pack of bottled water and big dog food bags. After it had some time to heal, it hardly hurts now. Had good coworkers. Rarely saw store manager..."
bad,"management is unfair. often do not get paid for work, and to get the money costs 30% of the missed pay. Condescending management."
bad,The managers and supervisors had attitude problems and wouldn't help out when the store got extra busy. They would pull employees from different departments to help on register and expect for them to get there work done as well.
bad,"although there is room to grow at this company, including an employee discount, they need you to work every weekend with no full time employment. i was never granted any days i asked for off, and it took a big toll on my family life"
bad,"The environment is horrible. The managers are rude. They act like just because they are the manager the have the right to belittle you and be rude to you. The pay is terrible as well"
bad,One of the worst jobs. Management has no respect for others and strong favorites among co workers makes moving up impossible. Over worked and treated poorly by managers on shift. Move of upper management do not provide proper equipment to complete tasks such as pump jacks and telzon guns in working order
bad,"The store I was with was very very biased towards the opposite gender also unhealthy work conditions And habits, no management to talk to or find when employees would need them"
bad,"Lazy co-workers and useless management. Underpaid and overworked with no real advancement for many people unless you brown nose the useless and overpaid  management,"
bad,"You are on a be here schedule. Long hours, store manager will expect you do get the job done whether there are associates or not. Hourly's are overworked and underpaid for the task they are given."
bad,"management protects their own. "
bad,worst job i have ever had. they don't give care about their employees what so ever. I was managed horribly and no one ever took into consideration that employees have lives outside of work
bad,"Worse job I've had in the past 20 years.  Management needs proper training from somewhere other than “Walmart University” and needs to learn how to speak to and respect their employee's, too much drama and a hostile work environment in a negative work environment and ZERO opportunities for stability.  Pay is several dollars less per hour than competitors, no time and half pay on holidays, PTO/sick time needs a major overhaul.  Hours have been constantly cut in the last 3 Months never received more than 35 hours per Week as a full time employee.  Any and all complaints are ignored by management and their standard response is “we are retail”.  They expect employee's to be available to work with an open schedule 24 hours a day 7 days a Week and when you change your availability they will just not schedule you for work and replace you with a new employee."
bad,"Managers and co-workers are terrible to work with over all walmart is a horrible company that does not care about its employees."
bad,"This company started out as a good place for me to work, then it slowly but surly started going down hill quick. Management could care less about their employees and their medical conditions. Nor, did they care about their employees opinions on stuff."
bad,no hablo mal de la empresa porque mi renuncia fue voluntaria por el ambiente que ya se vivia hay
bad,"Manager's pick on hourly employee's. No team work. Manager's love to belittle everyone under them. There's favoritism big time, no equal opportunity. People that works there the longest gets paid less then the new people that starts. I had lived in lodi and was traveling to rancho cordova to work and management didn't care about me enough to say keep up the good work or anything but get cursed out everyday by customers and team members even when I transferred to the one in lodi."
bad,The only positive thing I got from Walmart was the friends I made and the life skills you learn from working for a place as bad as Walmart.
bad,Decent job for HS and college kids to make some extra money. Min skill job that it is highly standardized and requires unnecessary emotional labor.
bad,"Walmart is the worst company to work for. The management teams are lazy and won't hesitate to treat any and every employee like trash. Most of them don't even know what they're doing and shouldn't be in the position they are in. They say they are all about family but only the Walmart family. God forbid you have a family emergency and can't make it to work that day, you just lost your job. The only way to advance is to be a brown nose, who cares about good workers. Such a joke."
bad,"managers did not care about there emplyees. did not pay enough, "
bad,"this is a horrible company to work for"
bad,This company was so horrible I felt stuck because I had no skills at the time. I finally got a break ad offered another job somewhere else and was blessed to move on.
bad,"Well, I don't really know where to start with this one. I mean we all know it's walmart so you've gotta deal with the public in a certain way that can be uncomfortable as well as managers that always want more, more, more while giving/doing very little in return, especially when you are a strong backed young man like me they start putting you to hard work for minimum wage, and this is coming from someone who prides/loves hard work, just not when it is served with a side of disrespect and lowest posi ble wages/pay raises"
bad,"A typical day at my job involves stocking shelves, straightening shelves, helping customers, and cutting fabric. I learned that cutting fabric is a fun thing to do when your customers are so nice. Management is pretty good for working with associates. The coworkers are awesome. The hardest part of the job is the heavy lifting. The best part is interacting with the customers."
bad,Management would put you with new people when you were fairly new yourself expecting people to still meet quota this is a terrible place to work. Would not recommend.
bad,Most walmarts will go through people faster then they can hire. Working for them can either go well or will be soul draining. I would not recommend working for them unless its all that is around.
bad,"My experience there was new and not very comfortable, to many people don't know ho to mind their business, very slow place, and no communication at all."
bad,Went through multiple managers in my short time there all were rude and treated us horribly and if you do not like retail or customer service I would not recommend working here.
bad,the absolute company to work for.  management doesnt care about its employees and getting time off is like pulling teeth.  you arent really assigned to anywhere specific in the store but are expected to know every fine detail about everything in the store.
bad,My time at Wal-Mart was something of an experience. My co-workers were more interested in trying to find ways to trick the system into letting them pay $5 for a new game that just came out rather than actually doing their job. Also management has this ability to completely ignore your school schedule and have you scheduled to come in to work 10 minutes after your class across campus from your dorm let out and would get mad about me being late. They didn't understand the fact that school came before work to me so I left.
bad,"Interaction with different type of customers and possibility to develop my merchandiser skills."
bad,"what do you expect terrible pay, terrible management. But its entry level job requires more than you get paid but its part time if this is your career i feel bad for you."
bad,"Unorganized company, bad HR representatives, unprofessional and questionable ethics. Managers don't listen, employees always complaining for nothing, bad pay for the work you do."
bad,stocked shelves i did not learn anything except for how to not mange people. The co workers were great. Hardest part of the job would be dealing with managements attitudes on a daily basis. most enjoyable part of job n/a
bad,The people were rude and the management was inadiquit. Will never woke here again. You are over worked and under payed and they treat you like animals.
bad,"If you been with this company a long time you don't move up. You don't grow. You can't nourish, flourish or blossom. You can be very well qualified for the upcoming position and they'll hire someone outside than within the company"
bad,"Store did not work as a team."
bad,a living nightmare that exactly what this job felt like. i worked everyday weekends to and i was in school. the manager messed with every guy in there and steals from the drawer
bad,no growth with company. nothing else to say. I feel stuck and unimportant to the company. we feel just like a number to the stock holders and even upper management
bad,They dont treat staff rigth and dont give hours. management says all different things no one is consistant no trainning mostly is figuring yourself how to do the job
bad,They have no respect for their employees or their needs. You could be laying in a bed dying and they would expect you to be at work.
bad,"A wonder stepping stool. learning how to do a grand opening was amazing . starting with a empty store . having a good store manager is a plus "
bad,"Bad management with terrible attitudes. Bad customer service, due to associate hours being cut and no one is there to help the customer. Most of management don't care about the associate or the customer. Very unprofessional."
bad,stay away from this store if you ever want to get in and out try self checkout otherwise your waiting along time to be rung up not enough staff to ring
bad,It is horrible need I say more. I started there when the store first opened and it started off great. Soon after it started to decline with a quickness. There was times that I would be covering 3 departments and running a register in one night just to get in trouble by my manager the next day for being out of my department for too long. S then I would be made to go to the back and unload a truck. Word to the wise stay in your department and help direct customers from where you are to save some of the back pain that you could possibly feel.
bad,"My thoughts and feelings about this Walmart was not a good one. I worked only for the remodeling crew and we constantly found ourselves throughout the doing customer service. That's not a bad thing, but that put our crew behind. "
bad,Terrible company. Doesn't care about their employees. Doesn't properly equip you for the job or task. Not a place where I'll recommend for anybody to work. Truly a slave in the corp.
bad,It was fast pace making orders management was not the great they were never around they lack employees  always closing at night one person did too many things
bad,I transferred from the Walmart in Canton and I absolutely miss and loved it there . But when I came to the Walmart in Phoenix on Lowerbuckeye to work they took me through alot  . going to work there was stressful . I spent plenty of days running to the rest room in tears .
bad,"nada"
bad,"terrible place to work they did not care when I was pregnant and made me sit in the heat when I wasn't feeling good. otherwise the job was just cashiering, pruning and watering plants, doing end caps, restocking craft area and organizing shelving and go backs. when I tried coming back for maternity leave they refused to work with me a new availability schedule and told me I would have to start at work then change my availability."
bad,"This is not a good place to work. management does not care about the employees, and neither does the company, overall a very negative work atmosphere."
bad,"When I first started it was great but I crossed trained in other areas and was promised a raise management kept blowing me off and cutting my hours I was hired for full-time I wasn't even working part-time hours, went and talked with management and they let me go for no reason told me I was being unprofessional like seriously."
bad,You aren't appreciated.  You are asked to do more and more every day.  Management does not acknowledge a good job.  They do not address problems.  You are required to do others work when they don't come in.  You are not given the tools and equipment needed to do your job and then reprimanded when you don't do it.
bad,"Expected to move mountains without the appropriate equipment or man power. Learned how to stock and work quickly. No personal touch with management, they treated us as if we were disposable."
bad,My job is very inconsistent and there is no communication whatsoever.  Walmart wants people to think that it is a wonderful place to work for.  WRONG!!!!!
bad,"payed all the bills , did all the research on vendors , took care of the p i corrected mistakes, took care of management i was the go to girl !"
bad,This experience alone with how the store was ran was horrible. It lacked everything a regular Family Dollar provided. The staff was horrible. Store infested with rodents and no one ever wanted to work
bad,"A typical day was to cashier and sometimes work the service desk if they were short handed.  I learned how to be a good cashier and help the customers.  I can't say anything good about management because when I left in January we didn't actually have anyone.  My co-workers were nice to work with.  The hardest part of the job was having to work on Thanksgiving.  But I know it was a part of my job, that's what I did.  The most enjoyable part of my job was my paycheck."
bad,"Management there is lowdown, scandalous and lower that whale snot.  I would never want to work for a company that has such poor management teams.  They are liars and do underhanded things."
bad,Working for this location was not enjoyable. The store manager needs to be replaced. The organization is bad and the under cover security is a joke. The amount of racism the managers let employeesget away with makes me sick
bad,"This Walmart is an awful place to work at, work ethic is not valued.  Drama is the center of the workplace and there is no conflict resolution."
bad,I was required to preform work for multiple departments without assistance from other employees or upper management while still having to run and protect my own department. I was worked through the majority of my lunches and had no breaks
bad,"Trabajo por necesidad,pero cuatro días,no es suficiente,atropellan mucho a los asociados,no vale la pena"
bad,The hardest parted of this job is being stereo typed and treated unfair because of your color. Only valuable thing I learned was how to use the power equipment. The days were good when I was made to do the truck or get picked on because of my color
bad,"Did not care for working for WalMart.  They do not treat their employee's well, no benefits, wages, and hours.  I would not go back there an work for WalMart or even Sams due to how they treat their employees."
bad,"The overall work environment is good, but management there is horrible. They are not on one accord. A bad management team can ruin a good working team."
bad,"My type of day is pay day because it feels good to have money coming in and being to spend it. I learned how to meet and greet my co workers and customers ,and I think they are very nice."
bad,"This company does NOT value it's employees."
bad,"I worked at a full service WalMart SuperCenter.  It was extremely busy.  The hardest part of the job was moving constantly for your entire shift.  "
bad,"was maintenance but had to stock,zone,push carts,load unload trucks,forklift,back haul, and any thing else they could through at you. if they new I could count past five I would of cashiered."
bad,"I work in the Deli/Bakery area and they have refused to give me raise even though everyone is getting paid $1.50 more than me and i am only at $9 an hour."
bad,I had dr notes saying that I couldn't do certain things due to being pregnant and they just didn't care all they don't care about their employees they just care about their money
bad,The management only worry about themselves. The managers talk to you as if you are not human. They allow customers to do so as well. you have no separate life. You have to work basically all day everyday. There are never holidays off if you're new at walmart. Only older employees and management get holidays off. Pay is only average because of the new law that's makes them pay you 10 dollars a hour.
bad,"A typical work day at this location is difficult even if you work as a team and get freight out and zone when management asks. "
bad,"work at Walmart was frustrating as the management was not communicative with each other and very poorly with workers , some of my co-workers were good hard working people while others were more interested  in finding ways to avoid jobs they disliked or to push work off on others , the hardest part of the job was dealing with manager's and assistant manager's who could not decide on how they wanted things done as well as the stress caused due to low pay and few hours , the best part of the job was dealing with customers"
bad,A typical day at Walmart is great. I have learned how to operate a cash register. Management is great always looking to help. My co-workers are great. There is no hard part at about this job.
bad,They treat you like if your no one. Very rude. Disrespectful to anyone. They find the smallest excuse to let you go if they don't like you. They don't care if how long you've been there they'll let you go in a heart beat knowing people apply there everyday!
bad,"The job itself is not that bad, it is the management that is poor. It is as if you are in high school again but worse. I do not recommend working with the walmart on 146 in Baytown TX"
bad,"This is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. They say they are flexible and provide training for new associates, which is false. If you do a good job, that usually means you get the job load of 3 put on your shoulders."
bad,Review on Walmart very un professional type of work environment will never work for the Walmart company again! Disrespectful staff a very negative work environment. They work you to death expect you to work strang odd hours without giving you any benefits they start you off at $9 a hour but tell you you get your $1 raise after 90 days a bunch of bull. There are no pros or good feed back from me to Walmart
bad,A typical day at work was horrible i hated it because of my work partners. Management had very unprofessional skills.I learned nothing positive from this job.I only enjoyed the customers because seeing them happy made me happy.
bad,"Walmart has been the most stressful place to be an employee of, the management never follows the actual rules set and instead makes up their own. They never have enough people scheduled to actually work the jobs assigned to associates. Instead they just have the people they did schedule do the job of three. Horrible place to work at."
bad,"My coworkers where nice and all but management was lousy, they never gave you a sort of fixed schedule and if you wanted time off and you requested it, most of the time it would be given a no. They made you work long hours for only minimum wage. They don't treat there employees very well and the 10% they give isn't really worth it because you can't use it on food."
bad,"I have nothing nice to say about this company."
bad,They don't care about their employees at all. The management doesn't do their job and expects you to do it for them with less pay. You will be made to do jobs that aren't in your job title and if you refuse they will use any and every reason to fire you and push you out.
bad,"i was a stocker and i was very sick and could not work i called the store and the lady said if you feel like you cannot work call in sick, so i did, the next time i went in to work i was called into the back room and pretty much degraded by being told im to young to be calling in and should have come in to work anyways so i guess walmart dosent care if the customers caught my cold and pink eye, then i was basically bashed on by having 3 people tell me they arent impressed with how i was doing my work when my trainer was telling me i was doing a good job and was catching on fast. was just a clusterf-ck, no wonder they dont want you to join a work union."
bad,Walmart is very unfair to employee they want employee to work holidays with time and half pay don't post new jobs thought out the store give to PET employees
bad,"They say that they are a family oriented work force. Yet they fire those whom have family emergencies. They do not care if you get hurt, they will replace you and deny your w.c. claim. I would suggest working elsewhere."
bad,I feel that the morale there could be a little mored happy.  I feel that the management staff see us as numbers instead of people.  They never say hello and never talk to you.  They just talk to you when they want you to do something and I don't think that's right.  You should love the place you work in and I pretty much love the people I work with in the pharmacy dept but the whole entire store can be run a little bit better
bad,"I  liked meeting people and helping them get things done. A lot of days it was a very hostile place to be.Coworkers would leave their work area and but extra burdens on the those that were at their work stations. To be very blunt,Walmart treats the people that work there like dirt and little better than indentured employees with  no place to go and no life outside of Walmart."
bad,"I worked Walmart store 1966 in Geneseo NY for almost a year. I was hired at full time only part time hours. The managers are lazy, complacent and don't care about safety or even doing their jobs. They spend all their time on their cell phones hiding in offices in the back. When I would inform them of major issues, safety issues or not having the equipment to do my job they just rolled their eyes at me and walked away. They are so badly understaffed because most people quit before their 90 days are completed! There is a lot of favoritism at Geneseo Walmart especially among night managers.  The best thing I ever did was quit. Walmart doesn't care about their associates only how much work they can get out of them for little pay. They like to play the blame game, especially Arlene who doesn't do her job! She is made aware of the issues and ignores you or makes up excuses for her lack of management! If you are a female she is harder on you than the guys! Walmart as a company is a bunch of liars and full of back stabbing!"
bad,"I was one of the only employees to make it even a year there. I was scheduled to work anywhere between 5:00 am to 10:00pm and usually 6 days a week. I wasn't allowed to work more than 32 hrs, so I was often scheduled for several 4 or 6 hr shifts."
bad,Company dosent care about employees. pay is awful and Management dosent  care. They only care about Credit Cards and making money. Customers are rude and expect everything for free. No health insurance if you don't have enough hours.
bad,This store was not a super center so they were able to get away with anything. The store assistant manager had to sue Wal-Mart just to keep her job. This is the worst place i have ever worked.
bad,overworked and underpaid and under appriciated. nothing went the way it was supposed to and there is always a bigger issue. If you follow policy you get yelled at by customers if you dont then you get in trouble by management
bad,"a typical day of work for me is going to the backroom and figuring out were they want me at (normally foods or pets of chemicals). i do go backs, stock stuff for each department, zone each department and do fright. (although i was originally appeal and got switched without permission)"
bad,"I mean even in the training videos they tell you not to form a union. You can't have a drink at your cash register not even water unless you have a note from a doctor  you can't have a bathroom break. The shifts are very long, the management takes forever to come help you if you need it. They just do not care about their employees at all what do ever. Do not work at Walmart for any position unless you just cannot find another job dude it's the worst job I've ever had and I worked in Bojangles."
bad,I love Walmart treat the employees great I would work there again if I have to go to Walmart for all your needs  I love the hours the pay and the people its really a great company
bad,"Walmart is a horrible company. Everyday was a nightmare, I had to double work myself because no one would work. Management was lazy and bias as h*ll. I got coaching and fired over someone not working. It is a slave company and does not give two f*cks about their associate. The only people who ""Enjoy/love"" the company are those white people who automatically get an management job. They only want money and will milk you of everything you have until they decide to lie and get rid of you. If they don't like you, they will make it hard for you to get a job by lying. They cleared out a whole department claiming they stole when one associate stole and left the company weeks before. Everything was horrible. I do not recommend the job to anyone."
bad,Walmart does not care about there employees they do anything in there power to rip u off. I wish i could say my experience was a good experience working there but truth be told it was not
bad,"Great opportunities within the company it just depends on what walmart store you are employeed with. The store I worked at didn't allow part-time employees to get over 30 hours per week, even if you are needed to cover for other employees."
bad,"It was a dead end job, everybody was miserable there is no upside to working here nothing to learn, nothing to experience this job made me miserable and hate working there."
bad,Used physically disabled employees in physically stressing positions. Discriminated on job positions based off of gender. Poor training or unwillingness to follow corporate standards for employee training.
bad,Honestly the worst job I ever had. They treated their employees like numbers instead of human beings. Plus their management did nothing to stop it because they were all friends.
bad,"While I've enjoyed working with most of the Associates, Management is a whole other story. When they say ""flexible schedule,"" they mean for them and not for you."
bad,If all you do is wanna work then that's the place for you. As a salary member of management your always on call so don't matter what you do where your located you always have to report to work when called in NY it was never like that but in AtL it was the worst working down in these parts and Walmart was supposed to be the same everywhere you went which was not true at all
bad,Management is unprofessional. They act like they are in high school and form cliques and the people that are in good with them are the ones that get promoted.
bad,Walmart is a good company to work for they just have a very high turn over people quit and get fired everyday. They also treat certain people better then other they have favoritism there.
bad,working for wal-martoverall jus did not like the experience. the management was not being fair and i wouldnt consider working there again.
bad,"Not enough pay, hard labor, and not enough benefits were available. Management was hostile and the work environment was toxic."
bad,"Store manager needs to get more invole with associates, and stop being closed minded... as long as that store manager is there that store is not going to succeed in profit"
bad,"I hope no managers are seeing these reviews because im sure im not alone when i say these are very big wastes of time.  Im sorry im not on these to advertise jobs for others.  However in a work place is different , right now i have no team."
bad,I found the job to be challenging. The co-workers were always to lend a hand. The company did  a great for the local community.I was able to travel and help other stores
bad,"I was extremely disappointed and I wouldn't recommend anyone to work at Wal-Mart, waste of my time and education. I wouldn't even recommend my kids to work at Wal-Mart that's how bad my working experience was at Wal-Mart"
bad,Didn't care for working here mainly because of the way management handles things. They don't treat their employee's very good. Wouldn't work there again.
bad,"Good learning experience with new positions , Nice Customers to help out. Some but not all Workers willing to help you out on team effort tasks. But Definitely would never work there again. Looking for Better Rate jobs."
bad,The new management doesn't know what to do so the employees have to do everything and employees that work hard for the company and pass their test to get promoted the management pass them by and hire and promote their friends and family
bad,The management ment is poor. Also they will change your schedule and not let you know so you get a point. They dont care if your family is dying. They find any reason and they will fire you.
bad,when I first started Walmart I was a piece with the job I had but months came down the line and the management started showing there true colors they started being rude and nasty and talking to the employees any kind of way and being very disrespectful so I had to leave the kind of person I am if I feel like I'm being disrespected on a job I should leave I'm not saying I cant take it but I had to leave that was a job I did not want to have
bad,"I worked for Wal-Mart for 2 years.  Made some great friends but management is the absolute WORST!  Management seriously needs training in how to communicate with people.  Too much favoritism.  Lazy people benefit more than the people that bust their behinds.  Corporate doesn't care.  Since my experience with working, for this corp.  i have boycotted Wal-Mart and will not shop there...ever again."
bad,Not a friendly place to work. People in management come across as up tight and seem to think they are so much better than you. Not a good experience.
bad,"Stocking,zoning,customer service,price changes,changing end caps,"
bad,"its just a stupid job, with petty people, who bark about petty things and cant stop complaining. they have the ability to quit their job and move on but they dont"
bad,"Company has no morals, respect, accountability or responsibility. Horrible incompetent company. Hate it. Managers and store manager are idiots."
bad,"Company has gotten greedy and has cut any program that used to support their associates. They keep cutting jobs and have they few that work there pick up extra workload. New associates start out at high wages but company does not seem to reward their loyal, longterm associates with pay increases."
bad,"A typical work day at Wal-Mart was not the best, the managers at the one that I worked at were always gossiping about others all the time, when it would be time for your break they wouldn't relieve you, completely strict rules that would jeopardize your employment, they were ALWAYS talking about how you can get fired, not how you can advance and then they fired me 3 days before my probation period ended."
bad,"Walmart is not an employee friendly company.  They do not back up their employees.  Maybe stores other than the one I worked at are better, but this is the only one I have experience with."
bad,"Pay wasn't good enough & hours weren't convenient...left for a better job.  Third shift hours are not compatible with my lifestyle/school hours.  Management did not communicate on a professional level, neither did the co-workers.  Conflict was not dealt with in a timely/appropriate manner. I stocked the shelves on the over night shift and I felt that we could not focus on the customers needs. Having an income was the most enjoyable part of my job."
bad,"Lack of respect. "
bad,Stressful place to work and discriminating towards pregnant people they make exceptions if you're a guy though.  If not you're a liability to them and they rather not have you.
bad,Clock in and go to a meeting. Followed by going to the aisle and down stacking our pallets to stock. Stock the merchandise and front the products. Greet customers on the aisles. Assist customers with issues or guide customers to the correct help section. Poor management and not a team work friendly environment.
bad,I did not enjoy working at Wal Mart at all. The people i worked with were nice but the bosses were nor very efficient. it was an ok and had a flexible schedule but other than that it was not a very fun and enjoyable place to work
bad,"i hated working here. managers are rude, cant move up unless you work there for most of your life. the work it self is the worst, never ending baskets and baskets full of items you need to put back"
bad,"They work you too hard, u make nothing. The managers treat you horrible.  This is a horrible place to work. I would never let my kids work here when the grow up"
bad,"Terrible to thier employees not a company I want to work for long term"
bad,This job was not difficult. However i didn't like it. Management was completely sow and extremely rude. they were very scolding and careless. there wasn't enough support.
bad,Worst place to work management sucks the money wasnt worth it for working in a auto shop. Walmart doesnt follow there own policys when it comes to working on cars my last day i was underminded by managment on a vehicle that had issues with their tires.
bad,I started out as an overnight receiving associate then I moved to daytime cashier when I went back to school. Overnight we would work the freight for the general merchandise part of the store.
bad,"not a place to make a career, they will use you till you make too much and then cut their ties and replace you with someone they can pay less, will work you like 50 people only being one.Nice start up job, but nothing long lasting"
bad,This job was very demanding. I learned a majority of customer service from working here on how to deal with different types of customers.
bad,"A day's work can be  tedious and stressful and sometime pleasant."
bad,"horrible place would not recommend this place to anyone, they don't care about their workers and never issue breaks on time. the store manager is very inconsiderate"
bad,"The worst place I have every worked. "
bad,The culture was terrible and the management was ignorant. The management would tell you to your face that you are replaceable. The pay was not enough for what you put up with. They underpay and you are part time they expect the world from you for minimum wage.
bad,"Not a terrible place to work, but got nothing out of it. I felt like I was just a number working there, like no one really knew my name or who I was."
bad,I'm glad I am out of there. I never once felt appreciated for anything. Management has gotten worse over time. Walmart is the perfect place to stay away from if you can find something else.
bad,I worked hard and they treat me wrong. Rude managers and discriminating against my color so looking forward to working somewhere that treats me with respect and doesn't discriminate against color.
bad,i would recommend this job to people that are young that are collage and that seeking a job opportunity and it just depend the experience to determine how much pay would be and the work hours it still depend if your full time or part time
bad,when you come in you go straight to the truck and unload. separate freight according to where it goes on the floor. take freight out to floor stock shelf's and pick up receiving dept. Good co-workers. they should bump up the pay. hardest part unloading the truck. easiest part stocking shelf's.
bad,"Only take this job if you are desperate for a little money. They say it's easy to move up, but you have to suck up to do it. The work/life balance is terrible."
bad,They just drop me in the back with little to no training which is fine but they never told me what they wanted me to do. I would try to learn from senior employees cause mgmt was never around. Most my fellow employees would just ignore me.
bad,I really enjoyed working for wal- mart. we have a meeting almost everyday before your shift to pump you up and keep you aware of things going on in the store. All the managers are great and will help you advance if you desire to.
bad,"a typical work day can be challenging, I've learned how to keep calm when under pressure & problem solving skills. Being in management can be challenging and rewarding. coworkers are nice civilian's, the hardest part of the job is calming down an irate customer. most enjoyable part of the job is giving out quality customer service an sending them off with a warming smile, knowing they have enjoy their shopping experience."
bad,"it's been an enlightening experience, my typical day starts with turning on the self check out machines, and making sure the area is clean and ready for customer use. the rest of the day consists of helping and directing customers, fixing machines, and cleaning in and around self check out. I've learned alot about customer service, being an adult and life in general. My co workers are the best part of the job. management is friendly and helpful. the hardest part of the job is dealing with the machines when they break down. the most enjoyable part is meeting new people every day."
bad,"There is not much to say other than it takes your soul and crushes it! It is always stressful, and nothing is ever good enough for the managers. Even when things are done correctly they want you to undo them and redo them 100 times and then they want it done their way no the companies way which is what it is called for. Working here is a joke"
bad,"Walmart is a good employer, but needs to improve in other areas of management. Their management style is not taught in college. Most management majors have no clue on how Walmart treats its people. Many people get fired from Walmart for doing stupid things such as stealing money, coming in late to work, or by having too much overtime. Today, Walmart has pay increases to its workforce, but some critics say it benefits only the new employees, not senior employees. I would give Walmart a higher rating, but the company needs to improve on how they treat the general public and their employees. When I was at Walmart, I had to pay for most of my equipment for being a cart pusher. Walmart would not pay me back for my purchase of equipment. They did not provide me a decent water supply when working outdoors in the heat. This treatment of employees concerning outdoor work is wrong in my view. I had to use my own hard earned money to purchase water and gatorade for fellow cart pushers."
bad,I did good work with them store and up closing remodeling just was far after my car broke down no help to get back in forth to work
bad,"While I was employed here, I never felt like more than a low-rung peon. A typical day of work consisted of clocking in only to be immediately ordered around and treated menially, only to be ignored by management for sometimes a half an hour while waiting on necessary additional service in order to adequately take care of valuable customers."
bad,"First job which had lead to me to be better in my field of experience in whatever field that i will purse, to also uplift myself to better one day."
bad,"It was friendly, but not everyone was helpful or paced for good qualities. It was always stressful because of the drama. I learned that managers are not helpful at all. Some co-workers were alright more then others. The hardest part was not having weekends off. I enjoyed my customers of all things."
bad,"They like to say that they are all about their employees and customers, but they are really about the money and how they can rip people off. They pay the employees and substandard amount of money they wouldn't even count as a livable wage. They demand that you always be available to work to the point that you cant make plans to be with family or friends. If you request time off they penalize you for it."
bad,"Horrible place to work. management is a mess, one tells you to do something, the other one tell you not to listen to the other and another one tells something else and in the end you end up paying the consequences. the first thing they tell you is when hired is that you do not get out of your area or department, but once you got to the sales floor they would send you to all departments."
bad,"Get out while you can. Sure a job may be nice, but Walmart is NOT the company you wanna spend your life at. Management was disorganized and awful. I once witnessed them gathered around talking about my shift in a nasty way. All while I was an aisle over. One of the managers was even sitting on the floor like nothing was needed to be done! The work was hard, and I was paid the exact same as a cashier??? That makes no sense, so please if you have to work here don't stay for very long. Unless you happen upon a fabled ""decent"" Walmart to work for."
bad,They yell at you for every tiny little thing they think that they hirer robot don't waste your time trust me it's not worth the pain
bad,"Management was constantly turned over and minimal, at best. Duties were unclear and inconsistent. Compensation was sub-standard for the level of work preformed."
bad,The managers would always contradict what another manager told the sales associate to do so there was always miscommunication.
bad,"Yo le daría un -4 por la mala actitud gerencial que hay,  así como pésima cultura negrera y explotadora, esto lógicamente no les importa puesto que siempre corren al personal y lo cambian por uno nuevo"
bad,Walmart refused to give a consistant schedule to work with school hours and study time. Only Full time employees could pick their schedules. Part time employees had full time hours but not with the same benefits. They work you like a dog with only few employees.
bad,liked the tle job enjoy working on cars and thats what i did when i was there the co workers all got along and enjoyed the day made it go faster and not drag on
bad,presion laboral y acoso y presion no dejan hacer las cosas bien
bad,"ne sont pas capable de respecter nos disponibilités! "
bad,"The work ethnics go unnoticed by all management. The CEO of Walmart should take a week off and come be just a regular person at Walmart for about a week and see how it REAL IS. Example of how a work night goes....Ok you have 12 hours of freight in HBA to throw and you need to do top stock, zone, and do all of returns HBA and don't forget to take the cardboard to the compactor in GM and the plastic to the compactor at grocery. All this needs to be done in your 8 hour shift and your all alone."
bad,"I was not a good fit for this job, we had to work alone no talking. I like a job that you know when you leave you done something that matters. this was not the job."
bad,"I wasn't tried right at this job. The management had better things to do to do then to help their employees and train them. I was trained for only a few days by co worker I had at the time. She had an attitude the whole time and short temper. She helped me a little but not enough. I don't blame her, a manager should be training me."
bad,"Poor pay, management, lazy co workers, working here one of the worst decisions i have ever made do not apply you have been warned."
bad,"will not work here again and I was miserable here"
bad,"Not family oriented like they state. Belittled you. Always regretted coming into work. Didn't feel appreciated. Couldn't use doctor notes"
bad,i have wanted to work for a company that cares for family.i learned that walmart dont care.we were always short handed with workers...at times not finishing all the work.they didnt allow overtime  which that what was needed to get the work done.i am a good worker...a hard worker...i willl and can prove it.
bad,Everything is bad in that company. I like a zombie work place. I wii never work there again if i dont have to. The managers dont care about workers is all about money.
bad,"The management here was rude; they made the work force environment really unbearable. Whenever an associate would ask for help they would say its not there job, and if a customer would ask for help they would refer that customer to an associate; due to the fact that they were to busy. When in reality they were just not in the mood to help that individual."
bad,"Management hawking over you while work is not good, pushed carts in the snow was not pleasing, would be sick from the rain and one of the managers was a demon."
bad,"When initially hired, everything was good working there. As time went on, continual changes with staff & mgmt. created unnecessary conflict. From constant changes in work schedule (time & days), to not having clear (or lack of) communication from mgmt. or staff in regards of work assignment/ products. Overly strict time clock regulations would cause problems with scheduling & mgmt. was not willing to correct the issue. Enjoyed the job I did, as long as I worked on my own. Working with others tended not getting the job done on time, if at all; co-workers either were too slow at task or were not interested in preforming job at all."
bad,I wore many hats when I worked at Wal-Mart. I worked at the cash office and Money center working more than 40 hours a week. Management did not tried to work with you on hours and where extremely rude. The hardest part of the job was it was always busy. The customers made the best of the job.
bad,"Walmart is not a great place to work if you want to have a living wage, benefits, and good mental health. It's busy, low paying, and depressing. Your schedule will be messed with and you will not be able to move up with the company."
bad,The overnight management staff was horrible and they were favoritism. was not a professional working environment. could have been a better place with better staffing.
bad,This company is one of the largest companies in the world while I love to shop here my employment as with many others WAS SIMPLY PUT HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE
bad,"Not a lifetime career. Needs work with maganament and sometimes a struggle to work with the people. If you are looking for a company to work for while in school, this is a great company to work with."
bad,"Given only training for my hired job title of cashier but required to do the job of floor associate, maintenance and door greater. fired if we hit 5th hour but can't leave without relief or okay from the CSMs who will just say 'you have a while before your 5th' even if there is an hour and you are scheduled off after 3.5-4 hours. Was bullied by an assistant store manager out of my job. When I was a temporary hire I was told on my final day that I was being let go in front of customers and that I had to report to a manager in order to be escorted out like I was a criminal when I did nothing to deserve such treatment. Sporadic schedule times and weekly hours. Told that they would work with students but had to drop out or quit in order to keep up with work. They scheduled me during my class hours and finals even after giving them my class schedule and final schedules. Told I was to put Walmart above anything else, can't use any sick days based on rumors that I was never sick even when I was vomiting in the bathroom."
bad,The job was enjoyable in the beginning when we were setting up the store.  There was music we made a lot of new friends.  After the store opened the whole atmosphere changed. No longer to have music on no dancing breaks.  We were pressured to get the merchandise out on the floor as soon as possible as like yesterday.
bad,"I took on a part time job with Walmart, as an opportunity to experience a retail work environment. The Walmart culture pretends to be employee driven, when it is clearly sales and profit driven, at least at the local store level. Managers were inefficient, contradictory and lacked many key abilities for leadership. Store was routinely understaffed, instructions were very poor. I worked for three weeks without meeting my direct manager. In-fighting and personal issues interfered with tasks."
bad,horrible place work associates who I've worked next too have no customer service experience theres a lot of favoritism and no one gets promoted unless all managers like them it isn't decided by the company store
bad,The management is the worst thing about working at walmart. The atmosphere is horrid and morale is terrible. if you think about a job here just run now
bad,not paid enough... not valued enough.. never enough hours.... no benifits..always short handed...never good enough
bad,"Would not Recommend this job to any one . its a shame it actually makes me sick to go there. they force you to do jobs you don't want to do. Its like revolving door, people come and go."
bad,Everyday day a work you learn something new about your work place an about the customers. You learn about how to talk to customers and make the customers to come again next time. The management really sucks at Walmart because they don't really listen to you and you do what you are told to do. the coworkers can be really mean to you according to how their day is going if they having a good day they will be nice to you and if they having a bad day they will be a a... h... to you.
bad,I qualified for a lot of positions there and they denied me I believe because of the color of my skin.. I worked hard for Walmart and was mistreated so badly..
bad,i would go in to do floor maintenance and would have to do my managers job before i could do mine. then if i didn't get mine done on time i would get fussed at and so i quit and went to college.
bad,"I see that a lot of these reviews are decent/good which is great.However for me, working at Wal-Mart was horrible. If you plan on working in the deli well expect busy weekends and a lot of stress. I was a part-time employee working 40 hours a week. My boss kept giving me and all my other co-workers these full time shifts because we were short-staffed. Mainly due to the fact that my boss refused to listen to us with the way things were going in the deli and because my boss wouldn't change our schedules when we actually needed to have days off on certain days. "
bad,"Pay doesn't compensate for work load. There isn't really much of a relationship between management and employee. Not really a training system in place to help you complete your task. No written warnings. No loyalty from company. Culture isn't really there, it's every man for themselves. You don't get any healthcare until after a year of employment. Lunch break is unpaid. Unreal expectations in a shift."
bad,Its hellmart everyone dreads going there. ok place to work worked at 2 made decent money they really need to work with people better on there schedules they really dont understand single moms
bad,This company is good for high school students looking for their first job.  It should not be a destination but a stepping stone.  Each store is different. Pray you have a good management team or else you'll probably quit.
bad,Nearly all of the workers there are condescending and mean.  The management plays favorites.  The hardest part of the job was getting along with co-workers who were constantly trying to irritate you.  I didn't really find anything enjoyable about this job.
bad,"WalMart will turn a good person into a piece of dirt. When you thought you knew depression, hold onto your pants. The management is horrible and doesn't care how they treat their fellow co-workers. God help you if you get an L & I workers claim. If you truly love yourself, don't work their. Find ANY OTHER place to work. Please, do not support such a horrible company."
bad,"Not enough staff, not enough work hours, they have you working in different parts of the store and don't pay you the higher rate for that job."
bad,The managers treat you like slaves. They lie to you about transferring you. They don't respect you and you are not appreciated!
bad,"can be a great place to work at, did not fit my life. i personally would not work there again. they do not care enough about their employees."
bad,Walmart is not a great environment to work. too many chiefs and not enough Indians. I worked at the location in Chesapeake grass field pkwy.
bad,"a typical day consists of customer service, stocking items, inventorying incoming products, intenventorying items, maintaining outdoor & indoor products. with no help of replacements, there are only a few people that worked the rest sit on their butts and get paid the  same as I did but I worked in the lawn & garden area with no ac no extra breaks with the 110 temps. like an employee is suppose to ...with pupose.Management was there if there was an incident or accident otherwise they were never to be seen."
bad,All the managers there are totaly crazy and i dont know unless i absolutely had to if id work there again.
bad,"When you work for this company as an hourly associate and are actually a good hard working employee that really truly makes a point of doing your job correctly to the T it will NOT help you advance, in fact it will put a target on your back to be treated like garbage, borderline being tortured by management. Everything having to do with being treated decently working there is based solely on your rank in the worst popularity contest you'll ever experience. It's 1,000 times worse than high school in that aspect. Laziness and not doing things corectly or even really trying to especially per policy (which they do EVERYTHING possible for being able to look up and read any policy EVER an impossible feat) is what gets people recognition and what moves them up in this company as long as you make sure the store manager is your best friend that's the only thing your treatment and any opportunities to move up in the company will be based on and nothing else. They will find any way to do whatever they want to you and it somehow still be legal, just because you refused to sign the papers to relocate you to a lower position and give u a pay cut it doesn't matter they'll authorize it anyways because it was ok'd and accepted by someone that wasn't you on the computer."
bad,"The company makes it sound like a good place to work to the public, but don't let them fool you. The lousy raises they give along with taking away Sunday premiums and holiday pay and insurance rates going up, I make less money than the previous year.  If at all possible steer clear of this company!"
bad,when i work for wal-mart i saw a lot things that went on there things that could of  been better . the customer  service was okay and the mangers could be been better .
bad,Management treats you like youre less of a person. They have a warped way on what they want to get done. Never enough staff. You youre left alone alot. They expect so much from you and they dont give you all your credit for being a good worker.
bad,worked for woolco and was hired on by Walmart and was good for the first years but then Walmart started to do cuts  made a lot of employess over worked
bad,"Work/Life Balance - Everyone starts just under full time and they never get a set schedule unless they've been there for 2 years or long. Meaning you never have the same days off, Always work different shifts, and work all major holidays. I've had days where I worked until 8pm, Didn't get home until 9, and had to get up the next morning to be at work for 7 am."
bad,It was a very hard company to work for the pay was very low and the management staff disrespect the regular associates. The management staff would work the associates against each other.
bad,it sucked the company has no good benefits and the managers are not fit for the position. Don't work with you on your schedule like they said they would. Never recommend anyone to work there.
bad,"I worked at this Walmart branch campbellsville Kentucky last year as stocking than I qualify for lead position but was my bad luck that I quit cause had lots of bad experience with management some department manager take two break for 30-45 minutes and lunch break for 1 hours and don't do better job just ordered to co-worker to do all they don't care about store manager or anyone also at working time using phone and texting just chill out for rest of day "
bad,Stocking unloading the truck working on cash register helping customers and employees  making sure trash clean up and zoning til the shift ends
bad,"Do not work here. Management is not knowledgeable, does not value employees, and is often hired from outside the company and doesn't understand the culture they are trying to walk into."
bad,It's ok to work for with the right management but obviously we don't live in a perfect world so their are people that take advantage of their power
bad,"Was as okay work environment, just dident like the way management did certain things.  But i would most definitely consider working at another location."
bad,"Walmart was a good first job at first, then they started cutting my hours towards the end i was suppose to get full time never happened. They started making up a bunch of rules towards the end."
bad,"Fun workplace good people good environment"
bad,"Management does not have any people skills in how they communication with the associates. Management expects results from minimal staffing that full staffing would deliver."
bad,first real job I had as a college student didn't manage my time and job to well as a freshman so it was a bit of a struggle for me.
bad,"practically impossible to move up, crazy hours, mandatory holidays, waiting period to transfer departments or locations even if you move out of town, if your good at your job, you get stuck in it so they don't have to find a replacement then train you somewhere else."
bad,No respect for the individual like promised. No ability to move in the company like told. No job security. Bad management. Bad benefits. If you don't kiss butt you get nowhere. If you refuse to brain wash you go nowhere.
bad,"i mean its good hours but you never see your family and im a family person so i didnt like it, i asked for my birthday off after working there for six months or at least a morningshift and they gave me latest shift possible, manager dosent care if you feel like your hours were short or not"
bad,I have worked there for about to months and when you put your availably the will try to make you work and when you bring it up the will cut you down hours.
bad,They don't care at all about you having children emergencies or needing days off sometime. Very selfish and rude management.
bad,"I was the deli manager, yet had none of the responsibilities that would go with the title.  I basically was a stocker.  I ordered items for the shelves and kept them full.  I had no authority over any employee, hiring, firing disciplining, or over any of the systems in place for running of the deli, but was definitely the go-to person when something wasn't running correctly.  I am very conscientious about my job and wanted it to succeed.  The policy at Walmart was to never give overtime, but my job required so much more; I would come in two hours before, stay at least an hour after, but punch in at the correct times just to get some things done that needed to be done.  It was impossible!"
bad,The people are really nice and there is always something that has to be done.  Which has its pros and cons
bad,"You will never have a life and the pay will remind you, "
bad,"They are willing to train you for every department."
bad,"terrible company to work for, i worked 3rd shift at the fulton store in kentucky, i hated every second. we were given a time limit for the fright we had to put up and several times they would give us 45 min to put up 6 pallets of fright and wright us up when we didnt get it done. i learned that if you dont trust a manager, its probably for a good reason, so keep them at arms length. management is terrible, out if the only two good manager we had, one left and the other was abused by the other managers, co-workers were the only good part about the job, i made a lot of good friends their, hardest part was the managers, if they didnt like you, they did everything they could to get rid of you. again the co-workers where the most enjoyable part"
bad,The lighting and atmosphere are depressing. The benefits do not compensate for the inventory restocking and payment you deal with. but you do get a discount i guess.
bad,"management is not great, pay was horrible, favoritism. they have a high turn over rate, customers are rude."
bad,satisfaction of customers experience when able to provide inventory that was in demand. setting up merchandise for optimal shopping experience of customers.
bad,"Look around and see if you notice any happy  people working in the store you shop at."
bad,"management often played the ""favorites"" game.  I often found myself being taken advantage of during my workday. I left after two employees fought and it resulted in one being stabbed"
bad,This is not a good company to work for they do not treat there employees fair or give them proper breaks. I did not like working for them.
bad,This company pays a lot but it is a place you do not want to be everyday. This was something i did wile i was in college and I hate it.
bad,"Wal-Mart is not what it used to be when Sam Walton was alive. It is now an Oppressive Atmosphere for all levels of Employees, from the lowest position to the Manager that is in charge over the entire store."
bad,"Personally, social interaction with fellow employees is not an easy task; during work or break. There is very little communication between hourly and salary. Usually once a month there is a BBQ for employees, but there is little to no interest to attend. Everyone, including customers, is usually in a rotten mood. Having to keep an active desire to work, and smile on, for a nine hour day requires at least six cups of coffee."
bad,"When i first was hired to Walmart as a Courtesy Associate, i was treated well in the beginning because they didn't want me to leave... but i didn't realize that until much later. As months went by my managers didn't know my name and would treat me with no respect or dignity. I did whatever they wanted me to do, even other people's jobs like covering for a people greeter from minutes to hours depending if the greeter was capable of showing up. "
bad,cant get full time or steady shiffs to work been their a year no benifts or a raise giving don't care about the employees at all.
bad,Its not a good place when not only do they expect so much out of you and for you to care when you're already at the bottom rung.
bad,Walmart is place that does encourage growth and advancement. Management attempts to remain fair and impartial but is not always successful. I have nothing more to add
bad,It was good experience and I really enjoyed the work that I did daily. I really would have like to continue working there but their hours were not flexible
bad,One day you work mornings and the next you work till midnight.  No consistency. You would deal with pleasant and unpleasant customers.
bad,"this job was a pretty decent job giving the company it was for sometimes its best to keep it pushing and count your blessings in the previous employer and tough it out,"
bad,"I loved the team I was working with and the role I was playing at Walmart."
bad,"They didn't train properly, they discriminate against people who have disabilities and manager was ignorant."
bad,"no motivation to do a great job, not customer focused, took away breakfast and lunch provision in a store with over 500 employees, unable to do a great job helping customers, no staff =no stock=poor range, not enough colleagues to help, just a really awful place to work, always cutting hours"
bad,"Nasty , work environment mangers and employee having adultery on break very unprofessional i hated it plus heavy work loads , and little pay  , no time for break because of work load"
bad,"is a great job for someone who comes out of highschool, or a part time job it doesn't pay very well...............................................................I moved on to a better paying job and have been there for almost 15 years. I'm looking for a fun new adventure"
bad,Walmart is an okay job for right out of high school or maybe while trying to get through college. this is not the place to work for a career. the hours are terrible. the people are all rude. and they do a terrible job at picking management
bad,The job app was for a permanent position but got there and it was temp- only 2 mos. I took it because I needed it at the moment but even being in the vision center didn't make it any better.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of my job, was the day I got fired for defending myself."
bad,"did not enjoy, understaffed, poor management, hard to move up in company, co-workers were pleasant, learned many different cell phone areas"
bad,"Working at wal mart was okay, nothing really to big or cool about it, it did teach me a few things that are helpful"
bad,"Not the best job I had. Too much drama! Very little pay, they were always busy and all of our hard work couldn't even be appreciated."
bad,I worked every time I was scheduled to work it was a very interesting job. it was seasonal work tho. it would have been nice if they told me that when they hired me that way I could have been more prepared for being laid off.
bad,Every assistant manager was disrespectful. they did not care about and if you did not stay later than your shift then they would try to write you up and make it look like you left before your job was completed. At the end of the week you could have worked 50-60 hours in a week but you would only get 40 because management would tell you to cut your time so you wouldn't get paid overtime.!!!!
bad,working at Walmart is not for everybody. it requires desperate people because the way employees are treated you have to be desperate to work or have criminal record.
bad,just horrible i would never work there again. they are a bad corporation. they tended to pick favorites and were not good to there employees.
bad,"i would not recommend this job at all...ever. The job culture is awful, your managers do not train you and coworkers are not willing to help you."
bad,"This job was terrible from the start. Hired to work in the deli, ended up as a cart pusher for a month. Finally get to where I was supposed to be working and find out its understaffed (even with a new person being added on), overworked and pressured by management to work harder for less. I get its, its a kitchen-like environment, tempers flare in tight spaces like that, but the Deli department manager was just plain mean. Rude, crude, condescending, arrogant..... I could go on but there is no point. Management above her didn't care. She got her employees to work hard through fear so we always had stuff stocked out of fear of being written up and fired over things not being ""finished"". It didn't matter that 2(two) people were required to stock everything AND manage 3 meat/cheese slicers, a fryer, a rotisserie oven, make DOZENS of sandwiches and do any custom orders for the day(usually only 1 or 2 six foot sub, some days its was 5-10. Holidays could see over 20 being made.) and prep for the afternoon shift. THIS WAS A DAILY TREND. I worked in the Deli for a little under 2 years. My schedule changed monthly, sometimes weekly. Some weeks I worked 35 hours, usually got around 20 (Walmart doesn't like full-time employees, they get benefits), some weeks I got 12 hours. Even though there was work to be done, upper management decided not to have people on more often then not. It was deplorable. The only reason I stayed was because I needed a job. I had it out with management several times over the mismanagement of the department, the harassment from the department manager, the lack of"
bad,I love to work at walmart you meet all kinds of people the best part was helping customer find there needs
bad,Walmart will promise you the world just to turn around a rip it all away. Management is not trustworthy.
bad,I would never work for walmart ever again the company is full of nothing but lies about how they treat people who work for them and how they treat people who shop at walmart stores.
bad,it was such a great company to work for. i had to work whenever everyday for 3 years. management treats you poorly. they let long lines happen.
bad,At Wal-mart supervisors had no regard as to whether you had a family or not  wanted employees work when the said work. Not a good place to work.
bad,poor service rude impolite environment very judgemental never able to keep one position poor training hiring process takes to long
bad,Smashed between costumers and management.  Long hours for little pay.  Feels like being in high school again.  On the positive side some of the people where great to work with and for.
bad,"Walmart is a good company, I believe. It employs many people. "
bad,I worked the graveyard shift so it was a negative experience for me. I would only recommend this job to someone who desperately needs it.
bad,"even though, walmart is full of good people, I probably wont return. it was just not an empowering environment. but the pay is decent."
bad,"stressful environment, I learned a lot of different things in my 9 years of experience, management was so hard to work with, they each had a different way of doing things so you never really knew what the proper thing to do was. My co workers were awesome I enjoyed working with them. Hardest part of my job was making sure everything was stocked for customers, but if the warehouse was out then it was out of my hands on when we would receive it. Enjoyable part was meeting new people and the customers."
bad,this job is a great form of training for sustomer service. you deal with a vast variety of guest. also very budy year round.
bad,"The only reason why i took this job was because the economy was really bad.  I had lost my job as a Customer Service Manager at GE and was unable to find a job.  They don't want to hire full-time and their schedules are very poor.  They would work you 4 hrs a day and maybe 25 hrs a week.  When i had dislocated my knee, they made me take unpaid time off.  I wanted to work and they wouldn't let me.  Then was able to work full-time stocking.  They didn't hire enough employees for the jobs that was needed.  They worked the employees and didn't want to pay.  They made false promises about job promotions."
bad,walmart is awful the management was horrible. they never gave me hours and they were very hateful i would not recommend anyone to work there
bad,walmart is a ok job its just alot of downs that cant over come the ups about the job first the managers are not friendly my co workers were fun the hardest part about job was the difference in the weather
bad,Unsupervised employees and lack of leadership. Unprofessional conduct. Felt stranded. Little to no training involved with position.
bad,my husbands crazy c**t ex (who also works there) tried to hit me with her car and the store manager literly did nothing and the human resource manager literaly told me to get over it or quit
bad,Must be willing to work all job roles and have strong customer service skills. Must be willing to work all shifts. Room for advancement if you work hard!
bad,"clock in go straight to my register check out customer , offer walmart credit cards apps, work the front door as a greeter. Work customer service."
bad,"Verify customers' ages when they buy restricted merchandise."
bad,i have nothing to say. thank they are a pretty good company to work they treat their employee fair and they have some good benefit
bad,The management is horrible. They do not care about family emergencies. The environment is very negative.The store itself is very dirty & disorganized.
bad,This place will ware you down until you can doing anything and blame you for everything. This place curses there employees and fires good hard working people. They don't care if your child is sick and don't care about if your sick
bad,walmart doesn't care about they employee. rate pay is awful. won't be able to get hours if avaibility is close. rude managers and customers. this place is a very stressful place.
bad,The management team don't care about their employees. I was pregnant and working at the cash register and I asked for as chair because I couldn't stand for long and they denied me to have a chair.
bad,"stressful"
bad,Wal-Mart will break state and federal rules and will try to cover it up so they wont get in trouble. I was fired because I whistle blow on this company but was officially fired for something petty.
bad,wasn't fun learned nothing really managers were horrible coworkers were ok making it to payday once payday got there i did not like anything about the job at walmart
bad,"confusion about where your working , poor management , no respect for employees over worked for amount of pay  a lot of complaints from customers, no benefits  hours always change, co-workers are good with each other but always complaining about company and management  treating the employees bad. never enough stock on the shelves poor work envirement to work in"
bad,"the management and staff was awful, the store manager was rude, disrespectful and only toke notice of you if he wanted something, hours was cut for no reason,"
bad,I worked here for 3.5 years and have absolutely nothing good to say. The management does not care about you or your work. They only care about doing nothing. If you have a work ethic this company is not for you. STAY AWAY.
bad,"The upper level management has no idea on how to do their jobs, they have unrealistic expectations and just look at the numbers. They are completely unengaged and I really believe that they only care about their paychecks and nothing else. They take days and weeks to follow up and it is difficult to ask a question and get an answer."
bad,"My last employer was understaffed, and not caring  for the needs or personal problems of the employee. Some of the managers did not know all the answers to every customers needs, and was sometimes rude in certain situations."
bad,"Primary department is the Toy department, but trained to assist in several other departments. I learned new skills and what peoples needs are. I like helping people."
bad,I would work with customers get there meds ready explain things to them fill there prescriptions order medicine fill our machine and work on it help type in there prescriptions run the cash register and bag medicine and clean up at the end of the day and return medicine that wasn't picked up after seven days
bad,"Walmart was the worst place I have ever worked for, maybe it was just the store I was at. The store manager was/is VERY RUDE, no people skills at all. He never has anything positive to say to anyone, he is always criticizing people. He really believes he is better then everyone else."
bad,"A typical day at work included horrible managers with attitude at work."
bad,"Wal-Mart taught me great things about day to day operations of their processes, about insurance and what the benefits are to those who work for them, how to interact with customers to give them great customer service. All in all it was not a bad place to work."
bad,i was a customer service manager that made less than 10 an hr. i did more work and didnt get paid the right amount. i had cashiers that i was over making more than me
bad,"Absolutely the worst company to work for - no hours - no pay - work you like a dog - treat the employees like animals!"
bad,the people were nice they told me how the business run and how d and you can develop more skills and grow in the field so much.
bad,"I was responsible for opening and closing the jewelry department. Duties include stocking and handling jewelry, special orders, lay away accounts, and providing good quality customer service to the public."
bad,"It was an okay place to work but, some of things they demanded an employees to do was ridiculous and sometimes dangerous. When your eligible for a raise that was part of the job and being denied because of being the only female doing maintenance is also unfair. This cause me to do the unthinkable and I have regretted it ever since, because I would have been absolutely furious if my child had done it. I'm truly sorry for what I did and it change me to be a better person. I am a 61 year old college graduate with a degree in Office Administration."
bad,Lack of advancement and growth opportunities. There needs to be more opportunities for growth. You don't get to move up in management. You remain in the same position forever.
bad,"managers are very disrespectful to employees , rude and do not care if you have to ride the public transportation. Can't get off on time ."
bad,The management looked at the workers more as numbers than  people. The co- workers were friendly and did work with each other.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of this job was the people I had the chance to meet and to work with, I found all of the people I met there very fascinating."
bad,"I hated Walmart. They treated me so unfair from the rest of the workers. A typical day at Walmart was the managers catching attitudes with the workers, and customers. Managers was so unprofessional. They wouldn't give people their well deserve vacation but managers made sure they went on their vacation. They would give hours. The store manager was so rude to workers. They fired me because I still signed on my register by an accident. They wouldn't give workers their lunches on time. An not enough workers at night that why lines would be long."
bad,I did not like working here. My boss was selfish and only cared for himself. They will make you work 13 hours a day. sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
bad,A good start-up job for someone fresh out of high school. This is not a place you would want to work full time. You learn a great deal about people and customer service.
bad,"Not fun to work for, low pay with very poor managers. You are micro managed every minute and when put on a project you will be pulled by some different manager and put on a different project."
bad,Terrible place to work. Low wages. Over worked people. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. And not a place for a student to work. Not flexible at all and a huge waste of time.
bad,"Gave impossible time limits on task,learned operations of store,great coworkers,no stability,work wise,cold in freezers,no work gear,great customers"
bad,the managers are very demanding the are they also lacking on the hours they don't do benefits they have horrible store policies there in disparate need of new management.
bad,"I learn to much in this job I learn more English I now I need to improved , is a the big family. is a good experience for me in this job"
bad,"Not my favorite job. I am not above working anywhere. However, if i had to choose somewhere to not work again it would be Walmart. A typical day consisted of no one knowing what was going on including the managers."
bad,I worked there only because that was the only job I could get. Its very low paying for what you have to do and you always start part time.
bad,I had worked for Walmart years ago and it was a better place to work then. The overnight management staff now cannot handle their duties and responsibilities as they should with the store continually short staffed. The best part of my job was when I was tasked into my favorite areas to work which was Health and Beauty and Cosmetics.
bad,"Customers are extremely rude"
bad,As an overnight stocker at WalMart wanted you to stock your area and then also go stock everyone else's area. Management moved around to different stores to often.
bad,"Es una empresa que estrategicamente hace lavado de cerebro, generando un ambiente de incertidumbre, que produce trabajo Mecánico paranoico de los trabajadores, se les hace pensar que a veces pueden haber despidos, para crear ese mayor compromiso y estúpidamente trabajar el doble.  Los sueldos son ""acuenta"" realmente malos.  Es por eso que nunca publican el sueldo que pagaran en los avisos,  ya que esperan que vayas a la entrevista para manipular tu necesidad, diciendo que tendras beneficios de la caja los héroes, puff..   que si trabajas duro, puedes ser jefe,  puff.   El jefe gana 350 lukas,  imaginate tu cuanto ganaras. Incentivan la competencia de no tener que cofiar en nadie.  Realmente una empresa para muy buena para los obreros de del tercer mundo..."
bad,is good to work there at least is a job security for years than I am been in there the job is ok managers ok and the associates are nice is nice to worj at Walmart
bad,Walmart was focused only on bottom line. Leaders are not trained and have very little interest in work force. Employers have very little regard for employers beyond Walmart.
bad,"Nothing good comes from here, you're forced to work like a dog, treated like a common peon, its sad to work for here, dont apply if you want a life."
bad,They do not care about people that have kids and place the family first. I do not agree with that. I would get jobs that would reqiuire it to be two people and when I would not get it finished I was in trouble and they knew it was a two person or more job
bad,Under staffed so I did the job of 3 people. Was treated horrible. I cleaned up things that make most people sick. Rainy or snowy days were up front all day with a mop in my hand with cold air blowing on me and being very wet from the knees down. Hardest part of my job was trying to satisfy the my manager and the head CSM and keep up with thousands of customers destroying all the work I did each day among other things.
bad,"They belittle their associates to keep their customers happy, the customer service reps never listen to anything that you have to say without looking at the camera. I learned to leave your problems at the door when coming into work and to never let anyone get in the way of making your own money."
bad,they were very impersonal and had no compassion for single mother's. workers were treated like replaceable commodities.
bad,Staff were constantly arguing amongst each other for shifts. Very hostile towards new employees for fear of lost hours.
bad,"It started out as a good place to work. The company does lack a much needed training program, but with hard work you can get promotions. Recently this has all changed as corperate doesn't really care about it's associates, only its money."
bad,"I have no comment. Better to say nothing than be negative.However, I cannot leave this field evidently without saying more so I will refrain from being negative with this final comment. I like working with customers and talking to people."
bad,"There isn't enough space for me to write my contempt for this company.  They make a great effort of hiding the behind the scenes problems going on with their charity work.  Your worked like a slave for next to nothing, there is nothing competitive about their wages, your reminded constantly by management that your replaceable and to do what your told.  It was one of the worst experiences of my life."
bad,"I didn't really mind the job itself, other than dealing with ungreatful management and customers. The healthcare isn't that good, the management is completely disrespectful and heaven forbid you get sick or something happens like someone dying because they could care less. They never want to work with you whether it comes to hospital stays, leave of absence, school, bereavement, anything... they don't appreciate you and treat you as pretty much a slave, and good luck at staying in the department you're hired for, getting deserved raises. Anyone thats been there awhile barely get anything or any compensation, but will hire someone with less experience for twice as much, basically you'll make as much as someone just starting even though you've been working there for years. They also don't follow policy and make you look like a bad guy, they'll also get in your face as well as customers"
bad,"- Healthcare plans for employee's are a joke"
bad,"Do yourself a favor and do not even bother. Both times I worked at Walmart were just awful. Management was a joke, Co-Workers were rude and talked about you behind your back. If it's money you need and you can deal with a bad environment then go ahead. otherwise just don't."
bad,One of the few places hiring during the time I was looking for a job.  No love for managers except for my department manager.
bad,"They say that the company cares about the employee, and will do what they can for them, this can't be more un-true. Since starting at store 1034 i was promised full-time ect only to be told 5 months later that i'm part-time and am not aloud to work 5 days a week, so that being said i've only been scheduled 3 days a week which makes it so i can't pay rent or my important bills. So if you plan on working at Walmart be sure you go through everything more than once to be sure you're not screwed over like i was along with more than a few other associates that i work with."
bad,Hated it it was garbage they couldnt accomodate me always changing my hours it was awful what else can i say its walmart...
bad,Empresa de porte mundial que não valoriza o trabalho árduo dos funcionários que possuem longas jornadas de trabalho e baixa remuneração.
bad,I handled money transactions with customers. I also zone my area. I would clean my area. I loved being able to interact with my customers.
bad,"no communication"
bad,"A typical day at work was not typical in any way. I never knew from one minute to the next if I was going to be able to complete my task at hand before I was told to leave it and go onto another.  Once pulled from said task, the manager that had originally put me on it would come yelling at me as to why I didn't finish what he asked before moving on to present task. It was all very stressful and there was no way in those conditions, to do my job to a satisfactory level.  I felt I was being purposely pushed out due to my physical disabilities that made it hard to place me during renovations."
bad,not understanding at all about family. no chance of advancement. management will take no suggestions for anything and do not care about harassment from supervisors.
bad,It is a very enjoyable job and is a good starting job for someone who is looking to work in customer service. And you get to meet new people and get to know some of them that has been there for a long time.
bad,its walmart. do i have to say more. customers complain about stuff that the workers cant fix and then management blames workers for not caring when they make next to nothing.
bad,"esploração dos funcionários, "
bad,"Hate this place. Burn it down. ALL OF IT!!! It sucked the life out of my poor, miserable soul. I never had a good day that wasn't shattered by something or someone."
bad,"It was the worse job I ever had...I liked my coworkers and loved to help customers when I could, but I never liked Walmart as a company and I didnt like how they ran the place, there was also never any room for advancement."
bad,"Doesnt support their team. Customer Service is good but does not appreciate their members. "
bad,I loved the chance to work with wonderful cashiers. Extremely poor management. Treat employees terrible. Will never work or shop there again
bad,This job sucked because of the managers didn't know anything and just kept messing up the work flow during the day. It wouldn't help that it just felt like I was working for the wrong people. They say customer service is everything but they really don't care about anyone but themselves
bad,"It is a new company however it is not as organized as you would expect, There is a lot of things that must ve mapped out and hopefully in the future it will be."
bad,"First thing first, team meeting, starting with what we are doing and what is expected. Next we prepare for the truck. roll out the steel line, and begin. After unloading the truck we stock the food, and a few of us begin unloading pallets of high velocity truck and begin stocking high velocity freight. by that time we have lunch. after that we resume stocking food and high velocity, after second break we begin to pull pallets out to sales floor of other freight such as pharmacy and sporting goods. Then we close off by stocking chemicals, pets, pharmacy and HBA. last but not least we clock out and go home."
bad,I worked for Walmart for almost 2 years while attending college full time. Walmart purposefully scheduled me the same time as some of my classes. I had to have a job to pay bills so I eventually had to drop out of college to work.
bad,This store was actually better than the one I work for now. Rarely had any problems with management and other associates. Unlike the other store everyone knows they positions.
bad,regretted ever working here. treated terrible. No notice of schedule changes. Paid very little with minimal pay increases. very negative work environment
bad,I assist customers with there daily needs in the store. I also make sure that the services are fast and that the customer is happy
bad,"I love my job there but I do not feel supported by the company claims to be for the employee also but no they arent the worse treated associates are the the seasoned ones with pay and work, not to mention the hurt not much compassion from managers or company."
bad,"This company don't care about the employees at all, they only whant to make money and that is it.They treat you very bad although you are a great,fast and happy cashier...they really don't care and that is very sad..."
bad,this has to be the worst place ive ever worked in my entire life. i would never ever work here again. and i wouldnt reccomend it
bad,"Hard to stand for 8 hours to check out customers."
bad,"its a job they treat u like a slave pay like one to ."
bad,Had lots of issues with management playing favorites. The incompetence of management was appalling. The worst job I have ever had. Co workers were amazing but management was the pits.
bad,Worked there for about three-four years probably more and they were the worst years of my life. Management was the worst i have ever seen.
bad,"micromanaging everything is really bad here, you will be told the same thing none stop even if you do your job perfect. good part of the job is if you're part time its super easy, you dont have to put up with the drama of most of the people that work here."
bad,"No life. Horrible hours, no family time. Might as well be q prison"
bad,typical work day is hetic. One person tells you one thing an then another tells you something else. Managment counts stuff against you even if its medical even if it happened before an they didnt count it against you then. they schedule you a ton of hours when you are first hired on an then nothing after that..
bad,"the job was long hours, rude managers (old manager left) and unfriendly customers. it was an unplesant experience all together"
bad,"From the TOP Down... No Body Cares about the customers or providing any kind of service. BUT, the customers expect service like Neiman Marcus. It's just all screwed Up."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend anyone to work in such a devilish world of non-productivity and greed. the wages were poor, the mangers were not there to do their job and great workers were overlooked for even less qualified prospects ."
bad,"work there for short time dont stay to long....."
bad,I have nothing but bad things to say about this company. The management team is horrible. the associates arent that bad. Most of them had to live off of government funding just to survive. I Would not recommend anyone to ever work for this company.
bad,Horrible place to work. Horrible working conditions. When I worked there I was barely making more than minimum wage. Co-workers were friendly most of the time.
bad,They only offer part time meaning you get no benefits.  They dont offer very many hours so it really doesn't matter how much you get paid.  They schedule you for 4 hour shifts.  Its hard to take off.  Hours fluctuate so you miss weekends and holidays and since the 10$ pay raise there is no paid holidays anymore.  The open door policy means nothing.   Talking to your manager does not help.  They do not care.  The only job they care about in the store is their own.  I thought wal-mart would be a good job for me and I enjoy the work I do but no I dont not like the company.  I feel cheated.  I have a son and 600$ rent and my checks are 400$ or less and I make 10$ an hour so you do the math.  I have to have a roommate just to get by.  Thats why Im always looking for work.
bad,"If you need a job, search somewhere else. You will be treated poorly in all aspects of your career. Don't waste your time."
bad,"Store Manager doesn't know how shrinkage is caused in so many fresh/produce departments. I'm surprised Home Office in Bentonville, Arkansas has gotten into this subject matter with the store manager."
bad,Management team doesn't listen to you. Needs are not met. all boils down to most all the management there doesn't care and all the ones that do don't have a say.
bad,This was a terrible place to work.  There was no concern for employee safety and people were intimidated by most of the management staff.
bad,Agradavel de trabalhar equipe de trabalho perfeita disponibilidade de cresce dentro da empresa
bad,"Make sure you want to do the position you start as because they will not move you to another department. They will put a new hire in that position before they move you. The open door policy does not work. The managers will ignore your schedule availability. If you do not have an open availability you will not be favored for anything like changing departments or a promotion. Do not listen to managers promises they do not keep them. The management pretends to care and listen to your concerns but overall it is about them and store profit. You will hear how good the company is and all the positive changes ahead but do your research. The benefits, insurance, and paid time off are best for full-time or salaried employees. Most are hired part-time so they don't have to give you benefits and insurance. Shift or department leaders forget about breaks and meals so you go late. If they remember they send you too early so by the end of an eight hour shift you work 3 to 4 hours without break. Then they forget to send you home so you're there another 30 minutes before you clock out."
bad,not a very good work environment at all work to life quality isnt good the pay is low for the work expectations was on nights and it seemed as if  nobody care not even management
bad,bad management all together hardly anybody works at one time two busy. their was nice people their also liked how their was time to stock and move around
bad,scaned the vin  number on cars for oil chages or tires drove cars in bay for oil helped vacuam cars out welcomed customers to tire lube express
bad,"Though Walmart claims to be a family business, that is far from the truth. There are no excuses at walmart, there is no compensation, you are on your own throughout the development of your career there."
bad,"it was an okay type of job .i wasn't happy wit you. I don't advise anyone to work there if you don't have pation,magement it horriable they pick fravorte"
bad,I worked for the one in Dallas and the management/ co workers were very rude. I really enjoyed helping the customers and interacting with them.
bad,"good work culture i liked it a lot."
bad,"Work days are long, and consist of a lot of manual labor. I really haven't learned anything new at Walmart, I am over qualified to be working there. Management has lack of experience. The only thing that us enjoyable are some of the people I work with."
bad,Horrible company to work for. Dont get me wrong the pay is okay but the harrassment of employees from managers is just ridiculous. They have lost a lot of people due to the managements attitude and how everyday when asked to do something they go about it in a rude manor. I will never darken their doorstep ever again unless it is for shopping. Customers have complained about the current store im employed at many of times it was just recently shut down due to sewage backup in the restrooms.
bad,"This was the worst job of my life. I am a full time student, and Walmart had me working full time some weeks (and did not offer any full time benefits, which I am fairly certain is illegal), even after I requested less hours. The managers that work at the cash registers with you are unspeakably rude and entirely unhelpful. I learned absolutely nothing from them and essentially had to teach myself the ropes. I would not return to Walmart ever again."
bad,"Wal Mart is the biggest waist of time ever. Management doesn't care about its workers, benefits don't kick in till 6 months, hours are always awful, and no one cares. I refuse to shop at Wal Mart."
bad,I did not like working for this employer at all.  I worked very hard for Wal-Mart and all they did id is fire me for working overtime.  The only reason I stayed is because my overnight manager needed from me or else I would have gone home.  Sad job.
bad,"My typical day in Walmart was to help my associate with their department, help the customers with their question about items. There is no hard part of the job if you know what are you doing."
bad,"ran a cash register"
bad,"Wishin I was never hired.....need I say anymore?"
bad,"I hated this job, no I loved the position, but there was no support from supervisors or management. after being there about 2 months they supposedly put in the wrong job code and I went from $9.95 to $8.95 an hour as a supervisor."
bad,Management was horrible never there when needed there coaching level was ridiculous 3 coaching s your fired u get coaching s over little things something that should not matter i recommend no one apply or work here very stressful environment no one cares Few people i actually respected but few and far between
bad,"This job was one of the worst I have ever had. I used to be a cashier but the CSM's and Managers ran me from that job. Ive never seen a place hire so many managers and they'lll just up and leave after two weeks. "
bad,Worst employer in modern history. They are very creative at finding ways to take money/hours from employees. Managers/Supervisors bully/threaten employees regularly.
bad,as fiscais eram otias em suas tarefas alias todos os funcionarios
bad,"co workers management was bad."
bad,"If I could give zero stars I definitely would. I highly recommend to anyone who is considering working for this company to just not do it - stay far away! "
bad,"Typical day at my job is very busy. It is very challenging, but I like challenging jobs and there is always something too do."
bad,they do not do good with family things like if u have a son in the hospital the refuse to give time off when he almost died on us i was at work bc i could not get time off
bad,I've heard some Walmart stores are amazing the one I was at though was not. I gave three years of my life and only got one promotion. They want everyone to work full time hours but still mark you down as part time so you don't get benefits. Your co-workers are usually the best part of your day and the hardest part is keeping the customers happy while also getting them out of the store as fast as possible. Certain Managers are great and to others you're just a number.
bad,The overnight crew i worked with were the best. would change them for nothing. The managers on the other hand well they needed to take shots of happy juice a lot of the time. Most managers pretty much paid no attention.
bad,"Horrible place to work. Doesn't respect you as a person. Wants you to bend over backwards for them but don't give you anything in return,"
bad,I have learned a lot from working with this company but overall its not work life balance at all. this isn't a good place to work if you have small children
bad,The customer are great. The management needs serious improvement on how to treat their employees and help them when its needed.
bad,"Management at Walmart leaves much to be desired."
bad,"My time at Walmart was a huge waste of time. No one cared about the employees, benefits were horrible and over priced, if you brought up something that was unsafe they didn't do anything to fix the problem. Just completely horrible work place."
bad,"I decorated and baked products for the bakery. What I learned here was to multi task, easy part was doing my job, but the hard part they constantly changed your shift and not enough pay."
bad,enjoy with people and leraning new skills  i having everytime fun in my job and smile with customers they  love to see smiles
bad,"Wal~Mart is the worst employment and roughest part of my life to date. I worked at the store over night shift stocking shelves. In this job management required you to do the work at the speed they asked regardless of how impossible it seemed. Your work would be required to be done three, sometimes four times as fast then the allocated time you had. Three hours of work was expected to be done in an hour and a half, with no questioned asked. For this job you would also be required to be cross trained and be able to work every department in the store, even if your job details do not have the job listed, In example, stockers would also be doing frozen section, cooler sections, Inventory, back room processing. They pay these positions differently and expect you to do the job without the pay. The management here, probably shouldn't exist because it's so bad, managers are always running around giving orders, watching you do your work making sure you're doing it fast enough and not for one moment slacking or taking breaks. When something is needed and a manager isn't around you have to locate a manager in the store by walking around to find one. Also managers are usually in the office playing card games on the computer while you're expect to be superman. Because wal~mart has never really been up to par with their equipment the pallet jacks where always broken. The bearings were always busted and it made moving 1500 lb pallets close to impossible, but it needed to be done."
bad,"Bad company terrible leadership not worth working there, move on to something worth your time people. Lack of training all the way around for company."
bad,"management doesn't care, some managers play favoritism, impossible to switch departements, treated poorly. other associates are friendly for the most part. Corporate needs to come and fix things."
bad,there was too much drama and we got short breaks and no lunches short pay not enough stuff to do. got sent home if we didn't meet up to his wantings
bad,"This was my first job ever! "
bad,Management does not care about you! They only look out for themselves! No good opportunities! Required to get 10 to 12 hour work done in 8 hours. If you do not get your work done they write you up. Co-workers are the only reason I stayed so long at this job.
bad,They will take advantage of you and not promote you at all. Then they will find any reason to fire you.. Dont work there you will work as hard as you can and go no where
bad,The business was very sexist. If you did not have the body of a goddess than you meant nothing to them. I could not tell anyone how many times I got pushed to the side for a position because of someone that came in with a better body than me or someone with a prettier face than me.
bad,Not fun at all. Not to mention that the pay is not any good. Over worked with little pay. Better of going to a temp agency. you would at least make more money there
bad,Walmart isn't a a job that i would recommend to a friend. Everyone is treated differently and nobody is treated equally. There is a lot favoritism in the company. the managers aren't professional and think its okay to make fun of employees. Managers think they are above everyone else
bad,"It was a very busy days there and there were also slow days. I wish I could have learned more about the job. to become better. it seem like I wasn't growing as much as my co worker were telling me. But overall I love being around the guest that came in. I made sure the left with a smile, and made sure when they saw me again I knew them by name,"
bad,"back up cashier, picks, zone, returns, answering the phone, calling another store for a customers, making change for customers, wiring money, refunding money,"
bad,Management is terrible. The work is terrible and the customers are even worse.  I wouldnt wish working here on my worst enemy.  Everyone just seems too incompetantt to function
bad,Expected to to the jobs of 4 people.  Management is poor and associates are expected to work in a Fire-drill environment..
bad,"just don't, it's just bad times all ahead. too much work for a single person, and they mistreat you for not meeting their expectations"
bad,"Hated the managers they were annoying..supervisors had a bad attitude. Hours randomly cut back after they work you to death, put in departments randomly that I did not like and had no training in. Co workers were a little weird and funny acting. Benefits were decent.  Pay wasn't all that great. It was awkward walking around in the store. I was constantly being followed and looked at by customers asking me things I didn't know anything about."
bad,"A nursing home is only as good as the people working there. It can be fun or it can be a drag. In my case, it was a drag. Long nights watching the laundry go round and round. Sorting it once it was dry. taking it back to the residents room and putting it away day after day. You develop a liking for some of the residents, and others... Well, lets just say they can be outspoken."
bad,"The job sucked the management is terrible, hard to move up, treated like dirt, no hours, Never wanna work at walmart again"
bad,bad company practice implemented and getting rid of long term employees and don't want to pay for your benefits cut your hours to meet daily sale goal
bad,"The Idea of Walmart is a great idea, but it has been run by greedy and callus people. When i worked at Walmart i was forgotten many occasions when i was supposed to be relieved, and got locked out of my register and was punished for running my register for over 6 hours straight on several occasions when it is management that is supposed to relieve me. Worked several 24 hour shifts because people did not feel like coming into work, and they showed favoritism as those people were never punished. Myself and a few others had to do others jobs because they did not feel like getting up from the chair they were sitting on, and management said that since they did not feel like getting up we had to do those jobs. They would not give me my overtime pay even when i worked well over 76 hours a week, and Stated they would not make anyone a Full time employee, due to having to pay healthcare insurance."
bad,"very shady place to work for, management pretty much make their own policies on an as needed basis. they yell at you, degrade you and don't stand by you."
bad,"A typical work day at Wal-Mart consists of Planning your day. The first thing you do is review the schedule to see who you have in the building to plan out your day. I usually supervise 40-50 people a day. This includes Department managers, supervisors, cashiers, service areas, vendors, office associates cash office, and Pharmacy. I delegate task for everyone and follow up throughout the day. Time management and following up and building relationships are the most important things I have learned. Management has to communicate with one another constantly to ensure all projects are being completed in a timely manner, and to make sure our associates are being taken care of. The hardest part of my job is the consistency and routine, Wal-mart changes almost daily. They require certain things to be done in a timely manner. And it may be asked on short notice. This can be challenging but it keeps it interesting. The most enjoyable part of my job are the associates and customers. My store has  a small town feel to it, everyone knows everyone. Everyone feels like family."
bad,"I worked for an older Wal-Mart as it transitioned into a super store.  When the transition was complete I was denied the job and pay raise I had been promised and left as a cashier.  I was attending college and was often late for classes or forced to miss them completely due to the management refusing to let me off of work, claiming that I had to work over due to someone calling in or an influx of customers.  I had gotten ill and had to take leave due to the flue.  I was fired due to not letting management know in advance that I would be out for two weeks with the flu and thrush."
bad,"I did not enjoy the atmosphere working here, the owners are difficult to work with and they do not do a great job training."
bad,there work you and the people are ok to work with the bosses can be nice and have a lot info about the company and there work you as many hours you want
bad,I was hired to work with Walmart. They are set to train you and management never did. I have never worked in retail before so this was a whole new ball park for me. My first day management told me to go to the girls section and she would be right back to show me what needed to be done. She never came back. For a week this has been going on. I go to find management and it is all the same. They say they will train you and they never come around. I have tried to get my schedule and if you call they hang up on you. If you go in and try to get it they say they will get it in a min. and your never get it.  You are put in to learn trial by fire. No training what so ever. Then  you get in trouble for not knowing what to do. I would never recommend this place to anyone. You could probably sign in and take off and go home or what ever and come back and clock out and they would never know the difference.
bad,No Hours no job security customer suck job sucks would not work there again if there was a gun to my head.  Its walmart what do you expect
bad,"Bad management, treat you bad, talk down to you, tell you that you're not good enough or slow or stupid. I had one manager tell me my girlfriend was ugly and needed glasses because she couldn't see. This was in Waycross, Georgia."
bad,they do not care about employees or customers hours are awful benefits are slim to none and if you are not a favorite you do not matter
bad,I guess it depends where you work but you're working with people who hold little respect for you. You make the job what you want but the management is all politics and they have favorites.
bad,A typical day at work would have to be a customers being mean to me for no reason. What I learned everyday is that all people aren't the same. The management wasn't always fair. My co-workers and I rarely talk during the work time because I would always be too focused on correctly doing my work. The hardest part of the job was to keep an unsatisfied customer happy without hurting their feelings. The most enjoyable part of the job was to see that you help a customers find exactly what they were looking for.
bad,"When I worked at Walmart the csm's treated me like I was less than a human being. I would do my work and theirs. I would work really hard while certain csm's and their friends would stand around and chat. I felt targeted because of my skin color. certain csm's and managers would mispronounce my name purposely, reason i know that they would mispronounce my name is because they would pick and choose when they would deccide to pronounce my name correctly. I didn't feel comfortable working at walmart i felt like a high school kid who wasn't popular and I felt like I was being bullied."
bad,"they treat you very horribly it is very hard to move up in this company even after plenty of years , they have a strict dress code and horrible management"
bad,"I ran the registers, helped customers, and stoked shelves. Management would bring in family and friends and want me ring them up for free. I quit after this, I didn't want the company blaming me for missing merchandise."
bad,"Walmart is known for abusing the use of it's employees, and paying them too little. Management does not do much, except for walk around, and talk to each other. You are hired for one department, and later on used for three."
bad,mistreat all the workers not a good place to be too much pressure even when you work your hardest its never good enough then they cut hours and had full time workers only working 2 days out of the week the job really was easy i mean the production room is a fast working environment which i kept up with but it wasnt good enough for them i will say it like this they try to kill you
bad,"they are nice, but talk over you. ignore you. don't help you if you ask for help. They do not help with appointments. they will schedule you on days you cant work."
bad,"A typical day at work at Wal-Mart usually involves trying your very hardest and not getting anywhere. The management was terrible, usually abusing there power just to yell at people. Normally working a 5 man job by yourself while the managers watched you struggle was a typical day on the job. Had to train myself at everything, managers had to have a class to learn how to do my job but were still yelling at me before they knew how to do my job."
bad,"It was hard work with low pay;"
bad,work environment a little stressful but then again what fast food environment isn't managers ok no hours no money work around your schedule if you're in school
bad,"This particular store is not a good store to work at. Everything about this store completely backwards. Most of the managers aren't worth their salt in salary. The day to day and night to night operations don't aren't run very well. The pay is downright terrible."
bad,"this store is not well managed, if the managers like you then you were in there if not they would harrasse   you and treat you like a little kid. i had seen individuals come in with doctor's note stating they needed to sit down, then others would bring the same note and they would tell them they could not honor it. the pharmacist is great other then that won't shop at this store again."
bad,"horrible ,worst place ever to work. managers are disrespectful, upper management is ridiculous. bad system of management ,horrible pay. they treat you like an animal."
bad,Worked here for 3 months with promises of more hours (only got 20 a week) never happened got yelled at all the time for other peoples mistakes.
bad,"walmart is a terrible company to work for they dont pay well and its hard to switch position if your trying to move up in the company,"
bad,"Unloading 1500 piece or more trucks  stacking and pulling pallets to the floor.  I was the unloader manager until they decided the store didn't need one. "
bad,Upper management was very uncooperative with middle and lower management. Hiring process need to be reviewed and more qualified people needed to be put into important positions instead of a social heirarchy
bad,"Very bad when it comes to favoritism, and I've been here 4 years working harder then most, with a know how from past jobs, college. Guys with little time and NO know-how are passing me up."
bad,empresa agradavel mas nem sempre foi boa sua administração
bad,"Last resort ONLY, They will chew you up and spit you out, If you are employed by them, you are expendable. Hard work is not rewarded. You have to fail in order to get promoted."
bad,"Favoritism favoritism favoritism, that's all I have to say about Walmart. Don't expect to move up in the company unless you plan on sleeping your way to the top. Because that is the only way you'll get there. I worked there for 5 years and people that were hired 3 years after me got to move up to management all because they were attractive not because of their work. This place makes me sick!!"
bad,I would not recommend this job to anyone. Some of the managers do not believe in team work. And one does not know how to speak to the employees. That manager does not realize that can determine a persons wok ethics. They have unrealistic expectations.
bad,Não tenho Muito o que dizer o que ela fez por mim foi apenas dar um impulso na minha vida profissional
bad,"This company is one of the biggest retailers in the country but day to day in store it is horrible.  The managers don't care about their employees, customers are mean, pay is minimum and raises are hard to come by.  The one shining spot is the schedule, they will take your availability and not schedule you when you are not available."
bad,"I worked 9 years as a Pharmacy Technician. While I did love Pharmacy and my co-workers, Wal-Mart mostly taught me everything a pharmacy shouldn't be. It's money first, customers and employees last. You are just a number to them. You can easily be replaced by someone who they can brainwash and pay less. I worked as a Pharmacy Technician because I truly enjoy helping others but Wal-Mart doesn't care about that. They focus on things that have nothing to do with patient care. Pharmacists can't stick up for their Technicians. Poor management skills. No one is on the same page. There is also no room for growth at Wal-Mart Pharmacy, your either a Pharmacist or a Technician and that's all you'll ever be. There is nothing to work towards, no promotions, no additional training, no extra pay. They work you to the bone paying you the least amount possible before they throw you out on the curb when you actually speak up for what is right and speak the truth. Wal-Mart is nothing but lies. You speak the truth and they hand you your final statement of pay. It's truly a blessing to no longer work for such a corrupt corporation."
bad,"I learned in the months that I worked at Wal-Mart that they do not treat their employees right. They get onto those who get in, do their job and get out instead of those who walk around and talking the whole day instead of doing their job."
bad,"For many people in this small town, Walmart is all they have. Many good people work there, but some of the management constantly badger people to stock faster and more, even to the point that you might need to be a robot. "
bad,"talking with customer, dealing with all kind of people.  I worked well with management.  the hardest part of the jobs was with walmart didn't have enough cashier working."
bad,"The managers are ok, but the company just doesn't care about amy of their people, and unfortunately, it is obvious that the feeling is mutual. People would regularly call in sick or not show up, and when they did come in, there was no work ethic. It was clear that the company was only about making a profit, with no regard for safety, community involvement or betterment of the lives of the customers."
bad,They hire people every week. Not everyone goes by the company's rules. The pay is actually good depending your department. The benefits are great also
bad,"inconsistent and  doesn't care about their employees .. to much favoritism "
bad,"Working at Walmart wasn't a good experience for me. The management was very disrespectful. And, sometimes the male managers would flirt with you. They made you do so much and they wouldn't even appreciate it. They make you stay late and don't even pay you for it...."
bad,I wasn't trained properly. I would basically do a whole eight hour shift before getting a lunch break. When asking management for assistants the would become very rude.
bad,"if you are able to work in a walmart in a good area feel lucky. but most walmart are in bad areas and the treat their employees like it. low pay, and they want you to go above and beyond what your jobs does. your hard work means nothing in advancement. If you do advance one miss take can drop you right back to the bottom. oh yean the long lunches on Friday so they don't have to pay you OT cuz they ask you to stay during the week to finish others work."
bad,"Typical work day consisted of the same people doing the same work, whilst others walked around their entire shift. The job was easy and fun for me. I like to organize things and being a cashier is not hard. The other employees were what made working here hard."
bad,Walmart is a very stressful job depending on your management some days it was fun some days it was not the management team could've been better. The pay rate at walmart when I started was 7.25$ and when I left I was making 9.00$ after 3 yrs which was not enough to feed my kids and pay my bills and buy other things I need
bad,I work in a big city location where there was constantly customer coming in and not enough help to deal with them. Management would  say one thing and then another would tell you something else that would get you in trouble with a different manager.
bad,"Did not like this job but still willing to do the same type of work"
bad,"Serving customers with great customer service."
bad,It was ok but lack much in safety concerns.They did not keep up there safety standards like they should have.My job there was the job from haties.I hated it and it needed to be better that it was.
bad,"You have some much to the work, were work load is as high you or ever higher.If you task not done with the time the complain and threat you on write you."
bad,"Was treated like another clone. The company does not care about its employees.  Expected to do way more than job description.  Wouldn't mind, but gets old doing other people's work. Especially, when that position gets paid more than mine."
bad,"Busy, challenging, but I thoroughly didn't mind because time flew by.  In the Deli department could have had a little more team spirited."
bad,"they work you for like 2 or 3 jobs at one time,but under pay you so they wont have to hire other people. the way they treat employees is not a good thing"
bad,will never work there again. The managers are hateful. No good benefits. Don't work for walmart. That's all I got to say.
bad,management were not willing to work with you I was fired on time off being hospitalized prior to being robbed and carjacked and brutaly beaten on return with proper documents was told I abandoned my job when I initially spoke with management about the situation.
bad,it was very hard place nobody was happy and there was to strict nobody was customer service friendly I didn't like it at all we couldn't talk to anyone and it was just not a happy place to work
bad,Managment seemed like they had no idea what was going on in the shop. we were always short staffed and under equipped. the shop manager was chosen on a whim because they took there sweet time looking for a manager and had to pick one last minute
bad,"Setup pallets on floor in a certain grid for down stacking, grab items off rollers and place on corresponding pallet area, bring pallets to areas of store."
bad,"I worked there seven years ago, and it was great. But, management is mentally and emotionally abusive. And they pay isn't that great, nor are the hours and they treat you as if you're stupid or you're an animal. And they'll fire you or lay you off to hire in three new people illegally."
bad,worst job Ive ever had. horrible management. they treated their workers like garbage. I have nothing good to say about walmart
bad,"getting yelled at even when you are working hard, management making everything to be your fault even if you are injured in the truck from collapsing walls of freight, when trucks come in so horrible that is inevitable to happen, tried to tell them to put in formal complaint to warehouse and was laughed at. all management bickering with eachother and no sense of direction."
bad,I would not recommend working here to many people.  They are always trying to work around paying employees fairly or giving them enough hours to pay the bills.
bad,"•	Handled customer complaints, refunds, and staff conflicts "
bad,"Forced to deal with constant short staffing, forced to cover every position due to poor scheduling and lazy managers. Unrealistic demands"
bad,"Walmart co-workers were nice, but the company itself is a cra ppy place to work, management sucked at time management and asked way to much of their employees, also don't get pregnant while you work there because you will be out of a job!"
bad,"I don't normally do this sort of thing.  But because of the way that walmart treated me and other Holiday associates here.  I decided to go ahead and do this.  First of all when I took the job, I was aware that this was a temporary position and voiced my concerns as such in the interview and was told that I would most likely be kept on if I turned out to be a ""great associate"".  That being said, I worked as hard as I could to try to keep my job.  I was also in addition to my duties assigned, asked in a please help us out way, many times to do some extra little things.  I did everything I was asked to do, as quickly, safely, and cleanly as I could.  I went into work CHRISTMAS NIGHT, and was told that I was not needed any longer.  CHRISTMAS NIGHT... No talk of being kept on at all.  I feel like I was just told that in the interview to get me to take the job.  I trusted the individual and got burned.  I could not believe it."
bad,"It's the absolute worst place to work. Everyone there is nasty. Pure evil. Not really. But they do have some pretty devious ways. Just don't try to work at the 7200 Arroyo one unless you're willing to usurp the popular kids circle. Which is most of management. Oddly, they are all best friends. And they sit around during break and talk smack about fellow employees. It's sad, but that's the kind of environment it was. No teamwork at all."
bad,"Favouritism /nepotism"
bad,"Walmart did not pay enough for what i had to put up with, Paid me about 9/hr for overnight cashier, management did not care about our concerns or the employees at all, all they care about is meeting their quotas."
bad,It was an okay store.. just some of the managers got on my nerves..i learned most about the store from my co-workers and they were cool they helped me in spots the managers wouldn't. This store had a lot of stealing and security was bad at that store as well.
bad,"If you consider working as an optometrist in Walmart, you may want to research the market manager with whom you will negotiate your terms.  I had a very poor landlord who never visited me in 1.5 years.  He put the optical's very large file cabinet in my space, the space that  I rent, without asking me.  He tried to hire someone for Saturdays without asking me.  I pay internet, phone, and marketing expenses, all of which another person would utilize without my consent.  But most of all, he does not care about patient care at all. He knows nothing about it and nor does he care.  My opinion is that they will eventually ask you to work 6-7 days per week, even the numbers don't support adding another day. "
bad,"unfair, not worth the work and pay. needs better management and better people. needs lot of improvement; when it comes to how to treat their associates. they work day and night to make everything better."
bad,Walmart gives you horrible shifts and they people there was mean ( in the morning)  the managers was not understanding to anything.
bad,"typical day at work consisted of standing in one place for 4-8 hours at a time. Lifted and bagged heavy items. Needed permission to use the restroom. Management was very unorganized. Store was a mess, customers were destructive and ruthless. Front end CSM (customer service managers) were unprofessional in the sense that they would gossip and associate with other cashiers outside of work thus creating different cliques of people who all gossiped about each other."
bad,This was a job filled of stress and ridiculous designated tasks. The company expected for individuals to do multiple tasks at once and and be able to complete them at the end of their shift while assisting customers on the sales floor and register. The company always seemed to be under staffed. The always remained unorganized.The only thing that could be enjoyed was lunch and clocking out.
bad,Walmart will take your life chew it up and leave you with the pieces.  Run away. Run far far away. Do anything but this. Walmart will use you up.
bad,Long hours and get treated bad by CSM. They don't tell you how to do things just expect you know. They want you to do 4 different jobs at once. Don't work there it tough.
bad,"The most deceptively crooked company I have ever disgraced myself by working for. The worst part is how employees are ""legally"" treated."
bad,I did not like working here. It might of been just the location i was in but very unprofessional. I made it long enough to make it through school.
bad,"Typical day at work..."
bad,They hired me for seasonal and told me it would be for 3 months.In one month they let me go. It personally was very cold and uninviting. I had to go onto a computer and learn all these things and take a whole bunch of tests before i could go out onto the floor. When i finally did all that i had to learn the register which wasnt easy. I finally got the hang of it and they let me go.
bad,"Little pay, several titles, poor hours, improper training, hostile work environment. There is little room for advancement. 4o1k benefits were ok."
bad,nothing to say it was just like working at any other store you just wait on the people and hope that are happy with the service you have given them
bad,"They don't care about their associates at all, which in turn creates a bad atmosphere. No morale what so ever. The pay recently got a little better, although there is very few (if any) incentives. I wish I had something good to say about Walmart, but I don't."
bad,I loved the environment. The employees all worked as a team. We were taught patience and knew that help was always offered.
bad,"Not a good place to work. This company only cares about it's bottom line doesn't care about the well being of the employees, and it shows on a day to day basis.You are stressed, overworked, under paid, no insurance."
bad,they do not work with your schedule. no benefits. they do care for the employees. no assistance when needed. never work through manpower. they take so much out of your paycheck.
bad,"poor management. unreliable shifts, lunches and breaks. treated poorly by customers and the store lets it happen. would never work for Walmart again."
bad,"I hated it here they all suckd never helped me I did everything please do not work here walmart can g and die, all of them were so rude never gave me anything  but a but headache."
bad,"I was too smart and knew too much to work for Walmart,and I did not get paid what I earned every week. The company does not pay their workers or allow them to move up in the company quickly. With me having a IQ of 142 I could not stay there being treated unfairly, and as if I were dumb."
bad,Very disaorganized and messy nothing was ever neat no matter how hard we tried. lack of communicaions between managers and the low level associates lead to mistrust and unfair treatent.
bad,"This company had originally signed me on for doing overnight maintenance, which was cleaning the store. Mopping, Sweeping, waxing, stripping. They then needed a stocker because the people they were hiring weren't coming into work."
bad,"Between management, pay, the way they treat their people, the customers that employees deal with on a daily basis, the demand for everything makes it an incredibly difficult place to work."
bad,Working at Walmart prepared me to handle many situations. Managers were never on one accord and every rule is not always executed.
bad,"Terrible management, no room for growth, Bully employees and make them feel like they are lower than dirt. If you're thinking about working here, don't."
bad,They don't treat their workers fairly and will make you feel bad if you have to call in.  expect unrealistic expectations of their workers
bad,"working at walmart is one of the worst jobs ive by far ever had. they slave you, working every weekend, every holiday.. & you dont work your shift on black friday? your fired. they dont handle any harassment cases. they just sweep it under the rug calling them ""accusations"" and pray to god you dont run your mouth."
bad,A typical day at Walmart is hectic and unorganized. Youre on you own with most times no training or basic knowledge of the job you'll be performing.
bad,"the mistreat there workers, and dont care about the employees. if you have a family emergency you get in trouble for leaving, do not work for this company"
bad,i stocked shelves the other employees were idiots and it was hard to get work done the hardest part was just the job itself the most enjoyable time was when i left to go home
bad,"The job itself is quite easy. Customers are for the most part quite nice as well. The management, however, make the job a lot more stressful than it has to be. It seems like a lot of managers do not have adequate skills and do not know how to speak to employees properly. I would not recommend this employer."
bad,"Come in, search for a telxon and waste 30 minutes because previous shifts would hide them all around the store. Pick until lunch and usually get yelled at or have to stay late because they were not finished. Do the work of 4 people because those hired are incapable of doing simple tasks, especially alone. Said people can not team up or no work is accomplished. After lunch we bin and finish special projects. Also given grief from management if everything is not binned by the end of the shift even though we were under staffed and picking up the slack of those who I talked about previously. Management expects too much of those who do work and do not give any attention to those who do not pull their weight. The job is easy, you just have those people who don't care and would rather do nothing at their ""job"". The most enjoyable part of the job is lunch.  :)"
bad,The owner is cool some of the co-worker are amazing. it has come a long way and when i went back to visit it looked totally different.
bad,Incompetent management and employees. Treats the employees very bad. Very bad pay and no recognition for good work done.
bad,got it right out of high school and stuck with it till i got a better one....didnt help the managers were not at all helpful in the learning process
bad,I enjoyed and had fun as a retail coverage merchandiser manager of the various products I managed for Acosta.the job I was a great team player enjoyed assisting customers at walmarts sam stores enjoyed communicating with department managers Stores General Managers and also entire staff of store clerks in various departments
bad,running a great shift in how to have patience the hardest part was not having enough people the to complete all duties in orders that needed to be done
bad,I believe management need to work on their communication skills. They need to learn to treat employees with respect because from experience i felt intimidated by management.
bad,working for wal-mart  was nit the best experience we worked long hard hours and was very under paid barely had time off and could never work days always nights and all wekends it was horrible
bad,na never a nough help mangers will do nothing about it because they what bigger bonus for them they dont care about customer service all they care about is money
bad,Management was horrible. They gave little praise to employees who worked very hard to keep the store running. The pay was not the best. Job security and advancement was almost unheard of. I would not reemploy here.
bad,é bom de trabalhar nesta empresa ambiente agradável e dinamico
bad,"This company gave me the experience i needed to able to excel and rise to better things. My high goal is open my own business my objective goal is gain office experience."
bad,No flexible with school schedule. No regard for family or outside life. Over worked and underpaid. I can not wait to finish school and find a full time job that is more caring. Also the employees there are rude and have no professionalism.
bad,"I will never work for this company again.  Awful, slave work, no advancement, pay sucks, co-workers are your enemy, no benefits, shifts suck."
bad,big company enjoyable of the job is working long side management  and learning from them personal glow and development decent amount of politics but this expected because is a big company
bad,"poor managment .not a good company to work for ,employees come last in this company ,profits are number one concern. hours are constantly being cut to maximize profits"
bad,Wal-Mart is a good company as a whole but the managers need work. Co-workers are a wonderful type of people. hardest part is the numbers.
bad,I started working for this company through sams and it was great they take care of their people. but once i got to walmart it was a different world the managment was rude and the lower managment would do anything to turn the tables to make it so anything that went wrong was all on the lower employment.
bad,"Poor management."
bad,They work you as if your a slave and do not pay you a proper wage for the work you do as well as cut comers when ever possible and never provide over time or full time jobs.
bad,they will cut your hours if they do not like you they make you work every holiday. they do not care. then I was working for this company the store manager was sleeping with hr worker
bad,was army and had to leave and go to war that all i can say about Walmart.it not for employee bases.we need more people that was going stay
bad,I like it because i get to be of service to other people. And I get to cook then listen to the public give me good or bad feed back.
bad,"Horrible Employee Work Ethics."
bad,"Horrible work environment, reminds me of high school. Disrespectful to the customers and treat the customers inferiorly."
bad,"If you have a family, don't plan on seeing them. If you want a day off, you are either going to have to call in or switch with someone. You have a medical condition, you probably shouldn't work for them, Management simply doesn't care about you, all they care about is money."
bad,"Poorly managed, under payed for work done, no incentive to improve job performance, unrealistic expectations, extreme degree of favouritism showed"
bad,I would never work for this company again. I would not recommend this job to anyone who is honest and hardworking. There is little room for growth and employees are subject to ridicule.
bad,i worked at Walmart for nine months when I ended up getting hurt they fired me they shorted hors on a regular basis they dont take your everyday life into consideration and even if youre sick and have proof from a doctor they will still fire you worst job I every had
bad,"after working there for 2yrs the managers kept changing for the worst. after tell you to do one thing, like move a whole aisle, they'd want it moved back the next day. management never got along and at the end of the day they would plot on how to fire you with your co-workers. wanted you to do more work but not get paid for it."
bad,"I didn't like working for Walmart simply because they didn't care enough about their employees. A regular day for me at Walmart was just providing customer service and keeping the apparel section well kept which was fine.What bothered me about Walmart is how they neglected to care for their employees medical needs, even with legit doctor's notes and conformation from doctors i was still punished for missing days to tend to my medical needs."
bad,Excellent  environment to work. I am a automation Engineer. I do both Manual and Automation testing by using  a management tool ALM and for Automation testing using a tool called UFT>
bad,"The customers were rude, the workers made it worst with the profanity and lack of communication to make things better. management did not support the employees nor give paid time off."
bad,"enjoyed working with the public, the best part you was usually busy and your time went by fast.  You never had the same schedule, not given enough training during the busiest part of the year."
bad,When I worked at walmart it was a smaller store and I love to work there. I quit before it is going to be a super center. It has really change people aren't so nice there.
bad,I have worked for walmart for 8 months they have offered me two support positions which i was denied at last minute and gave the position to someone with less experience
bad,Two many rules and not enough manners from management. do no care if you have kids or a family matter come up if you are schedualed to work you cannot leave
bad,High employee turnover.  Management is overwhelmed with the profit  of the store that employee concerns are not of importance. Employees are not properly supervised causing low morale which creates a negative working enviornment.
bad,"not a great place to work, no time with family, always tired due to the crazy work hours, terrible pay for the work would not recommend working here"
bad,"They give no worker any benefit without Blood, sweat and fears going into how they keep all workers. Black listing all ex-employees so they don't get people. Walmart only wants slaves nothing more."
bad,"its a job but I don't think people get paid enough to deal with the stuff people come in complaining about , and sometimes the managers are useless as well."
bad,They say it is a family friendly environment but really Walmart consumes your entire life and they compensation for long-term associates is very low. New hires are making what a nine-year associate does. Very frustrating and you do not get appreciated. You are strictly a number!
bad,"I have never worked for a company more frustrating, draining, or demotivating like this one. Retail work in itself is no picnic but working for a large store like this one is a nightmare because of the standards tacked on by the public."
bad,"No Comment, No Comment, No Comment, Co-Workers were mostly indifferent and stayed in private groups, the most enjoyable part of the job was the customers"
bad,"I like having a job it pays the bills, I love helping people, I process bills I also cash checks, and send money orders, the company has long hours the customers keep coming"
bad,The store would be a great place to work if so many managers weren't so rude to their employees. It also would be better if the managers would actually help when needed and there would be more than 3 lanes open for the cashiers during the day/night.
bad,"Poor management and organization of staff, poor customer service."
bad,I was not focused while working there. I can not give a fair judgment on the company. the company was great for a college student
bad,When an Employer tells you that it's a conflict of Interest for a Employee to have another Job for a source of Income because you are not being paid enough here and your are Part-Time Employee???
bad,I don't like working there I have been there for three years. I think its time for a chance. They don't treat us right. I like being a cashier but not a sale associate. I used to have fun there but not any more.
bad,Working for Walmart is tiring with very little advancement. It seems that the only way to advance is to be friends with management.
bad,Typical day working every minute.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I learn how to stock.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The hardest part was woking at a fast pace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The most enjoyable was taking care of customer
bad,They make you work like a slave. No moral from upper management. Management sets unrealistic goals that will eventually cost you your job. Very difficult place to move up. They will write you up for anything even if it was not your fault. EX. If someone crashed their forklift into you and you die they will write you up still and fire you. TRUE STORY
bad,"My typical day of work was checking in vendors in receiving, stocking shelves, cashier, upc and invoicing and community involvement. I learned a lot at my 11 years with Walmart. The management is not happy along with the employees. The hardest part of the job is they want you to do so much and you do not have the help to do it and you get put down for not getting it done. I loved helping my customers with what their need were."
bad,"i have amazing social skills, always very polite to my customers and friendly. i always do what i can  to best help in any way that i can."
bad,Thier a good company to work for they have good customer serivce. They are have raise thier wage where other company is not raise theie wage you do have to worry about have a job.
bad,it was a bad work place for any body to work it might be thr worst job in the world it is making me review this for some reason it was bad wow yeah cant beliebe it
bad,"There is always room for improvement, hire the right people. I love taken care of my customers. Speak and acknowledge each and everyone you encounter, this company lacks that. I worked in the money center, on the cash register, and worked lay a way. I""m the one to learn multiple task to help in all fields that are possible. Promotion is a never for this company."
bad,Former employee  says mgrs can ban you from the store because you found another job from a vendo they lost my business. But they don't care they did the same thing in another store not to far away so many employees work for vendors and they don't get banned i had no write ups and always left tiref from working hard what gives the mgrs the right to do this you have support  mgrs wbo yell at employees on the floor in front of customers and fellow employees not inthe office Walmart has nothing I need or want  wake up corp this is going on right u der your nose the compressors go down for hours and you still put .erchandise back on the shelf when it should have gotten thrown out you got the insurance money. Wake Up!!!!!!;; winn dixie still beats you for sales pricing and customer care!!!!!!;;;!!
bad,Wal-Mart is not interested in the job being done correctly and not interested in their associates ---- my typical day was restocking returns--trying to unplug and correcting the errors of 3rd shift--that made my job more difficult---most of my co-workers feels the same way---unappreciated---the good part of my former job was the customers
bad,"Poor management, not training, lack of communication, too many staff."
bad,"The work was okay, the pay sucked for the amount of work that we did, and the manages would not work around school schedules."
bad,Worked hard for too little of pay. Was constantly pushed past my limits. Nothing we did was good enough. It was back breaking work and definitely not worth it.
bad,One manager will tell you to do one thing and then the other will yell at you for doing it because the managers never communicate with each other. Terrible work place.
bad,Work was ok but people was really rude especially the managers. The head manager paul was great but the assistant managers suck.
bad,"Starvation wages, hierarchy of management creates large bureaucracy that slows down communication. Repetitive work that doesn't demand creativity and induces burn-out easily."
bad,I didn't like management well sum of their team. co workers great. hated a lot about this job. it nothing like what the lead you to believe. no full time but works you with full time without getting what all comes with full time workers.
bad,"They live up to all of the media stereo types. Unless you're desperate for a job, try to steer clear. I recommend working at Meijer..."
bad,"Its a good place to work, but the people who run it are judgmental and do favoritism. They treat people differently than others"
bad,"Walmart may hire more veterans yearly than any other company, but this veteran and current member of the Indiana National Guard felt as if going to drill was a burden on my supervisors."
bad,"they were a horrible place to work specially for females. they did not treat them very well. they did not play well and did not have good insurance for their employees, they did not have good managers and there was no room to grow."
bad,"treated me wrong, mangament were unorganized, wanted more hours only could work part time. co workers were very friendly, the hardest part of the job was trying to get along with management"
bad,"poor management, pay is bad. i learned some not so basic things when it comes to janitorial work. co workers are what made this job tolerable, i was self reliant that was the most enjoyable part about this job"
bad,"Walmart was terrible to work for."
bad,"Management are horrible.  All sweet and caring to your face but in reality they don't care about you.  Customers get away with anything they want and management let's them.  "
bad,"The stores are literally individually run,on corporate visits the store management will hide any issues and fake numbers to keep corp happy and improve their bonuses ( They have a different scoring system than normal employees). They rather save their own and fire you instead, than to be blamed for the problems they created. (No, I was not fired. Watched to many people get fired for being pregnant, medical issues, and plain out ""don't like"")"
bad,"I ran the deli and meat/cheese slicing areas, weighed products for cost and for waster purposes. I also sometimes ran the cash registers out on the floor when they where short handed"
bad,"Not a good place to work they did not care about nothing, the management was very bad they talk to everyone in a disrespectful manner. I learn how to be a sale associate."
bad,"I would never work at Walmart again. The managers just loved strolling around the store casually pointing out what they would like to see done. They didn't even take into consideration just how much time and manpower their ""ideas"" would take. They just wanted it done in the shortest amount of time with the least amount of people and get by the cheapest they could. They were always ready to criticize, but a compliment was very rare. I think it is a disgrace that they are the number one employer in America and their employees can not only not make enough money to live on, they also can't get enough hours and they have to beg for those. Food Stamps and Welfare are Walmart's benefit package. I don't think this is what Sam Walton had in mind when he started Walmart. I think he would be shocked. I actually got fired because my manager would change my hours and not put it in the system so it would look like I was late or even missed work. I was way too trusting that he was doing the right thing. But, he was just a snot nosed brat straight out of college without a clue about how to be a manager. I could go on and on, but, you get the idea."
bad,"Slaved away at a cash register with unpaid 30 min break in an 8 hour day. Horrible management. favoritism, disgusting bathrooms,  treat senior employees like slaves, making them pick up stuff ten times what they physically carry. Impossible hours. below minimum wage salary."
bad,walmart isn't for everyone. it is a headache and the company sucks. It is mostly for people that don't have on having a career with the company
bad,"Managerment worthless,policies are diffcult to go by. you dont have a life. schdules are bad, you have split days off and they fire you for no reasons. walmart is a lying company."
bad,"Bad place to work."
bad,Would not like to return there as a worker love to shop there but never again will I work there. I think that that they don't value their workers.
bad,"Walmart is really not a place to rely on to succeed in life. but if you can handle being verbally attacked on an hourly basis by a bunch of self hating, depressed, incompetent, uncoordinated, and rude supervisors, than it can make a good side job to help pay the electrical bills at home:)"
bad,"This place is not even worth working at or applying to. The managers were incredibly rude to their employees and didn't bother looking at their health or the state they were in as long as they worked, that's all they cared about."
bad,I had to run the department without any training. I received no assistance when it came time for the heavy lifting. The co-managers could never be found. I think the customers were the only part of the job worth anything.
bad,over all Wal-Mart would be a great if they where to start being organized and if the management team were actual more of people persons!! Like i mentioned before i appreciate the experience because atleast i got my foot in the door to have training fir another cashier position.
bad,"Poor management and poor execution of duties. Myself in the department I worked had heaviest workload and i finished either on time or early nightly. Management would allow employees with less of a workload work inefficient and then ask me to help every night in which did at first, but i noticed a trend and stopped."
bad,was only empoloyeed as temp employee and when time came to close down my department they avoided me for a couple days and just took me off the schedule instead of tellimg me that they were not going to hire me as a temp employee
bad,"A typical day at Walmart  would be clocking in and moving directly to your assigned post. The management only seem to care about catching associates doing something wrong.  They weed out long term associate by writing them up, and them terminating them.  This is done to reduce payroll. The long term associates are then replaced by minimum wage new hires. "
bad,"It often had felt that when I worked for this company that everything wrong with a workplace as far as the company caring more about it's own agenda and money over any of their workers is completely true here. "
bad,"Working maintenance for walmart is worse then getting your teeth pulled out, they management has no understanding of what's needed to get the job done"
bad,I don't really understand how someone can work for this company theres no resudial growtg within the company everybody sleeping with everyone . this job truly reminded me of my high school experience
bad,i enjoy working with my co workers. and helping customers. i learned  how to run equipment. and running electronics. and seeing customers.
bad,I really appreciate my manager and  team leaders for being very cooperative and I learn so many things.The company is really good at safety as well as human rights. It always listens to  any problem and provide a solution .
bad,I worked here fore 1- week and right after that week i didnt even get an 2nd worrnning... on working without no call no show and they side in orinetation that everyone gets 3 wornnings be fore fired from this work place...
bad,"While working for Walmart the number one retail chain in the world, I was definitely overworked and under paid. Many promises that was spoken fell through the holes. I was never promised a full time position until the day I told them that I was leaving. Sometimes my hours consisted of working under twenty hours a week. Despite the low hours and low pay, the associates still kept a positive attitude."
bad,"While I was making well above minimum wage, it did not make up for the fact that I was working- more or less- full time while I was going to college full time. Management would not let me drop any of my hours because they said they needed hard workers like me that were committed to finishing their shift. While that was flattering, it did not make up for the fact that I was only eighteen years old and was working at least 35 hour weeks while taking sixteen credit hours in school. "
bad,Walmart. What can I say? I hated every moment of it. from being paid horribly to being treated badly by the people that were supposed to be helpful. Would not wish that on anybody.
bad,I dislike this company for obvious reasons. I didn't get paid enough for the things I did. On my yearly raise they tried to give me 25 cents....
bad,En el tiempo que estuve en panadería fue un poco muy agro opues la gerente no deja trabajar agusto
bad,"Overworked, underpaid, completely un-appreciated. Wal-Mart owners don't care about the associates. Will never go back to working at Wal-Mart even if my life depended on it."
bad,"This store was the worst Walmart I have ever worked in.  The management treated everyone like dirt, Taking all the credit for anything good that happened while keeping the associates in the dark about any news that mattered to us"
bad,no promotions and if you do get them like i did you will have to work for everyone else who isnt working in your department if you get promoted to a place where noone like you will be assigned all of there work load at once
bad,"this job is ok for young people just starting out, decent pay and benefits, would not do it again, all cashiers are grouchy"
bad,"If you want a career please dont waste your time with walmart. over worked, under paid, rude management, rude staff, lazy management, no benefits."
bad,i have worked there for a few months now and i hate everything about it there the co workers are rude the managers there don't care if people walk off the job for hours
bad,"The hardest part of the job would have to have been the other employees, the people that work there are not friendly towards customers or employees."
bad,"The most insufferable and excruciating job I have ever endured. Coworkers can be extremely frustrating and lazy, management is tenfold. Customers treat employees as if they are punching bags, while the paradigm of Walmart is to place achievable standards onto employees while providing such little compensation that the combined wage of two associates could not even afford rent."
bad,the uppers that work for this company like to make the little guys feel inferior to there all mighty power. and the pay and benefits suck
bad,"Understaffing issues negatively affects all parts of their business. However, Walmart has increased their minimum hourly rate with hopes to attract more committed employees, and retain better employees."
bad,My co-workers were great got along with them just fine.The sad thing about Walmart is that your hours can be cut just like that. A typical day for me was usually good but we were always short handed.I would always help on the floor but it was never appreciated by management.
bad,"Not a good company "
bad,"This job is not the best, I love the work I dislike the company's policies. The managers are nice, for the most part. The company seems nice to work for at first but it was a let down."
bad,"They didn't have a lot of benefits, there schedual was horrifying and they made sure to always schedual you at the worse possible times so that you can't seem to have a life of your own."
bad,Inconsistent with treatment of associates. Different standards apply according to each person instead of what the handbook states.
bad,"Good fora high school job"
bad,"Never before had I experienced such a volatile work environment. Frequently one may be praised by one supervisor for how one does something, and scolded by another for that same thing. Accountability is seemingly only applicable to the lowest level employees. Policy, as well as the law, are treated as matters up for individual interpretation. Training is almost nonexistent. Buyer beware."
bad,they are bad employers they don't listen. which caused me to get hurt on the job. I will not ever work for them again. I don't care for Walmart.
bad,In my first years with the company it was a variable wonderful place where supportive and much room for advancement.  As the years went by the company became less family oriented and less concerned about its associates.  I do not recommend this company to anyone.
bad,"lacked hours, only time really busy is halloween and valentines day, not enough pay  things could be great if the things i mention changed  seemed like a job for teens"
bad,just a horrible place to work. I caught a co-worker check out a minor in a very bad way and confronted this person and was terminated for it. this person was later promoted I wouldn't ever want to work there again wish I never had. once you get to full time they try their hardest to fire you so they don't have to give you benefits. if you work less then 5 hours you don't get a break and if you do manage to get more then 32 hours you will be scolded and possibly written up. don't not work here unless you have ZERO desire to go places in life.
bad,Good to work but their new system is not good at all. They make us work when they dont even supply us with the materials we need.
bad,"I do not recommend advancing with this company. However to work as a sales associate , office associate , ( hourly only ) I would recommend working here. Pay is good for the industry it is , but it is a very high demanding retail store that causes a lot of undo stress to its employees. The benefits with this company are not very good."
bad,after 17 years they terminated me for forgetting to clock out at lunch accusing me of stealing time. they treat there associates like there nothing. you work hard and commit to them and then you get tossed out like trash.
bad,There's a lot of things that go on there that I for one did not want to be involved in. You only get one break and that's for lunch. I really didn't learn much of any thing except bad stuff going on there. Co-workers argued a lot.
bad,A typical day started with a meeting were they asked us for our suggestions and input as well as concerns though we had learned to keep quiet due to a employee who has been with the company for 10 years (recently just got his plaque and new badge) did speak his concerns and was rudely shut down and told to mind his own business. Followed by our dispersed through the floor to start working on pallets in each area which were dangerously stacked and often fell and caused injuries to workers and were some of us had multiple departments and more pallets than could be reasonably dealt with the lack of support and required technology (Telezons [for finding locations of items as well as to scan items to allow for the printers to work] and printers to make labels for over stock. I was a part of the third shift and had for the last 8 month prior to my leaving had asked management to shift to another full time position on preferably first shift to better work for my on coming collage schedule and life in general and had applied both in person and through the in work system to open positions within the company but all of my requests were denied. I was also forced to use my sick days even though i had requested time off two months in advance to allow me to move into a new apartment but my request was denied and i was instead forced to use my sick days to complete my move into my new home. And i am not the only one who has had to deal with this repeated denial of all requests for time off. The management also use their coaching system as a way to force individuals into being stuck at their
bad,Horrible management. Benefits are ok. Employees are constantly coming and going. If you need something temporarily it is an OK job to seek. If looking for something long term I would suggest you look else where. Pay for the amount of stuff the want you to do is terrible.
bad,The worst place to work. Management only pretends to listen to you and never follows through with what they say. They don’t care about the associates and will through you under the bus just to save their skin.
bad,"Pay sucks, they expect you to do the jobs of three people, management is inept. Two words: Black Friday. Or, let's be real, Black Thursday so you get to work on Thanksgiving."
bad,The management team had favourite employee and it was easy to tell who preferred who. Hours were not good. Expecting people to live off of 16 hours a week is ridiculous. They won't hiring full time because the company does not want to give benefits and have to pay for them. It was dirty and not organized very well. Days were long and cashiers often hurt their backs and had to deal with way too much for their pay rate.
bad,This job my a be a good first job for young people but is not the place for a long term career. This company does not allow any over time and will force you to cut your over time to avoid paying it. The management doesn't communicate with each other and are constantly making the job harder than it should be.
bad,A typical day at Walmart starts with not knowing what your gonna be doing and which boss is gonna tell you what to do. Walmart says they are base on family that totally wrong
bad,I would typically go to the corral and move pallets of rock. In the mornings we would have to get all of the freight done. I learned how to run the service desk and am certified on a forklift.
bad,"Not a good job if you have any trouble picking up and learning the job on your own. No training was given, they throw you out there and its basically sink or swim on your own. They dont respect your available hours and schedule you on the days you need off and the hours when you will be unavailable. There is no help from supervisors and managers when you need them with an agitated customer."
bad,"Stock toys, zone, and keep department cleaned. Assist customers in choosing the right items, assist customers with all their needs while at Wal-Mart. Run cash register. I was promoted to the Garden Department, I take care of all the plants that we sale, I also help unload carts of flowers and plants and set them up on display, I help our customers, I also help clean all three patios and stock the shelves, I have set mods, re-set mods, condensed mods, set up displays and taken displays down. I have worked every holiday since being at walmart and I truly loved doing so, because I love helping my customers."
bad,"almost every manager is mean and extremely rude to employees and they arent happy at all, all the time. most employees arent happy, they seem to hate their job."
bad,The management was horrible and would always change the seclude at the last second and never let anyone know that it was changed so you would waste your gas and time to go to work even tho you didn't have to work
bad,"Management is horrible & ungreatful!!! If you are full-time your hours can drop from 40 to 16 hours a week!! They don't schedule enough people to work, so they run the little bit of associates that they do schedule, crazy! It's a lot of the buddy system that flows through walmart as well. Even if you are well qualified for a position it doesn't matter, it's the friends that you have in different management positions. Save your time and hair, and look for something better."
bad,They took us for granted. They wouldn't allow us to grow within the company although they wanted us to learn every aspect of the company. I just couldn't stay. Management was ok some was very understanding and some was not.
bad,"Looking back, the only thing I enjoyed about working here was working with my co-workers. Management never treated us as equals. Our employment status was always threatened by management. Looking back, I cannot remember a single associate who was happy at this employer."
bad,You will work hard every single day and will probably not be appreciated while your working there. Walmart is not for everyone.
bad,high paced work with little down time kept us busy and the day flew. Learned a lot of things I didn't know and sharpened up a few things I already knew.
bad,The place is the place to be if you are looking for almost anything from guns to clothes.Its a company thats going to be around for a long time.
bad,They worked us like salve drivers and were very rude when asked for a break which they forgot about a lot. I was coached for so much things that i wasn't trained for and was eventually fired because of a misunderstanding with me and a customer. instead of hearing me out i was coached and that led to me being fired. On top of that i was a senior in high school working until about 12 am and then going home to do homework until about 3 and getting up at 5:30 am. when i tried to change my availability because it was getting to me they told me they couldn't do it at the moment. Then when i went to the store manager they cut my hours about 70% so instead of working 5 days i went to two days four shifts
bad,Walmart is money hungry. They do not pay their employees properly and they do not care about their employees. It is sad because they make so much money!!!!
bad,"They treat there employees awful! Lack of organization and inexperienced management.  They make promises and dont follow through.  They make up procedure and policy on the fly and do not properly inform the employee.  Then they will ""write you up.""  They yell at grown adults as if they were 5 years old.  Management hires unreliable people, because they are unreliable... It appears when they have hard working, loyal people, the take advantage.  Again, management is inexperienced and un professional! Customer service is down the tubes because management is down the tubes!"
bad,"As a receiving associate it was my job to empty out merchandise and other products from a truck. Most of the time we were under manned and management required us to work until all trucks were unloaded. Management never listened to their associates. A lot of favoritism was at play. No regards to veteran employees. Overall, it is a horrible working environment."
bad,I loved working there but was blind sighted by getting fired at the end of my three month employment. Management constantly spread gossip about employees and it felt like I was back in high school. the drama was unbearable but I enjoyed the customers. that whole store needs an over haul on management.
bad,i learned what not to say to people and how to operate in hectic environments. I also learned how to work with difficult people and how to communicate with various language barriers such as Spanish and sign
bad,I showed up to work to run the front end and they treat you like a slave all day. I was never happy there just did it for my family.
bad,"This was my first job, being that it was actually the first place I have ever worked for there was a lot of mishaps. The managers and/or CSM's did not treat me with respect, they were never there when I had questions, they told me that missing a week due to my grandfathers and aunts deaths was not acceptable at all, and the schedule they put me on was mixing my school hours with work hours. I had a horrible experience working here and I would not reccormend it to anyone."
bad,"It was an all around nightmare. The worst case of ""the blind leading the blind"" as far as management is concerened, furthermore the pay was set for 10$ an hour but was reduced to 7.29$ an hour due to theft rates. Very over worked and very underpayed. I was not happy."
bad,"So few managers and employees that customers can never get the help they need. The place is so under staffed its a shame, all the good employees transferred to better run corporations."
bad,Will never work for this company again in my life. This was the most ungrateful establishment i have ever seen. They do not value their employees and they don't know how to treat people.
bad,The stores are unorganized and filthy. The employees could care less about the customers. The managers take advantage of their employees and don't provide any benefits or incentives. They pay you nearly nothing and expect you to come in and break your back everyday while being treated like a slave. All of the employee's look and seem like they are miserable and hate their lives. AVoid this company at all costs.
bad,"As the largest retail chain in the world, Walmart must hire on and maintain sizable staffs of sales associates to provide customer service. Workers falling under the job title of sales associate take responsibility for greeting customers, locating products, price-checking items, and organizing store shelves and displays. Sales associates also answer customer questions about policies, services, and products. Returning carts to store frontends also serves as a typical, daily responsibility of sales associates."
bad,"The work hours are random. The work days are random. The wages are surely not worth the effort. Its as if they roll a dice and say that is how many hours you are going to work. Doesn't help that they only tell you what days you work 2 weeks in advance. Do you like planning things in advance? then don't work for Walmart. Do like a consistent shift? then don't work for Walmart. Do you like having a steady paycheck? then don't work for Walmart. a quote my fellow co-workers used to use was ""you take the smartest thing you can do, reverse that and that is Walmart"""
bad,"Walmart portrays itself as a family oriented business, that is, unless you actually work for Walmart. Walmart cares little about employees private lives."
bad,"During my time at Walmart, I felt the management did not treat their employees. The employees were all overworked and underpaid."
bad,"Worst job I have ever had in my life. This company lied to me to get me into a position they wanted. If I would have had another choice, I would not have worked for them but I had to take care of my family because they come first."
bad,"management wasn't always around when needed, but worked well with sales associates. I always did what I was told. Ex: when needed back up cashier for the front I went. needed people to unlaod in the back i also went."
bad,"The job itself is not hard, but when you have broken tools, backstabbing coworkers and 5 different managers all telling you to do something different its easy to burn out quickly."
bad,"They cannot keep managers, they do not work with associates schedules. Advancement only occurs if you are willing to switch stores which means needing to travel. If you are a good worker your odds of being able to transfer stores are like your chances of winning the lottery."
bad,Walmarts an alright place to work but i think their is to many chiefs and not enough Indians if you get my analogy. I like that you got ateast 3 breaks and either a 30 min or an hour lucnh depending on your shift
bad,"a impressa é um lugar bom e agradável de trabalhar, uma impressa onde a muitas oportunidades de crescimento, os colegas de trabalho sempre muito atenciosos, a má organização do gerente em relação ao funcionamento de aparelhos e maquinas de trabalho é o que muitas vezes  que atrapalha o desempenho de muitos funcionários."
bad,"a typical day at work included bossy rude managers , no team work , and unhappy customers. I learned to have tough skin working with a company like Wal-Mart. management wasn't good role models for their employees. my employees were all in all great people to work with I had some bad encounters with some but others were good. the hardest part of my job was the rude customers. the most enjoyable was when I clocked out."
bad,I liked it. it was alota fun. There were a lot of good people to work with and fun with every night o third shift...the shift was the best because it gave mw more of few on what it takes to operate as a night owl.
bad,"There was never any way to become a manager or any way to advance in your job. They always wanted to keep you where you were at if you were good at the job. I was the best stocker that they had in frozen and dairy and they wont let me out of it. our support managers were compeltely rude and never did anything to help out but when things didnt get done, they got really mad . There is a lot of favoritism as well and that gets in the way of work."
bad,"Never, never, never, never work at Wal-Mart. They raised the minimum pay yes, however they lowered the annual raises you get maybe 10-15 cents if you do a good job. If they think you aren't good they can deny you raises. Management is terrible. They give you a 10 hour task and expect you done in 5 to get zoned and go help other people who don't do their job. The people who do their job get in trouble because they expect them to get everything done then when they have an off day they don't have a back up plan for then like they do for the employees that normally don't get finished."
bad,Working at Walmart is a good experience to learn about customer service to get the 1st feeling of having a job for the 1st time
bad,"I honestly would never work for this company again! I was harassed by most of the management team, I got hurt a few times here as well, sliced my finger, fractured my ankle, and many more injury's. Management is the main issue though, they have no idea how to do their job, they don't take responsibility for themselves, and they of course didn't treat the other associates with respect or even like they mattered."
bad,the customer were great and all but the management was another story I wont go there. the rest of the employees were great the ones that you worked with.
bad,I feel like there is not much direction. They try to change to many things that really don't need to be changed. I do enjoy my co workers that is sadly the best part of the job. Management I don't think is very good.
bad,I started working there while going to college. They worked well with my college schedule very well.  The hardest part about the job was meeting the timeline for unloading the trucks.
bad,Enjoyable: My co-workers were the best part of my day as well as my regular customers. Management sucks!! There was a  lot of favoritism while working there. Management feels like they have you dangling by a thread. Crooked people!!!!
bad,"Employees are not trained for their job, there is a lot of lack of information. Overworked employees no vacation hours."
bad,"I really don't remember, it was long ago. It was a decent job though. all I did was cashier everyday. nice people. uojhdwb;oiqeh'pEWDJMVCNC/NDV :F  CE'.mdv""LQDmv  :?M S""xm vdx/,"
bad,"I am very fast with the register so when I get my customers out of there fast it makes them happy.. If its time for me to go home and there is a long line, I would stay and help get the line down."
bad,"A typical day at Walmart when I was first hired on was working at cash registers, counting money to make sure I had a sufficient amount in the registers. When I was not helping customers, I helped keep the customer service area clean and made sure that the bags were stocked. Then I started working as a stocker, ensuring that the freight that was delivered to the store was properly stocked for the customers. I was given a designated area to stock and I had to stock my freight in a specified time efficiently. I was required to help customers in my area as needed, clean up my work area, and then face the product. I also worked as an IMS associate in the backrooms, helping pick items that needed to be stocked from the backroom to the sales floor as well as binning the overstock that came back in the proper place. My responsibility was to make sure that I got all of the overstock freight binned before my shift ended and keep the backroooms cleaned and organized."
bad,never enough help. pay is not great for the amount of work and responsibilities you have. management sits in the office and does nothing. walmart does not accept doctor excuses or emergency room slips. overall a terrible place to work
bad,"As my first job, I was able to learn to work in a scheduled environment, working with others, and handling uncomfortable temperatures in my department. I learned to work efficiently in an area with little training."
bad,My position was Pharmacy Sales Associate. I did not like this job or the management at all. There was too much drama and negativity in this workplace. I probably will never go back there.
bad,"Bad administration."
bad,Nice place to work and very clean.And everyone is nice to work with makes everything very comfortable.And is very understanding
bad,This company sucks. Doesn't care about employees and their families. They promote poor customer service. They concentrate more on filling shifts with poor quality workers than they do cultivating the good workers they have
bad,"AWFUL place to work, The employees and head staff were rude and not welcoming. I had to learn everything on my own.. no help! "
bad,Unload trucks and bring all the freight to the main floor. I learned how to stack boxes really well. Managers where nice but took advantage of being in charge way to much. I liked most of my co-workers. Hardest part was the fact that not everyone wanted to do there job or people would just walk away from there station. The best part was being able to drive the fork lift.
bad,"You aren't surprised to hear this. Wal-mart is basically a joke. They don't make it easy to work there and they don't care if you're happy."
bad,There is not one good thing about this place. I would not  tale anyone to go work there. They do not care at all about the people how work for them they just want there money at payday.
bad,"I use to work in the bakery and make donuts. I learned how to make donuts, and stock shelves, my co workers were always nice the hardest part of my job was getting up at 4 a. m. the most enjoyable part of my job was customers"
bad,I interact with customers because i am a cashier so i have one on one with each customer i learn to have respect for my customer and get them out in a timely manner and make sure their needs are met to the best of my ability.I work well with my co- workers and help them any way i can. the lifting is the hardest part because i have back and shoulder problems. being able to help people. i am a very loyal facebook user and have been for several years. i believe i would be a asset to your team and would appreciate the chance to work with your company.wal mart is a company that cares only about the money and they do not care about the associates .
bad,a typical day you would go in and have to wait on customers. and deal with the managers  my co workers were a great bunch of people
bad,I worked for Wal-Mart for 7 years and learned how to do everything in the store. I was never thanked or rewarded or even noticed.
bad,"worst place to work ever. overworked and under paid."
bad,"surprise they finally gave them wages they can live by. When I worked here the management was rude they did not care about you or what you had going on in life, They did not care if you got a break or if you were about to die while working, Walmart is a bad company I don't even shop at that place."
bad,"They lie and black ball people, they work you super hard and pay you very little. They don't care about you if you are not friends with the management."
bad,Would be an ok overall job if it weren't for the managers and staff stalking you and trying to intimidate their employees. Would definetely recommend working elsewhere.
bad,"do not care about employees, the pay sucks. wouldn't recommend this company to my worst enemy ...I don't agree with their policies or procedures."
bad,walmart super center is not a good place to work. the management is not always the best and my reason for saying because they always think they are better than the employees thats working hard and they treat the employees like dogs and doesnt wanna pay
bad,Walmart is an okay job. It goes by pretty quick when its busy which is a good thing. It pays good for the most part but not good enough for what they pay you.
bad,This job is absolutely horrible.  The management team is very disrespectful to employees.  Most employees are still part time with no benefits. I never want to work for this company ever again.
bad,"It was a job, but that is about it. The pay was low for all the work they wanted you to do and the management did not treat all employees equally. A lot of favoritism in the location where I worked."
bad,"As an employee at Walmart I had found myself to realize that management did not communicate to their fellow employees and other managers within the company, I had received little breaks as I was a minor however they were only 20-30 minutes long in-between long shifts, and customer service managers were not present whenever something happens. For instance the cash register malfunctions and if a customer has a concern or complaint for which only management can resolve."
bad,Walmart is the worst place I have ever worked. They do not see their employees as people but just a number. There is no such thing as family when you work for this place
bad,this was a great experience for me its fast pace and its the public so you learn different ways of working with all different types of people
bad,Just don't work at Walmart if you ever want to possibly enjoy going to work ever. well that's how I see it at least. How ever there is pay every 2 weeks.
bad,"Walmart and it's management is a joke! They care nothing about an individual or their life. My father-in-law got cancer while I was working here and my hours had to change. Walmart management said they would change my hours, but then wrote me up for missing days that they gave me off! Then they fired me, no warning! Worst place ever to work!"
bad,"customer complaints just so they can get free stuff"
bad,"this job requires a lot of dedication as it requires waking up at the crack of dawn, walking through dewy cornfields, and acquiring a nasty corn rash. Again, a great started job as it pays quite nice."
bad,"You stay there for 9 hours..third shift is easy but you get heavy boxes, some you can barely lift. You don't do what you're trained too. Really disappointed."
bad,"Poor place to work for if you wish to advance in a pharmacy /medical field. little to no support from immediate supervisiors, poor to no healthcare benefits, customer nor employee safty is not a concern"
bad,Management as a whole show to much favoritism. If you are not on their good side you will not move up. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the customers. Seeing them satisfied makes me feel like I am doing something right. The hardest is fixing the freezer it seems everyday.
bad,I pray that if anyone tells me that they work at walmart I will do my best to help them get something better in their life than walmart.
bad,"Wal-Mart, from what I have heard, use to be a great place to work. I have a full-time position and can not depend on getting 40 hours in a single week."
bad,worked there and was promised more hours and was worked 24 hours a week and asked for more hours and was told i am part time and they cant' give me more hours......so i have to quit this job to look for work with more hours
bad,Extremely hostile work environment. Management had no people skills and promoted the hostile work environment. They also showed a gross lack of experience to be management.
bad,"this was a job i had when i was 16, was a nice starting job and the staff was pretty decent. the store had some good hours. I only worked at this place over the summer, but now we no longer have a zellers here so this review doesnt matter"
bad,"Walmart is not a productive work environment. There are no benefits and they do not hire full-time any more. Upper management is not interested in what the everyday worker has to say or concerns for their well being. My experience was not enjoyable. The only thing that made it bearable were some of the fellow employees. The hardest part of the job was getting stock from the stockroom. Things were so piled up that you could not get to the merchandise that you needed for your department. I did not feel safe coming out of the store at nighttime after 9:00 pm. Employees have to park at the upper end of the parking lot and lighting is very poor at the store I worked at. Walmart is not the company it used to be. They have taken everything that made them special and gave nothing in return,"
bad,"Horrible experience. Poor compensation, outrageous expectations, insulting benefits, and incompetent management. Wal-Mart is the number one retail chain in the world and they treat their employees like indentured servants, and everyone in an authoritative position is crooked."
bad,they put you where they needed need you. not according to your experience or desire on where or what you wanted to do. for example i had 15 years of experience with tv's and audio and eletronics but they thought i would be happy and content with the stocking of can food
bad,"Very unfriendly and rude, schedule changes were last minute. "
bad,not a healthy place to work and to much stress no cares worst job ever you always get hurt you do to much work for little pay insurance  is low you only make 10 thou a year no hours
bad,"The management is terrible, most of the equipment needed to complete jobs are damaged or unusable, the pay is sub-par for the work done. I could go on and on but I won't."
bad,The job have a lot of UPS and down I learn not to make friends why you work because them people will talk bad about you. Management is a some time they nice one day and then mean the next the hardest part is going so fast but my work always done but its a job that get me tho the day
bad,I worked for this company for 3 years and myself and everyone I worked with were repeatedly spoken badly to by the store manager and many deserving candidates were passed over for promotions based on if the store manager liked you or not. This is not the way to promote hard work from employees.
bad,"my job duties were to check in all grocery vendors, I did this 5 days a week. I enjoyed my job with this company. Management at this facility was very unprofessional."
bad,Terrible job. The managers treat you either as an item or something that they know is expendable. They say they have an open door policy but that's bull. Would never suggest this job to anyone.
bad,"horrible hours, management and co workers. i wouldn't recommend anyone to work here unless they absolutely have to. IT SUCKS!!!"
bad,"4 years with little or no positive recognition.  Limited room for advancement and non-caring management team.  Was just a number, my name meant nothing to them."
bad,"The store would be better if management took the time to structure the store to where all who work there are able to enjoy the jobs that they do day in and day out. The entire place runs on dis-function and they think it is they proper way of doing things, but anyone with common sense can see a more beneficial way of doing things to better the functionality of the store."
bad,"Management was horrible no help to new employees at all, all night shift supervisors just walked around chilling do not a darn thing but got the nerve to try and slave and over work the rest of the employees. And they keep you at part time temp to hire but will work you full-time hours weekly."
bad,This job is not a fun one and the managers have unrealistic expectations for only some of their employees and they will not promote someone unless you are a close friend.
bad,I don't know about all of the other stores but the Walmart on Woodmen and powers sucks. Management treats everyone like dirt. Your suggestions are never heard. They think your a robot so you aren't allowed to get sick and don't dare bring in a doctors note. It still won't excuse you absence.
bad,Walmart is the worst company to work for. They drag their feet when it comes to promoting and once they do promote they don't train! When you ask for training they don't give it to you. The stress is unbearable and they back you into a corner where you either have to chose between your health or your job. STAY AWAY FROM THIS HORRIBLE COMPANY!!!!!!!
bad,Do not care about their employees. Wont fire you but will make you so miserable that you want to quit so they dont fire you.
bad,"That place is very unorganized and sloppily ran, the managers at night are very discriminative and rude. i was fired for leaving for lunch at 2 am and not returning because my baby was being born and i couldnt call because of how early it was. i felt as if the management was out to get me due to my race."
bad,While working there I thought I was going to be able stay there for a while and was actually advancing up to Customer Service until my child got sick and needed me to rush him to the E.R. they told me that if I left to take care of my child I wouldn't have a job to come back to.
bad,I interfered with my college work too muck for me to continue my employment there.  There was rarely any energy at the workplace and the work was monotonous and boring.
bad,I am looking  forward to working fo a company that appreciates it's employee's. Where there is a cohesiveness between the employee and management.
bad,"being put in different areas, and attempting to learn the area, I learned to deal with different attitudes and different moods and still be friendly. Management was the worse they didn't care if you were fine or not. The hardest part of the job was thinking that I was going to  move up and they only looked out for their friends or family that would come into the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers and making sure that their shopping experience was enjoyable."
bad,Every single person you come into contact with treats you like you're nothing. I was told that in order to finish training I would have to get one mastercard application and when I did and went to the back they had no idea what I was talking about and prodded me for my real training sheets. You are thrown to the wolves from day one.
bad,"This job was very fun and rewarding at times, I depends how you choose to look at it. I always tried to look at working their positively even though most of the time the people and shoppers were far from that. I learned a lot of good personal skills from working at Walmart. Patience, respect, kindness and always achieving excellent customer service was the skills I perfected while working there."
bad,"Not a place to work if you want to build a career path in life. Management sucks, unfriendly management. Co-workers are pretentious. No enjoyable moment at the job"
bad,The management isn't good to the employee at all. I like my customer that come to Wal-mart . I give them the best customer service.
bad,"Walmart was a nightmare, I would never again work for this comapny in anyway. I honestly have nothing nice to say about this company as a employer"
bad,"Walmart consists of Long hours, High Stress levels, Fair Pay could be better, Poor Management. The Company is nice to work  for if you're going to start out in the retail business."
bad,This store is a shame to work at. Has a high turnover rate which is not good. Some of the people in management are fun to work with while others are not.
bad,"The people of WalMart were great, loved to work with them again. But the company I hated to work for. Hours cut, no insurance, and always saying the company is not making no money."
bad,The job was great at first. I do have a lot of medical issues and I had to take a lot of time off which was understandable at first. I had to have surgery and when I tried talking to the manager about it he got a attitude with me. I didn't like it at all so we had a dispute.
bad,"Customer service, ordering, price changes, zone, fill end caps, I learned a lot on my own, managers treated you like you were poor, a lot of favoritism, a lot of drama."
bad,"Corrupted Management , with poor Exp , resist people , NOT Future Job , I heard a lot about how bad is it until I work there for 3 weeks and it is bad environment and they need u to work like dog all day long !"
bad,"I would rather not rate this job at this time, personally did not enjoy working there, management was not friendly and some of your co-workers work ethic was not high."
bad,it was awful i didnt learn anything at all they were totally mean to me the managers were really bad and didnt pay attention to other employees
bad,"The management got to comfortable with all employees. The employees did not take the job serious. People never came to work, a lot of employees did not get along with each other. Management didn't handle certain situations the right way."
bad,very family oriented and very helpful but can be stressful and play that I like to work and other associate are very understanding and likeable
bad,"Management is horrible!!! Turnover rate is high"
bad,typical day show up get butt kicked got way underpaid for it. Dealt with three managers/supervisors that made working there miserable for 5 months. NOTHING was enjoyable about job. I learned IF I'm desperate for a job I will not work there EVER again.
bad,"My personal experience was a good opportunity that turned into a nightmare mainly because the wages are impossible to live off of.  There is no culture of respect.  I learned a lot because I asked a lot of questions and forced people to help me.  The hardest part was lack of team work and respect.  I would recommend starting in a retail pharmacy chain as they help with your certification and extended learning, but it is not a career."
bad,Like any walk mart it isn't worth working for. Pay sucks. Co workers are rude and not nice. Management aren't nice either. it just isn't a job you would enjoy. you just go cause you need the money.
bad,Management was rude and never had help around when help was needed. Unable work with schedule the driving distance was too far. Hours were ridiculous.
bad,I disliked everything about Walmart. The management was bad and there is no control over anything. There was nothing enjoyable about Walmart.
bad,"I like customer serve and interacting with customers all day, Walmart on the other hand does not treat their employees with any respect. I started off with 40 hours A week. Then after a couple weeks they had cut my hours down to 20. With no reasoning behind it. They had originally hired me for full time, but that was a lie since I only averaged a good 15-20 hours each week if I was lucky,"
bad,If you do not like being the teachers pet you will never move up in the company. Do not plan on getting sick because they will not care.
bad,"Cashier."
bad,Micro-Management and miscommunications was a daily struggle. Inventory management system is flawed. Employees that I managed worked hard but would often be pulled to assist other departments due to inventory and management issues.
bad,"too much work for bs pay , I will never go back . they make you do work you that do not apply to you . please don't apply or you will be mad at yourself"
bad,working at Wal-Mart in napanoch is horrible because they don't care about what happens with your life they try to trap you there.. what the worst thing about this place is everyone is very rode and disrespectful people..
bad,"Bust your but hours get cut, loose money, no advancement. Awful management wast of food daily. Not the best place to work"
bad,"enjoyed the variety of tasks, not happy with management but stayed professional and positive, enjoyed co workers.  I enjoyed the over all work and enjoyed my department but the negativity of the management on all the good workers was discouraging."
bad,"I worked in frozen and it was a good job I kept all the frozen stocked and I also worked in dairy there I kept all the milk, tea, butter elc  stocked"
bad,"typical day  like any, management rude, my co-workers I work with are great most enjoyable part of the job to me is my customer."
bad,"Working here will make you wanna punch someone, it;s really unorganized. There are way too many people ""in charge"" and the schedules aren't consistent. Also the pay sucks for the work you have to do. Managers always have nasty attitudes without reasoning."
bad,"DO NOT work for the Circleville Walmart. If you love yourself, DO NOT work here. This place kills your soul. The customers and management are literally the worst."
bad,Always getting harassed by management couldn't work in a team even when having to lift heavy objects even though team lift is required always got on what I wear even though I was following dress code. People that have been there for a 5+ years or in good with managers always got away with taking long breaks and not following store procedures favoritism was always played by management. managers would sit in the office and just gossip and never answered when the employees or customers need them.
bad,I would get there and set up to unload the truck. I learned better customer service skills and how to deal with each individual customer. Management was busy but there to help if needed. My co-workers made work fun and interesting. Making sure everyones task was done at the end of the night. Talking with my co-workers and having a great time while I was at work.
bad,I have found that they are more willing to fire employees than to accept the fact that their training system needs a lot of work.
bad,My responsibility working for this company was to take in customers returns and refund them or credit them their items.
bad,"It's walmart, I needed a job when I moved into town so I worked here for a year and some months."
bad,"I was a assembler I did bikes, grills and work the the sales floor stocking and helping customers on sales floor also help in the warehouse"
bad,"Terrible Company Structure"
bad,"Disrespected, overworked and underpaid. Not treated fair, favoritism is shown to whoever is wiling to suck up to the managers. Can't ever speak your mind without retaliation."
bad,hated working here if you have a choice work someplace else.  they are almost always short staffed.  In my experience they promote those they like over those well suited to a position.
bad,"not a professional place to work, dangerous employees , not a safe area, unprofessional management, not enough freedom to grow"
bad,"Walmart does not care about there employees or about what is the right thing to do. I worked night here during college, they would not adjust my schedule for school until I collapsed from exhuastion and then changed it only so I would not quit. The management played favorites and only cared about getting things done on there list and their time regardless of employee situation or experience. Non management and or non senior employees are treated poorly."
bad,"Worst place. Cash manager was a tyrant who was always mean. There are some good managers! quite a few are wonderful people to work for but the ones I dealt with were awful.  You could have missed work because you're in the hospital dying and they would need a sick note, and even then, they would mark it against you as not showing up for work.  most enjoyable part of this job was leaving it."
bad,I would not suggest working for Walmart. The benefits are not worth the stress. Conditions of the builder were not good.
bad,Wal-mart is the number one business in the world but has many setbacks. It is a cold unfriendly place. If your not in the loop you'll never get ahead. To be honest I has nothing good to say but you get a check.
bad,"I have worked at Wal-Mart on and off for 7 years and the only positive is that I have a job. I do enjoy the group I work with. Overall I really do not like this company. Not enough pay and they hire for part time and work you full time hours, without the benefits."
bad,Value was not placed on the employees. It's unimaginable how an employee can support a family with the pay scale provided.
bad,"Personally, I hated this job. I got about a week and a half of actual OJT and then I was left to fend for myself. Many aspects of the job were not clearly explained to me, and I rarely got the assistance I needed when I needed it. Supervisors simply didn't care."
bad,Took Inventory did picking and packing shipping and receiving wrapped pallets and wrapping pallets lifting up to 50lbs and standing for long periods of time
bad,I don't have anything good to say about working for Wal Mart for 4.5 years. Therefor I will say nothing other than most fellow associates are good people.
bad,"Learned how walmart stages it pallets for unloading freight, managers can work on your last nerves. Underpaid and overworked for what you do on a daily basis. After work is done you are expected to stock freight or do picks"
bad,I only worked their for a short period of time where i was thrown into a position where i needed to stock shelves ( not a difficult thing but their are tricks that only one person told me about ) as i worked there the managers would laugh at me from afar. On my last day they brought me in to tell me that they no longer needed me and as they were delivering the message they were laughing at me making me feel low. i am an older man yes but numerous men that i have worked with have said that i am a very hard worker and i do very well. the fact that those managers treated me like i was nothing will push me to prove that i am better than each and everyone of them.
bad,"My experience with Walmart was not a good one. They don't pay well, they don't care about their employees, the hours are terrible. The only good thing about it was that there was a little flexibility in schedules."
bad,"Walmart is a  Big Box retail store that sales great items at a low cost, There are plenty of areas to move around, and it  just gets really busy at times ."
bad,"The work atmosphere at Walmart?  Low wages, bullying, and little to no opportunities for advancement.  Worker complaints are expedited through the creation of poisoned work environments for the complainants.  Very unethical company that puts profits well ahead of people."
bad,"the management sucks, you get treated horribly and you work hard for little to nothing. coworkers behave in an unprofessional manner, and the overnight staff are forced to clean up after the day shift and take responsibility for the actions of people on the previous shift. its ridiculous."
bad,This was a horrible place to work. If you worked hard you were constantly riduculed and nitpicked by your bosses while you watched others slack off and nothing was done about it
bad,"The other employers didnt care for anyone but themselves, the managers were ok, they didnt really give any warning for anything. they expect you to know what to do."
bad,I was deli associate for year I closing and opening shifts time I been their  and cross train in the bakery making bread cakes and other food
bad,"There is nothing good about this place, and you might want to live in a cardboard box before you work here, you'll make more. Also the cheer that they make you say at the beginning of each shift crushes your soul a little more each day you say it."
bad,"worked inside of freezer loading and unloading route trucks,driving automatic and stick shift route trucks,taking inventory of route trucks and also inventory of freezer,unloading weekly semi trucks to stock freezer."
bad,I HATE working for Walmart!!!!!They are the WORSE company EVER to work for!!! They dont care about their associates and their families and you cant be human and make a mistake because that could cost you your job!! They want a body to work!! You can be bleeding out of your eyeballs and they would hand you a towel and tell you to shake it off and get back to work!!! The management is horrible and the customers treat you like you owe them something. Walmart needs to go back to where it came from.
bad,"I didn't like waking up to clock in, horrible job experience very unethical & unprofessional. great co-workers but thats about it."
bad,I wish not say any thing about Wal-mart. I fill very proud of when I quit from this company. I like to work for a company where people show  some kind of respect and give us break on according to the company policy.
bad,I did not like working for walmart at that location. They gave no hours to their works and they didn't respect them either. they treated their works as if they aren't humans.
bad,"After my mom passed, I was fired after being late to work a few times after leaving hospital visits. I worked here a year & a half, every Holiday, several hours overtime. Terrible management."
bad,"this is also a great job if you are in school and needing the experience. the management is always horrible at retail..their thoughts are ""we are retail, what do you expect?"""
bad,"Horrible company to work for, there irresponsible and disrespectful and do not look out for there employees. there just ridiculous and don't pay enough for the work they exspect. slave labor"
bad,"Walmart  hard working conditions, not enough help, management doesnt care its staff christmas time was the hardest very under staffed"
bad,"they are not a good company it is all about politics there if  you get along with management you will get promoted if you dont get along with management you will not get promoted, it does not matter how hard you work or your perfect attendance its about who you know"
bad,"Job work/life balance: nonexistent. they'll work you till 1 am then have you come in at 9 am as long as it's the bare minimum."
bad,they lack customer service the store is dirty the management does not care about employee a lot of workers are thrown into work with no training
bad,"you can be placed anywhere they want even if they hired you for a specific job"
bad,I have worked in this store for four years now been through 4 different store managers and three different market managers. I have tried on several occasions to move up and have had no guidance  nor help with this process. Have on several times been cut down and refer to as a worthless person. this is why I want to find a new career path
bad,Stocking and maintaining area. Making sure shelves are neat. Management was knowledgeable about products in the store. The hardest part making sure that we didn't harm guest while pulling out pallets
bad,"Walmart believes that large amounts of work can be done with minimal personnel. While the company guidelines say that they are supportive of their workers, they are not, often employees are encouraged to work over and the next week your hours are cut to balance the time. Management is encouraged to constantly monitor and berate employees in an attempt to squeeze more work. As a department manager I worked very hard in my area and once the store and my department passed the yearly audit, our promised bonus was never received and later the store manager said he used it to but an ice machine! I have worked in customer service and retail for years and have never experienced what I went through at walmart. After a year with the company as a manager and receiving exceeds on every evaluation, I received a .5 raise."
bad,i tell you about walmart you work your Butt off there and it gets you no where and you might not even get a raise or anything management always thought they were better then you always talked down to you and i hated working there thats why i will never work there again
bad,"Great starter job however, not the greatest job for long term. Too high paced. The day starts with a meeting with all staff, I have learned to work as a team with multiple personalities. The managers are polite quite strict due to the nature of the task.The hardest part of the job is taking orders from persons who were not supervisors who were unannounced team leaders. I greatly enjoyed working with a very diverse group of ages and seeing how they interact with each other to complete a task."
bad,you would have to be an idiot or desperate to ever work at Walmart. you are treated like a robot with no emotions or family and are expected to either bow down to your supreme overlords or get fired.
bad,during your interview they do tell you their strict on attendance and how you can request days off. when I requested days off like a month or two in advance I never got it and you don't really have a steady schedule there
bad,The employees are very unprofessional. The mangers are unprofessional. The worst part about a cashier was when you need assist and the CSM would never come help you or be very disrespectful and unprofessional  in front of customers. Best place to shop at but worst place to work at
bad,"Avoid this place at all costs. Horrible people, horrible bosses. The managers treat you like horribly, they will do whatever they can to get you to quit so that they don't have to pay unemployment. I don't even spend my money there. I refuse to support that place."
bad,Walmart does not care about its associates they maintain a skeleton crew and expect for everything to be completed. There is no set processes so things are always confusing and never done correctly.
bad,"Prepare bay area with pallets and carts to unload trucks. "
bad,I would go in and like a robot clock in find out where i am supposed to go and start working. Some co-workers was nice other no so much. They don't want to offer full time because then they would have to offer benefits.
bad,"I discourage people to work at Wal-Mart whenever possible, as during my four years there I saw many young people with futures surrender those futures to management.  I apologize, but I refuse to even enter a Wal-Mart today.  They do not pay their employees enough money to raise them out of poverty, therefore ensuring that they will be trapped there forever if they are looking for a safe alternative."
bad,If you are just starting out in the work field it would be perfect to help you grow and learn how to deal with people and teaches you responsibility
bad,"I would recomend anybody to work here thsi is a good company and they always willing to qork with you, they have good opportunities especially if uj wanna move up."
bad,They don't treat their employees well. They don't give them food on their breaks. They make the cart pushers  stay outside for hours at a time during bad weather.
bad,the managers are terrible and they dont care about the employees at all. the people i worked with were great but management was terrible.
bad,Working here is  hard esp. the management you are pulled to different departments to do their jobs you have many bosses that will tell you what to do most of all you have customers looked at you as if you not educated they can yell at you whenever they want and if you can't resolve their issues they will asked a manager to talked to.
bad,"Not a great place to work. Supervisors were not easy to communicate with. Would not recommend any one to work there. They don't understand emergencies, such as emergency surgery."
bad,it was a nice store with friendly people I enjoyed the management and benefits. Not challenging enough for me. Wanted a more promising career.
bad,Hours are not consistent and no job security. Management is awful. Never can agree and always a change with policy or procedure. Under paid and over worked.
bad,They don't care about there employees they only care about making money. I got sick working there because it is to hot to work in the store.
bad,I would never work for walmart again they do not care about there employees. I asked to be transferred to the other store took the store manage 4 months and once I did get over there it was so hot in the store it was hard to work.
bad,In general working at Walmart wasn't a good experience. There's no guarantee in any advancement within the company unless your close to management. Most management has their favorites while the ones that actually keep to themselves are the workhorse of the company while the ones that slack off get away with it.
bad,"Terrible. Unorganized shelves, expired products, lack of assistance from management, the only enjoyable part was the flexible schedules."
bad,"Terrible place to work, they don't care about their employees at all. Save the customer money by keeping the average Walmart employee under the poverty line."
bad,The Management is terrible.  The work environment is terrible.  Everyone micromanages you and they fire you without grounds for termination.
bad,"Clock in at 10:00 p.m. and have the ""morning"" meeting. Then we would go out onto the sales floor and proceed to stock merchandise."
bad,"Management could care less about the employees. Many complaints through out store about  being over worked and under paid. Managers not caring much for employee health or family. If you dont have a stronge friendship with  omeone above your position then you are basically screwed. or you just have to keep your mouth shut and never complain. They will fire people for the most simplest reasons. Horrible place to work. i would never recommend this place to anyone."
bad,"the worst place to work management expects to much out of you. To stressful of a job. There is no help offered, in fact they will take your people and put them in other areas of the store. Then you are left with no one and then they want to know about sales and why things aren't getting done."
bad,At the Distribution Centers you will be asked to do very physical work and get paid hardly anything for it. The goals Wal-Mart sets are often unreachable making incentive pay near impossible to get.
bad,i am trying my best to get out of this facility they are very unfair the schedule is all over the place. You don't get paid enough o go through some of the things you go through
bad,it was an okay job i wasnt there for that long temp work it was fun i learned how to remodeling and organized an entire store
bad,They give you more hours than you want or less than what you want. Management is very rude. You never get your breaks or lunches on time.
bad,"If you are right out of highschool and need a job, hit up walmart.  They are a decent starter job but the pay isn't that good, management is lackluster at best and getting time off is rather difficult outside of medical reasons."
bad,"One of the worst jobs ive had, The Work wasnt bad, I had to unload a track and downstack up to 5 to 8 pallets a night, Normally each pallet takes 1 an half, And i only worked a 8 hour shift, Managers were HORRIBLE!!!! Walmart was one of the worst times of my life."
bad,the manager was a bully and used scare tactics and threats daily while you worked which made it very uneasy at the work place.
bad,Very motivated and have to have a good personality and deal with customers and shoplifters along with law enforcement everyday.
bad,"never had the opportunity to move up eve after applying for many positions over three years, very low pay, crazy hours without any care that I have a family"
bad,"loved my job and the customers just hated my boss and district manager, place was the most un organized place ever, favoritism for family that worked together."
bad,"Walmart has many problems, the worst of them all is that their management team treats people & its worker poorly. They are very demanding, demeaning, poor quality of work ethics, & poor conduct from their supervisor teams. The worst job I have ever held, no career advancement unless they allow you to advance. Its a slave work shop."
bad,Managers do not care about the employees and you get written up/fired for the craziest things. in the neighborhood market cashiers had to do everything. they want you to go outside in the pouring down rain and get carts then expect you to hop back on the register soak and wet. They expect you to perform all these jobs with little to nothing pay. the discount card sucks. you barely get a discount. Managers also have their favorites. so if you are not one of the favs ... And this is from experience at 3 different locations. I transferred to Sams Club from walmart thinking Sams would be different. NO. then i tried the neighborhood market thinking it would be different also. NO. all Walmarts are the same
bad,over worked and under payed for the stuff you had to deal with and the managers were horrible an absolute nightmare dont know what else to say
bad,"the typical day at work proving customer service, checking out customers, stocking, making sure all products were put out and put up correctly, acting customer service manger, making sure all cashiers were doing their jobs, and making sure all money was put out at the end of the shift. The hardest part/enjoyable part was making sure all product and work was done and all cashier working together to make sure it happened"
bad,The management team did nothing to help the employees. My responsibilities included several areas that required several people to operate correctly. Never had enough people to have a smooth day. The only good day I ever had there was the day Wal-Mart reimbursed me the funds required to get my GED.
bad,"The turnover rate is ridiculous, the treatment of staff was unfair. Certain areas of the store needed improvement and to be revamped."
bad,"Wonderful place to work"
bad,"There is no job training, the employees are all extremely unhappy, management is not at all concerned about their employees welfare or well being. People are treated very unfairly and underpaid for the job that they do.  It is among the worst employers in our country/"
bad,"Es un trabajo nefasto, no promueve el desarrollo e su gente ni de el Banco mismo, cuando es en su gente ,la más grande fuerza, No se busca; generar un equipo de trabajo que aprecia y valora a las personas y sus inicativas. De parte de los Gerentes de Plaza existe una clara represión, y rigen sin un modo de hacer y de ser. Ya que se dejan llevar por sus sesgos y con esto provocan acoso y hostigamiento sin darle a sus empleados un clima de respeto e inclusión. y provoca en el asociado afectado, sentimientos de desagrado, poca satisfacion y depresion. Con esto se crea un ambiente intimidatorio hostil y humillante para quien lo recibe y hasta para terceras personas,   se coarta su libertad laboral y personal. Deberia ser una organizacion incluyente, para que con esto generar un clima laboral mejor, prevenir las relaciones laborales tensas, ausentismo y baja productividad y con esto evitar la rotación de personal. Sobre todo NO respetan a las personas, ni a los principos Basicos de la CULTURA WALMART.... RESPETO POR EL INDIVIDUO"
bad,"You can move up fast, You do get paid better then most places. But you are treated horribly the entire time. The company, CEO, and everyone in management will treat you like you are worth nothing but work."
bad,Management had little consideration of what their employees have going on in their personal lives. This was a minimum wage job and was worked to the bone. Management thought nobody had a brain.
bad,"They over work you and pay you very little. A regular floor sales associate but is made to do cashier work, manager work, back room stocking, shelf replenishing, etc. All those extra things i learned and do are never appreciated and if you dont kiss up to the managers and just are an excellent worker, its not enough. All benefits and bonuses go to managers and the store manager and the company itself. Walmart use to be a wonderful place to work for when Sam Walton was around (thats what the veterans told me) and now its an awful place where if the right people dont like you, you end up loosing your job over unfounded accusations. Ive seen too many wonderful people who have worked so so many years there, here one second and gone the next. Definitely time to move on."
bad,You are under paid and over worked. There is no advancement and the hours given are horrible. If you have a family this company is not for you. it is very hard to obtain a fulltime position.
bad,It is a place full of so much fun and ambitious co-workers who seek promotion and work hard towards achieving their Goal. It is nice to had been a part of the Walmart team.
bad,The CEO has no respect for its employees. The managers are rude and don't care about any of the lower employees. They change your hours without notification.
bad,I have started the job and I am very unhappy with this job. they have trouble management and don't work with people religious belief. I travel to work 2-3  from work 2-3 hours when tried to transfer they would not accommodate my religious beilefs because they are a billion dollar corporation
bad,Wal-Mart wasn't the greatest place to work for in my opinion. It was like pulling teeth when you needed to take off and you have to fight to get a promotion. It didn't feel like there was much of a place for advancement and the management didn't treat the associates very well.
bad,I worked for Wal-Mart as a Customer Service Manager for a year.  I was surprised at the amount of drama that was allowed to occur daily at my job.  Assistant Managers and even the store manager did nothing to stop any wrong doing.  I loved my job besides the drama.  I was terminated due to not having a schedule.  The computer system messed up a ton of employees schedules at the Wal-Mart I was employed at and because I didn't have a schedule to come into work the store manager terminated me over the phone with no warnings and no coachings.  I warn people to be wary when applying here.  They don't really care for their employees and the turn-over rate here is extremely high because of that.
bad,"Walmart is not a good company to work for if you are wanting a full time position. I started working for Walmart as a cashier and was told up front that I would not be allowed to work more than 34 hours a week, part time only. They do this so that when your 6 months are up as part time, you can make a REQUEST to become full time. Once that request is granted, if it is granted, then you get to work another 90 days before they have to offer you insurance. How fantastic is that?! They treat you like you are worthless and below everyone and the shifts you are scheduled to work are ridiculous even after you have given them your availability limits they schedule for whatever they feel necessary. Once I find another job, I am leaving Walmart and not only will I never work for them again, I will probably never shop there again either."
bad,"I have worked at Walmart for several years. At my store, the management is non-existent. They do not address your concerns, do not listen to suggestions to help improve working environment, and barely ever come check to see how the day is going. I was the only person working my position in my department, and they did not hire anybody to help me for over a year. When they finally did hire someone else, they would not put them on the schedule with me so I could properly train them. I applied for a department manager job in another part of the store, and they did not give it to me because I could not be replaced in my current department. The same thing happened when I applied for a transfer to another store altogether to get away from the management. I was told I could not leave until I had a replacement, which is likely never going to happen. I am currently looking for employment outside of Walmart altogether. Avoid working there if you can!"
bad,I am not interested in sharing information about my past jobs at this time I would like to move forward to build my future. Walmart was a good starter job and I enjoyed my time there
bad,"Unloading mass amounts of product"
bad,Come into a mess everyday. managers where rude and did not care for there workers. the whole place is cut throat and unorganized. they have no clue what there doing.
bad,"The management team is horrible, no one works together as a whole (managers/associates).The managers are very unprofessional and have no understanding that Walmart employees have a life outside of Walmart. They don't want to work with other job schedules or school schedules. When there is a complaint to the corporate office nothing is done about the matter."
bad,"Walmart is a Terrible place to work, you are Underpaid, disrespected, and treated like an animal. Management is Lazy and will not help out in any way. I would Never refer anyone to work for Walmart."
bad,"I couldn't think of a worse place to work at. They treat you like you're an idiot, no advancement unless you suck up to management, and bad pay yet they makes billions annually. Forget this place. I also got fired against policy TWICE in ONE WEEK and hired right back. Not even worth applying for."
bad,You can go far having not got the schooling to do anything else. The pay is minimum. The hours are not great but it pays the bills and does the legal requirements for employees.
bad,They do not treat you fair. They change the schedule all the time without informing you. They work you either too many hours or not enough hours. They don't listen to your complaints. Managers take advantage of their positions. And they're rude.
bad,"I didn't enjoy working there at all. I won't be the one to generalize and say that all the Walmarts are like the, but I definitely did not get to work in a nice environment. The managers weren't very nice and considerate and neither were the employees. It was like working in jail. Sorry!"
bad,I did not like working here. The staff was rude and the management treated us with no respect. All in all it is a horrible place to work
bad,"The best part of my job here was the customers, making them happy made going to work pleasant. The store in Danville as a whole was unorganized and did not work as a team"
bad,i worked my tail off like i was getting paid 25 and hour they dont care about you the management is sorry at best i will never work for them again.
bad,"When I was hired as a sales associate for Walmart I was rather excited to be starting a new job, but after about 2 or 3 weeks I realized that Walmart has very poor management. There are way too many people *In charge* and not enough people who will  actually do the work, leaving one skilled person to do everyone`s job for them as a result. Management does not train new employees to do their job correctly, such as ordering, or using what is called a handheld (Gemini) etc.. and also does not train their cashiers. I was placed at a register with about 15 minutes of supervised training, and then left to *figure it out* for myself (this includes learning all of the codes, and cashing checks, money orders, etc.. This also goes for the photo department, and learning how to do layaway. Not to mention their very low pay for over-worked employees."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of cleaning, organizing, moving product to the sales-floor, and assisting customers. The management would often assign tasks outside of the understood responsibilities, including some tasks that were dangerous or physically difficult to complete, and would expect the tasks to be finished in a ridiculously small time-frame. The backroom team at this particular walmart were sloppy at best. This led to inefficiency in moving product and assisting customers. The only redeeming part of the entire work experience was working with the customers."
bad,This was just not a career for me. They were disrespectful and I did not feel in any way I could see myself making a long term career at Wal Mart because I had more dreams than being a sales associate.
bad,I hated everything about it. It was just a job and a paycheck. Walmart does not have a great work environment and they treat their employees terrible.
bad,"When I first got the call that I was hired to work in this place I  was very excited. Once I was part of the team it was terrible managers no help at all the so called ""csm"" were never available to bring us change the only nice about this job is that co-workers will help each other since we didnt have no help from management ."
bad,The management is incompetent. Even if you do your job well you received nothing but a larger load of work unrelated to your own job. This means your own work suffers. There is no incentive to work hard because doing so only makes your job harder.
bad,"Would not recommend this job to anyone. Worse place to ever work. Mangement did not care about anything or anyone. If you had an emergency, they did not care one bit"
bad,There is nothing pleasant about working for a giant company that doesn't care enough about there employees. Horrible place to be employeed by. doesnt pay there employees enough.
bad,"I cooked, cleaned, answered multiple phones. I also opened and closed the store. Daily cash handling. I attended and successfully completed the course for food safety manager."
bad,I would come in and go to the pack to get the carts with the merchandise on it to go on the shelves. I would help the customers and also stock the cash register at the front. In the back room I had to  climb laters to stock and retrieve merchandise. I also loaded carts with heavy material to go on the end caps of my section. Management wasn't helpful but the co-workers were friendly. The most enjoyable part of my job was the environment the hardest part was carrying the heavy carts around the store.
bad,"A typical day at work is servial hours at work, i learned alot more about helping others in customer service how too greet a customer in a nonverbal type of way. The manangement was very sweet, kind hearted person always made sure her co workers was always great. My coworkers was always kind as well, joyful and great leaders at jobs. The hardest part of my job was getting prepared to go home at the end of the shift. The most enjoyable part of my job was working the customers."
bad,"It was really fun working in the TLE department I worked with mostly men . I learned soooo much from the guys, I can now say I'm independent when it comes down to me keeping up the maintenance on my vehicles."
bad,"There is very noticeable favoritism that goes around the company. Please be ware."
bad,Management in all positions constantly berate their employees.  Company does not follow their own company guidelines by making employees work as many as 10 days in a row.  Constant retaliation by supervisors if complaints are made.  No team atmosphere.
bad,"- Organized the activities as per schedule"
bad,"Stocked Shelves, talked to customers, directed customers, I was a cashier for awhile and I would check customers out at the register and help them with any of their other needs."
bad,"Was a great place before Sam Walton died but after he did the company went down the drain. They only hire ""part-timers"" so they dont have to worry about benefits. just another face in the crowd is all you are to them everyone is replaceable in their eyes."
bad,"stocks shelves overnight"
bad,work load an work responsibilities are always changing an there is no respect for the individual the hardest part of the job was trying to complete our job or a single task without the needed tools to succeed
bad,Wal-Mart does use or value the experience of long term associates they terminate employment by any means to hire someone with little or no experience willing to work for else. Customer service continues to go down as their price go up.
bad,a typical day at for me was stocking either woman or the kids depts. i sometimes answer the phone in fitting room and help customers
bad,n/a horrible work experience was terriable and the people in the industrial are not cooporating with there job duties wonderful store
bad,"Didn't like this job at all, interfered with my school way too much. Management is not understand at all. wouldnt go back"
bad,"I took this position because I love working with the public. In the end, it was because of the lack of compassion that I decided to end my employment with them. My father had been admitted to ICU (not breathing on his own) and the dept. manager advised me that I could not leave until I found someone to finish my shift. This was impossible because no one else was trained in the jewelry department."
bad,"One of my least favorite jobs. The customers are a handful however, that was expected so it did not bother me. My co-workers and management were horrible I felt like just another number working for this company."
bad,"Worked hard and never appreciated. Never fully trained after 1 & 1/12 years. Management promotes  buddies, rather than the most competent. Most co-workers are unfriendly. Job is easy, but just can't play their games. No joy in this job."
bad,Terrible management and they have no care for employees what so ever. Store manager is very rude and unprofessional. If you need anything for your drawer or a override you will be waiting a long time.
bad,"They don't care about anyone or anything.  Whether you stay 3 hours past your 9 hour shift to help or stop doing your job to help elsewhere in the store.   When i say they i mean management, I was ics swing shift 4pm-1am.  managers had conspired against my supervisor and when i say 80% of the managers don't work i mean they really don't work.  The only time id see them begin to move was when the store manager or corporate was around.  We were heavily understaffed for most of my two year tenure there but even still there could be 3 managers sitting around chuckling and talking telling us to hurry up when there is 4 of us to do a 7 or 8 man team job.  Bottom line from everyone i knew no one liked that place and no one wanted to be there but if you want hours they will give it to you.  But they have to be some of the most rude, ungrateful, unappreciative, and immature group of people."
bad,This job is very poorly managed and is not understanding at all. After several months I have come to see favoritism is a big role in this job as well as them not caring to give people the days off they need or hours they need. I have had split days off for 5 months even after putting availability in. U could be running 106 fever and they would still make u feel like bad for needing to call in sick and count it against u. absolutely the worst place I have ever worked.
bad,They Suck. A lot of drama. No Hours. To many employees trying to be authority. They work you to death when you do get hours.
bad,"A typical day at work would include touring and making sure all presentations and features and side counters are filled and complete."
bad,"The  work was extremely hard, and the employee  are  unpaid and overworked. wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The managers didn't care about the  employees"
bad,They pay you crumbs and work you like a slave. Walmart is a multi million dollar company but the treat and pay their workers booboo.
bad,Having spent two years working for walmart stores i grew to despise that place to the point where i dont even shop there. The people were awful the supervisors cared about nothing and the pay was terrible.
bad,"well i come in punch in say gm to everyone and do the work that was left for me to do, help out cleaning off tables ect make sure that the play area was clean for the customers and children,i learned how to deal with alot working at mcdonalds it made me a better person/parent as well i got along with all my co-workers and managers, what liked most about the job if one of us didnt know what to do we all helped eachother out its call teamwork"
bad,The management at Walmart was ready unprofessional. My supervisor always had an attitude and talked to people very nasty. The co workers was friendly but I tried to stay to myself because it was always some he say she say drama going on and I'm the type to mind my business.
bad,"bad job, terrible manangement with low pay. Little to no hours being awarded while being asked to do plenty task, bad job i did not enjoy."
bad,Most disgusting place. Co-workers are very nice and upliffting. they will be there for you during your hardest times and wont hesitate to make sure your alright.
bad,This company is getting to big and can't provide themselves with staffing to provide customer service and overall quality of work.
bad,you have no life in management they will give you schedule but within a day they will change it and that's just too bad. there were times when we would have a day off and come back on a Friday and find out that our weekend off we were working even if we had plans to go and see our family. I missed out on so much time with my family its so terrible. Lost my brother and I could have spend so many more times with him and some were times I was supposed to be off and was going to go home and they changed my schedule.
bad,Walmart would be a lot better if the management and company cared about the employees. They do not accept doctors notes whether they are for just missing a day for being sick or if your doctor put you on restrictions because you need surgery they are not accepted management don't care about you. you are inside their workplace your life doesn't matter.
bad,It was a easy job just hard to work with management. Taught me lots of interesting things. The management like to play favoritism to people that worked there longer. Could not see myself working for such a selfish company again.
bad,They treated their employees at the one that I worked at very poorly and they didn't pay wages that were at all livable I would not recommend this company to anyone
bad,A typical day at work includes of you working by yourself with work that was meant for two people. I learned about greed and the negative impact of it. Management didn't care about their workers. We did not have the tools we needed to work such as pens or a staple. My co-workers are the hardest working people I know.
bad,"Loved my job, interacted with customers (my favorite part). Supervised front half of store, set schedules, supervised cashiers. Really enjoyed the work but Walmart management leaves much to be desired."
bad,"A typical day at work is chaotic with everybody everywhere scrambling to get impossible tasks done while trying to serve frustrated customers that become ruder by the minute as they realize how little we are able to help them. The hardest part of the job is the high stress levels due to lack of communication and input associates have with managers and frustration in everybody. The best part of the job is all the interesting people I deal with on a daily basis. I learned that a workplace needs communication between all levels of authority, regardless of title."
bad,"Co workers are personally the only reason I'm still working here. The management staff need to take everything down a notch and they also screw up schedules frequently. The past two weeks I've gotten three calls because of shifts that they didn't tell me I had. "
bad,stocked the store and dispose of the boxes and make bales. help customers find what they are searching for in the store. Didn't have to face the store so it made the primary focus to be on stocking the store and helping the customers.
bad,"The Managers who have been at this Walmart for 10 years have nasty attitudes and act like they own the business. They have no caring for their workers and half the time the Hourly Supervisors they hire do not relieve the cashiers for their required breaks on time. I got terminated after a customer at my register threw a bag of food towards me and I lectured her that she needed to respect someone older than her while she was on my line. "
bad,"Fellow employees seemed nice at first, then I discover the work environment is full of clics. Crazy scheduling when it came to hours. Considered part time work because of 39.5 hours during the ""week""."
bad,This job was the WORST job I have ever had!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Management fought amoung themselves and had respect for anyone !!!!!!!!!!!
bad,"Having a chance to work at Wal-Mart was great, I enjoyed it. Far as management they were very friendly and told us what was right an d wrong. Everyone was nice including customers. The hardest part about working here was dealing with the price matching but I had it down pack by the time I left. Wal-Mart is a great company to work at."
bad,"I did not like this job at all. The only thing I liked about it was the people I worked for and the customers. I liked NOTHING else about it. I was treated very poorly. The benefits were terrible, the work terrible, the hours were terrible and the working conditions were terrible."
bad,It was a learning experience with lots of clients to work with on a daily basis. This made time go by quickly and stretched my talents.
bad,"Some good coworkers and managers. Move up fast. No one bothers you if you get your work done in a reasonable pace. Good culture and values."
bad,"STRESS, I liked working for walmart when i started the staff was friendly and management knew my name however in the 3 years i worked there my store location went ""super"" after this the store culture changed and it was harder to get assistance if needed, the store became understaffed and there were never enough cashiers the customers lost the connection with the store and were irritated that they had to wait what seemed like forever to cash out. this caused unnecessary stress on the staff and the customers. i like the store and the prices but even i am getting to the point where i try to spend my money in other places"
bad,"No hours, terrible management, and co-workers hate their jobs. Very low pay and hours always given to the very few full time associates. Management is the worst part of the walmart workplace."
bad,"Worst job. Terrible pay, always given JUST under 40 hours so that the company wouldn't have to pay benefits. Management was inconsistent and rude. Culture was terrible. Unpleasant place to work."
bad,Unfortunately my time at Walmart did not yield positive results. The managers seemed much more concerned with covering their own positions than actual managing. Every associate from the top down seemed to hate their job making positive work efforts extremely difficult.
bad,"A  empresa  era  uma  empresa    dinâmica  e  agradável   de  trabalhar,  o  trabalho  do  dia  a  dia  era   em  si  muito  corrido  devido  ser  um  setor  de recebimento  de  mercadorias  aprendi muito  nesta  empresa, condo  entrei  ocupei  o  cargo  de  fiscal  de caixa depois  fui  para  setor  da  tesouraria  e  depois  fui  para  o  setor  administrativo,  os  meus  gerentes  e  colegas  de  trabalho   eram  muitos  bons, não  tive  muitas  dificuldades  pois  sempre  fui  muita  curiosa  sempre  procurava   tirar  minhas  duvidas  e  sempre  procurava a  aprender  mais e mais,  a  parte  mais  agradável  quando  conseguia  superar   todas  dificuldades  quando  haviam."
bad,I hated it however I am appreciative for my experiences with Wal-Mart and how these help me moving forward.However to the overall growing rate of daily living i am seeking better employment.
bad,"I worked in the dressing rooms and stocking the womens, men, and baby sections."
bad,"Operate cash register for large general merchandise and grocery store"
bad,Worst company I have ever worked for. Co-workers were generally awesome people stuck with them for employment while looking for something better.
bad,the pay was good. the work was bad. they know they could replace you so they work you until you decide to quit or they have rackep up enough coachings from minuscule things no other companies would ever write you up for. horrible work environment. management is not trained and would rather you get in trouble than them. i do not suggest ever working here.
bad,"I've been with Walmart for 4 years and hate every day I work.  It has a feel very much like a high school.  There is 80% patronage and favouritism. Most jobs are never posted and management are always new and changing.  Most managers know almost nothing about retail let alone your job. "
bad,"Being threating that u will get fired, Management was rude disrespectful. never a smile or laugh in work . Never knowing when u where going to get fired Not being taught how to do the job"
bad,worked the cash register to check out customer purchases. Took payment for such. Bagged items. Counted out drawer at close of store. Worked on putting product back in it's place after the store closed.
bad,I hated every bit of working there they don't pay enough. They just want you to do your job and that is it. If you are looking for a job where you can come in and just work and that's it.....well there you go.
bad,"I was there 5 years started out on over nights, when I tried to get a different shift because of needing to be home with my daughter at night, I was passed over several times for new employees.  I finally got a job offer when one manager told them I was not interested, little to my knowledge I wasn't even approached about the matter until someone questioned me about it.  In order to get off over nights "
bad,"Worked as a temporary overnight remodel associate. Nothing to write home about. Decent wage, lots of hours, uninspiring work."
bad,"Very family unfriendly. They make you work every weekend so you never get to spend time with your family. They even make you work on Thanksgiving, which is terrible."
bad,Too many people want to be in charge. You will be given different direction from four different people. Management and management-types lack communication with each other.
bad,"Assisted with the inventory of various departments"
bad,The job was there and helped me to survive but it was a terrible place  to work. you were always told to do more and more work with less people and less hours. This job taught me a few things especially what I want to have and not have in futer jobs.
bad,Its not really that bad but it is extremely unprofessional and there tends to be a lot of favoritism. Also management is completely useless they hardly do their jobs.
bad,"I loved the fast pace of the job, I enjoyed my coworkers,this is a fun place to work.I the managment team is great. I like how your time goes by because the store is so busy."
bad,I had a blast working for walmart it was funny management was laid back and cool and there was nothing to worry about. I got my days off every week.
bad,"Walmart is a terrible place to work and the management tactics leave alot to be desired, mainly common sense. I personally was appalled at the sheer level of greed that had to be siphoned through prior to making any intelligent, ethical business decisions."
bad,"As an employee of Wal-Mart I was very much dissatisfied with practically everything. Not to say I didn't learn anything but what I did learn wasn't because of my love of my employer, my job, or any type of training. Everything I learned at this job was to make my customers happy."
bad,"I did not like working at sears. Maybe it was just the store I was at. Its slow, they expect way to many credit applications from you in such a small town. Priorities are backwards.. I do not recommend working there."
bad,"The store Manager was like a king, not any fun for break time, and the assistant managers just think to keep their  jobs  , push worker for more work ."
bad,"horrible place to work. mangers are on their phones all the time, and employees get treated horrible. Also workers aren't aloud to help each other out when someone gets stuck and needs help."
bad,terrible work environment because of management. Co workers stick together but pay is low which causes employees to become discouraged.
bad,I am a people person and working at walmart has certainly exposed me to all kinds of situations when dealing with the public in retail.  I enjoy my job at Walmart very much.
bad,"•	As a cashier my primary roles included scanning coupons, applying discounts, processing payments, and ringing up sales on computerized cash registers. Also taking responsibility for handling returns and answering questions about merchandise, store policies, and ongoing promotions."
bad,"Low pay, managers treat employees differently based on personal feelings, hostile work environment. Seems to discriminate based on how an employee looks (hair, tattoos, etc), was spoken to with disrespect daily, no opportunities to advance."
bad,horrible pay. horrible supervisors. hours are horrible. no supervision on employees. over all experience was horrible. could not support my family on this job
bad,"Happy hard working day at work.  I learned how to balance work and home life and I truly enjoyed working there.  IThe hardest part of the job was enjoying it so much and being passed over so many times."
bad,I sat at a cash register the entire day and would scan items for impolite customers. Sometimes the managers would make you get carts on a hot day which was awful. Not recommended.
bad,this is not a job that you can count on to make a decent living and to retire at. you don't always get 40 hours even if you are designated fulltime.
bad,"Like babysitting for adults, they are messy shopper with no respect for others. That  Wal-mart is money hungry and don't care about its employees. Management is clueless and don't have their proirity straight. Most of my co-workers are lazy and don't take pride in their work. The hardest part of this job is advancing to full time and getting benefits. Part time employees don't get medical or vision until a year of work and then your have to qualified with a number of hours work, also you don't accumlate sick or vaction time for a year. Part time employees are qualified for dental insurance just full time. And just recently it was pass that you can start a retired account when hired, it was after a yaer too. Working alone in the department and helping people."
bad,"Stressful for no reason "
bad,"I don't know who is over payroll at Wal-Mart but they need to be shot. $7.56 is not NEEEAARRLLYY enough for the amount of labor and time on your feet at that job. They will work you like a Hebrew slave one week, and then cut you down to twenty hours a week without notice. I knew it was time to go when the Assistant Manager of the whole store came to my line to buy a starbucks cold drink and her card declined with credit and debit. I quit the next day."
bad,Didnt like this place on bit. i would never work there again if i can help it. Hopefully they can get better managers with better attitudes
bad,"There is no work/life balance. You're supposed to be available 7 days a week and they can schedule anytime (or not). More than half of all employees are on social services, so what you're saving there you are paying in taxes."
bad,"Walmart dose not care about the employees, why do you think they have the highest turn over rate. coworkers were good to work with."
bad,"A typical work day for me was. getting told to get off my phone before my schedule shift started. While i was down stacking pallets my managers would come find me and ask me what i was doing. then proceed to tell me i am not schedule to work in that department. Then tell me where i need to be. Hours after they write me up because i am not in the department which they moved me from. i have obtained special training for customer service, how to operate and run a electric jack and lift. I believe my coworkers where there to maintain support of the store and each other, since the managers do not care about the safety and care of the associates. The hardest part was to maintain the store's stock from all the warehouse outs they had."
bad,Absolutely awful place to work. Management treats everyone who isn't a manager with bad attitudes. The only thing good here is that depending on the department you might get 40 hours a week but it's not even worth it when you hate your job. And you will hate it.
bad,"Low part time hours, cut hours regularly, busy, overwhelming, stocking merchandise and multitasking helping customers around the store, too many demands."
bad,Washington Walmart is the worse place I have ever worked at. management don't do their jobs right. There's nothing but people are immature and security isn't all the great. there's a particular manager that everyone hates because he wants the people he don't like gone. there's no respect at all
bad,Very by the book about things. Customers were well behaved. Teamwork was efficient. Management was fair. Great co-workers.
bad,This company is a terrible employer.  Several different layers of management and they are all telling you to do something different.  Their decentralized management structure has descended into bureaucracy and it is no wonder they are starting to lose consumer base.  Upper management is unqualified and incapable and thus they simply hold employees responsible for that which they have no power over.  DO NOT WORK HERE!
bad,do not like that job worst time ever cant wait to leave from there need a new job hate that job boss is no good co worker are bad to much gossip managnent sleeps with there workers
bad,By far the worst management I have ever worked under. Very unprofessional and bad work environment. I would never recommend anybody to this job.
bad,"I would not recommend anyone to work at this cheap, dangerous and unreliable job. A typical day is hectic and frantic from the time you walk in. You are literally working in an understaffed retail store with multiple safety hazards, rude customers who do not try to think for themselves. Holidays are almost always a failure due to lack of organization and proper auditing which your never allowed to do even if it is your job. Associates do everything wrong on purpose so that they have less work to do while leaving you with piles of their trash."
bad,"I learned how to deal with the different attitudes when working with the public.  How not to get involved in things that is not important to the job place.  Take good notes at the meetings.  Always know how to find the answers to the questions needed on the workplace website.  The morning meetings are fun.  Being in a management position myself I've learned that the people I supervise can not be my"
bad,"The store is desperately understaffed, you will be doing the job of minimum 3 people at the same time and get no recognition what so ever. No security, high rate of stealing. The pay is very low, and they want to compromise that with an annual bonus that we actually never get. For the past three years that I have been working there, I have never received a single dollar. Super cheap company. Not a single person in management is actually educated and knows how to run a store and employees.  Employees are not secured, you will have to go through lots and lots of injustice through the customers and your management. Money is constantly given freely to the customers for no reason (customer satisfaction) but the store can't afford anything for its employees. You will stay over time, you almost never finish on the due time."
bad,"If you show any type of knowledge or competency, management latches on and doesn't let go. Work in Dotcom? Don't worry, you'll never get your things done. Instead, you'll be pulled to different departments with lazy co-workers that don't do their job. Think a congratulations is in order for your hard work? Guess again! Why isn't your work in your department done? Steer clear if you can help it."
bad,With unreachable goals. under appreciated staff. and double standers this job was unbearable. but no one ever listens to just one person.
bad,"fast paced what felt  like long days  really were long days. "
bad,"Employees treated like slaves, few promotions from within, nepotism and favoritism rampant, company spies on workers- do NOT work for Walmart!"
bad,I would not refer anyone to work for walmart. A lot of changes need to be made within the company. It's just not what it use to be.
bad,"There is nothing positive about being there on a daily basis, and they try to make you feel uncomfortable to keep you in your position. They limit everything from you, and then only provide advancement to those that wish do not wish to make change. Under-staffing is a huge problem, and pay is dismal."
bad,"i didn't like it very much i was under paid and over worked and even with 3 years of cellphone sales experience i was only paid 10$/h and could hardly support myself while trying to do schooling."
bad,management know nothing about their jobs and there is NO room for advancement
bad,It was a very harsh work experience. It was also very unorganized. I would not advise anyone to work there long term the management is corrupt.
bad,i was part of the closing crew.I liked it there but they refused to work with my schedule as well like all my other jobs.
bad,"diversity is best"
bad,"Poor management, poor work environment, not enough employees for the work expected, resulting in worker injuries."
bad,This company treats you like a slave. Managers are rude and treat you horribly.
bad,I would never work for the walmart again. they have no respect for the staff and treat the staff any kind of way.
bad,A Typical day at work is making sure the shelves were stocked and clean.  And helping the customers and making sure they leave with a smile on their face.  I really enjoy working with my coworkers.  The hardest part of the job is having to deal with an angry customer.
bad,If you don't have any problem with being talked down to and being treated by management like you don't matter then it will be perfect to work for. wondering which one of the managers will come in with an attitude and looking for someone to take it out on.
bad,"What I don't like about my Wal-Mart is the management team, My co-workers are great. My team is awesome and my supervisor is the best to work with. The hardest part of my job is the management team. I have learned leadership and teamwork from my peers, My highlight of my work day is working with my IMS team and our supervisor, we teach other everyday, we learn from one another everyday."
bad,Walmart did not provide a comfortable work situation for people who's children were sick or the employee managers were not properly supervising there employees which led to conflict among the employees
bad,wal mart should be ashamed of themselfs for having such a successful company and to be paying they employees $7.65!! a HOUR! and they work you like a slave!
bad,"Just overall a terrible job. From wages, to the terrible way managers treat you."
bad,I will never work here again. Bad place to work. the management was the worst.
bad,"each morning I would clean up organize products to there correct dept. open and count the money in each drawer. review and receive any site to store (online) orders that are coming in and or had to be sent back. many upper management problems, co-workers were great made it nice to come in everyday. not having enough coverage for breaks."
bad,this is the worse employer I've ever had . They didnt even pay overtime for hour work . end of the week would make you  not clock in until your hours were down to 40 hrs . I think that against the law the problem is because it such a huge employer  the government would never make them follow the law .
bad,This is the worst company to work for. The company in general is just flat out greedy they pay you minimum wage and expect you to work like a slave. The managers are rude and they have no soul. I'm glad I quit working here and I will never return
bad,was fun working there got along great with everyone and everyone was really nice and friendly ad very out going.
bad,I have nothing to say about it other then 75% of the managers only care about themselves and not the employees
bad,cross trained in various positions.  Liked management and co-workers
bad,"A typical day at work consist of researching shortages, preparing deposits and preparing paperwork. The hardest part of the job is researching shortages that are not found in the smart system"
bad,"If you are trying to work for this company be prepared to work a lot for less than half of what you deserve. There will be only 3 lines open constantly regardless of how busy it is. You barely get decent hours and when you do they cut them the next week. I typically work 32 hrs a week and i can barely get by. They hire and fire people randomly, but most just quit. Save yourself the headache and skip this job"
bad,"Typical day at work started with being thrown into work, and being forced to work with questionable equipment. Management changed out rapidly, but never any sign of promotions from the bottom. Management, and supervisors ignored customers, and even told their own employees not to try to hard in helping. Saying how its pointless to show any desire to help the customer."
bad,This company is an example of too many chiefs and not enough Indians. I was continually given instructions a specific way by one manager and then told to do it another way by a second manager. This caused me great issues and distress. The pay was low and the hours were unstable.
bad,It all sucked on the grounds of fellow coworkers will mess with you no matter what you do
bad,This is a company that I have to say is horrible. They don't take care of their people. If higher up managers don't like you they will work to get rid of you no matter how good you are. They only care about the almighty dollar and don't care who they hurt to get it/
bad,"Walmart is a place I do not recommend to anyone, at least the one I worked at, they devalue their employees, co workers were never supportive of anything and would jump at the chance to make you look bad in any situation. "
bad,"I did not enjoy working at Wal-Mart. To many bosses out of there department telling you what to do. Most co-workers were good, but the management lacked. I learned all people are not what they seem but most people are good. The hardest part of the job was not knowing what boss was going to tell you to do what next. Lets put it this way one day I over heard the Store manager Chad tell a department manger just let them go there is someone else out there that needs a jobs, that's not right"
bad,pay is not equal for amount of work     management has lack of respect for employees  no support provided for individuals
bad,Not enough hours and then too many hours. They wouldn't let me use the bathroom when i was four months pregnant so i quit. The managers don't care about you nor your health. Its nothing personal just business
bad,I like challenge's working with people is my success I enjoy being around people customer service is a challenge........... Never missed a day of work unless im very ill
bad,"worked at the general merchandise side of Walmart. unloading the trucks and placing the product on pallets for the right product to go to the right department.at the tail end of the day i would help stock shelfs of product. what i learned is to work as a team, getting stuff done in a timely manner,learned how to face product.  The management treated most people like we can be replaced with a new worker.  I had good co-workers and not so good co-workers.the most enjoyable part was the 10 % off card we got."
bad,loaded and unloaded trucks transported pallets to multiple locations stocked shelves drove a forklift to load delivery trucks and unloaded them as well. management was horrible they all would demand different jobs to be done it was not together at all.
bad,"Walmart is an extremely unforgiving work enviroment.  It is discriminatory against women over the age of 35.  Advancement is difficult if you don't fit into their scope of what management should be.  There is no room for creativity, or an independent thinker.  It is not a place to work if you have a family or would like to have a family.  Extremely unforiving work enviroment.  Too many managers not enough associates to carry the work load, so you are over worked and held to impossible standards. "
bad,Probably the worst company I've worked for. Management was horrible and there was so much favouritism. Underworked and underpaid. Management liked to make up their own rules which were all lies and take advantage of the staff.
bad,"cashier. "
bad,this company over worked and underpaid. there was no direction and no time could be taken off before the 90 day period even if your children were in the hospital almost dead
bad,"2nd worse job and employer I have ever had. No respect from customers or management. If I have to pick between unemployment and walmart, Unemployment wins till benefits runs out. About the same line as working fast food I would think. really.... you do not want to work here if you can help but not too."
bad,"Working here was okay for me in the beginning, but the problems started with management and co-workers. I loved what I was doing, but when the manager has a bad habit of getting you in trouble when she gets in trouble is totally not worth it in the end. Be cautious when trying to work in this position because management is very unappreciative of the work you do, especially if you come in on your off days."
bad,"no job security or advancement, the management and other staff are extremely nice, but many companies look down on the fact that you worked for walmart even if it was work experience, a good place to work only if you need extra money or a place to work odd hours as in the 24 hour 7 day per week walmart.  They tell you your wage is low so that they can keep their prices low to compete with other competitors which is just untrue, they should pay their workers a fairer wage."
bad,"The job pays fairly well, but the management doesn't care about employees, and the hours and very long."
bad,Would not refer friends or family members to work there. Enough said about that company.
bad,"Walmart does not have professional management. At least not at the Overland store in Boise, Idaho. Management needs more training, especially in work ethics. Trustworthy, honest, sincere, friendly and professional customer service managers are lacking at the location on Overland. The employees are treated very poorly starting with, wages and schedules. In my opinion, Walmart would not have such a turn over, if Walmart would appreciate and treat their employees with respect and gratitude."
bad,"They look at people as nothing. including their ""valued"" customers. Worst place to work by far. Worst place to have to shop as well"
bad,"My co-workers were mean, the hours weren't stable, contacting them were hard."
bad,"Time always seemed to fly by."
bad,"Desde que eu chegava na empresa as 7 da manha eu já traçava uma meta para o dia de trabalho, no sentido de realizar todas as tarefas pertinentes ao meu cargo, porém como eu tinha uma serie de obrigações elas me tomavam muito tempo sendo assim necessário delegar algumas tarefas aos meus subordinados que era executado prontamente e com muita atenção, pois eu sempre trabalhei muito próximo da equipe e sendo assim mantinha um bom relacionamento com eles e com a gerencia da minha unidade, durante o dia eu tinha algumas tarefas quase que instantânea e eu necessitava de ajuda mas isso não me impediu de realizar um bom trabalho na unidade e a minha facilidade de relacionamento me facilitou muito este desafio na minha carreira."
bad,"worst place on the planet to work for!!! They have policy that they never follow. Always telling their Associate lies and lies to customers. They never listen to their people and then when problem come about they blame those that try to let them know!! "
bad,I was only trained on a computer. I really did not like the job.
bad,"Manger wouldnt show me time records. They will fire you in the middle of your shift and make others work harder, worked here several times."
bad,"cashier"
bad,"Provide a high-profile presence in the retail store and ready to help customers following company ""Happy to Help"" criteria and  giving them 100% satisfaction customer service. Monitoring the facility to prevent loss and ensure the full protection of occupants. Operated surveillance systems and patrol the grounds to protect against possible hazards. Write informative reports to update management on all security matters. Immediately respond to security violations, alarms, and other emergency situations. Exercise sound judgment and maintain confidentiality at all times."
bad,Long hours with out enough staff and too little pay. No opportunities for advancement beyond customer service manager which is only a 50 Cent raise above minumum wage. The owners of walmart should be ashamed to treat employees so poor.
bad,"This job was horrible in every aspect! The hardest part was dealing with the disrespect of the customers and lack of work from coworkers. Management was terrible. But on the upside i learned wat alot of medications were used for, their side effects, the prescription filling process and all aout patient privacy."
bad,I worked for the company for a little over 7 years.  Some days it was fun to work there and others days it was just stressful.  Management would want stuff to be done that was just not possible.
bad,"Check customers out at registers, stock shelves by registers."
bad,"A typical day at work would involve me working on a cash register for 8 hours a day. While working at walmart I had requested to move departments several times and was given a run around from management every time. However they would have no problem putting me wherever they needed when it was convenient for them. I usually don't mind that, after all, I am there to work, but none of my extra efforts were appreciated, I was given absolutely no recognition for anything I did that wasn't included in my job title. On the job I learned how to work in almost every department on the floor which was what I wanted, however there was no room for growth in the company. Like stated, I was not allowed to move from cash. When I made mistakes, there was no follow up to correct my mistakes. Management changes very often in walmart. Out of the almost three years working for that company, I've seen several good and bad managers come and go. A common opinion of the workers is that the management rarely cares about the employee. For the most part, the associates (non management level staff) all got along, everyone came in to do their jobs and go home. The hardest part of the job would probably be actually working for the company. A lot of the time people think it's the customers that make the job bad however the customers are not hard to manage. I can't really say that anything was really enjoyable at that job. I don't wish to speak so negatively of a former employer however after three years at that job I can whole heatedly say that I gained nothing from walmart other than the basic skills required"
bad,"Clean bathrooms, sweep floors take out trash"
bad,bad management and bad pay but good benefits and reliable job.
bad,"When I was working overnights, It took a while to get used to actually doing over nights. After a week or two I got used to it, but this wasn't the bad part. When I was working here, I only got one day of training, while a girl who started the same day as me got about three or four. They always switched my area after I got used to one, and would expect me to get the new area done in an hour, when I have never been in that section before, How can someone do that??? It's not that easy to find things you are looking for all the time!! Then when I was in the lanes stocking some shelves, I had the cart in there with me, this lady that works their was always very cranky with me for some reason, she was actually the one who trained me, and told me I had to take the carts out of the lanes. So I took the one I was working on out. I went and asked her if I had to take them all out. And in a snappy attitude she says ""well yeah its one of the first things you learn in you cbl's didn't you watch them?"" which to me was very rude because I was just asking a simple question. The management you could never seem to find when you needed them. This job just sucked, maybe working the day would have been better, but nights are a no go."
bad,i have learned to do your best and dont let others drag you down just because they envy the work you had just done.i also learned that some people are not trust worthy and will never change even for the good of others.
bad,Having hateful co workers talking to you like your low and not smart as them and they talk to customers like their slow.
bad,"Position hired for both times was not the same after hiring process, no instructions, no team support in store #1588, radical , unorganizded, Store manager didn't even know I was let go after communicating with him in regards to a problem in the bakery, so the retaliation was to get rid of me instead of getting to the root of a problem."
bad,"I have never hated working anywhere before I worked at Walmart. I had a pre-existing medical condition in which I had to take injections that made me sick. I asked for two off days together not caring which days it was, but they would never give it to me. They changed my schedule every week. That would have been fine if I wasn't having to take injections. I can work and I can work hard, but the two days after my injection, I was very sick. Walmart did not care and would not take doctor's excuses or letters from the doctor. I ended up having to quit just so I wouldn't get fired. Maybe it would have been better to get fired and then take it to court or something. Management at the Hueytown location was awful! They acted like all the other employees were low lifes. But they are just managers of Walmart... nothing special."
bad,"I enjoy my work rutine and I am very good at what I do. Because I come to work everyday (to work) and not hobnob with management and tell them all the juicy gossip on whos saying what, and who is doing what, when where and why... it seems to me that I recieve no recodnition from managers on a job well donr=e for the past 3 years. Corporate big wigs walk the stores periodically and always complement me on my service, my deameanor and rapport with my customers. Yet I still have not moved up in the company and I whole heartedly believe nothing is given, its earned. I know as well as everyone else in this small store that I deserve it, I have earned it. Walmart as a whole is a ""horrible bosses"" company"
bad,"My job for this company was to come in and stock shelves, make sure it was enough merchandise on the sales floor, and assist customers. I also assisted in special store project during holidays and other busy times."
bad,"If you are over the age of 18 and are actually having to support yourself, don't bother. Horrible training, horrible management, and to top it off, no job growth. Have a friend who has been a sales associate for 15 years and he keeps getting passed up because some one else kissed the managers butt more."
bad,"not a very good company to work for. even though you start out at $10/hr, the managers treat you horrible and they always short you on your paycheck. if you do end up getting reimbursed for the money they cheat you out on, then you are a lucky one."
bad,"The company is a great company to work for, however managment lack necessary skills to effectively manage"
bad,Nao eh um abiente muito agradavel para se trabalha tens folga uma vez na semana e eh trabalhado 3 domingos sim e um nao . muito puxado e cansativo . nao e uma empresa muito boa nao . os clientes reclamavam de falta de arroz nas partilheiras os caixa operador que escutava . ou seja walmat n eh uma boa empressa
bad,"Pay is acceptable, the coordination and organization between management and employees is not something the company seems to value. Although there was a lack of communication, the work environment was comfortable and compensation was adequate."
bad,Straight forward work. Walmart is not a company to build your career with in my personal opinion.
bad,Expectations were unrealistic. It was a very negative place to be.
bad,"Management didn't seem to care about employees. My co-workers were unhappy & stressed. No chance for advancement, even when promised. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
bad,The only thing I liked about working about Wal- Mart is that every day was different. I liked the interaction of meeting new people every day. I met my boyfriend there and we are still together .Other than that all I can say is that I was shocked that I had an Associates degree at that time and they still only wanted to pay me minimum wage. I was a single mom.I really thought it was a mistake to move to Texas.
bad,was hired on as a temp to hire and we got trained right before black friday to make sure we were ready and then got let go like 3 or so weeks before christmas...as some temps got to stay and some of us were let go
bad,the management was rude and disrespectful and made me work more than 40 hours a week and didnt care about anyone except themselves
bad,The job was very stressful between never having enough cashiers and customers complaining about it work days were long a tiring. Other cashiers were nice but other than that the job was simply just a job.
bad,I already did the review something must have got messed up.....
bad,Not enough pay for the job I did. I loved the people I worked with though.
bad,"I enjoyed the hard work, the co-workers I directly worked with were great, management could care less about the employees, and to the company you are just a warm body to do a job. The most enjoyable part of the job was quitting time."
bad,"Everything about this job sucked. The shifts were awful, the managers were very rude, the work conditions were very harsh at times. You know its bad when the customers are telling you that they are sorry that you have to do this kind of job. One thing that was good about the job was that I made a few friends in the process."
bad,Don't work for walmart they pay you bad and treat you bad. Stay away!
bad,stepping stone.. Its a learning experience if you want to become an entrepreneur in the future how you would do things differently.. its a steady job. I would not recommend this job to anyone unless your really in need of a job and don't mind working hard and have a high tolerance for negativity
bad,"This company is the worst company to ever work for. Management is horrible. They play stupid kids games with everyone and play favoritism games as well. It doesn't matter if you are the best person for any job. If you are the favorite, you will get anything you want. Horrible hours, horrible pay, benefits and jobs. I will never work or shop there again."
bad,"They say Wal-Mart is a family store, well that's not truth. I was pregnant when I worked their, and they didn't want to take my doctors notes for missing working. Also my doctor told them I had to sit for I could stand longer then an hour and I could lift more then 15 lbs., so they put me on leave with out pay. They management team thought they could treat you how every they wanted. Plus they talked to you like you were a slave. When I first started I like working at Wal-Mart but would never work for them again."
bad,walmart is just not a good place to work at they harass and bully you and give you long hours one week then take all of them away the next and they pay as little as possible
bad,I worked here for 13 years and then Walmart started cutting my hours and took my benefits away. The management was heartless and the upper management was even worse. I dedicated 13 years of my life to Walmart and I left with nothing.
bad,"All the advertisement and the benefits the Walmart companies they have to offer their employees are not really easy to have. Miscommunications between managements and employees are unbelievable huge. The pay rate is so low for the amount of work you done at the store. There's no respect at all for the employees who works so hard for the company to be a sucess, There's no professionalism, starting with the management ends with some employees."
bad,"Overnight Stock Associate who ensures that I articulate relevant information to customers on a daily basis internally or via telephone. Assist customers with telephone glitches that occur daily. Prepare the store for the next business day by stocking the selves and assuring the store is organized and clean. While maintaining my customer service skills with direct contact, I recognize and diffuse difficult situations with customers; utilizing my interpersonal and negotiating skills to come to some resolution."
bad,"A typical day at walmart is me unloading a truck for 2hrs, then pulling pallets out to the salesfloor. What ive learned is it was a great job for experience but not for making a career out of too much work for very little pay. After I do picks or stock the floor."
bad,not a good company to work for they promise you the world and just work you to death started off like a good company work starts at 7 and work till five and if they give you too much to do they expect it done or you will be coached also if you accomplish what was set for you that day they give you double and they keep increasing it day in and day out
bad,"Worst company to ever work for, management treats you like a work horse, who should give up family, friends and any personal life just for them and their needs. The employees aren't so bad most are just terrified of loosing their jobs. The hardest part of this job is trying to get through a day of dealing with management and their bigoted behavior towards people, the most enjoyable is making it to the car to drive home"
bad,"Very busy store with very little salary and unreliable management. i did not enjoy my employment with walmart, We had so many customers and received little to no help when needed. Management is sub par and i wouldn't recommend anyone work there."
bad,The management is very unorganized. They didn't know who was supposed to take breaks at what time. I wouldn't work for them again.
bad,this is a very nasty company to work for the managers were very rude and hateful.
bad,Treated like a number no personality a not all. Donot appreciate employees at all just like a robot. No one can survive on the pay.
bad,"I do the best I can, get my work done. I am looking to find a better company to work for. I gained knowledge in customer service, cash handling, time management and essential skills in the retail business. It is a good place to start and learn but I would not recommend staying and trying to make a career there."
bad,"At Wal-Mart i worked in backroom (IMS) inventory management. I unloaded trucks stocked product and cleared bins. I was a part-time employee working 40+ hours and they did not want to offer or give me benefits. For the job i applied for I not only did it, but other shifts jobs as well. They wanted me to work like a slave for 8 dollars an hour. Wal-Mart is a large cooperation but is very dishonest about what they bring to the table."
bad,"Its hard to go a whole day without someone jumping down your throat, some of the overnight management (in my opinion) shouldn't have their position."
bad,"Not a good location. Management was very poor. I met a lot of great people working here, including my co-workers and customers alike. Constant customer service. Cleaning, cashiering, sales floor."
bad,"Walmart is a horrible company to work for, they mistreat their employees and play games with their customers, over my tie working there i have witnessed that customers are not their #1 priority as they claim but it's the wallet they come in with or the purse they carry that is the most important to them, they also have no issues kicking you out if they dont think you're ""shopping"" and they have no problems firing their employees for mistakes made by salaried management"
bad,Walmart says it is a great place to work and yet they are far from it. They have no respect for the workers and cater to the management. They are disrespectful and do not allow for adjustments to schedules for family emergencies. I would NOT recommend ANYONE work here unless they thrive on being treated badly and paid poorly.
bad,working environment was horrible. the management is inconsiderate and does not care about personal issues.
bad,It was stressful working environment. I was lifting heavy boxes.
bad,idk why im doing this review over again i hated the job and the fact that this site is making me talk about it is me off !!!!
bad,"Its a great place to start when you want to get your foot in the door in the work industry. I would not recommend this job as a career like some people i know. Not to say any names. The management treats us associates like we're mere slaves and they don't care nor respect us. What they're there for is their paychecks and bonuses, they verbally crack a whip at us just so they can get  they can get their fat bonuses at the end of the year while we make minimum wage barely enough to support ourselves, not even speaking if we had kids."
bad,"I liked the people I worked with,and some of the managers,but for the most part ,it was not the ideal job, not a lot of pay for all the work you have to do."
bad,"I worked with the company for nearly 10 years, and seen a lot. The stores managers lie, hide things, and are taught to abuse their authority. Associates are disposable to the company, and they could care less about your well being. Fire exits were constantly blocked, equipment was broken often and never got repaired, broken ladders you were told to just use them, the roofs leaked badly like a small river in the back rooms, black mold growing on walls, open ended wires hanging from the ceiling, dead rodents under the steel found in back rooms, company policies and standards constantly ignored or changed by managers, broken carts your forced to use, unloaders being told to work harder and faster by management resulting in one unloader dying of a heart attack, and another getting her toe smashed. You would constantly sweat because the backrooms had no A/C, and unloaders were forced to work in a truck that was over 100 degrees inside during the summer, and they froze during the winter due to the dress code policies. They have little clicks of people who band together and get their way, and with whom buy managers gifts, coffee, dinner, etc, to get ahead. Managers will target anyone who doesn't kiss their behind. So the whole theory of just going to work and getting your job done, won't work with them, as they will find ways to make your job miserable. Pay wasn't great either, as it took me nearly 10 years to even start making decent money, and that was after going on overnights. Apply at your own risk is all I can say."
bad,Job pays enough to get by on the bills. Many locations to choose to work at.
bad,Unstable hours and not great pay.I did not like working there because it feels you are a number and not a hard working employee
bad,no back bone with management in specific departments. were unable to train properly leading to many employees quitting with little to no notice at all.
bad,"I worked in automotive. I changed oil, tires, and interacted with customers. I can't say I really learned anything new. Management there is many things none of them good. Unpleasant, lazy, and unethical to name a few. Its the perfect place to work if you want a place that expects enthusiasm for rock bottom pay and as much work as they can coerce out of you."
bad,It was a bad job. The job didn't even last as long as the contract said it would.
bad,"Working here was bad for my health. They make the best workers feel like they aren't worth nothing. I was wrongfully terminated, i fought it with the California state board hearing and won. I'm now 25 pounds healthier and improving daily."
bad,What you can expect from walmart other than getting terminated a week before you can collect benefits or the yearly bonus.
bad,Management stinks. There isn't any room for improvement and pay is horrible
bad,"Monitored customers use of fitting rooms"
bad,"Get to work, Clock in, got to work station and worked. Got two breaks, both 15 mins. Learned how to handle money. Management wasnt friendly."
bad,"A typical day is making sure you're always busy so management isn't down your back and looking for reasons to pull you into the office. They don't work with your schedule, even if you have kids, depending on the store manager if you get a good quarterly bonus or not. Management is rude to associates. The pay sucks, and now they are only hiring temps so that they don't even have to give out 401k as well as health insurance."
bad,Management is rude and hard to deal with. If you need a day off forget it and the pay sucks
bad,"Customer service, Cashier, Answer customer questions, Inventory, stock shelves, Photographic Process worker, Retail salesperson, counter attendant, develop film, count drawer in the morning and end of shift. Multi phone usage."
bad,Management was not well trained and there was no way to get full time.
bad,"Too much stress, not enough help. No appreciation.That is why I left."
bad,they don't care about your family or outside life. The hours are terrible and the pay sucks. The company sees you as just a number and you can easily be replaced with someone with a minimum wage salary.
bad,"walmart is not all it is cracked up to be, they are not family orentaited  like they say they are,  they are strict with an attendance policy and they like to coach you for everything. Management does not listen to you or solve problems efficiently."
bad,had so many problems working for walmart wasn't being trained and got in trouble for things i didn't know how to do when i asked to be shown
bad,I worked only for a month due to illness the management did not have a heart of what was going on or understood what I was going through. They ended up firing me for being out due to hospitalization
bad,Not much to say about Wal Mart.  Its not good or bad.  Hard to move it in this company any you work for little pay.  Good for part time job
bad,"Treated employee like children/slaves.  Always yelling, screaming and using unnecessary language.  Horrible working conditions."
bad,"Walmart thinks just because they are some huge corporation that they can treat their employee's like complete garbage. That is exactly what they do. They say that the customer is always right, but when customer's would try to come in and return things, manager's would make up excuses as to why they couldn't take it back even if the item was in perfect condition or even unopened. It was all just really bad when I worked there."
bad,come in to the backroom full and the sales floor empty. Management yells at me because overnight does not do their job but im the one that gets yelled at not overnight.
bad,easy moved up in the food chain fast just didnt like how they treated there people.
bad,"this place has changed for the worse the hours, pay everything. it use to be a fun place to work"
bad,"Manage total store which includes over 300+ associates including areas of responsibility I have been over Electronics, Consumables, Hardware, Paint, Tire and Lube Center, Garden Center, Food and fresh areas. Mainly over the Front end and operations, Responsible for managing my associates by holding them accountable and giving them recognition of there performance, coaching for improvement, teaching and training, new hires, terminations, budgeting, schedules, compliance, receiving trucks, planning for seasonal change."
bad,worst company i ever worked for management very rude no appreciation for there employees Walmart wants you to work for them and only for them no school no other job have to be available for them all the time or you don't get hired
bad,you have shopped there you have stood in line there it is no good. management is a joke from bottom to top. no one except the front end cares for customers and are always understaffed
bad,"This company does not care about your well being, your family, your advancement or paying you what you are worth. They work third shift like dogs expecting way too much for way too little.. such a disappointment because I grew up wanting to work for them.. so sad Sam Walton would be shaking his head .. in disappointment"
bad,"At Walmart they first tell you that it is a great corporation to work for. With friendly co workers and excellent management staff. But its all a lie. You have to beg for things, days off, back braces, respect, amongest everything else. Its just a job/paycheck never a career."
bad,I hated this job.Customers were rude. Managers were rude and didn't know how to talk to their employees. My co-workers were very lazy and rude. I didn't like nothing about this job.
bad,they wanted me to work 3rd shift hours but not get 3rd shift pay
bad,"The MGR at this store walks around pointing at things like you are a dog."
bad,"Retail/Sales in general is a horrible field. Not only do your your co-workers from those in the same position as you and all the way up to your store manager treat you like dirt, the customers are sometimes even worse. I will never understand why anyone would want to work in such a stressful environment by choice. However, I learned a very important life lesson by working in such a position: After leaving, I am even more polite to those who choose to work retail and I try to make their day a little bit easier by being patient and understanding of whatever else they may have going on."
bad,Management is rude. It's quite dysfunctional there. Training is bad.
bad,"Too much pression and work, not good pay, no good shedule. You can move up, but you have to overwork too much."
bad,Greeting customers meeting their needs and satisfying them with helping them find whatever it was that they needed
bad,"It was very busy, there were a lot of workers and managers who didn't want to work."
bad,"Working in the Vision Center at Walmart is about the best you can do at Walmart.  They are the highest hourly paid associates and the Vision Center is only open 9am-8pm. "
bad,This place is just horrible in general. Management sucks. They treat you like their slave. All they care about is money thats it. Highturn over rate. Its not worth the stress. I rather have no job. Than work at this place.l
bad,"My years working with the company was not good but good , because of the associates I've work with . They made the job a little easier to want to come to work. My night would start with no CSM , not enough of cashiers so we had to run registers and make sure the truck was done and all pallet were pulled to the floor , with no overnight associates. Management never communicated wit nothing it was always a surprised. No benefits, no real bonus nothing extra. work three jobs and barley get paid for one. My first and wanna say retail job."
bad,horrible is an understatement!!!!!!! the manager is charge was great then we got a new dm and he went on a power trip. my advise to anyone applying for the manager position beware youll get treated like dirt and if you try to change things then youll get the boot like my old manager did!!
bad,This location boasts the worst management I have ever worked for and I have been in retail for 19yrs and apart of Walmart twice.... They do not care about the employees and only care about covering up poor decisions on their part by blaming the staff below them.  They will never offer more than minimum wage as the manager feels minimum is more than anyone needs and in Alberta... this is not the case.  as a dept manager you make the same as a cashier in the larger city stores which is unacceptable.  Walmart preys on the people of this community thinking they have no other option in life... Hans and the rest of the management team should be fired and replaced so this Walmart can actually thrive and be a true part of this community.  Also on a side note they never have the products needed and always have empty shelves which means for the underpaid staff customers who are rude and ignorant all of which could be avoided by proper management and a staff who are paid to care.  If you have another option take it!
bad,"Horrible Place To Work. I wouldn't recommend anyone to apply there. There are no benefits for part-time workers, only management. The hardest part of my job was dealing with rude and demanding customers, getting no respect."
bad,"Walmart was not a place for me. I as doing more than one persons job, it wasent a fair job"
bad,"at one time walmart was the place to work. now its low morale, extreme favortisim, poor management, nothing gets done.  bad attitudes from management to cart pusher."
bad,"I didn't like one single thing about Walmart, the workers are horible"
bad,its ok..not to let the job stress you out..management isn't very good..my old co-workers was ok..lifting heavy boxes and been forced to lift..getting bonuses
bad,Walmart is an ok company to work for. Everything is not always fair. Being on the mod team means I'm doing different things everyday But it seems like I'm just there working and have no say so in what goes on because I'm young.
bad,"The typical work day was more than any one person can handle for an 8hr shift. This caused a lot of employees to become stressed and moral decreased. I learned how to manage other employees, my departments, my inventory and price integrity. The management team was unprofessional and did not care about the well being of the employees. The hardest part of the job was completing the work load with no support of the management team and not having the equipment need to perform and complete my duties as a department manager. The most enjoyable part of the job was the end of my shift."
bad,Lots of physical labor for a minimum wage job. The management was lazy and would often be confused about what the staff should be doing.
bad,"Communication with or to individuals or groups verbally and/or in writing. Ensure freight is loaded onto trailers. Organizes shipping "
bad,was terminated because I was late but I physically was there early but couldn't find a manager to clock me in
bad,"Every day its different it all depends on the manager, Management some times want to treat you like trash"
bad,Walmart as a company is horrible.  They do not pay their employees enough money to live and think it's alright to tell them to seek government aid and to have food drives for their employees.
bad,A typical day for me would be getting harassed by management who has nothing else to do when there not flirting with whomever. I learned that anyone including management take advantage of rules set by company's intended to mitigate tension in the workplace.
bad,WALMART IS A HORRIBLE PLACE TO WORK! The people who work there are horrible and cranky and no one works together. Management is awful. They lie to their associates and push them beyond their physical limits.
bad,"I wasn't very satisfied with the cleanliness of this place, being that it was a restaurant, it should have been cleaned accurately enough to keep pest out, the food to be used before expiration dates, the people working to the restaurant to have cleanliness such as hygiene. There was also problems with the way the management handled absence's and tardiness, they were very lenient with their employee and they should be enforcing there policies. I do have to say a plus was a curtain manager he was very fast, respectful, clean when he was working, and enforced all of the rules I was very satisfied with that member of management but he was not the store manager."
bad,A typical day at work here was one of being overworked and unappreciated. Although i did learn some ins and outs of retail and interacting with customers. Management at this particular establishment was appalling. They were rude and felt as though they were better then all the regular associates. Management is the reason I left this place of employment. My co-workers on the other hand were all very pleasant to work with. The hardest part of the job was meeting the ridiculous time time goals set in place by management. I really have no upside to working this job.
bad,Managers at this store have to many favorites. I enjoyed working with the customers but not the people I worked with.
bad,No longer in business but was able to cut my teeth in management and technical processes such as project management.
bad,Managers don't comply with policies and treat associates with little to no respect.
bad,Ignorant management over chemical handling placed personnel in direct danger.
bad,"Work as a team to get tasks completed in a timely manner. Communicate opportunities each and every shift to appropriate managers to ensure projects not able to have been completed on one shift, gets done the following shift. I have learned how to multi-task and work well with people and stay positive even in tense situations and to motivate others to do well in all areas of the facility. The hardest part of the job, is leaving and going home. The most enjoyable part of the job, is helping customers and associate with what they need."
bad,an institution for those who wish to gain a greater appreciation for future employment.
bad,"For a 12 hour a day job we only got one break a day. The managers didn't know anything about the job except complaining to the workers. Managers were not helpful at all and never trained me. My co workers trained me, but poorly with half effort then complained when I did something I didn't know was wrong. Job was suppose to be 8 hours but managers kept us an extra 4 hours every day so we got off at 2am. The managers also made us sign papers giving up over time pay, if we didn't sign we would get fired."
bad,I was not happy at all at Wal-Mart. It was just a stepping stone for something better to come along in my life. I was a cashier. I did enjoy working with the customers because thats what I enjoy.
bad,"A typical day at work concluded the following:"
bad,"unloaded truck, organized merchandise by department, stocked items, kept track of inventory flow and input data into system."
bad,"I worked there a year and I hated it! Management was rude, talked down to you, and constantly threw you all over the store with training you. I would never recommend this place to anybody. Unless maybe its a gag joke."
bad,wouldn't recommend working at walmart. management isn't well trained and don't show respect for their employees.
bad,"Do not work for this company. If you are someone that shows better ideas than other management or has the energy to create more work in order to make the environments more efficient - do not go to this company. The managers and senior staff are extremely comfortable in their old ways and do not like someone to make their work hard or especially have to make them learn more or other ideas that would require work. The majority of the workers attitudes is, ""Just keep your feet on your desk and do not change anything that would upset my comfortable world""."
bad,"Complaining about a job at Wal-Mart seems like complaining about the bubonic plague - yes, we all know it's bad, there's no reason to mention it."
bad,hours and days not consistant and change on a weekly basis. Management does not mean what they say
bad,"stock shelves, unload truck, downstack onto pallets, zone aisle, make a cardboard bale."
bad,When I started working here more than 8 years ago I really enjoyed it. Not anymore.
bad,it is  a very bad place to work they don't pay you enough for all the work and stress that they put on you
bad,"Managers are unprofessional"
bad,i liked this job until they tried to force overtime for people who were already getting off a 1 am. That did not work well when you have 8am classes the next day.
bad,Most unpleasant work experience I have ever had . Wal-Mart is not a good company for anyone to work for .
bad,Day shift could never clean up after themselves to the closer is always stuck cleaning up after them and never fully gets their own tasks done without having to stay late.
bad,Learned valuable customer service skills and people management techniques.
bad,"A typical workday we get calls for refills for our customers medications, they come pick up there prescriptions, and at the end of the night we clean our pharmacy. I also learned a lot about different medications. I also learned  how too care for unsatisfied customers. I know my coworkers depend on me to come into work with a positive attitude an most of all some of them work together an help each other out. Nothing is really hard about my job. The most enjoyable part of my job is keeping my customers happy."
bad,words can not express how walmart treats their people. they want top shelf work for bottom shelf pay.
bad,Most Managers are not understanding and have no Customer Service values and talks down and lowly towards you. So far the worst job I have ever had. Very rude managers and head managers. Low on staff always so they pull floor associates on cash so no ones on the floor and ask us to work longer hours. Ridiculous.
bad,They treat you terrible. too much favoritism to much wishy washy attitudes. i would not recommend this company to anyone at any given time
bad,"While Sam Walton was alive and in control, Walmart was a great company to work for."
bad,didn't want to work with my hours when i started school and couldn't get off days
bad,"No opportunities of advancement, lack of proper management, terrible scheduling, a company that will find every possible way to make sure you work as much as you can with as few benefits as possible."
bad,Working here was one of the worst by far.I absolutely hated going I n every day.it had poor management  and assistant management skills. They had bad roaches
bad,"Horrible place to work. never do it,. i would never do it againl. its disgusting and the people are rude."
bad,"Wal mart was a very unsatisfying place to work. A typical day of work at Wal mart consists of cashing out customers all day. Most customers are upset because a majority of the products are priced wrong or not all. There is not nearly enough management to adequately tend to the cashiers needs (price checks, cash problems, system failures, needing more supplies, irate customers, etc.). The worst part of the job was my co workers/managers attitudes, for some reason most people who work at Wal mart are very rude..."
bad,the management needs a lot of help to work with associates beter  have time for them when they need to talk to them  help them when they ask for help instead of saying I well get back to you and never does
bad,underpaid for all the work inclined in the so called one position you are hired on for
bad,"Se rotulan cambios de precio en algunos departamentos y se empieza a planear lo que se va hacer para las ofertas del siguiente dia."
bad,They cut my hours to ten a week when I was contracted for full time 40 hours a week even though I worked very hard and surpassed all their quantity/ quality guidelines
bad,"during daily routine, ordering, scheduling, claims, keeping area clean. making the customers happy"
bad,got my butt groped from csm. they didnt work with me at all very little breaks no benefits
bad,"This is literally the worst place I have ever worked, but unfortunately it's the only place hiring right now."
bad,i was less than impressed by this locations management skills and lack of training.
bad,"i would have to scan parking lot for shopping cart and retrieve them. i learned patieence. My managers were of no help, they actually brought me down at times. My co-workers were decent people but had an poor work ethic. The hardest part of this job was not getting any help from managers when i needed them to speak with co-workers. i greatly enjoyed clocking out and going home."
bad,"As a very dedicated , and hard-worker I feel the atmosphere as well as the management are not ideal. Unprofessional management, led to an unproductive work environment and even more unprofessional team of associates."
bad,"A typical day at this Walmart consists of punching in and spending 20 minutes finding someone to tell you what you're going to be doing that day."
bad,Es una empresa responsable que ofrece todas las prestaciones de ley tienen puertas abiertas para ir a recursos humano si ocupan algo o arreglar algún conflicto entregados a la satisfacción del cliente en la mercancía que venden.
bad,"working with alot of people, different types of position. if i can do it all over again i would to. cashiering is a big job"
bad,The Management does not care about you. A women will only get so far as the good old boys club will let you go if they don't make you step down first. If you stay to long and your making half way decent money then people get fired. no chance of moving up for a women.
bad,"When I first arrive. I open the garage doors, set-up the work areas, and turn on the facilities machines. I ready areas for operational functions.  Although I've had automotive experiences. I've learned how other automobile designed differ from others. I've learned that wal-mart management segregates, and unionize themselves from common employees. In order to mask their shortcomings. Most management is need of professionalism. Co-workers for the most part. Are helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable. The most difficult part is when superiors are not knowledgeable of company rules, policies, and functions. The most enjoyable part of the job are the public, and co-workers interactions."
bad,I wasted 18 years of my life working for a company that I thought really believed in their employee's.  It's all a smoke and mirror's..
bad,Not paying overtime and working thru lunch break. Favoritism towards other workers
bad,"A typical day at work consists of being understaffed and over worked. The only learning experience I had was training on equipment (walkie stacker, power jack and wave). Co-workers are fantastic. Management is terrible. They have unrealistic expectations of staff. Hardest part of my job was being understaffed and not being able to take appropriate breaks. There was nothing enjoyable about the job outside of my coworkers."
bad,A typical day at work was long and hard. a great workout though. i learned nothing. Management was terrible. they didn't care about me. co-workers were very weird. the hardest part about worker there was pushing the carts in the snow. the most enjoyable about the job was clocking out.
bad,The Walmart in Fort Erie is the worst company to work for they don't have enough employees and they don't know how to treat their techs. their managers are unprofessional and not very easy to talk to. They don't seem to understand customer service very well worst company i ever worked for and I will never work for them again.
bad,Do not ever work here. EVER!!! Everyone there did not like their job nor the slavery task they possess. It was the worst job ever
bad,The job is not a stable job for new comers to grow and thrive at while trying to make a step forward in their lives.
bad,walmart is a horrible place to work. the managers are ridiculous mean have bad attitudes and zero understanding and concerns to employees. i did not like working at walmart and WILL NEVER EVER WORK AT THAT PLACE AGAIN
bad,I will not work for walmart again. It is not a good company to work at the location I was at. They treated us poorly.
bad,"Cleaning my area, leaning about customers, food, sales, etc."
bad,Management doesn't care about employees. Pay does not compensate for actual job duties.
bad,"Worst"
bad,"The managers are all jerks and they even criticize the few good managers about ""not being mean enough for the position."" They have absolutely no concern for their employees, or their customers. A person can get fired for the equipment they are using being faulty, but not from stealing or setting off fireworks in the store. There is absolutely NO communication between managers, even between the ones on the same shift. They abuse their employees all the time because they know they can get away with it."
bad,Upper management blocked your transfer to other location.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working for Wal-Mart because the policies change daily, what you do today will be wrong tomorrow. there is no written notice of these changes just word of mouth and only half of the message gets to the people working the front lines. cashiers never know what's going on in the store as they never attend the daily meetings and are expected to know what's really going on in the store. so not my first choice of employer"
bad,They expect you do drop everything and do the job of 3 people for little money
bad,walmart is not the best place to work at. they work you more than they pay. the whole placw is filled with drama. you get in trouble for others not doing their job.
bad,"Management is cruel to emploees especially brainerd store if your a white employee. They want give decent raises ,cause it affect their bonus. If as holiday coming up they pay holiday pay but the employ has to take off without pay 1 day within 2 weeks so walmart can make up for the money they paid out . I guess 750 trillion profitt isnt enough for those bank investers that own 51% of walmart . They dont care about employees , they can be replaced at lower pay and they save and make more more . Thats their slogan ( save money / live better ) . That slogan for corp. Not for consumer . They run sales and mark up other areas to make up for it ."
bad,I felt like I was back in high school again with the people who work there. you had your groups . people who shoot mean looks and treat me like dirt. because I wasn't up to there standers or have as much money as them.
bad,job didnt work out as i was pregant and going back to school it was a normal customer service job
bad,The absolute worst job expereience. horrible ppl and horrible attitudes. They need a clean sweep take out all managers and replace with new ones
bad,"To Much Work                                                                               "
bad,Working at walmart was a very interesting and I've met a lot of interesting people there. But the job wasn't steady employment. It was only seasonal.
bad,walmart isn't a place you'd like to make a career out of. It's a job and that's about the extent of it. It isn't a horrible place but it's very political.
bad,"Every single day we were afraid of being given the pink slip. Everyday we didn't know if we would have a job at the end of the shift or not. Management would yell at us from various things; for asking a CSM a question, for asking to go to the restroom when we weren't busy, for taking medicine, for having surgery, etc etc. For the time I was there I saw a lot of people be fired for the most random things. One person was fired because her car got snowed in and she couldn't make her shift. Another was fired for injuring her back. There was even one who was fired for having to have surgery. They never wanted to negotiate anything. I lived an hour away from my store and they would try to have me leave at midnight and come back at six in the morning. When I told them why they couldn't do that they would get snippy with me and tell me that I could do it because I'm young. I don't think that they understood that I would not get home until after 1AM, go to bed by 2AM, have to get up by 4AM to leave by 5AM to get there by 6AM. They didn't do this to just me either. We had some college students who had a set schedule and management refused to follow their schedule. They ended up quitting because school was more important than working for a company who won't adjust to a school schedule. Also, none of the CSMs or Managers were co-ordinated. Often they would go on breaks and ""forget"" to send their employees on breaks/lunch. There have been times where we would work our whole shift without any breaks/lunches, and we weren't allowed to ask for them without getting a coaching from someone about"
bad,"Es una empresa que cuenta con las prestaciones básicas necesarias pero que al momento de estar dentro de la empresa no valoran el esfuerzo ni la destreza que se desarrolla dentro del puesto de manera que se pueda crecer si es que se llegan a abrir oportunidades, no se da inducción a la empresa, no  se da descripción de responsabilidades, no se da retro alimentación de el trabajo realizado. Los gerentes con los que cuenta el Club Tangamanga son o muy jóvenes sin experiencia ni laboral ni humana o son muy temperamentales y solo a ""quien les cae bien"" crecen. Hacen cambios de área sin consultar previamente a los asociados."
bad,"I liked the job when I first started working. Working here was kind of a bad experience. They never worked with my schedule and that was really bad. I love Wal-mart but they treated me not so good, as they do everyone else. The management didn't care about anything really. I got along with most of my coworkers. I never enjoyed this job except the lunch break because I had an opportunity to take a nap. They didn't even try to work with me whatsoever. I was a part time associate working full time hours. I got no benefits and I was always falling asleep in class. I needed my hours cut and they couldn't even help me."
bad,"Worked at the Walmart Distribution center in New Caney, TX.  These people are double standard and try to get you in trouble with safety issues at all costs.  They will hide behind racks and try to catch you doing anything and everything..........oh you think ""well you should just do the right thing"".  Well guess what hero it's not about that.  It is about power hungry safety managers wanting to flex their muscles and write people up.  We had people being written up for things managers specifically told them they could do and then denied it even though other employees heard them ""ok"" that action in the first place..... Absolutely ridiculous company to work for and I would sooner recommend mcdonalds to anyone."
bad,n/a. there is nothing to tell. did not like that job at all. and did my job.
bad,No comment about Wal-Mart and the way they treat employees.
bad,Working at Walmart was ok it wasn't that great we would go in @night have a meeting on where we would be assigned. We would have multiple areas to work in meaning three departments to do. The co-workers were great management sometimes would pull you out of a dept .
bad,The employees don't care about others at all. The customers are always rude and complaining about how the other employees work. Always getting called in or asking to stay over time. Also never getting off work on time because they don't pay attention to their employees and would rather sit and talk. They also take their time when you need help at a register. They do not care at all. I would never work here again!
bad,Place was dirty and customers were very rude. Did not like working at this establishment.
bad,terrible company to work for. definitely not worth what you go through
bad,Walmart abused me..... It was my first job. I acquired this job knowing I would have too commute too work every day so when I saved enough money for my car I still possess I began seeking employment somewhere else. I put in my 2 weeks and moved on. It was a long 11 months but I did learn a lot possibly the most out of any job.
bad,Management was under qualified. They don't pay their employees enough considering the Walmart family is the richest in America. You don't get noticed for being a good employee. Brain wash you the second you start with how unions are bad.
bad,"There is absolutely nothing good about working for walmart, the pay is awful, benefits are practically non-existent, co-workers are almost always depressed/angry about being at work. The work itself is not difficult by any means, its basic retail and menial labor, but the culture within the company is abysmal. When I worked there everyone from the store manager down seemed to be angry/depressed that they were there and no matter how hard you try the negativity gets to you."
bad,"On a typical night at work I stock freight from the current shipment, ensuring shelves are full and presentable. Other tasks include assisting customers, providing breaks for the electronics associate, and stocking/restoring apparel."
bad,i worked in the shoe department and stocked the shoes and rearranged them.
bad,"Não tenho nada a reclamar de ninguém, sai por motivos pessoais"
bad,"at the time i was just starting my hard class in college and got in to my 6 credit hour classes i told the hiring agent that i can only work these days and these hours we came to an agreement, this failed through when my zmf or what ever my bosses boss was and i explained i can't work the hours due to my non flexibility and i wouldnt give up my education to work at wal-mart that be so stupid so they said why don't you just quit (because clearly they were not going to respect what we agreed upon) so i quit because i'm not going to end up with a dead in job still not making enough to even scrape by. i loved my job and enjoyed it immensely i just wish i could have had my hours respected instead of working hours that i could not work."
bad,"The overall job was great, Management very unprofessional."
bad,Peter Principle in full swing.  Poor leadership at all levels up to and including District offices.
bad,you learn lots so when you go grocery shopping you learn where to find things
bad,I never want to work at a store or club ever again. They do not care about associates.
bad,"I've been working here for almost a year now and have had no place for advancement, the employees in the store are absolutely rude except in my tiny department. The managers don't come to calls or even give good hours. There is absolutely NO chance at getting legitimate full-time. Except Full-time hours with part-time wage and that means NO benefits. How does one survive off Walmart wage? They'd have to be FULL-TIME and working there over 10 years! 30 cent raises every year???! It's not worth it. I used to like it at the beginning, because I started around Christmas, more hours, more money. But as soon as it hit February/March, things changed and it's not worth struggling to live over."
bad,"Clock in and work sportings and hardware depts, may have to unload trucks or pull buggys because of poor scheduling"
bad,"walmart is walmart bad coworkers and worst people to work with. The interview process to complicated, they interview you like some professional job interview, 4 session interview for cashier job, asks complicated questions for interview"
bad,I think walmart managers need to work on there personal skills and communication with associates rather than putting them down because sometimes you have to wonder why they have policies they do not follow.
bad,"Management simply does not care about you, or your life. If you get sick, not a headache, seriously ill like pneumonia, they still coach you (write you up)! No direction, way too many chiefs, no uniformity at all. Rampant Favortism, you cannot trust the management at all!!"
bad,"they pay you 7.70 per hour and wants you to clean ur counter, mop floors around your counter. he worst things only certain colour of people get raise or promotion even if they dont know anything"
bad,"While I will say this job is not for me, the company was better than I expected. However, there is always too much to do and never enough time or people to do them. You are always pulled from your job to do others and then coached for not doing your job. There was no training for me when I was promoted to another area of the store and no explanation or training."
bad,The job is not a bad place to work its is just t far for me to work
bad,"I would not recommend working at Walmart unless it's a last resort, honestly. Stores are always understaffed. You're either asked to work too many hours, or too few, and it doesn't matter if you work more than 35 hours a week, you'll always be stuck in part-time. They tell you you can move up if you work hard, but almost all potential job opportunities are lateral in terms of pay despite being more work. Not to mention, customers are usually abusive, and management's only suggestion is always ""just deal with it"". The only thing I liked about working there was handing stickers to people's kids."
bad,"No work life balance.  Salary at Wal-Mart means SLAVE!  And the wages that the employes get is WRONG! I am a assistant manager my job is to manage people,  instead I am a stocker, truck unloader, cart pusher and cashier.  It is terrible,"
bad,A multi-billion dollar company that refuses to treat their employees with respect.
bad,"Find a goal and chase it forever never stay at a standstill. Timed breaks,these tasks they give us are an easy way to implement the transfer of machines into the workplace and no more humans in the workplace eventually."
bad,they don't work with there employees and are very rude the hrs are never the same and for the pay they expect you to bend over backwards and do managements job
bad,Good job but not a good chance for advancement. The limited Scheduled are not a thing that i would try in the future
bad,i was suppose to be part time but I worked full time hours with no benefits
bad,Nice friendly people most of the time. Managers were sometime friendly.
bad,"Walk in, Clock in. Stand at register and ring people up un-tell the end of the day."
bad,there nothing much to say! it was a job. they donot treat their people fair!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,"While working at walmart as a Front Cashier its a great place to have fun , i got experience working as a cashier, Customer Service, networking , excellent team work, very nice management, lots of flexibility."
bad,"I manage a large  group of people by giving each individual respect. Also, making our customers feel they are number one."
bad,management doesn't care. hard to move up if you dont know the right people.
bad,During this job i was taught how to use the cash register but the employees and managers were not very pleasant to work with.
bad,I was belittled and exploited by this company. Wal mart gives customer service a bad name.
bad,customer services and cashier is a great job I  love helping the customers and seeing them smile it really makes my day to see them happy.
bad,This employer is awful they treat their employees like slaves and totally under pay them.
bad,This company has been going downhill for some time now. Since the death of Sam Walton walmart stores has continually proven to abandon it's workers and their professionalism for more work and less hours with no benifits. Truly a terrible company to work for.
bad,"Worst job I have ever had. They hire you for on position but end up working multiple other. Management is terrible, all associates are miserable. Benefits are terrible and overly pricy"
bad,"Good workers will be taken advantage of and run into the ground. If managers get in trouble they'll pass it down to associates under them. Pay is terrible, even for retail. You have to devote your life to Wal-Mart in order to make a decent living."
bad,the job was alright would like to go back but dont know if they would allow
bad,Hated it. They need to learn how to run a company the right way.
bad,"no opportunity for advancement, management at a market level discriminative and prejudice against women"
bad,A typical day at work was mainly the same thing doing freight all day and when we would get done or do something helpful we would get no recognition from our zone manager or assistant manager. I did not really learn anything from this job because I have held other retail jobs in the past. Working with my co-workers was really good because we all got along very well and always helped each other out. The hardest part about working a Walmart would have to be all the disrespect that was shown to us by the department managers along with the zone/assistant manager. The most enjoyable part of the day would just being able to help customers and get some type of praise and recognition.
bad,"Wal-Mart may be the worse place to work. This is the biggest company on the planet but yet their workers start off at minimum wage. The bonus is awesome if your manager doesnt find a way to take it all from you. Management respect nobody including the customers. You would be lucky to get days that you asked for cause to Wal-Mart, you're their slave."
bad,"Management needs better help, associates under paid, and the open door policy is never open door, communication skills on the job are very poor"
bad,In my honest opinion the job sucks. The pay isn't worth it. They ask you to work over then try to give you longer lunches so you don't get paid for it.
bad,/constant verbal abuse by management. You are given a position not by what skills/experience/what you applied for but by what they tell you your going to do.Promises for Advancement  or to apply for other positions are not true.You as a person don't matter.$ is the only thing.
bad,This is not a family run company anymore. No one in upper management cares about your family only the bottom line
bad,"High volume customer store, very bust everyday. Customers are really complicated to reason with. Managers have favoritism, and retilate. Co workers are good hard working people but no communication set in place."
bad,Personal time is incredibly hard to obtain. Benefits are BS. You work your but off for a very minimum pay with minuscule yearly raises.
bad,Half the time no one knows what is going on and can't decide on what should be done next. As soon as you start one thing they immediately have you do something else and then yell at you for not finishing the first thing in time.
bad,"When I first started working for this company, I had fun. As the second year approached, I realized what made it fun, was the customers. Management treats employees like a number instead of a human. Very disrespectful the way they would speak to their employees in front of customers. Being a cashier up front, if I had to use the ladies room I was not aloud to leave my register even though many other registers were open. So many unhappy memories of working for a Walmart. What they pay their cashiers for what they expect of them is completely unfair.Why did I work here? The small town where I was living at the time had very few places for employment. Basically, it was either Walmart or a fast food restaurant."
bad,You have to have great customer service skills and be able to walk around the whole store in a certain amount of time
bad,Management location changed constantly.  The job was a joke!
bad,"very bad atmosphere, dreaded going to work everyday"
bad,This job consisted of someone with no life at all.You worked 40 hours a week and you would have to take time off your schedule so that yu didnt go over 40 hours. Walmart is very unorganized never had enough staff to keep the store going and no manager showed good work ethic.
bad,The management has no compassion for your life out of work. Very easy to get fired for anything there.
bad,"Wal-mart should be a last resort place to work. They will work you to death. Everyone, including supervisors were in a bad mood.  It comes from too much work for so few employees.  Conflicting instructions come from different shift managers and the employee gets caught in the middle."
bad,"this place is not for everyone to work. lets put it this way, if you are sick, you will get into trouble, if someone in your family is deathly ill, you will also get into trouble. my father had a heart attack, and sure enough I got written up for calling off for seeing my father in the ICU. also if you are female your chances to be promoted have dropped dramatically. I watched constantly, men giving the promotions even though, there are woman who  have been there longer and have much more experience."
bad,You could be the best employee and they don't want to give you nothing
bad,It wasn`t my ideal kind of job.  I wasn`t there long enough to give a proper review because I was determined to find a job that best suited my talents in the work face.  I was hoping for a job in the office dept.
bad,"Walmart in a small town not bad.  Hours are terrible, and pay is really bad."
bad,"They preach respect for the individual, and open door policy. But in reality if you have a complaint about a manager or specific issue, they cite rules and always side with the manager. Concerns do not get heard. Also they do not except doctor's notes as an excuse to miss work. My husband was in the ICU in a hospital and got a written warning for it, they would not except his hospital stay as an excuse to be absent from work. Horrible experience and horrible place to work."
bad,Management was not supportive. Benefits were pointless. Atmosphere always had negative feeling.
bad,"management sucked, they dont care about employees they will keep you at a certain amount of hours so they dont have to give out benefits and they are highly against unions."
bad,"te esclavisan "
bad,This was by far the worst job I have ever had. they refused to let cashiers off the register to relieve themselves. They would pull us off lunch and 15 minutes break to work. They consistently promoted friends versus likely candidates. They would scream at the employees and degrade them. Very few evaluations or raises.
bad,i'm so tired of working for walmart i'm quiting tomarrow i cant work a job i'm unhappy with. and being treated and abused does not help.
bad,Management is lazy and only enjoy delegating task. You will have to do your job as well as other jobs in other department too. They like to cut hours when you will receive holiday pay or bonus so you will never see the increase in your pay. I learned that I would never like to work for this company ever again in my life. The hardest part of job was dealing with the rude managers and customers.
bad,Management is unreasonable and blames you for other peoples mistakes. Too many Chief's and they to do not communicate with each other. They get mad when work is not done because your helping customers.
bad,walmart was the worst experince of my life...i leaned that nobody notices if you do good but if you mess up they are quick to tell you about it...managment sees lost and confused and the amount of favoritism displayed was sickening
bad,"A typical day at this job was picking, scanning and labeling boxes. I learned how to drive different types of equipment. The management team was strictly by policy and production but my coworkers made it a fun environment. The hardest part of this job was the different temperature inside the warehouse."
bad,"When i arrive to work we have the afternoon meeting to discuss the days tasks , then i proceed to execute the prep, for my day then i hit the sales floor and begain to service stock and help customers ."
bad,"My typical night was that of stocking seven different departments, cleaning up the day shifts mess, bin the extra products that the day shift had forced out on the floor, help customers, answer phones, open changing rooms for customers, back up cashier and help in other departments."
bad,"Remodel existing stores "
bad,Unpleasant place to work. Never work there. They are disrespectful and dont give you days u request off
bad,"The typical day at Walmart consisted of dealing with poor management, angry customers, as well as disgruntled employees. The hardest part of the day was sweating through two sets of shirts from working so hard, only to be scolded by management no matter how well you preformed. There really wasn't much to enjoy about this job at all."
bad,"The management team showed favoritism, there for advancement was not attainable. Hard work and dedication was not appreciated."
bad,just wasn't a good fit for me and my family life.  management was stressed to the max and couldn't communicate with employees due to language barriers
bad,worst company to work with that doesn't care about employees and will hire anyone no matter how bad they are dress.
bad,"company does not example good service and consideration for consumers, employees, nor investors"
bad,"Wal mart is not a family oriented company, they take their employees for granted."
bad,"the managers are rude and u hardly get a day off and they sometimes forget to give u a break and lum"
bad,"Walmart's slogan is ""Save Money Live Better"", when in fact as an associate you are virtually unable to save money and live better due to the horrible wages they provide. Being the largest retail company in the world you would honestly think they would want to take care of the associates who make it all happen. Over working their team members is an understatement. Management. What management? Most if not all salary management, pawns off all the delegated notes from the store manager to all department managers. Over working the staff creates horrible customer service due to high stress and pressure to push out all the freight from the back room. Thus, the associate will walk right by a customer without asking if they might need assistance finding a certain product. Most likely because the store does not train any associate properly with store standards and customer expectations."
bad,"This would be a great company to work for if they actually communicated and actually helped the customers find what they are looking for instead of just pointing in the direction.  I myself would drop what I was doing to help that customer, even if I didn't know where it was, we would find it together."
bad,Management team sucks the pay is garbage 7.25 an hour this job is for an high school student just needing money.
bad,"this is the worst workplace ever, i wouldnt want my dog working here. the managers have no respects everything is horrible"
bad,It was a terrible time when I worked there through a remodel.  Management was better at yelling or blaming than finding solutions.  A great place to find drive to better yourself for other job opportunities.
bad,Working for Walmart was difficult.  I was stressed out most of the time due to work overload and job security.
bad,"Just a job to pay your bills. Not fun. Not an easy going job, management yells at employees, overall not an enjoyable job."
bad,The customers are rude at times and the work is repetitive. The day would go by fast or slow depending on what you're doing.
bad,"A typical day at work involved trying to get through language barriers and attempting to clean a filthy store. I learned that no one at walmart will communicate and help each other and that you'll get picked on if you don't understand spanish. Management was never there and didn't care when they were. My co-workers did not care either, and would sit in the break room and talk, leaving me to do all the work. The only enjoyable part of this job was clocking out and going home."
bad,"Employees treated like they are nothing, small or no breaks. Always one sided stories. Low pay, low hours, and low staffing."
bad,A company that does not help their employees and constantly fails to provide tools required to perform their jobs.
bad,bad its not equal or enough pay went through a lot with the company they did not pay me the right amount for my job title
bad,The management was less than professional. Only cared for personal benefit and almost seemed as there was a quota for firing people and breaking people until they quit. Favorites were played not only personally but in pay ranks as well. Inappropriate relationships were played out and there was no effort to hide these. If you were someone who worked your job then you took on your duties of everyone around you. Stealing was of no issue to the top if you were caught stealing then a blind eye was turned and even worse were the customers people were walking out with TVs and large appliances everyday. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the feminist harassment of customers which no one would help me and the flirting from the top. I learned that the only to progress was to have a physical relationship with your boss. I worked there a year and well educated above many others always tried to better my job and experience turning down advances that were wrong I quit and refuse to do anything legally to protect myself because how large a corporation that walmart is that I know nothing will be done about it and people will continue to get away with whatever they please.
bad,Not enough pay its a great job to use as a stepping stone. I feel you are overworked for the amount of money you receive.
bad,i liked the co-worker just not management they were not fare
bad,"poor managemnt schelues were bad, they were not flexable at all. you can only apply for benefits after working for them for 2 years ... overall the compeny sucks. walmart on hudson."
bad,"Do not like at all and am anxious to get out of there. Its low pay and you are treated like a pawn, not a person."
bad,"The only way to advance in that place is to be the manager's best friend. If at any time you have stood up for yourself over anything at all, you will never better yourself here."
bad,"Unfriendly work place, pay was terrible, not much room for advancement, co workers were lazy, hardest part of the job was the shoppers. thing i enjoyed the most about working there was clocking out and going home"
bad,Management is lazy and never does anything but takes credit for all other employee work. They fire people for anything including car accidents where people are hospitalized and do not care about customers. No set scheduling and managers make it impossible for the lower level employees to succeed. There is never enough help and the stores never schedule enough people.
bad,"To anyone interested in working for walmart, i advise to keep your head down. do not share opinions, do not show you're smart, do not make friends, and most especially do not let anyone know if you are going to school. Any or all of these things will get you on somebodies bad side. And if that happens then your days are numbered. Collect your paycheck and find somewhere else to work ASAP."
bad,"After I find another job, I will not return, I refuse to even shop there anymore. Management pushes too hard and expects too much."
bad,Horrible company to work for. Manager needs to leave to completely turn that store around>
bad,This store is a GHETTO HOT MESS from the store manager to the sales associates. They show favoritism to the highest of all high! Under pay their associate for the work they do. Will not honor experience pay.
bad,boses only cared about them selves and their money they always promised comission if you sold a certain amount but never ever came trew with it!
bad,"Taylorville location was the worst store i have ever worked in. Management lies and will get you fired if they dont get what they want from you, and they dont want work. Not saying its all stores because i worked in another store and loved every minute of it."
bad,"Horrible work environment, Management literally thinks they own you, as my manager told me this once. And better hope you never get sick, nothing is ever excused."
bad,"You will never get full time unless you are management, salaried management will always treat you like trash, you will always be asked to cut hours or come in for free."
bad,"Unfair expectations from Store and Department Managers."
bad,"I mostly just stock items, and sometimes go out and pull carts outside in the heat. I have learn nothing while I worked there and they always have bad management like they don't care about its associates."
bad,"You get what you get from the job"
bad,"Walmart is an absolutely terrible company to work for. There is no consideration for employees, so there is no work-life balance. Scheduling is all over the place and is completed by incompetent members of management. I was employed with the company for over 5 years and was constantly over worked and mistreated. If you can, stay far away from Walmart."
bad,I loved working with children. I also learned a lot about myself and the  passion that comes with working with kids.
bad,"Awful company, thieving people, and horrific working conditions"
bad,"A typical day is me walking into work, punching in and going up to the front and finding out what register I am at, since I am a cashier, and from the start I already see an overbearing amount of favouritism by the supervisors with which register cashiers are sent to. After that is done, I arrive at my register seeing that more often than not it is not organized or cleaned from the previous cashier who was there or the previous night. If that wasn't bad enough, I am usually centred out as the one cashier who gets a lot of people sent to or due to the EXTREME lack of organization, my line becomes insane. At first the job was enjoyable and customers/management was friendly...now they are more or less focused on themselves and lining their own pockets . Not to mention asking to be transferred to another department is not only like pulling teeth, but you are lied to right to your face about not having a position available in that department. And half the time that you want to transfer to another store, management DOES NOT agree to sign your transfer form, plus trying to ask for time off or adjusting your availability is next to impossible as well because they only work around the schedule that is suitable for them, not you, no matter how much they say otherwise. I am not sorry for saying this but DON'T work at Walmart, no matter how inviting they may seem at the start!"
bad,Typical big box culture. Pay less and work hard. AKA- A glamourized sweat shop.No one can live on this salary. They can merely survive at best. Managers are mere puppets held by strings from higher up: mostly uneducated and lack people skills (poor communication). Promotions are sometimes given to the best brown-nosers. The real hard workers are slammed. The slackers overlooked. By far the worst job I've ever had. Family life is non existant to say the least! Never again and would never recommend it!
bad,"This place treats its employees like slave workers. I'm not saying its always bad but most of the time it is. Managers say they have the associates best interests in mind, and some are telling the truth, but most of them could care less about you or your needs. All they care about is making money and they will do anything to do so. They cut hours like its nothing and everyone but the management team suffers for it. The floor associates are some of the best people I have ever met and worked with, that is really the only good thing i can say about this job. Be extremely weary when applying for any job at Walmart. It may be fine for a while but it will not last long."
bad,There is absolutely nothing positive about working for this company and I've never felt more unappreciated in my life.  The management is absolutely terrible and it's somehow only gotten worse over the past year.  I don't understand how a company can let their managers treat employees like such garbage and not do anything about it.
bad,I love working here all the cooking my employees and my managers I love the attitudews of them all are so good and I enjoy going to work everydat
bad,"This company really goes overboard when it comes to the ""right to work"" law in Louisiana. because they don't care if they want you gone then guess what you are gone. Managers were incompetent and most of the time drunk or high off whatever it is they did. No trust, micromanagement was heavily executed. when trying to do your job assigned, managers from other departments would try to pull you to do their job. Terrible place to work."
bad,Tough company to advance in.  High turn over rate.  Management are puppets listening to anything corporate tells them to.
bad,Bad experience lack of trainging I taught myself and I learned very fast I was on the register within 2 days
bad,Every one is walking out left and right to work at other stores. Work you like a dog.
bad,"I was alienated, ignored, and everyone was rude except maybe two other people that were also cashiers that they tried to keep me far far away from, its unorganized and literally the WORST job of my life."
bad,"Never consistent hours, poor management, and lack of appreciation for the individual."
bad,worked there for 10 years with no opportunity to grow with the company.The management team was the worst I have ever worked with. The management team was very unreliable did not know how to manage anything could not solve problems only added to them. The co-workers I had where very hard working people who also dealt with unfair treatment and no opportunity to advance as well.
bad,"Typical day included being in charge of maintaining multiple departments at once on my own and being expected to do the work of 5 people at once. After a while I learned the reason to over load associates with work was to help management fore workers before they could get to a pay raise so they could keep rehiring and maintaining pay rates at the minimum $7.25 rate. Management was also TERRIBLE, as there were about 5 managers for every three associates on the floor, and rarely did a manager try to listen or help resolve any issues. The hardest part was when there were two customers that kept coming into the store to harass me, they refused to get security or to resolve the harassment issues to the point of blaming me for their showing up. Nothing about this job was enjoyable, and it was stressful to the point that I left without notice because they refused to give me a raise, do anything about the verbal/s.exual harassment, and high workload. It is impossible to work a third of a store that's high traffic and the size of two football fields with little to no help!"
bad,i love working retail but this place sucked the life right out of everyone i have known.
bad,"Don't ever be sick enough to go to an emergency room and not have a general practitioner, because if you can't find that ER doc to sign their paperwork and you need to be out more than 3 days, they'll fire you."
bad,the managers mistreat people they lock the doors at night which are illegal to make sure store is set up for next day stay away not nice people
bad,Unloading and stocking shelves with merchandise from truck orders. There were multiple pallets full with merchandise and not enough staff to finish the work in the allowed time. i learned how to use the pallet jack as well as the system in which to locate where merchandise is the be found. Management is horrible. One manager is very unorganized and unprofessional. She has a terrible work ethic as well as a horrible attitude towards her employees. The hardest part of my job was working with incompetent co-workers as well as the manager. There was nothing enjoyable about the job. The hours were not fitting to my personal schedule and the pay is absolutely terrible for how many hours you work a week. The pay did not match the amount of work that was expected to be done in an 8 hour shift. I do not recommend this job to anyone. They are number 1 out of 10 in the worst places to work for.
bad,"Great first time job, if you don't really care about anything just a little extra money. Not a very good place to work if you like to plan things for weekends and need money to pay for bills."
bad,"Poor Compensation"
bad,Hated job. Don't have anything to say. They are not family oriented and they treat employees terribly.
bad,"At the beginning it was very productive and it was nice and excited to go to work.. but lately it has been too judgemental, associates scared to speak because of ""Retaliation""... Management are not going through companies policy, (They do what eva they want, without corporate knowing)."
bad,"Horrific managers overall. They don't care for the workers safety let alone the workers period. Only looked out for themselves and they're money. No job security because when they felt like they could get bigger bonuses with less employees, they'd fire the ones that can require someone from another department to handle. Meaning have one person doing multiple amount of jobs"
bad,"•a typical day at work"
bad,Managment horrible employee dont have a saying low hours diff schedules accused of not doing the job correct preferences with associates if dep manager hates you they will go to store manager and wine about u to get u fire..jealousy if ur hard worker specially BILINGUAL yes !...if u have no life no school no bills its perfect for u NEVER get weekends off
bad,My typical day was to go out to the parking lot and retrieve carts left in parking lot and bring them inside to the cart rows.
bad,"A typical (9 hour) shift starts by scanning my I.D. Badge to find out what register I'm assigned to until my first break, which I probably won't get. I sign into my register and start to check out customers. Hopefully I won't run out of change or need a price check, because the managers ignore your page half of the time. After my first break I go back and scan my badge to go to another register. This time I go to the self check. It's simple enough. Help up to six customers when needed. Scan your badge to verify age or to fix simple problems. Pray that the machines don't mess up. You'll have a hard time getting a manager to come help you! Thank goodness it's lunch time. I love that I get an entire hour to eat and relax. Back to work, scan your badge, go to a register, wait for my last break. 90% of the time, I will not get my last break. Finally, time to go home. After an hour drive, I put my 3 kids to bed. Get up the next day and do it again."
bad,"not enough hours."
bad,This place isn't a team enviroment. faulty equipment. Employees are nothing but gossip hounds. Managers are rude. Only good thing it works around your school schedules
bad,"Realisacion de inventarios, resivo de mercancia acomodo de la misma, supervicion del personal y vigilancia de posibles robos."
bad,Management did not care about quality in the deli area. I had heard our department manager state on many occasions he did not care about service or the job in general. We were always understaffed and management refused to help us when we would get overwhelmed by demand.
bad,"I have worked for several retailers before Walmart and found that this company in particular is more disorganized than all of them. The overall atmosphere among employees is very negative. The staff (not exclusive to hourly folks, mind you) works mostly by being motivated by threat of termination. While I imagine some stores function better than others I find that all former Walmart staff is largely in agreement about the fear tactics used by management."
bad,"my typical day at work is productive, some ove the management cared about their employes and some didnt. all my co-workers love me, the job wasnt hard for me at all. the most enjoyin part was the co-workers."
bad,people were very rude and not helpful. I was constantly harrassed by co-workers. Managers  and supervisors were not helpful most were disrespectful. I would never work there again.
bad,work crew messed around to much and talked to much stuffand they didn't know how to work as a team half the time so thats y i found a better job
bad,Not a place for advancement. Cannot move up. Full time positions are non-existant
bad,Not the place to work. They depend on the hardest workers for everything. Instead of giving hard works raises they hire new people just as slow as the one that quit or get fired.
bad,"A typical day at Walmart consists of turning keys solving issues, finding a solution to get valued customers on their way. Counting the podium, giving and receiving loans from the cash office. keeping the walkie being in constant contact with the upper management team. Also keeping the palm pilot to satisfy all cashier need in a timely fashion. Auditing registers, talking with associates about previous issues, taking and also giving advice on how to avoid future issues. Scheduling breaks, greeting customers, eyes up for all customers and cashiers."
bad,Working for one of the lowest rated companies in the nation has taught me many valuable skills.  I know how to work under pressure with no support from leadership.  I can work with the customers who cannot be satisfied and somehow learn to please them.  I learned all of my workplace policy and ethics on my own without any proper management and still earned the respect of peers.
bad,I enjoyed everyone I worked with on a daily basis. I enjoyed the steady pace and busy work assignments.didnt like the pay rate.
bad,Customers and management are worth your small paycheck and your major hours invested.
bad,"The pay was fine, but the managers wasn't good at all. Its a good place to work for a short period"
bad,Walmart does not care about their employees best bet is to be in management because they are the only ones to get paid
bad,These people treat you like slaves. Worst job eveeerrrrrrrrrrrr.
bad,"bathrooms, floors, and offices clean with daily maintenance. Strip and waxed floors. Stock shelves and help customers when needed."
bad,A typical day as a sales coordinator entails processing all the new jewelry shipments and selling jewelry to customers. Some customers place special orders so it was my job to call and follow up with their order.
bad,The job itself was easy but management and owners did poorly keeping it up to par.
bad,"A typical day at Walmart would be to clock in, walk to the front of the store, receive my drawer keys and hit the floor running."
bad,"As a former Wal-Mart employee, I would not recommend working at Wal-Mart to anyone. Words cannot describe how hard I worked for them. I learned how to do things that I didn't have to do just to help out. I worked all over the store in almost every department, did everything I was asked to do and then some. But I was treated like I never did anything by management. The managers at this store were the most awful human beings to walk the planet and were complete idiots. My co-workers were lazy and incompetent. I had one co-worker (another sales associate, not a manager) who would bring me her work for me to do when I was at the fitting rooms. And the managers treated her like she was a hard worker and did everything by herself. There was nothing enjoyable about working here. The benefits were horrible. No two schedules were ever the same, so my internal clock was never right. Some times they would have me work until 12 am and then come back for a new shift at 7 am knowing full well that I lived almost an hour away. I never knew when to eat or sleep. The pay was abysmal. To be fair, when I started, my job was what I considered a minimum-wage job. All I was really responsible for was answering the phone and directing calls, processing returns, and letting people in the fitting rooms. But as time went on they kept giving me more and more responsibilities but never increasing my pay. By the time I quit, I was doing everything the department managers were responsible for doing but only being paid a few cents over minimum wage. Working at Wal-Mart was the worst experience of my life."
bad,"Nao fui reconhecida por meus trabalhos exemplares, fui explorada e isso nao me ajudou em nada, nao cresci na empresa e nao pude continuar la."
bad,"Management was extremely rude and not very helpful. Very unprofessional at times. Not a company i'd like to work for again. Although, My co-workers were very friendly and helpful."
bad,The position I held was an Inventory Associate and the job itself was fine. The environment and the way the company takes advantage of their associates is disgusting.
bad,"I hate the people at the west end Walmart. When I worked there I got treated like I was nothing. No one cares about anyone.. I wanted to change my schedule and my jerk manager told me to suck it up, quit, or get fired! Rude."
bad,this job was tough as the proper tools and training were not provided
bad,"company only hires managers off the street , no real reason why they fire employees .unprofessional thinks all employees are criminals thinks all but the customers steal"
bad,The hours I worked were terrible!! I hated it!! The hours were bad!! They had me work in the evening till way early hours!! Like from 6:00 p.m. -3:00 a.m!! Then I would have to walk to my car by myself!! Super scary!! That is why I didn't work for them very long!!
bad,Walmart hire a lot of unskilled people for retail.. This folks do not care for there name or employees that works under them this place is worst company of them all.. words can't say how nasty this people are..
bad,Not enough hours. Try to get employees to work over their schedule hours. Do not schedule enough employees for the work day.
bad,they work you to the bone for nothing. you will get injured garunteed
bad,the most horrible and ghetto  company i ever worked for in my life.
bad,"I worked here for a year and would have been longer but luckily we had to move. This was really hard work, low pay, the management is terrible and if your willing to work hard they will drop all the work of the whole store on you with no thanks and if you aren't you don't do a thing then get fired randomly. I had worked there and worked hard. I could have been the supervisor but turned it down, they gave it to someone who it was their first week he always came in high and drunk and cussed at us all. The managers were his friends so ignored it and instead got us in trouble. I am so glad to be free of there."
bad,Typical corporation.  Employees are treated like garbage.  Your treated like a slave and if you don't comply your told to get out.
bad,this job sucks. the employees get treated very bad. they fire people for no reason.
bad,cashier was the most enjoyable because of the people you meet and the co-workers. the hardest part of the job was getting people to sign up for a master card.
bad,Management needs to learn that employees are just as important as they are.
bad,"Walmart is one of the worst companies I have worked for in my life. Unless you need the benefits, the pay is very low even for those who have worked for over 20+ years. The only way to make any money at  walmart is by climbing the ranks and somehow landing a salary management position."
bad,walmart had sis not have a good staff to work with. management treats you like dogs. the most enjoyable part was working with customers.
bad,"they dont pay great, and they arent always nice. they dont care about what u have going on in your personal life and wont work around it."
bad,"Low pay, over worked, no benefits, the people I worked with were awesome but the ones I worked for were idiots"
bad,i was underpaid and overworked with no benefits or for full time even after a year of me working
bad,The worst place I ever worked at. The wages were too low for the amount of work and stress I had to put up with on a daily basis.
bad,Walmart is the worst job to work. The customers are rude and management is even worse. My co-workers were lazy and there was always slack.
bad,Wal - Mart is a horrible company to work for.  They do not care about their employees. Home office is a joke.
bad,"Continuously under staffed and ill tempered management. Management thinks nothing of insulting employees, name calling and even cursing."
bad,"horrible staff, horrible pay, horrible everything I hated working for walmart and the money wasn't even worth it I couldn't pay one bill with what I made its sad how badly walmart employees are treated"
bad,Everything about this place sucked. Bad management with bad attitudes. Hardest part of the job was not losing your cool.
bad,"found everything that I needed when I wasn't working"
bad,Did not like my job as an unloader hours were not easy. Only worked as an unloader to get through college.
bad,I learned to not trust corporations. They promote anyone...just take a test. A MONKEY COULD DO IT
bad,i didnt like this job at all management was bad and i just didnt like it.
bad,"helping in other areas and not getting help with your area no teamwork i learned about produce,fighting all time,conflicts,heavy lifting of product that weighed as much as me by hand on ladder with no help unsafe work.enjoyable was piece and quite due to hours i worked"
bad,i always hated this job i walked in and quit proably because i worked at a very unstable location..
bad,I worked in the food department restocking food as people bought it. I learned how to work in a fast paced environment.
bad,i will not step on any toes but its not a job i recommend for the hard worker. its best for those that just need something
bad,"A typical day was greeting custormer and scanning their purchases as quickly a possible and cashing their purchase out.  Thanking the custormer for coming to the store and hope you seen them again.  I learned how to deal with all type of customers.  Management know their jobs well,  I worked well and got along well with most of my co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the customer who no matter what you did to try to please them they were never please and just wanted to keep arguing with you.  The most enjoyable part of the job was be able to meet different people and get to know them a better level."
bad,"I worked at Kennedy-King College for many years, and each department that I had successfully moved up to has taught me the real meaning of co-workers becoming your family. The hardest part of the job was when you cant make everyone happy. The most enjoyable part when I know I went that extra mile."
bad,this place is the devil's playground bad people bad management the more you try the more they hurt   you
bad,"en distintos sectores desempeñado correctamente. mi antiguedad en este supermercado es ya de dos años, con un crfeciemiento constante en la compañia desde deposito, piso de ventas,  como tambien logistica y facturacion ."
bad,Didnt like this job at all!  I could go on for hours about how much i disliked working here but im not going to
bad,they treat you like just a number more and they just worry about what they need they keep moving you around and making different task that are not on your job description they keep bouncing you around and changing you of areas without changing your pay rate as it should
bad,Management was good  i gained more  customer service experience.
bad,"Awful place to work = poor management, poor scheduling, it's all about the almighty $ at everyone else's expense.  No concern for employees and poor benefits, especially from a company with all their money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,HOrrible place to work. All the managers are disrespectful and never give you breaks and your lunch is on the sixth hour.
bad,"very dishonest, they do not value there employees, No incentive or praise to good workers, I would never work there again!!"
bad,walmart is not a career for me. while there is room for advancement there is alot of other things that need to happen first. its not exactly a career for alot of people but i think if you put in the time and effort it might be a good opportuinty for some people.
bad,"uma otima empresa ,com uma cultura muito flexivel entre todos os generos,a liderança aberta para o dialogo. colegas de trabalho cada um cuidando do seu departamento,sempre que nescessario um ajuda o outro. a parte mais dificil quando faltava produtos ai ficava dificil vender sem produtos. a parte mais agradavel era cumprir as metas e ter produto  disponivel pro clinte, e o bom humor da liderança em si."
bad,treated like a criminal. automatically assumed i did thnings i did not.
bad,"was not my mine pick"
bad,"Worst place to work!!! Rude power hungry management with no reguard for employee safety or health. My manager gave me grief for asking for 2 days off in a row to have an upper gi! I was also told (as a 5'1 110lbs 18 year old female at the time) to have every cart in the lot back in the building in 1 hour by myself when the maitenence guys were allowed 3-4 men, 3 hours, and a cart pusher to clear the same amount of carts. Rude coworkers rude management and horrible customers! I'd rather shovel droppings until the day I die than work there ever again!!!"
bad,"My work ethic was fantastic but Manager treatment there was pathetic. Every day I went to work I was harassed by Management to the point where physical injury took place on the job site. Not going to go into full detail but all I can say is it wasn't a best time working there at Walmart."
bad,I learned great customer service skills. I also learned to the cashier and to functions money on fast terms.
bad,"When I first applied, I had applied for and gotten the job for an overnight stockman working in the dry foods section of the store. On my first day of work, they put me in the Frozen/Dairy section, which I came to find out TWO WEEKS later, that I should be getting paid more for working in that section. One month later, after I told ALL of the higher ups about it, nothing had been done."
bad,I have been employed by Walmart (2 seperate stores) and they are horrible to work for.  First - I am a veteran of 2 overseas deployments (1 Iraq and 1 Afghanistan) and apparently I didn't qualify for their veterans status. Second - the management all the way to home office were very disrespectful and ill mannered.  I would not recommend this workplace to anybody!
bad,"Really over worked and underpaid.  They don't care about their Associates, if sick nor injured. All they care about is money in their pocket.  The only thing i actually go there is people and make them happy even if it cost me my job.  Management sucks and pushes you the right in a away to write you up.  They through you into a position that your not getting the mentoring nor training to full fill."
bad,Sucks!!!! Do Not EVER Work for the walmart in pooler. Bad management. No job security you call in ones you will be fired.
bad,"I work at walmart for 8 years just last month I was terminated because of (they say absentees), but for someone to have an intermittent on file to be let go. I only call out if its because of my son or weather related. I did my job that's all i wanted to was to to my job and go home. i feel as though management shows favoritism. I say that because I know some that calls out leave early come in late and all they get told and I quote: "" I told such and such to get their butt to work."" I feel that the store manager lacks, I feel at the store I worked at that there's no one and I mean no one you can go to. Why is it that when management love ones get sick its okay for them to just leave, but as a single parent when school call or my child wakes up sick or having a asthma attack and I call out letting them know that my child is sick that my job is threaten or even worst i lost my job regardless of the fact that I have a intermittent on file. Why is it so hard for single parents at walmart? I do feel like I was wrongfully terminated. I even called the store manager the next day and asked him to look into I have to have heard back from him. I didn't know as associate that i would have to managements job as will as mine to keep remaining of what and why I called out. I feel like this here will go by and no one will look into it. There's so much that goes on inside of walmart that even i don't understand."
bad,"8 hr shifts"
bad,"Management isn't worried about employee goals or advancement, they worry about how good the employees make them look by the end of the shift. NOT a team effort."
bad,there is no where to move up here and are not supportive of people to further yourself when trying to go back to school to better yourself.
bad,"i keept my job there because the power of selfesteem and self confidant,otherwise i was discriminated and been called all kind names because of my back ground"
bad,"clock in make sure regester is running good "
bad,I absolutely dislike this company. I think the people at the top of the food chain are greedy selfish sad people. They mistreat and misuse their employees. The employees are underpaid for the job the company expects them to do.
bad,This establishment is horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The management has no respect for their associates. FIRE YOU FOR NO REASON. Management has the nastiest attitudes all the time
bad,"Unloading trucks and separated freight. Data entry, Supervision"
bad,Typical day as being a cashier is that your always getting yelled at by customers because the lines are too long. Management stresses you to move faster but what can you do if management doesn't do the scheduling right. Its always drama. There are some cool people that work there.
bad,"I hated working here, no advancement opportunities, terrible pay, they want you to have an open availability yet you'll barely get hours. Management is terrible... probably the worst Wal-Mart in existence."
bad,"I was employeed by Walmart for almost a year, and throughout that entire time it was a miserable experience for me. The managers dogged me constantly, forced me to work through my breaks, and constantly harassed me over the pager. I finally had enough and left, and good riddance."
bad,This company likes to hire on a three month temporary basis and then let you go so that they do not have to provide benefits
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of frustration and worry over who was going to get fired next. Management was never happy with the work I did and never gave praise when warranted. I learned not to trust anyone in this company, including co-workers and managers. The hardest part of the job was watching my back as I tried to please the management team. They have too many managers and not enough workers. They expect a person to do the work of 4-5 people without getting compensated for it. The most enjoyable part of the job was quitting time, when I could leave it behind for a few hours."
bad,"I loved the job when I first started with the company but would soon realize that things were not as they appeared! The company expects WAY to much work out of their associates and are not willing to pay them what they are deserved. Management would call in employees early for a shift but would make them cut the ""overtime"" off even if it did not exceed 40 hours. High expectations and low consideration of employees!"
bad,Walmart was a good place to work at but they need to pay their employees more for what they have to deal with and do on a daily basis/
bad,"This may be just a one person case. I don't believe it to be, this particular store and manager, in particular the pharmacy manager, was hard to get along with she was not understanding of childcare, military families, or with out moral thought. She isn't a friend of the law enforcement, and it is Wal-Mart's policy that they give no information, to law enforcement of their customers, even if they are breaking the law, with drug abuse, however it is accepted by the proper employee, to get someone for shoplifting a 2 dollar lipstick ? "
bad,This was a terrible place to work.  They would schedule you to work until midnight and you would have to come back at 7am the next day. Your schedule is all over the place.  Standing on your feet for 8 hours is painful. Some of the managers are rude and look down on the lower level workers. The best part of the job was the co-workers and some of the customer service managers.  There were no pros about this job.  I was very happy to leave.
bad,"This company does not care about employees, has to many bosses who can not get along"
bad,ive already done a review. terrible experiance but in the midst of chaos there was a lot learned
bad,They took advantage of every employe to the point were some employees worked 14 hour shifts
bad,"Stociking, worked 3rd shift, which was not enjoyable, too far from my house, hardest part of the day was adjusting to time difference."
bad,"Provide excellent customer service until the store closed. Stock shelves overnight, price changes, backroom audits, inventory. I learned organization skills and patience. Independent work."
bad,"Managers rarely know a thing about the department they are currently over.  Management team changes every 4-6 months, by lottery, or by default when a manager would frequently quit because of the poor state of the store.  Loss  prevention manager was caught falsifying records of profit loss and theft in order to make the store look better, and was terminated.  Store manager was forced to step-down because of severe loss of profit and production.  Cart pushers were treated awfully in all weather types, be it 105 degrees outside, or 28 and raining.  Equipment regularly failed and broke, and repairs were untimely, and frequently incomplete.  On several occasions, the technicians didn't repair anything, but claimed they did.  One cartpusher was frequently scheduled to work 2pm-11pm one day, and then 6am-3pm the next.  Schedules were randomized and did not allow for college classes."
bad,"Since the passing of Sam Walton Wal-Mart is on a dangerous slope. the expectations and ""support"" are worlds apart. there was little to no support from any management as one manager said when asked for help ""Look its a sink or swim business figure it out or get out"".  The most enjoyable part of that job came the day I turned in my badges the weight of the world had been lifted by quitting go figure."
bad,punched in went to a supervisor start a task then another person of management would ask me to do something else while i wasnt even done with my first task. its way to many management there and like four people over a department and the department still never gets organized. I dont understand why it has so many people of management. I know someone who worked in grocery and got fired from someone who as management in electronics.Walmart is a bad place to work for my cousin didnt get her yearly raise they gave her some dumb excuse on why she didnt get. walmart doesnt care if your sick or not. they dont expect doctor excuses. just plain sucks! THEY GAVE ME 40 HOURS TO WORK BUT HAD ME DOWN FOR PART TIME SO THEY WOULD'NT GIVE ME ANY BENEFITS.
bad,That is a good place to work they have friendly co-workers and the managers there have no problem allowing to help out in other parts of the store and the pay is great. They pay you for the work that you do and have benefits
bad,"Well for starters I worked 3rd shift a month out of high school in the middle of trying to get my drivers license so that through a huge monkey wrench into that so I had to catch a ride from either my parents or my ""friend"" so it was a huge damper on their lives. I was only getting paid just above minimum wage for full time 3rd shift, which for a kid with no bills and a 100$ rent, wasn't terrible but it wasn't good for someone to independently live on. Since this was 3rd shift my social life was completely dead for the 3 months I worked there and management was horrible."
bad,everyday is different Im always learing something new which I like.
bad,"A typical night at work consist of going to the meeting first thing then being scheduled to a certain area the stock freight.  I learned how to stock freight to shelves, the back room process, and how to use our task manager and hand held.  Management was less than helpful.  They were rude and disrespectful even to the customers.  They talked about team work and such things, but when it came right down to it they expect a select few people to get the work done.  My co-workers were lazy and did as little as possible, and expect someone else to help them every night instead of doing their own work.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the managers egos'.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when it was time to go home.  The Walmart that I worked for was nothing but a joke."
bad,The management was not professional. I personally liked working here but management was just corrupted and picked favorites.
bad,They will fire you and try to rehire you to keep you as a temp do not waist your time management blows!!!!!!
bad,"A typical day at walmart consists of 5 seperate bosses each telling you to do different tasks.  There is no structure and absolutely no training for your job.  Day one you will be sent to do tasks with no training whatsoever.  There are individual good people at walmart.  The problem is the culture at the company turns those good people into robots.  People do not use any form of respect when dealing with their employees.  The focus points that should be used are not and they are more worried about things that make them look good rather than what is good for the customer.  If products are not on the shelf customers cannot purchase them.  Yet they are more concerned with displays than availability.  A multi-billion dollar company should add more manpower at each store.  If they did walmart could double their business with proper staffing and product availability.  Customer service would be higher, satisfaction would be higher, the stores would look nice.  In the long run spending the money on the labor and training would help.  They lose far too many talented people due to work conditions and laughable pay.  If a company took care of their employees, those employees would be happy at work, and want to go the extra mile for the company and the customer.  They are complacent with minimal staffing, select products being available, and in a round about way forcing the customer to select certain items due to shelf availability."
bad,I absolutely love Wal Mart. Management was great. The most enjoyable part was knowing that you're making someone else shopping experience a lot more easier.
bad,"After hiring about 30 of us, they let everyone good and said it was because they didn't get pemission from the corporate office.  I really needed this job to help me pay my Tuition."
bad,Enjoyed the co-workers. But not the management team. I also enjoyed the customers.
bad,management only cares about themselves. Would not say that even an management spot would be good for the simple fact that they have to deal with so much BS that you need to bring your own shovel.
bad,maintained front end of entire store schedules personal and store credit card goals meet
bad,"I was only there a short time, but felt like a whipped dog. The work was overly demanding and all the managers and associates seemed worn down."
bad,upper management treats employees like slaves while paying 7.25 per hr
bad,"They don't care if you have a family emergency, they count that against you, and that can get you fired. There are no real advancements, they pay only minumum wage, no benifits what so ever. Their Competor Taget Corporation is great with their employees, believes in advancement, pays extreamly well, gives you benifits within 90 days, you get a 401k when your 1 year comes up, great envrioment,extreamly family orientated, gives you sick leave, aa=nd vacation leave as well within 90 days as well. And their 10% you can use on any and everything in the store. You are not limited to anything. You have the right to also switch your hours out with who ever you choose as well.   "
bad,"Standing at the register, cashing people out.  I have learned nothing, its a very medial job, not in the field I want.  The hardest part of the job was going everyday and not feeling like i am making a difference."
bad,"load and unload pallets, take care of customer needs, stock freight to  shelves, price changes, dealing with customers was best part of the job, management played a lot of favoring with certain  employees was hardest part of job watching it on daily basis. you do all the work they take all credit.  To move up in the company was not easy unless you were on there list of favorites"
bad,Enjoyed working with fellow co-workers. Everything you learn is  based on what you can figure out on your own or ask a fellow co-worker
bad,"Basically you have to process cash, then find and correct shortages."
bad,"Managers have no respect for employee needs or schedules. If you missed a day, even sick with a note, you were written up. They changed schedules on a dime and didn't raise old employees wages but started the new people out at a higher rate. They'd send you home over a cough than tell you that you had an  ""attendance issue"" and fire you just to get you out the door"
bad,The most enjoyable part of the helping customer want she /he needs the help of chosen a pair of shoe
bad,"not a good employer differentiate between races in the workplace. Managers are very rude and they talk about people in the workplace in front of the customers. They are very rude when people ask them to help them find an item in the store. "
bad,"While Walmart professes to be a place of equal opportunity for all, it is anything but that. There are two cultures and classes. One is the salaried management, the other are the hourly associates. The management follows an almost cult-like devotion to the regional and home office, above and beyond what is normally found in other coperate cultures. Reading and studing the sayins of ""Mr Sam"" is encouraged. Standard answers and phrases are used in dealing with employee problems. The number one goal is manipulating and lying to the associates to get the most amount of work from them at the least possible pay. "
bad,this place is one of the worst places to work they don't offer very good benefits to their employees
bad,pretty good company. flex hours sometimes easy  going managers . great co-workers
bad,"It sucks, low wage mean consumers. its not worth your time unless you want extra cash to go shop at the dollar store."
bad,Constantly bending and standing on very hard concrete floors. Management asked associates for help because they were unsure how to manage.
bad,This company was an amazing place to work. It taught me a lot about customer service
bad,Management is terrible. Hours are terrible. Pay is terrible.
bad,"There is not much to say except that walmart was the most stressful job. As a front cashier there was little to no support from management. If you needed money or help, you had to search for one of the 4 front managers, who were hard to find at all. They have no compassion for individuals and never cared to get to know anyone.    They made you work long hours, regardless of if you had two jobs or not. The only good part was that you got to meet interesting people."
bad,"I worked there for 6 months, asked for feedback and was told I was doing fine only to be fired when my six months was up for no real reason.  Then they tried to fight me on receiving unemployment."
bad,"I don't know if it's this store, but the management and treatment is unfair, and unethical. I have never hated a job in all of my life! Typical day is working 3rd shift, meeting, scanning badge for task, work over 4 different departments, zone the departments, and constant assignments added on in a 8 hr shift.  You darn near lose your mind trying to complete everything, which is impossible to do by yourself in one shift. What you hear is what is true! Warning!"
bad,"Done in previous pages. Walmart I did not care for working there. Morning Star- Nanny, I wish the other nanny  did not have to return!!"
bad,You will be paid next to minimum wage to do a warehouse job that could easily get you 12 dollars an hour.  Dept. managers and assistant managers are overworked while the store manager and co manager sit back and enjoy that fat bonus collected from the sweat of our brows.  You will be expected to do 2x the job that was asked of you.
bad,The disorganized management makes each task harder than it is. with new technology being put in but under utilized the work just gets lost. there is all the since of urgency and none of the know how. Absolutely horrible place to work for.
bad,"Did not have a good experience. Management was terrible. Not saying that all Walmart's are like this. However, the one that I worked at was very bad."
bad,Dont work here if you can help it! Management is unfair and they play favorites.
bad,"Empresa com falta de humanidade,péssimo salario,horas e horas de trabalho sem descanço."
bad,always getting introuble by management for helping customers
bad,"A typical day at work is never the same they are short staffed all the time, poor management and you feel like you live there. The co-workers act like you are back in high school with ""clubs"". I did get along with most of my co-workers they are what the day go by a little bit faster. The hardest part of the job was not having the equipment everyday to do my job and not the staff to be able to get everything done on time. They pull you up to the register and train on you everything basic, you don't know there policy or rules up there because that is ""not your job"".  You are always looked at as being replaceable."
bad,"Wal-mart pharmacy over the years has changed. I use to love to go work,but at the end I hated my job and the people I worked with. It was a different problem everyday and mangement did care at all. No leadership,care for their employee."
bad,If I had to beg Walmart to hire me back I might have hit my ultimate low. And may need counciling. Just kidding. No really I would never go back to that greedy company. I no longer shop in Walmart stores.
bad,Only good thing was the fun and jokes with other employees lol
bad,"A terrible place to work where hours are cut and overtime is taken away by extending your lunch break. Employees excuse me ""Slaves"" work long hours in the back without seeing a lunch break until their 4 pm to 1 am shifts are nearly over. Management is totalitarian will accuse employees of stealing and threaten to call the police fire you on the spot. You will be insulted on the daily basis and work with individuals will a below average high school level education. Even at the upper levels of employment because degrees are not required to advance."
bad,"We always had something to do, For the most part everyone worked together as a team."
bad,"stocking, pricing, shipping working with negitve people was the worst."
bad,The best thing about working here was that it motivated me to find somewhere else to work.
bad,"I sold cell phones from several companies.  Dealing with the people was ok, but the interruptions and odd work hours were not my thing.  I liked the manager and my supervisor, however they were both so stressed it was hard to even find time to communicate.  I enjoyed the customers and my co-workers, but disliked the long hours and low pay."
bad,I was only there for a short time. This was a part time position.
bad,"FIRED ME FOR MISSING A LUNCH."
bad,They do not schedule you enough hours per week. Management needs more training/classes.
bad,It just wasn't what I needed to progress in my future plans. It was unorganized and people customers were rude
bad,They are terrible organization to work for. I never in my life was treated so badly when i work here and my job performance has always been top notch. Often times I would be the only worker outside to collect carts for both sides and I would be reprimanded for not being fast enough and I'm a fast and effecient worker. They have an open door policy but if you have an issue they try to make you wrong.
bad,en anviente era muy pesado nos pagavan poco y erasn orarios rotativos
bad,its easy working there but the customers are really rude and very impatient
bad,Management was ok at times. It had its good days and bad days.
bad,they is a good company and welcome everyone to work for them. and the pay is good also
bad,Management seems non-existent and the whole thing is disorganized.
bad,I would come into work but was in a transition were the store had no Manager so everyone was every where and it was chaos.
bad,"This company treats their employees very poorly. I would not recommend employment with this company unless you are looking for a temporary job, such as something to pay the bills while in college."
bad,"You literally spend every day you go in waiting in fear to hear they drummed up a reason to coach you. This in turn allows them build up reasons to fire you. I work O/N stocks and it is literally like working on a loading dock. Chemicals, dairy you can be lifting up to 50 or more pounds per ever 5 seconds. I love when I find myself being handed 8 pallets of chemicals with 4 hours to finish while others, it seems slackers get away with everything, get 2 pallets and walk around socializing. The co managers are wackos who'll break down during a meeting crying because they fear they're about to be fired because their employees are SO LAZY!! They don't allow overtime period! They try to keep you under 40 hours continually because they don't want the employees to be able to claim a full time status. Not having a full time status means NO BONUS! Yep, while everyone basks in the glory of a bonus, PT'rs get crapola! I love rounding up carts in below zero weather freezing my ears off while the long timers know how to hide out and stay warm inside. You can never get your boxes into the baler because it's always full and it's up to the stock people, us, to make bales on top of hauling pallets off a truck, putting out our stock and whatever else they throw at us. Co managers refuse to answer employees calls in case they're calling off. Home goods consists of half the store and our store will put only one person in there for the night expected to do it all on their own. Don't work fast....if you do, they'll expect more and more every time you get an assignment. If you're in Dairy you're to"
bad,I did enjoy my position but the management there is not what it used to be when they cared bout employees
bad,"I believe the portrait studios are no longer there, but the hours suck and they couldn't keep workers. Mainly because the district manager was the worst. She had such a nasty attitude and didn't care about the well being of others."
bad,Assisted customer and wrote on cakes. It was a good enviornment but not very flexible.
bad,I have nothing good to say about this job. Overall it was a bad situation to be in.
bad,"not a great job, employees were not treated well, hours were long and customers were not the nicest"
bad,Separation of Joint venture effects employees badly.less job security.
bad,Poor Management.... You would apply for a certain position but every day your doing something else. Management would not work with school schedules or care anything about you. crazy work hours and lunch breaks all late.
bad,This was my worse job ever. The only thing good about this place was the people. My co-workers were awesome.
bad,"Its walmart it had terrible managers, not enough employees that I had to continually push carts because they couldn't afford to hire new ones."
bad,Wal-Mart worked with me on my work schedule while I attended college.
bad,It didn't seem like they cared about you as a person more like your just a number.
bad,"What I learned working for Walmart is that it is a world by itself. This company has a difficult time dealing with individuals. Processes change very quickly all in order to make more money. As a sales associate you are required to do whatever the management asks you to do, otherwise in some cases you could get fired. The hardest part of the job was listening to management who chose to put their personal agenda above the good of the store. The fun part was the great people I worked with."
bad,omg worst company to work for i would never do it again the ish sucked and the pay sucked 8.40 an hour really
bad,not enough managment no one owened up to the thefts in the lounge
bad,"Everything you hear on tv about it not being a great place is true.  Management does little to nothing to defend you.  Company is more about the $$ then its employee's and shows when they go to promote employees within.  I was the smallest person employed and the one lifting 27"" + CRT TV's onto risers while management was watching and pushing a cart through out the dept. made it hard to really want to work hard for the company."
bad,"I would not advise anyone to work at the Walmart on South Main in Kernersvile, NC."
bad,"Experienced race and gender discrimination. Terrible managing, mangers would gossip and belittle employees. After numerous hospital visits health was still put at risk even when doctor’s notes were provided. Lack of communication throughout the store. School schedule was not taken into consideration."
bad,"I learned nothing except how to stock a freezer, take orders from a man who had unrealistic ideals about how 1 person could do a three man job. By far the worst place I've ever worked."
bad,i was part of the set up crew which was a crew of people they chose to build/ move fixtures and shelves so the store can become a supercenter. they had us doing all this while stocking things. which was not part of the job description. they never helped you if u needed any type of help. i also got yelled at for helping a customer in front of a big crowd of customers. it was so bad that the customer i was helping wrote a complaint to management.
bad,400 plus prescriptions were completed in one day.  The pharmacy was fully staffed.  The pharmacist were pleasant to work with at all times.
bad,Understaffed store in Edinburg...store #3886. Had to work off the clock just to get things done... both salaried female and male managers were having affairs with hourly employees...not only in this location but also in store #0395 in Mission.
bad,Despite all the negative rumors I decided to experience working at Wal-mart for myself. Shortly after being employed I realized how underpaid and under appreciated the associates are.  The cashiers were lovely people I liked them the most. Management was tired cranky and over worked. There are no perks or mobility working for this company.
bad,"I would open up the store as to getting stock on the shelves ."
bad,"The Walmart I worked at was terrible. I can only speak in regards to that one as I have not worked at them all. However, management was sloppy and nothing was well organized or run. Multiple departments were hardly able to complete their daily duties due primarily in part to the failure of the managements to supply man power or required tools. Customers who are rude consistently shop in the store, which would be fine except that the management does not engage them or step in to assist employees in the moment. Rather they chastise the employee and proceed with disciplinary actions."
bad,"Clearing the floors for new products to come out. changing all prices and setting all items out on the floor right and in thier proper place."
bad,"No Comment. Great for high school kids that need money."
bad,their policies are unfair and they do not care about their employees like Sam Walton said he did
bad,ive  learned  alot about  this  company. only bad thing is that your pay is poor your work skills are  not vauled ..no room to grow in company ..
bad,"They do not treat their employees very well, this company has went downhill since Sam Walton passed away."
bad,They were truly an awful company to work for and the pay was next to nothing look elsewhere for work if you can!
bad,"Wal-mart employees do not get paid enough for dealing with cranky customers. The stories are true, management does not care about their employees. Do not apply if you are a college student, they will not work around your schedule."
bad,Walmart was a good job for me until the pay was not meeting my financial needs.  I enjoyed working directly with customers.  My co-workers were fun to work with because we practiced teamwork.  There really wasn't anything hard to do at walmart.  The most enjoyable part was getting to see the new meerchandise before it went on the floor.
bad,"1.understaffed in every department"
bad,"its a good high school job to teach you about work and how things operate, pay isn't good benefits are not great, good firt job though"
bad,"This used to be a great place to work, however over the years has become more of just another low paying dead end job. There is plenty of room for advancement, but you have to be buddies with management and due to various complicated policies several highly skilled very qualified associates constantly get overlooked for promotions that go to less qualified newer employees, Not just my opinion most long term associates i have spoken to feel the same way."
bad,Working at Popeyes was a great learning experience on how to work in a close environment. I use to working outside. I learn how to work inside and stay out or all the mess the co worker keep up. The hardest part of the job was nothing.
bad,I worked in the Deli Department ant Walmart.  Helped the customers with their orders.
bad,Do I really need to say anything? terrible work and terrible pay
bad,"if mgmt let people work it wouldf have been better"
bad,"Addressed American Tire Distributors website inquiries per day, ordering tires for"
bad,"I clean from the time I get in the door. I work in customer service, so I have to pay attention to everything (customer, money center, returns and questions). Retail is very stressful, but I manager to maintain my area and still smile at the customer. I really like what I do there. The manager's trust me enough to leave that whole area up to me to decide what to do. I have strong leadership skills and I can get people to work around me. I love it. You just have to be kind to people and listen to them, but do the work as well. And once they understand that it is no playing games, or not wanting to do what I am doing (work) because that is what you are get pay for. To work."
bad,"A typical day at work includes daily quotas for selling cell phones. Handling customer issues, and resolving them in a timely manner. I also take inventory everyday to insure that we are fully stocked on the items that we need before beginning the work day. My co-workers in the wireless department are great we all get along very well. The hardest part of the job is trying to please an unhappy customer.  The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the smile on my customers face when I complete their transaction. We have a management team that doesn't respect their employees and their ideas."
bad,stocking the shelves and making sure that my co-workers are done and if not help them if its needed
bad,They have very useless rules. They will fire you over nothing.
bad,"You would come in and get pulled around by 5 different people at one time. I did learn about retail and how it works. I did move up by the highest pay I ever got was $12.40 An hour as a manager to me that was not good when I was there for 6.5 years. Hardest part was not know what your doing from one minute to the next. "
bad,Management never speaks to the customers but wants the employees to be friendly at all times. Very hard work with no rewards what so ever.
bad,"would never recommend anyone to work for them, they should be put out of business"
bad,I would go out and grab carts all day and bring them back inside for customer use. How to work as a team and to always do what your boss tells you. They were never there when you needed them and would get angry if you reported broken equipment to them saying it will get fixed eventually. dealing with the broken equipment. Being able to be outside constantly.
bad,"management was helpful, co-workers always very helpful, production was most hardest part of the job but if you work hard at it , it was achievable. The most enjoyable part of the job was the hard fast pace work and the people that were always there to help"
bad,I Worked there for 2 years. went from general merchandise to frozen foods. a good place to work but hard to move up unless you know somebody.
bad,Although I hated this job with a passion because management sucked and the whole place is corrupt. It did teach me how to work on the team and taught me how to have more patience with people and for that I am extremely grateful.
bad,"managers were mean, never work at walmart, sucked, nice, dealing with management, when its just me and my cashier"
bad,"stocking"
bad,"I don't want to sound super negative, but Wal-Mart is the worst place I ever worked. Unless you cannot find anything else, I suggest going elsewhere."
bad,"Walmart is only for the a first time job, everything they stand for or use to be known for is no more and they treat their employees highly unfair."
bad,They will most likely never give you full time hours. they will get you close to it so they dont have to give you full time employee benefits.
bad,"Setting up store after remodeling, stocking the store, building shelves and setting up displays"
bad,Learned alot about stocking and disassembling and assembling shelves and setting up stores after remodeling.
bad,Managers didn't cover if people called in. High expectations with little help on the floor. At least they gave yearly raises.
bad,I hated working at WalMArt. I worked there for about 4 years total with no chance of moving up within the company. The management there was lazy and hard to find when you needed them.
bad,"Managers unfriendly and workers don't work, Lack of team work, No motivation to get job done, Nobody wanted to be friendly to guest"
bad,"a typical day at work? insane"
bad,The Walmart in Pampa Texas is full of drama. I did meet some pretty cool people there.
bad,"en el horario que me correspondía, ya que se rolaban turnos por las mañanas checar mercancía que llego al departamento, (juguetería) acomodarla, si era necesario hacer pedidos autorizados por gerencia,  alguna meta en el momento como  hacer un estante de las promociones del departamento, si era martes de visitar a la competencia para saber de los precios que manejaban."
bad,Typical day at work is never a good experience. I learned to distrust people-co-workers(some of them). management needs a lot of improvement. (they don't care about their employees. Most of the co-workers are helpful and fun to work with. hardest part of the job is waking up in the morning and knowing you have to go to work there. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and interacting with the customers.
bad,I was fired for forgetting to clock out for lunch one time so i have nothing good to say about walmart
bad,If the customers don't annoy you then your co workers will definately do the job because no one where i worked ever smiled.
bad,My typical day at work would be stressful & it felt like i was in high school all over again. Overall the co-workers were okay but the managers where very unprofessional. The hardest part of my job was trying to work under such disgusting and unsanitary conditions and the most enjoyable part was the laughs I got from customers and co-workers. I believe walmart taught me how to have a lot of patientce.
bad,I worked there almost 6 years ago so i cant really give a good review.  It didnt feel like a job.  It kinda felt like me just talking to customers
bad,"doing customer service, you work very hard making things are done . you are given tasks by all types of managment all at one time so multi tasking is a big must. you are given tasks that have to be performed by a certain time. the best part of my job is making sure customers get the help and are happy with my customer service."
bad,"Working at walmart made me miserable because the people there treated me horribly, and I wasn't given any benefits, on top of being under paid."
bad,Just thank god you have a job. Get in and get out. Go to school and get a degree.
bad,"poor pay, bad treatment of employees, I just didn't like it at all"
bad,management at walmart isnt good... they dont care about antone.... and there open door doesnt work
bad,I was miserable at Walmart in my three years there. I would never work there again.
bad,what i enjoyed the most was working with the people that came in and some of my co-worker where nice and some of them where two face
bad,you may have good days and bad days the customers come first and they are always right. the hours are to late for single parents
bad,Management at any Walmart needs to be overhauled. A typical day at work involves dealing with the unfriendly staff and cranky customers.
bad,I do believe that some companies are meant to be stepping stones and lessons learned. This company was!
bad,"I was a seasonal cashier I don't know if it is just the Walmart I was at or all are like this but this one was a horrible employer to me. In another words if I ever go to hell I expect to wake up in a 24 hour Walmart kind of thing.  I don't know where to start but first I will start with the erratic schedule it's evening, nights one day early morning the next. I wasn't given at least seven breaks while I was there, it was always a mystery if I would get one or a lunch. I would often call for a manager for change while cashiering(for my drawer) and they would never come. In fact, at Walmart, if you need a manager for anything they will not come and you are left there with the customer to explain why. (you after a while will throw the management under the bus because realistically it's not your fault). You are never told anything, in fact it is your job to chase management down to figure out your schedule or to make changes to it even though it was someone else in Management who told you to work a certain shift. What ever happened to, if someone wanted you to work, scheduling for it? Also the store I worked at was a mess, things were always out of place, left thrown around and it seemed one out of four customers items were wrong up wrong. Oh and as a last present from this store, I guess as a Christmas present, they didn't bother to tell me when my last day was, they simply stopped scheduling me. Even though I worked every weekend for Walmart while I was there and even dressed up like Santa, far beyond my job description, Oh and didn't miss a single day."
bad,Wal Mart was a Job that I took while I was in college to support myself
bad,"Walmart has become the worst company to work for, they have eliminated store bonuses, raised health benefit rates, cut work hours and pay is terribly unjustified some workers receive more than those working in the company for several years. Also becoming management is a process of cat and mouse, growth in the company is how you kiss up. The company also does not care about the customers whatsoever."
bad,"Employees are treated very poorly, compensation for work is little to none. Advancement is nonexistent. Management does not know anything about a managers job. They are puppets  told what to do by upper management. If you ask any assistant a question, get an answer, ask another and get a completely different answer. Despite using Sam Walton's statement that our associates are our best idea makers, they do not want any feedback form their associates, they don't care. Co-workers are wonderful, and enjoyable to work with and most of the people who come in are fabulous."
bad,Everyone knows their employees work for slave labor in comparison to the pay. Minimum wage isn't what it used to be with inflation.
bad,worked lik a slave and paid less than nothing positive about this employer
bad,I don't Recommend Working for walmart Your Job will never be safe .....
bad,"Management is very bad. Most co-workers very professional and honest. Very high work load : 200-300 and over Rx for a shift."
bad,Walmart does not value their employees and management barely deals with the problems with the employees such as benefits and vacation days off. The customers were not bad to deal with but the job in general was not worth it for the pay and the stress that comes with it.
bad,"My main goal focused on customers and keeping them happy while processing their transactions and getting them through the lines quick and efficient. I learned how to handle difficult customers in stressful situations. Cope with standing for long periods at a time and keep a positive demeanor. The hardest was to keep a professional demeanor when dealing with difficult situations. But I kept professional. My co-workers were all team players, we tried to help each other out as much as we could. Management was awful, simple request took longer than expected. Especially when the store was short on employees."
bad,"I like working hard, but the lack of good management slowly took that away from me for this job. I liked my co-workers and having a different job task almost everyday I went to work."
bad,"lack of promised hours"
bad,"Walmart treats its employees like garbage and cut hours so that they dont have to give you any benefits at all. They fire people for any reason and then block your unemployment. There is no room for advancement since they fire or ""lay off"" people constantly so they do not have to pay them bonus at christmas time or so you cannot advance. The managers come to work, high or drunk and they dont get fired. The managers treat you badly and yell and give you lots of work that you possibly cannot complete in one shift."
bad,My days are very busy and fast paste everyday first thing is clean up my work aeras. help customers ordes idems were out of.take and make orders.unload trunk for the day.
bad,"No help from the loss prevention manger, the store manger wanted to run the lp department."
bad,A day of working in an unfair environment.  No beneficial help to depend on but it is a job.  Not enough hours to make a living.
bad,Big name company that only sees dollars not employees. Treats people as work horses instead of having respect for the individual and does not care about how you are doing and will just up and fire you if they feel you are not good enough.
bad,"Although I enjoyed working with other coworkers I found the time schedule very difficult to work with. In this position days and shift hours are never the same. This makes it very difficult to find a second job in order to supplement your lack of income. Walmart claims it has an ""open door"" policy that allows you to connect directly to the store manager. Unfortunately your concerns go unaddressed. Managers smoking while on the clock close to less than 5 foot from the building is more than common. The bale compactor that is extremely necessary is seldom available for use. Back doors to dumpster is kept locked with only management possessing a key. When Managers do not come to let the other employee out for 15-30 minutes in order for the employee to discard their expired products it takes a lot of time off the employees time to preform other tasks."
bad,"I like working with people, but this company does not pay enough."
bad,"some stores are alright, but other store can be very unfair and abusive to their employees"
bad,Wal mart is the worst place to work in my opinion. I worked for them for years till they fired me for getting hurt on the job.I opened the door to one of their trucks and a wall of boxes fell on me and when I turned it in they fired me
bad,"The cake decorating was great.  The policies, not so much.  The store was cliquish, and anyone who resented that attitude was an outcast (I was one of them, and we stuck together).  The management was very by the book, but unfortunately the book was written by higher ups who didn't even know there was any such thing as the working class.  The closer a store adhered to corporate policy, the higher their turnover rate tended to be.  People who didn't quit were often fired under false pretenses and petty disputes, and they had little to no chance for rebuttal.  Those who wished to stay with the company for the sake of simply being employed avoided being let go by frequently changing departments.  Giving encouragement to a coworker was considered against company policy.  Associates could be fired for as few as four small and completely unrelated mistakes."
bad,"Management was horrible, My co workers and customers was the only thing  I looked forward to when I came to work"
bad,"a typical working environment"
bad,I would pull freight out to floor and then stock shelves. I worked so hard at my job. they would let the young kids slack and us older people have to bend over backwards and when you end up hurting yourself there then they make excuses to get rid of you. The hardest part of my job was when they put me in grocery stock and I had to lift really heavy boxes with no help.
bad,"working customer service desk, money center doing money transfer around the US and other countries cashing checks post credit card payment and assisting customers as needed...Management worked well with us and allow me to train for other job within the store, all of my co-worker had fun working there we all got along great the hardest part was dealing with someone who would steal but for the most part we had loss prevention to deal with it.  I enjoy getting  the bonuses we would get for doing a great job."
bad,"I started out stocking shelves which was very hard work, but I enjoyed it.  I was moved up to cashier.  That position was tense.  Supervisors were watching over us at all times.  But when I was threatened by a customer for no reason, the store took the customers side and left me unprotected.  I had to call for someone to escort me to my car."
bad,Not a bad place to work if you don't mind working nights and weekends
bad,N/A - I met some amazing people who I worked with and who I served.
bad,Make sure store runs properly and associates and customers are being helped when needed. Work 12 - 15 hours a day with no appreciation. Lack of train for  the management or associates in the store. Hardest part of the job was giving them everything and getting nothing in return but when you have never been written up reprimanded for nothing they can just terminate you on a whim..
bad,Walmart essentially are responsible for helping to get the store prepared every night for the next morning's and day's customers.
bad,"My day at Walmart well night I worked 3rd shift, I learned many new things and how things are done at Walmart. My co-workers were really nice and respectful, my manger not so much she was mean all the time and really didn't know what was going on most of the time. The hardest part of the job was  pulling fright off the trucks because it was very heavy, The most enjoyable was when I was on break because I could relax and not have to stock anymore clothes."
bad,"This is an okay position if you are in between jobs.  The compensation is not that good for the work you do and there are no benefits in this position.  there is no job security or advancement and there are no management positions available and the culture is most Hispanic on the border in Yuma, Az."
bad,They want to work you full time but want you to actually be part time so they don't have to provide you with benefits!
bad,No one enjoys their job at Walmart. Anytime you go into that store everyone looks depressed or angry. It just wasn't a good environment.
bad,"hardworking, stocking, assist customers "
bad,"Cashier, Customer service, Job duties checking out customers, handling returns, money orders and money gram"
bad,This was the worst place I've ever worked at. Management was nowhere near professional or caring in any way and I was always getting harassed.
bad,Great Job learning experience especially during Holiday season. It will challenge you in many capacities.
bad,"I learned that the environment in a workplace can be at an extremely fast pase. The coworkers were really nice people, they helped me out to make the first day not so hard.  The hardest part was constantly having to complete different tasks at a moments notice.  I enjoyed the customers that i encountered."
bad,this walmart is in a bad spot people fighting all the inside and on the parking lot people shooting on the parking lot this is just a bad place to be at any time!!!!!!!
bad,"Management is rude and disrespectful to the customers and employments"
bad,people are just ignorant there. They dont know how to work. I end up doing all theyre work. they stand there and do nothing on phones and talking to each other.
bad,"My day began with tidying department, customer service, running the cash register and stocking shelves in an orderly manner."
bad,good part time job. work a lot for little pay. small pay raises.
bad,A typical day at work is helping customers and checking them out. Management is ok. It all depends on who you deal with. My co-workers are good people. The hardest part about this job is having open availability and not get schedule but 4 to 5 hours a day 5days a week. I just don't understand why they look for open availability but don't give you any hours.
bad,This was not a great place to work and was a stressful environment.
bad,"The atmosphere was not good , typical day is stocking, and changing tires"
bad,"pay was really low had to deal with rude people all the time and had bad management"
bad,"Organized stock and maintained sales floor merchandise areas clean and safe, provided excellent customer service."
bad,"Walmart is terrible. They the least but demand the most. Some staff are really great but mostly it's just a lot of gossip & back stabbing, management included."
bad,Would come in and start to clean well frankly the managers were rude they never say hi and inorge customers
bad,working there was the worst place i have ever work for.. they always said to us you can be replaced.... Not a very good way to make you feel comfortable.... stress was very high there... worring if u walk wrong you get in trouble .... my co workers were great.. management was the worst i have seen in a business ever.... the hardest part of the job was the whole thing... you couldnt be happy or else you were doing something wrong...  enjoyable part was clocking out...
bad,the managers at forest drive wal- mart did not think logically and were not professional. They seemed to think that people were robots and could do anything in horrible conditions
bad,I was not able to move up within the company.  Management was not concerned about employees future.  Company had a high turn-over rate.
bad,I would not recommend walmart to anyone. The management mistreats their employees. They dont clean the breakroom or refrigerators.
bad,It's not a company that I would recommend to anyone to work for..
bad,"Not a good place, find a job ANYWHERE but here!!"
bad,"It never seemed as if management cared for their employees.  Also, we were over worked for not enough pay."
bad,"Walmart is a JOKE! Literally, it's just a job, not anywhere near a career. I really don't have anything good to say about Walmart. If you want bad pay with no raises or ""promised"" bonuses, terrible hours, no room for advancement, managers and customers yelling at you every day all day, understaffing and expecting results...etc. DON'T WORK FOR WALMART!!! I don't even shop a Walmart after working there, just saying."
bad,I did not like working there. I had cut my finger on the meat slicer. It was deep enough I needed stiches. My boss rapped my finger put a bandad on it an said go back to work. He would not let me leave even wit bleeding every where. that is when I told him I quit an walked out.
bad,"serving customers, cooking take out food,cleaning"
bad,the compnay it awesome but you have to be able to handle stress
bad,no comment on any matters. I enjoyed working there. they used to be a very good company.
bad,This was one of the worst places to work. There was a lot of favoritism and management didn't care about its employees at all.
bad,"On a typical day I would go into the deli and work hard all day.  It did not matter how hard I worked or how many times I volunteered to stay over to help someone, they always were ungrateful and finding some way to get me into trouble.  I loved my job and the people I worked with, they made work fun.  I would have loved to have stayed there just to have the great relationships with the people in the deli."
bad,Management was a joke always walking around complaing. Not scheduling enough people and leaving the front under staffed and us CSM's to deal with all the angry customers
bad,"I hated this place the whole time I worked there, I was pregnant with my daughter at the time and they treated  me horribly"
bad,"typical day is busy, you a number of variety of people come in at different hours of the day"
bad,"Management is very cold and uncaring about there employes. They work you to death trying to do your job while trying to cover other positions they are to cheep to to schedule for or hire people for. Also it is a very unsafe environment, trying to find safety equipment is quite difficult. I as a bike assembler was trying to do my job assembling bikes in accordance with there own standards and management wanted me to just throw them together and put them on the floor unaligned and unadjusted, they don't even care if there is air in the tires."
bad,yet another predator employer... this company even goes as far as to maximize profit on those employees that die on the job! Enough said!
bad,"just wanted the day to end when I got there was not a fun workplace at all"
bad,"worked hard ,cut our benifits,not good pay, for the work i did!!!"
bad,"The most memorable times I have of this place are the days it would take management until 5 AM to realize that the person working in one of the busiest departments called in.  Management was disorganized, rude, miserable. "
bad,The work given doesn't amount to the money paid. Managers talk down to associates and its not a friendly environment
bad,It is a place to work if you do not wish to go to college and start a family
bad,"Im cursed with good work ethic. If you have good work ethic, do yourself a favor and don't work here."
bad,"A typical Day at work was a typical General Labor of work, you had to work at a very fast pace, management was ok as long as u met up to their standards and didn't get them trouble for unfinished work, co workers was friendly but really just minded their own business . the hardest part of the job was the pressure you had to finish stocking 5-8 pallets a night overall this job was an ok job for me."
bad,Wal-mart is a good job if you are one of them people that like people taking credit for your work and not give you any of the credit.  I feel that some of the management should take a class in communication.
bad,"Honestly, you could work at fast food, and you'd only be a step below this place. Their practices are near-criminal, and their leadership is horrid from the top down."
bad,"I liked the people, my coworkers were helpful. I enjoyed the customer service aspect of installing cell-phones. ( connections center )"
bad,"I hated working at Wal-Mart. A typical day at work consisted of me cleaning bathrooms and spills throughout the store, not only that but often they had me pushing carts and unloading trucks without the extra pay. I learned not to ever fill out another application to work at Wal-Mart. Management was poorly staffed and they weren't on one accord. I love working with my co-workers the best part of working there. There wasn't a hard part of my job. Getting off was the most enjoyable part of my job."
bad,"A typical work day consists of answering phone, taking care of the customer’s needs, stocking shelves and zoning departments. I learned better organization skills and how to locate items on the floor and in the back room. I also learned better communication skills. The managers of walk-mart are good but could learn to be a little more professional and bring their communication level up a little more. The hardest part of this job would be inventory. We all have to make sure everything is perfect for inspection. The most enjoyable part of my job would be taking care of the customers. If that mean answering the phone, helping them locate what they needs or answering question. I really enjoy helping others."
bad,A typical day at work was ok. I learned that working has its pros and cons you cant make everyone happy. Job was good overall pay wise. I think my biggest problem was immorality of co-workers and management the have their favorites in the company and no one wants to work together. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new customers getting to know them and being recognized as a good employee.
bad,"Very unprofessional, would never work for the company again."
bad,Helping customer with their accounts and credit card balance.
bad,"your often stopped on lunch and asked to assist a customer so of course you are ""off"" the clock"
bad,"I absolutely abhor my position at Walmart and the company as a whole. They are hypocritical, the management ""plays games"" with the staff, and all the focus is put on customer's money, with barely any focus on the staff. My recommendation: Don't do it. I work there and I am searching ferverently for a way out."
bad,"worst job of my life would not recommend this job to any one. the management is terrible ,the health car sucks and you are threatened daily with your job"
bad,"Working here for 2 years and not making $8."
bad,"Horrible place to work at, Wal-Mart does not care for their employees. To low pay for work you put in."
bad,This company went out of business. it was a horrible place to work with horrible customer service.
bad,"WalMart is the worst place to work in the world. Management makes up reasons to fire people. They fire people for making too much. Management also does not know how to do their jobs. The company is a racist, biast, sexist, and favoritist company."
bad,"Management was terrible, more often than not sitting in the back office, being lazy and doing nothing. Employees are typically not well taken care of. Sometimes, people have to manage multiple departments, which is an unnecessary responsibility"
bad,Assemble merchandise. There are no hours.  Management is below standard. The co-workers are good.  The hardest part of the job is working with a 30 to 32 hour work week.  Being the only assembler on staff is a hard part.  The most enjoyable part is serving the customer.
bad,"Terrible workplace bad management"
bad,Managers do not care. Other associates do not care. Worked like a slave for almost minimum wage.
bad,bad management very bad work hours along with  bad work ethics
bad,"Typically slow days accept for holidays.Managment is bad (very bad), co-workers are great, no hard parts of job mostly easy"
bad,"•Mediated conflicts between customers and/or employees "
bad,management tells you one thing then acts completely different. tells you the customer comes first then will fire you for going out of your way for the customer. the only way to stay there or advance is to kiss up to every one above you
bad,"A typical day a work includes getting yelled at for the slightest mistake you make, and being ridiculously punished for it. Having many tasks to do, and not having enough time to finish them and unrealistic tasks."
bad,"From my experience I, was not allow to use the OPEN DOOR POLICY. That the Company had put place long before I, was hired If I, was I, would of had my job and likely maybe to this date."
bad,A typical day would include pushing carts around in the parking lot for four hours. Management wanted no part of there employees  and co-workers wanted me to do all of the work then proceed to take the credit for it. The job was very mind numbing and there was nothing enjoyable about it.
bad,"Employees at Walmart are treated as temps which can be let go at any moments notice. Regardless of how hard you work and how much passion you put into your job. If applying to Walmart one should be ok with never being promoted, making very little, and being subject to constant criticism. Recommended only for those looking for a stepping stone in life."
bad,"going to work was like walking into slavery, I was worked like a dog and did not get paid half the money as the time I put into this company, management was terrible, hours, benefits and pay was ridiculous, leaving the job everyday was the most enjoyable part of the day"
bad,check out costumers and help them take thing ot their cars. magers and anyone in a hiring positon are rude and dont care if you get your lunch or not
bad,"Processed daily insurance claims, customer service interaction, and establishing postive relationship with customers"
bad,the work was back breaking which i didnt mind but they put every expendable employee on a pedistol that they're the lowest person there all while management verbally assaults you.
bad,Bad Experiences.Nothing good to talk about.Horrible team of leadership. You will fell the daily doses of extortion by your supervisors.
bad,it was a summer job i got paid. made me work 38 hours so they didnt have to pay me full tie wages.
bad,Don't waste your time working there. No raise for a year. No fulltime no benefits more work added as mgrs stand and watch u work. Mgrs do nothing but coffee .
bad,"I worked for Walmart 8 years altogether and was fired because of an injury on the job.  I tore my shoulder so badly I only have 60% use of it.  And they fought paying me unemployment because I could no longer preform my duties.  They have no family values, and make you feel like you can be easily replaced.  The management insults you in front of customers, and make you work with injuries.  I would not recommend this company to anyone."
bad,I was a cashier. i greeted customers. customer services helped when needed in other areas.
bad,Very nice company. I loved it so much. The customers are never rude they treat the managers with the upmost respect. The customers are so patient and friendly. The management staff are so well educated and we are love one another in a family way.
bad,"Overnight Stocker = 10 jobs and you only get paid $7.95 hourly. Bad Management, Good Teamwork though among other fellow Employees, but thats only because they are all fearing for their jobs. Managers Threatened me (us) that if we dont do what they ask, there are other people who will want our jobs. Unfair place to work.. It wouldn't be so bad if they raised their pay to employees, and trained their employees hands on more. Time limits for stocking is just stupid when you do not have any tools to help you stock like a ""First Phone"" "
bad,The reputation Walmart gets for mistreating its employees and being a poor place to work is well deserved.
bad,"I do believe they should follow policy and have schedules as stated off everyother weekend; personal days should be available for personal emergency such as: water pump, starter, dead battery.Please note my car was screached my walmart management, as well as my private residence. No one knows why they screached these private properties.  I am eligilbe for rehire . I do believe this rating should in all reality should be stopped until the activity of the staff is aligned with legal means. If they do not know any better it is time to help the manager and her team straighten up."
bad,I was an okay place to work.  The pay was good for the tasks you were expected to perform.
bad,A typical workday involved being on my feet for most of the day assisting a licensed pharmacist in the delivery of pharmaceutical services to the public.
bad,My day started meeting customers and sometimes at the front door greeting them as they entered the store. I learned how to operate the cash register by logging in. I learned how to count down my drawer. My co-workers were all very nice and understanding. The hardest part to me was being the only one left on the floor. The customers had to wait. I enjoyed meeting and greeting the customers.
bad,I really don't have nothing bad to say but all the money Wal-Mart make they could pay their employee more money.
bad,Management puts majority of the work on regular associates as wells as their on personal duties onto lower workers with no appreciation. Don't get paid enough to deal with people being disrespectful.
bad,"You do not have a life outside of Wal-Mart.  Management get called in on their days off.  Always work beyond your shift.  There is no job security.  It is all about profit at any cost.  They also do not care about their employees.  They like to make people think they are family oriented, but they are not."
bad,"Work long hours for little pay and little recognition"
bad,"Under paid, doing work that wasn't in my job title.Management had favorites."
bad,"The company is one of the largest employers in the world but, had to be sued to pay persons a decent wage and open doors for all to advance.  A really sad commentary."
bad,would not ask anyone to apply here. does not pay you enough for the things they make you do and deal with
bad,its walmart. treated like garbage for little pay. no holidays off. no bonuses. management untrained
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers & co-workers. The hardest part was the speed which management required you to work at. Co-workers are very friendly & most will help you from day one. It is a very management vs hourly kind of social set up. I learned that Walmart is a horrible place to work. A typical day involved carrying lots of heavy things around at rapid pace.
bad,this company is not family friendly and some of the management really sucks. they will change your hours without your promision. and do not care if you are sick.
bad,"I would go to work at night. I would be expected to do about 2-3 peoples jobs and not get paid for it. They would work me to death and expect everything to get done. If it didn't get done the hard workers would be the ones getting wrote up. When it was time to leave we would get told we cant leave until everything was done. So if you did your job and was done but someone else wasn't then you cant leave till they finish. It was always the same people who would keep us behind. Then we would get told we cant have overtime but yet you want to keep me over to do other peoples jobs on top of what I already did. "
bad,"no comment. I would not recommend it to anyone, they don't value their employees and customers and they only care about the money. they promote who ever sucks up the best and the pay is not that great"
bad,Not A Good Place To Work. No Breaks. No Advancement. The Management Does Not Work With The Employees.
bad,This job was so bad it was hard to get through the day. Management was always angry and mean. Payed very low and no one gave a rat about there job. All the customers would treat you like you were not human.
bad,A typical day of work begins with managers threatening to fire us for 45 or more minutes a day. Then you go and do really remediable tasks for 8 hours. Then you get yelled at and threatened to be fired constantly throughout the day. Then after a 2 weeks of working in this environment you get a pay check that is not even worth it. The only part I liked about working there were my co workers who suffered with me. Wal-Mart is just as bad as everyone says. Don't apply and stay away.
bad,"Fast pace, productive, and heavy labor."
bad,WalMart does not care about you and has the worst management I've ever worked around. I was very disappointed with the whole experience. My standards are a lot higher than there's will ever be.😊
bad,"the day you would be response for cleaning the bathrooms, cleaning the floor and handling the trash removal. cleaning up any spills knowing how each type of spill is handled.did waxing, washing floors, dustmop."
bad,"this place was horrible. Dont work for this Wal-Mart if you are in the San Antonio,TX area. The manager's dont care about you at all, and the worst manager's are the Customer Service Managers. They dont help you, they yell at you, and when you bring it up to their boss, YOU get yelled at. Just a terrible terrible place to work."
bad,"Normalmente a gente era jogado de setor em setor e quase nunca ficava no nosso, aprendi muitas coisas que antes não sabia, a direção era fraca e a gerência também, pois ambos não tinham controle e a confiança dos funcionários, eram pessoas simples e tranquilas, e gostavam de trabalhar ali, apesar de muita falta de respeito que ali tinha, a parte mais difícil do trabalho, era fazer o serviço do outros, pois a gente tinha que sair do nosso setor as pressas e ir pra um outro, pois as pessoas que ali se encontravam,  não gostavam do que faziam, as amizades sem dúvida, era a parte mais agradável ali fiz muitos amigos."
bad,"There are many things I would like to say about Wal-Mart, but nothing I believe would be beneficial to them nor myself..."
bad,"was a front end cashier"
bad,"I learned better customer service experience."
bad,"Be thankful if you never have to work at Walmart!"
bad,management they had some was good some was bad. you would pull freight out after doing what was on the truck and would look at you and say thats all you did...never happy
bad,Working at Walmart was ok There were fast paced days and slow paced days. I personal love it when i is busy
bad,"Worst company to work for ever. Poor management. Out dated equipment. Scheduling left a lot to be desired. There was no team effort. Everyone in survival mode. "
bad,"If you like working very hard for very little pay and being managed by many different managers, each with their own demands, that they expect accomplished at the same time, then this is the place for you."
bad,you are pretty much used  they don't care about you  or how you feel  to them you are just a slave  they over work you and get you in trouble for just stupid pettty little things.
bad,We are like family. Really good people.....Good culture & the enjoyable working environment has made production.
bad,"Too much to write about this employer. All was great in the beginning. There were excellent benefits, caring and supportive management. After 2010, things started to fall apart and now things are horrible. Read the recent news articles on how Walmart treat their employee...enough said!"
bad,work hard all night stocking the shelves and get told u could have done better no matter how much you do
bad,"the customers are horrible and rude, as the managers are. the wrong people get recognized. worst job EVER."
bad,"typical day at work was loading and unloading stock, filling shelves. Management was alright, not very friendly. co-workers were very nice and hard-working. hardest part of the job was leaving when I had reached 8 months pregnant. most enjoyable part was getting my paycheck."
bad,"A typical day would be getting there early, clocking on. Start doing other associates jobs until they got there. Once they are there you will finally start your job. Learned nothing that wasn't already known from previous jobs. Management is completely bias and unfriendly (as if they hate their life and job). Co-workers can be great depending on location. Hardest part of the job was being forced to do other co-workers jobs until they got there then having to stay late due to the managers bad time management since you were doing others jobs and not your own. Most enjoyable part once again would be the co-workers depending on location."
bad,"i held several positions there. i was a assembler, unloader, inventory control and stock clerk. i honestly don't remember much else it was a long time ago."
bad,Worked at the Albany Location Overnight. Management is very rude and disrespectful. They treat their employees like robots or race horses. Pay is not worth the stress you have to go through. Co Workers are usually people older than you who feel they have a sense of entitlement because they have been emplyed there for x amount of years. Reminds me of High School with the Drama Pettiness and fingerpointing. Unpleasant Environment overall. Worst job I have ever had. You also get paid every bi weekly.
bad,"I worked 4pm to 1am unloading trucks, and taking care of inventory"
bad,"They discriminate against people with disabilities, and make you take back your overtime by making you clock in later then when you were suppose to start then mark you late."
bad,This company has very bad work ethics. They do not care about you as an individual and only thinks about themselves.
bad,Not a good company at all. Does not care about employees. Only out for a profit. Lies to employees.
bad,"My job at Walmart was terrible at best. If an employee was injured, they were not helped and were expected to keep working. Many people were permanently damaged from this. I've lost count of the times I had severe nosebleeds and couldn't stop working. Employees could only miss three days before they were fired. I was not trained outside of watching computer videos. They were not willing to work around my life schedule. I worked overnight. The coworkers were unhelpful, as was the management. We had to request time off four weeks in advance, and they never gave anyone Saturdays or Sundays. The schedule was rotating and inconsistent."
bad,"Walmart is a great job, I love my job!"
bad,"Entrei se saber coisa alguma, e hoje sei um pouco de cada setor que passei, como por exemplo: Padaria e rotisseria. O lugar em si é bom de se trabalhar mais faltou bom gerenciamento em minha opinião."
bad,"I spent five years working in the backroom at Wal-Mart in Murray, dealing with impossible expectations and brutal conditions.  Gas leaks from the heating system were common.  Managers expected the impossible and demanded we violate safety rules to achieve it.  Finally I was fired over a trivial meal violation.  If I weren't expecting a second child, I would be grateful."
bad,this company is a nasty company to work for. I request to be put on ada family leave act. I was moving my disable wife and daughter across country be cause of their health. when I arrive at the new home that I have purcharse. the lender company and the closing on the house was canceled. because wal-mart fried me while i was on the road . this intrened ruint my credit score and made my faimly and I homeless. STAY AWAYFROM WALMART
bad,walmart is the worst possible place to work i dont even like to shop there im glad i am no longer employed there if i could give no stars i would
bad,"Enjoyed my time at Wal Mart Super Center in Daphne AL.  Very friendly staff and allowed for family emergencies when necessary."
bad,I just found that at Walmart there are a lot of promises made and broken. the pay is horrible and so are the hours.
bad,"A typical day at Walmart was like a day in prison.  Everyone there was so demoralized that they wouldn't even speak to most people.  Upon saying ""Good Morning"" to someone, they'd only reply with, ""hey.""  If you asked anyone how they were doing, the most common response was, ""I'm here."""
bad,Throwing heavy merchandise for 10 to 12 hours. The management was horrible and the goals to hard to reach.
bad,"my first 5 years were good, the next four took a turn for the worse.Doing the same work with half the staff so when things took longer the yelling and threats started."
bad,"This company was very hard to work for. Hours were never consistant, rude employees and supervisors."
bad,"The store runs on a skeleton crew and as a result all employees overworked. Expectations of each employee are beyond an average employee's capabilities. As a result all clothes racks unorganized, crowded and most clothing end up on the floor. Management disorganized, each give a order and another will change that order and give another in place. Wonderful co-workers but all feel the same about their positions. The most difficult part is too much for too few employees to accomplish. Management insult employees in front of customers."
bad,"You may have had a set job title, but it didn't matter, Walmart will put you where they need you so they don't have to hire more people.  The pathetic pay check you did get went right back into the store. At Walmart, you basically work for script."
bad,"Given a specific department, then told to go to another, then told to do your job in your department. Management and co-workers not very friendly."
bad,I will never work for walmart again. They work you like you are a slave and they have no compassion when it comes to your health or the health and welfare of your family.
bad,Employees are the lowest link on the food chain and are reminded of it daily with low wages and too few hours to even balance the low wages.
bad,I really was desperate for income.  Only worked here for 6 months. Moved on to bigger and better things after 6 months.
bad,"I worked for wal-mart and the managment at the store i worked was rude, unreliable, non trained and had no customer service skills at all. I would like to see the employees treated with more respect. the zms and css should recieve more help from managment when wal-mart will not allow any more employees to be hired, and they take the associates out of their areas to do jobs they have no idea how to do. Anyways just my opinion, I hope someone will crack down or go under cover to each store and see how it is really run. managment is the first thing that needs to be checked."
bad,"The management is horrible, You can not advance unless you kiss up, customers are rude, co workers are very stuck up. It is very hard to get along with people here and make friends. No one is excepting of new comers."
bad,Hate the company. Crooks in every way possible. Thats all I have to say about it.
bad,"Wal-Mart has to be one of the worst places for employment.  I started working there as a cart pusher and not only did I have to push carts I also had to do maintenances job and had to work in the bottle room.  I was only paid minimum wage but I had to be in so many places at one time.  And had so many tasks that were part of the job.  I would be gathering carts out in the parking lot and I would get called inside to fix the bottle machines or take out the garbage or assist customers with carry outs. Most of the time we would be working by ourselves.  The managers there had unrealistic expectations for us.  They wanted us to do so many tasks and still have the parking lot clean and the cart area full of carts. "
bad,I hate working for these people. Management is very lazy and messy. The up side are the customers are very friendl
bad,Basically keeping the job site moving forward with different projects each day.
bad,"dealing with cranky cuastomers for minimum wage"
bad,Did not work with you with any illness. Were completely biased against the employees that actually worked.
bad,"not enjoyable, just horrible, no structure, lazyness, rude management, etc."
bad,It's just a job that is all a dead beat job!!!!!!! to be a manager here it takes years. I wasted three years of my life here before I finally realized I needed to go back to school. I was on nights and they wouldn't help me switch to days so I could go back to school. So I quit. I flat out just quit and I walked out one night. Greatest feeling in the world. If they had helped me to switch to days I wouldn't be saying this and I'd still be there I guess. It's just like any retail job good for college students.
bad,"Walmart sucks! Never work for walmart! If you want to work for a junk company, apply here! The management is out for themselves to make sure they keep their jobs, they don't care about you!"
bad,i was 4 months pregnant and got fired because i missed more than 7 days due to have open surgery even with a doctors note
bad,"In the Walmart orientation, it touted Open Door Policy, it touted ethical treatment to all, it stated everyone starts out the same...it gave a 90 day probationary period, which was raised to 120 days, and then to 180 days...without notifying any associate in that category.  The work is very hard, demanding, physical, proper attire was not provided. i.e. freezer duty was a daily and integral part of the job, no gloves, no coats, no protective wear was given.  Brought my own, and it was stolen."
bad,"My typical day at work includes processing returned merchandise, stocking freight, interacting with other associates to manage ourselves, cleaning and organizing sales floor, and help customers with their questions and concerns.  In my department management is rarely available so my co-workers and I assess the demands and delegate ourselves accordingly.  Some of my co-workers are hard workers while others see the job more as social time.  The hardest part of my job only occurs when there are not enough associates working and I have to take on more work but I manage.  The easiest and most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers."
bad,"I learned how NOT to treat employees."
bad,"in the 3 years that I worked for walmart  I was constantly under a lot of pressure. they have terrible organization and poor customer service. I was the only technician out of 8 who actually knew what they were doing, but was not given  a lead position or even a raise. I spent my days correcting other people's mistakes and apologizing to customers for long wait times and medications unavailability. I cannot count how many technicians I trained in 3 years that quit because of the bad working environment. I don not recommend working for walmart especially the Fairfield,ca location. the store manager PETER DANOFF yells at his employees like they are his children at the top of his lungs and belittles them until they believe that they are no good and cant do anything else."
bad,"This is the Walmart on Mooney. They give you 4 hours a week, the managers don't know what is going on at any given time. They don't listen to your ideas or opinions and require that you work off the clock. Don't get hurt on the job, or you will be fired."
bad,"A typical day for me at Walmart is being blamed for anything not done by other associates during their shift, to make room for skids in the back room without pulling to the floor or having any space in the back room to put them, I work on one shift but am responsible for the entire store."
bad,"This was a job out of necessity. The culture, the environment and overall energy of the store was quite depressing. I would not recommend this as a place of employment for anyone."
bad,employees friendly easy to get along with open 24/7 only closes for Christmas.
bad,The job was a good one. I had to learn to move quick. It made me be a more outgoing person
bad,I have nothing good to say about walmart at this time. Maybe in a couple of years.
bad,we were slaves in this company. The management are drill sargents. They only cared about themselves
bad,less than $8 an hourly & they work you like a slave. the managers are very incompetent.
bad,"-Provide excellent customer service to the walmart customers and employees"
bad,Although I enjoy working with the customers of Walmart it is very hard work and Walmart does not pay enough to survive.
bad,Management show favortism and only show support to the favored few. Discrimination is a daily occurence. Most management have low morals and no integrity. I was lied to several times during my 6 year career at walmart. Promotions are few and far between if you don't kiss butt. Co-workers are usually dishonest and only out for themselves but in their defense this is the only way to survive with this company. I would not recommend this company to any one. I wasted six years of my life and I am the only one to blame for this.
bad,"no appreciation for what is done, you could break your back doing things they never asked you to do that you see needs to be done and they'll say ok now i want you to do this...no such acknowledgement or even a good job.  No time for a social life with this job, compensation is a joke here, job security is terrible treating all associates like a dime a dozen, and they don't hold on to their company's values even heard a lot of customer complaints that this company no longer appreciates its patrons.  Would never recommend anyone to work for this company!"
bad,"Horrible treatment by management to associates. They degrade, humiliate and belittle the associates in front of other associates and customers.  They overwork ( with unrealistic expectations DAILY) their associates..Rude to customers also. The store manager is an absolute nightmare! She's dishonest and doesn't even conceal her disdain for her associates. I'm a people person for consumers and associates, so this was not the place for me!!"
bad,had no concern on whether i needed to get off work to get my children only worried about the bottom dollar
bad,I enjoyed this job especially during Christmas time the people and my associates. I would checked more boxes at top but couldn't click on them
bad,"Management will lie to save their jobs. They harass employees to get them to quit. Management will also go in and change schedules without notice, or schedule you a day that you have stated you cannot work without prior request. When you get injured and it is another employees fault they will do everything they can to make sure you get as little as possible. They will starve you out to get you to settle."
bad,"low pay, untrained management, "
bad,Erratic schedules and hour reductions as well a pay deductions or benefit modifications frequently.
bad,"no one knew what was going on from 1 day to the next, manager was not a people person in any form"
bad,"They hire everyone part time and temporary, so there is no benefits and you can get terminated at any time for any reason. The hours have to be flexible. Which means you can get off at 11 at night and have to be back at 6am. Other than that it was a decent job,"
bad,Always busy so your day goes by fast but you also have angry customers all day long. You get used by management but they will not promote because they do not want to pay
bad,"Spend my days moving stuff around the store. Transfering departments and making the store a super center. I learned how to tear things down and put things back up, how to read sku,and how to put thinks in there right place. Management did not know what they were doing most of the time. We would start a project get somwhat threw it and get pulled away. My co-works made clicks and if u were not part of them u get treated badly. I enjoyed learning how hard it is to change a store. The hardest part of my job was moving things that were big and the way they made us do it was unsafe."
bad,this was not an enjoyable company to work for. Management walked around with their noses in the air treating their employees like bottom feeders. their open door policy was a joke.
bad,"You go to work , check your tasks for the day , Go to your assigned area, start working in that area, Then you are called to do a thing called 5 alive from 2:30- 4:00pm. Plus you have to zone other depts while your doing your dept ,plus try to give good customer service. This was the hardest part of the job Trying to get all your tasks done which could be as many as five . make sure every dept you worked in was zoned 100% and all returns put away, plus be called up to run regiter when the lines got long. Or cover the phones in the fitting room because there wasn't enough people scheduled to cover breaks and lunches.The most enjoyable part of my job was when you could make a customer happy. Or when a customer comes in and says oh i'm so glad your here now maybe I can get what I want.My coworkers there were a very few that where team orinated. There were more grumbliers and complainers. , plus the ones that spend more time talking about everyone else, brown nosing. Team work is in my book everyone work as a team to get the job done."
bad,"Long hours, required un paid breaks and meal periods are just to add the amount of time you have to stay."
bad,Walmart doesn't care about their associates and the pay sucks...walmart is a billion dollar company and they start off with 7.25hr and you have to work 90 days before you can get the discount what type of mess is that and you have to be with the company 2 years before you can get a vacation smdh...
bad,I did not enjoy this job at all. The management was horrible. They were rude and very unprofessional.
bad,"Essa empresa abre as portas, oportunizando que quem está fora do mercado possa nele inserir-se novamente, mas peca na valorização da mão-de-obra, no quesito que diz respeito a ater-se as reais necessidades dos funcionários ou em tudo aquilo que se faz necessário, aquém a vontade e iniciativa pessoal, para se obter bons resultados e otimizar o trabalho. São muito poucas as promoções e os salários são baixos. Você trabalha muito e recebe pouco e ninguém parece muito preocupado com isso, o que justifica a grande rotatividade de funcionários dentro da empresa. Você faz hora extra a pedido de seu superior, que não lhe são pagas, mas revertidas em folga ou dispensa, quando ele julgar bom para ele."
bad,"fun working overnight, the staff is completely rude but the customers are so much worse"
bad,"Wal-Mart is awful. Managers that don't know whether they're coming or going. Starting pay below minimum wage. Benefits that you can't afford and that no doctors will take. Working 7 nights a week, yet somehow no overtime, and being wrote up and disciplined if you go over your 40 hours by one minute. The only way to become a manager is to suck up to the store manager with all the might you can muster. You also have to kiss butt for the $.55 raise, which only 30 out 598 people receive."
bad,"Walmart will work you to the bone. I worked third shift at the oak ridge walmart"
bad,"Avoid if possible, but feed your kids if you need to do it.  Job is a waste, did have a great experiece"
bad,Walmart could care less about their employees... You're only as good as that moments sweat... Store manager was upset and could not be bothered with an employee having a heart attack
bad,"I did almost four years with Walmart and i can tell you from experience they do not value any employee (even managers) only the bottom end. It is really a shame they do not value the hard working employees over the lazy ones, I seen it over and over where they promote the person who is not best for the position but the one who can be controlled in that position the easiest. I also have seen managers with many many years experience canned for the littlest infractions. I am not bitter about Walmart at all - its just a job, I am trying to fore warn any one thinking about working for them to really weigh all your options. The managers for the most part we easy to get along with and I had no bad experiences dealing with them. You cannot work another job along with Walmart also they want to control you to flip your schedule around, they want to pretty much own you. This is from experience on my part, I now work at Lowes and they would not work with me just to work mornings at Walmart. As I am part time at Lowes."
bad,you could not drag me to work back at that place and do not recomend it to anyone
bad,hated working for walmart not enough hours nor pay. they are a horrible place to work for.
bad,operating the cash register and providing outstanding customer service.
bad,This company is horrible. In worked here for 4 years and still got treated so badly as well as other employees. I stuck it through because of school.
bad,I hated how little value I was to the company after all the long hours and hard work put into the job.
bad,Only worked here for a month or so. I only worked on the cash register than before my shift was up I worked as a people greeter.  I really didn't get to know my coworkers.
bad,"Worked overnight shift"
bad,"deal with rude customers, fill prescriptions, input prescription, customer service"
bad,Working for Walmart was not a good experience for me. At first everything went well but as time went on it turned into the worst job that I have ever had in my life. The store manager was very racist and treated me differently because of the color of my skin along with all of the employees. I really hated that because I knew that I was a hard worker and that I had potential to grow with this company but I never got the chance to because the manager laid me off. 
bad,if the management wasnt great that means the staff was in a terrible place
bad,I had the worst working experience when I worked at wal mart. 
bad,"great enviroment for first job employees"
bad,"Not satisified with company. Poor work hours, Poor management. Unfair disapline. "
bad, I hated how my managers had so little regard for the lives of their employees. I was fired because i refused to come to work when i was scheduled to be class. Something that management knew about but refused to rectify. Nothing else left to say.
bad,"learn to change tires "
bad,I would love to work with this company as a sales associate morning shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was working.
bad,"Wost job ever. "
bad,A typical day at work was very disorganized. Management did not communicate well with lower lower workers. Co-workers would constantly call out or just not show up to work. They have a rule that you can not work more then 40 hours a week and with the team calling out forced some workers to go over 40 and they would get written up. 
bad,"Not a place I would ever recommend to any one that has an upbeat personality, outgoing, and very friendly and dependable. They treat their employees like they are beneath everyone who is higher up in the work chain."
bad,Management does not really care about anybody but themselves. They use people under them to make them look good. 
bad,Worse company ever. Warehouse work....self explanatory. I learned to never work in that type environment again. Management was a joke. They played favoritism way too much. Co workers were two faced. The hardest part? You keep  your job by making quotas. If you don't make 100% you have NO job. There was not one thing enjoyable about that job
bad,"A typical work day in Walmart in Hoover is torture. I was hired to work as a cashier in the garden center, I did that plus anything else that needed to be done. I spend so many months being pulled off my register to work in the toys department, where I was talked down to, yelled at like a child and just completely disrespected. The managers don't like to give you breaks and they will find you during your breaks and ask you about work assignments. If they know you made a friend in the store, they try their hardest to seperate you. They dont allow you to move up to full-time and the pay is kept right at minimum wage. There were plenty of days where I had no breaks and I had to beg for a lunch. You'll spend forever moving items to a place one day and putting them back the next. It is unorganized and has no order. Worst job ever, God willing I would never ever reapply."
bad,Had some great coworkers but overall the Wal-Mart experience was about everything I had heard it would be and not for the better.
bad,Looking for a new job due to the complete lack of company ethics and have nothing further to say about this workplace. 
bad,It must have just been the area and the time of year I worked there but I hated it. All the customers were nasty and disrespectful. It was always busy.  The supervisor was always moody and the shifts were 9 hours long midday so I felt as if i had no social life. 
bad,"um dia normal, aprende muito principalmente escutar muito antes de falar, em relação a direção, gerência precisam entrar mas em acordo acima de tudo, apesar das dificuldades do dia a dia estávamos sempre tentando viver em harmonia,a parte mas difícil ter que aceitar certas regras que sabíamos que não dar certo, e não ter bons recursos para trabalhar, quando nos reconhecíamos profissionalmente. "
bad,"very bad, never liked, pay was terrible. I quit after a few months."
bad,"Walmart is unstable. It would be good as an extra job but not for your main source of income. my hours range from 15 - 38, guess I average 20. Hard to create a budget to live by. They use their employees and are spiteful. If you are sick or need to request a day off, the next work schedule, your hours are dropped."
bad,"-Bad management"
bad,"a typical day at Wal Mart was very crazy, I was always being yelled at by customers, which is very understandable.  I did learn how to use a register.  My management was very confusing they all said something different how they wanted it done,I got a long well with my co workers,  I actually met my husband there, he worked out side a part of the security,  So I am glad I worked there even though it was not a very happy work place,"
bad,Management was horrible. The store manager has no clue of what he is doing.  A lot of us complained about other employees and their uncleanliness and nothing was done.  The only thing I enjoyed was that I worked by myself.  I went from part time  deli/bakery associate to head baker with no raise.  I just couldnt believe how dirty it would be and the managers and supervisors too scared to confront the ones who were the problem.  Cowards.
bad,You where many hats at this place! Your hard work goes unnoticed. Some co-workers are for you and others are against you. 
bad,"Long standing hours, one person expected to do the job of 10 people, little suport from management"
bad,a typical day at walmart consisted of pulling freight to salesfloor and packing out shelves.i learned to always work with a sense of urgency.not much to say about management. very good group of co workers the hardest part of the job was a night with extra trucks of freight.most enjoyable part of the job was the teamwork.
bad,The most enjoyable part of this job is the people you may meet and the flexibility.
bad,"The management at Wal-mart care nothing for the employees. The internet schedule and the hard copy has discrepancies and to top it off they promise promotion, but look for ways to take you down.  "
bad,"most days were uneventful,but there was days where you had to stay on your best to make a apprehention .I enjoyed working with my team they gave me a lot of good skills to use.the hardest part of my job was when parents of small kids were shoplifting.most enjoyable was stopping someone with large theft."
bad,"Poor place to work. Management very unfriendly. Customers are VERY unfriendly and disrespectful. "
bad,i was 3months pregnanut as a cashier and they treid to make me go outside with no jacket on and push carts in 2 feet of snow.
bad,"The management of the Wal-Mart that I worked at was the most disrespectful group of people I have ever seen.  My job was to just stand there and greet people.   When the security alarm went off, we were not allowed to stop the person to investigate the reason for the alarm going off."
bad,It was great at first then management changed had CSM sitting on her but and letting someone who is not management run things and treat people bad. Hire up management didn't care about me or what was going on with my family 
bad,very scatterbrain place to work for people don't know how to run a buiness
bad,"The company does not care about the employee, the management is more worried about having sex in the office, and the work is given out unreasonably."
bad,"assist customer promptly, fast & accurate on the register, shifts vary from time to time"
bad,I didnt like working here employees were unprofesssional and i had a very uncomfortable situation that arised while working here
bad,stocked shelves helped customers cleaned up store .nice co workers managers were okay
bad,The Walmart I worked at only hired young black kids and now I understand why because they don't realize their working for nothing. Walmart treats their employees like dirt and will replace you with the next urban 17 year old looking for a job if you stand up for what you believe in. 
bad,"It was hard to take time off, managers always threatened positions. no way to move up with the company. The were not considerate of family priorities."
bad,They are terrible and nothing is every the way that it is supposed to be. Favoritism is big there and they don't pay well. Also benefits are a joke. And they won't work with you on scheduling. 
bad,"the hours were horrible,  the pay was horrible, there were no benefit that were affordable,  individuals that couldn't cut it else where have been put in management positions who so clearly shouldn't be there.."
bad,"speak up about anything and expect punishment. very inflexible, Don't expect to get hours if you have a limited availability. Autocratic system and dictatorship. Inconsistent policy, back lashing for trying to stand up for your person. Doesn't value or respect individuals. "
bad,"The turnover is horrible, management is included. Communication is non existent. People have said that they are told to finish something then work the overtime that should be given off on a later day. Sometimes its not even full time hours and they still have to work it off. Customers have never been a problem, going out of the way is what needs to be done. The store has been going down a slope, anyone that has ever left is relieved to be working somewhere new. "
bad,"It's walmart. You can't expect it to be amazing. Allthough, the pay was pretty decent."
bad,Worked in one of the most Ghetto walmarts in milwaukee. fights everyday. kids running crazy. smells of all type of odors
bad,I really loved my job and liked working here but the management were mean and rude. 
bad,i was a manager for them for 7 years and the whole time i was there they never really could get there act together just wasent for me
bad,"Worked with 15-20 cashiers a day. Schedule breaks,lunches,etc. Made sure that customers were well taken care of."
bad,If you don't want to get off public assistance it is a good place to work. Advancement to full time is not happening.
bad,Worked there for a few months. Got fired over keys going missing. Found out from a friend that I was fired cause I made more money than my supervisor. Need I say more.
bad,I feel that is place to start if you are just entering the work field. I worked in the freezer and you had to dress warm. The co-workers were a little cliquish. The hardest part was being in the freezer all day.
bad,"uma enpresa muito boa de trabalha não tenho do q reclama."
bad,"Very stressful day management putting to many task for the employees to do."
bad,The management was insensitive to its employees needs and rude. The associates talked about each other and were very rude. It was like high school but worse. 
bad,"bad compny dont work there ever, managers are still in a mental state high school"
bad,"not worth the stress and low pay at the end of the day "
bad,a typical day at work nothing interesting just do the work they assign you. I learned how to pace my self to work really fast and safe. my coworkers were all great loved every one. the hardest part working when your really under the weather and no one cares for your health. 
bad,"steady work flow, nice lunch breaks.Not enough employee recognition, lack of employee knowledge."
bad,"I did every job from inventory control to cashier, I learned a lot and took much from the company, but I did not like the environment."
bad,I worked here during the time of 9/11.I loved the fact that you were given an extra dollar to work on Sunday.
bad,the managers are not friendly at all and are very money oriented 
bad,"no one ever knew where there position was, managers were nowhere to be found"
bad,I loved that this was a fast paced environment but it was not organized at all. I learned that I could not ask for help everything had to be done by your own knowledge. I tired to advance to a manger position but I was overlooked because the managers only advanced people they knew.
bad,"I was a cashier and was told I had to be 18 to be a CSM, which is understandable. Turns out, I didn't have to be 18, the front end manager was just biased against 16-17 year olds. When I finally did turn 18, I applied and took the test to be a CSM and was told I wasn't qualified even though I passed the test with flying colors and had been with the company for almost 2 years. It also took 6 months of asking and proving I was capable before I was able to learn the service desk and money center."
bad,Short hours and hard work. I love some of my co workers. Always was a team player and enjoy being a cashier.
bad,"Don't work at walmart, it sucks! They love coach associates and managers out the door!"
bad,"Management team terrible, no work ethic, no concern for the associates, breaks and lunches were always late"
bad,Worst company to work for. Never appreciated people who worked there. 
bad,"Many times, the management staff here excused problems that employees created because the managers often developed personal relationships with their employees. I was sent to lunch not two hours after starting the day, so others could go to lunch when they wanted to. "
bad,Customers bombarded and not enough workers to present effective customer services. Business management and the management staff are lazy and doesn't wanted to do their Job. Very great people with great work ethic. Dealing with Associates complaints and Mostly is customer services and enjoying the moment with customers.
bad,"This rotten company should be ousted out of Canada , and the US , shame on them for there method of doing things and their poor treatment of their employees"
bad,the prices are great however the company isn't the best to work for as a college student.
bad,"Don't waste your time working "
bad,"Just a bad place to work at, grant it they did offer us free food from time to time. However, management sucked so bad and the hours were non-existent. I hated working there so much that i called in a bunch of times in hopes of getting fired. But I ended up leaving, and now have a better job, the only good thing Walmart did for me is give me experience... I would never go back. "
bad,"Working at Walmart was not a bad experience, I enjoyed my coworkers and superiors. I worked directly with customers and was always on time and stayed late if necessary. "
bad,"I Clock in; called to register because there are not enough cashiers, customers stop you wanting to know where things are in the store and can you find them something or show them where it is and then a member of management comes along and reprimands you because your work is not done in your department. Management tells you that to go on break you must find someone to watch your department for you and then find a manager and tell them you are going on break or lunch and there is no telling where they are located at.  Then an assistant manager tells you that you are not doing things the Wal-mart way, they tell you they are going to write you up, that you are not telling the truth and it is very stressful. Not all of the managers are that way but the majority are. Then there is the equipment, it takes a couple of minutes to measure, cut and fold a yard of cloth but it can take up to 30 minutes to print a ticket for the item because the scanner can't find the printer. I have learned that management feel they have to bully people to get the work done, my co-workers are just as stressed as I am and the hardest part of my job is not knowing what I will be doing once I slide my time card and clock in. Cleaning, stocking, zoning or cashiering or zoning some other department. There is no structure, and not enough employees for the work load. The most enjoyable part of my job is when someone(customer) says thank you for helping me and it makes it a little more bearable to come back on my next shift and do it all over again."
bad,"My tipical day at walmart was to do a complite zone check, witch it involved to check my area very good and it was to be very clean at all times. Also it involved to do what the manager did not get to do. Like inventory in the wearhouse and doing some vining witch is to but the item that did not fit in the sales floor. Also my dutie was to do sales, and what I sold in the store were fishing Lic and ammunition.It was fun to work with my co-workers because we always had each others back. Like when I needed to go to break they had my back and when they needed to go too, they counter on me."
bad,was great cashier at wal mart store and always smile to customer...kept the drawer balance and met production!
bad,"horrible company with a horrible management team. very demeaning, and treated everyone like dogs."
bad,"It is a fast pace job and your busy days go by quickly but on slow days it drags on. Management team that i have delt with are rude, and wont help you with things unless you take action yourself... The people that you work with are great! "
bad,"It is what it is."
bad,I enjoyed working with the public.The hardest part of my job was we were going threw management changes a lot witch made hard at times.
bad,wanted to try this and left when I found a better job. I was a department manager and stocker and truck unloader
bad,"nothing to say.prefer to keep it to myself!just a job!!!!"
bad,I was injured on the job and management didn't even care. Had to go against my doctors orders to do my job. Management didn't care about how much pain I was in all they wanted was job done. Management also had a stuck up attitude that I'm better than you. Don't work for walmart!
bad,You can not move up or achive over time working at walmart I do not kn ow what else to say its pretty self explanitory
bad,The worker were rude and lazy. A very dirty work place(mice). Manager are never around where you need them.
bad,A lot of overtime  temporary employment not much else to say. Not gaurnteed rehire after  picking season over
bad,"Unorganized "
bad,Management will use your team as a scapegoat if something doesn't go there way.
bad,I grew up around Wal-mart in the south and it is a lot different here in the North.  You go through orienation being told it a family admosphere and customers come first but reality is NO.. work get the job done don't talk to your co-workers and just do what the give you or tell you.  One manager from a different shift will tell you to complete a module one way then the next shift manger will tell you to change it only to have a Co-manager tell you to go back to the first way you completed the task... Would never recommend anyone to take it unless they lived in the Southern states... there treated with respect.
bad,Never worked around school schedule and kept avoiding me when I would ask about changing my hours.
bad,I worked at Walmart as a cashier....at first it was good I started off as just a temp for holidays and became permanent afterwards...but after I became permanent I realized that management really didn't care about their employees they always favored certain ones...I had customers constantly complaining about products not being found or lack of products so I stopped asking if they found everything because it was obvious they didn't... I would just tell them to go to customer service and file a complaint....but when I was told I could have a permanent position they promised me a better position better pay did I get it? No....it was given to someone else...the only reason I took the job
bad,"It was an okay place to work, management really was to appreciative or supportive of their empolyees. They showed no compassion towards their workers. They were not willing to work around school schedules,and family life. The most enjoyable moment for me was working as a cashier and meeting new customers and opening me up to a whole new experience for my first time in customer service. "
bad,"As a customer service associate, the duties varied. Those included cash handling, sending wire transfers through MoneyGram, assisting customer during check out services, handling customer store complaints, and also restocking shelves."
bad,"hated working for them because it was a poorly ran company"
bad,A typical day at work is stressful you work in any department they tell you to work in and get told to do to many things by to many people management is always telling to work fast or ask if you are done yet every time they walk past you I have learned to many different things from working at Walmart. My co-workers are fun to be around sometimes.The most enjoyable part of this job is making sure the customers is pleased.
bad,"A typical day was 6 hour shift, baking, stocking, helping customers and other associates. I learned alot about baking and techniques. Management was terrible, you ask for more hours and eligibility for full time and they cut your hours even more. co-workers were great people, other associates were fine for the most part. The hardest part of the job was going to work knowing you weren't gonna get to support your family come payday. The most enjoyable part was still being able to help customers, and other associates. It is great to work as a team with such great people."
bad,"Customers come in hating you, before you say a single word.  Management is terrible and there is no room to advance."
bad,Bad management that drags everything down. Ridiculous demands for work hours. working full times hours while being registered as part time. Told to leave school hours early to go to work.  
bad,"Not a whole lot to say. Management sucked, no room for advancement and they are very vindictive."
bad,I assisted customers with their purchases. it was agreat place to meet new people.  enjoyed working there. i helped me build my customer service skillls.
bad,"- You get two faced by the managers.  They're nice to your face but talk crazy behind your back."
bad,Poor company to work within. Management is rude and disrespectful. Advancement opportunities com far and few in between.
bad,A typical day at walmart was very annoying. It was very unorganized and unprofessional where managment was concerned. Very unfair to workers.
bad,"as pessoa q entram para trabalhar, saem com depressão, chefes de setores não compreendem os problemas das pessoas, eles querem que as pessoa vão trabalhar doentes, fora q tem q trabalhar de domingo a domingo sem ganhar hora extra."
bad,Typical day at work consisted of angry customers yell and screaming and saying things that offends different races. I learned never to work for walmart again. The management was soooo unorganized and there was so many micro managers we never knew who we should listen to. The big managers never did anything they basic got paid to just come and have fun with there buddies all the time . We never saw the store manager doing anything. The hardest part was going there and the most enjoyable part was my coworkers I loved them.well most of them
bad,"management is awful ....treated poorly  ,,,,,no respect for  you or your needs .  not a family oriented work place . poor pay and long hours"
bad,"A typical day at work would have me coming in bagging or laying out bread to be baked. What i have learned from this job is that all of Wal-Mart's bakery items come in frozen. I did not know that. I thought I would be kneading dough all day. My department manager is really nice and always helps out when there is work that needs to be done. She is also very understanding and a great person to talk to. My co-workers are awesome, part of the reason being because it is such a laid back-but work hard atmosphere. The hardest part of my job is smelling the bread. As silly as it may sound the smell makes me nauseous, and sometimes I can not take it because it literally makes me sick. On the other hand, the part I love most about my job is when I am able to let my creative juices flow and decorate some cakes, because I think I am pretty good at it. "
bad,work day was hard and management was very disrespectful and the co-workers was back stabber's and they work you for little to nothing a what was enjoyable nothing.  
bad," A typical work day at this particular store would include management speaking to the ones he/she likes rather than speaking to everyone. The associates however are friendly and very considerate. I learned a few things working at Walmart, being below management means you don't have a voice and you will have to do what management tells you in order to keep your underpaying job. Moving up in the company would mean to bow down and tell on each other to get ahead. And also, working as a team can mean doing all the work and ""the favorites"" reap the benefits. My co-workers can be just as crude as the management team, overall my co-workers seem to realize we're all in the same boat. The hardest part of the job would be to consistantly deal with management not providing everyone with professionalism roles and treating everyone equally. The most enjoyable part of this job, is most of its customers were very supportive and understanding."
bad,"They are a horrible company to work for. They demand a lot out of their staff even when short staffed. Management can care less about the work load, they always say ""Get it done!"""
bad,They don't get the low prices by investing in employees. You have heard the stories. Most are true and the extreme ones are usually isolated but still happened. 
bad,"Walmart is probably the most heineous place to work.  They screw you over on your hours, give no over time, and their benefits suck."
bad,Walmart places company profit over the value of the hard working people who made them rich.
bad,"I was with Walmart almost two years.  I'm a HONEST person...and a team player.  When I saw employees stealing company time, merchandise, talking on cell phones/texting at the register I knew enough was enough.  I mentioned it to management, nothen was done about it.  I went to above and they told me to basically mind my own biz.  They said let them do what they want to do.  I was so upset.  Therefor I quit."
bad,"Hated being a manager at for this place, you had no life because they overload you with work that is impossible to complete so you are there 15-16 hours a day only one day off.  You are expected to come in on your days off sometimes, I've learned that management is where i wanted to be after working for walmart, but in the human resources department. I enjoyed being needed by the employees and helping them evolve and helping the customers when they are upset. "
bad,That is a joke they didn't care if you had kids or that fact that you had no help nor the fat that you have had experience and yet still get passed up for a position. Another place that just wants bodies on the floor not caring if the person knows anything.
bad,"All department managers would leave their departments and get together as a group to fill produce, pantry shelves, dairy counters, etc... When we were finished, we would go do our counts, price changes, order merchandise, fill our stock, help customers, etc.... "
bad,"Very difficult to take time off for breaks or lunch due to inadequate number of staff."
bad,"very busy answering phones"
bad,my typical day at work was assisting customers with purchases
bad,Terrible pay for basically being treated like a slave ... they do not care about their employees.. And the health care they provide is terrible... you pay more then they offer
bad,"I would go to work 5 days out of the week and this is the worst place I've ever worked at. I get to work, clock in and clean the place for just about minimum wage. I was treated like I don't matter by most of the management, along with some of the employees. We get a tiny workplace which is shared with the bike assembler but every day the backroom stacks their pallets there and makes it so we have a hard time getting to our stuff. The Customer Service Supervisors tell us what to do, when all they do is stand there doing watching the cashiers and doing nothing, all well getting paid more. They even tell us to push carts all day some days and yell at us because the stores not clean which is hard to do when were outside doing something we're not supposed to be doing. We'd even get yelled at by the manager for some things we were told to do. I didn't enjoy anything about working at Walmart and would never suggest the job to anyone, we were treated like garbage."
bad,when I first started it was a family based job you felt a sense of pride working for Wal-Mart. but after about 6 months lots of people started to get laid off and there was no replacements you found your self working mandatory overtime all the time and the pay checks never increased. I quickly felt like a number at the company who could quickly be replaced. I became a acting manager over the departments on the salary of minim wage since I was never given the job title I never got the pay but I was required to continue doing a managers job.
bad,"Expectation for jobs to be done are incorrect."
bad,I worked for this company for a good year. and although the pay was acceptable (not great) the management there was horrible. worst id ever went through. they treated not just me but all the workers there like badly and worked them all to the bone. didn't care about time off nothing. and trust me i work allot im probably easily considered a workaholic but even i needed a break from time to time which i did not get with this company. and i was pregnant. and still worked me to death.
bad,Negative and pay is not adequate n stable enviroment
bad,When it comes to Walmart i feel like it was the worst job ever to hold a spot for two years. Walmart is the biggest business in the corporate but this company never takes care of the employees. Employees are not treated fairly within the company.
bad,I hate it. Plain and simple but it is a job so what can I tell you. The management is dumb they know nothing. They only promote favorites. No organization whatsoever! Ugh run for the hills. And now they are currently only hiring temp.
bad,they treat there employees like trash. They do not care about how well you work or how hard you work. as long as they get what they want. also they lie to the government and on your files. they never give good references either. they also do not protect their employees.
bad,I enjoy working for Wal-mart very much. Im a people's person studying communications in school. Meeting and Greating customers all day to ensure they have a postive shopping experience is the best.
bad,People of walmart (dot) com <--- After you see this i think that will be all you need to know to review this company.
bad,"If I were to review walmart, it would probably cause a law suit. So, let's just say I hated all most every single minute of working there."
bad,Work and a paycheck. The management is not good and the people are not friendly or out to help anyone but themselves.
bad,associates dot exactly get along and are not quite honest people like i thought they would be.
bad,"I hated working at Walmart! I didn't mind being an maintenance associate, having to clean bathrooms and messes that other people made didn't bother me at all. But the managment and employees that I had to work with anytime I was there, was unbearable. I had a few employees that I build friendships with that I enjoyed talking to and being friends with. The management team was unfair to anyone that they didn't like, not because the person wasn't doing their job but because they looked better or dressed better. Working at this particular Walmart was like being in high school!"
bad,Fun place to work. Alot of things to be done there and also need more positive leaders...
bad,"Péssimo ambiente de trabalho , demissão sem motivos , salário baixo , horários ruins ."
bad,"They dont give a darn for thier employees, they make them work long hours minimum pay"
bad,If you are looking for a place with poor management and Napolean complexes than you found it.
bad,it has minimal pay for the multiple tasks in different departments they want you to work in.
bad,I cash customers out all day. nice co workers standing for long periods of time. meeting different people all day. how to cash. management needs improvement
bad,good people just wanted a job that had a decent schedule maybe even had some of the same days and hours
bad,My day at work consist of making the customer happy to my fullest. I have learned a lot of different departments within the store so I am called the floater. Where ever there is help needed I am always reliable to be called to get the work done in a nice timely manner.
bad,they punished you if you worked more than 40 hours if you had to call in sick due to family issues you still got punished sometimes. they don't understand that some days you cannot work and you still get scheduled and can get punished for not being able to go in. i dont know if thats just how the one i worked at is but thats how it was.
bad,"There are a great deal of bad rumors surrounding Wal-Mart and most of them are true. It's a terrible, constricting, unpleasant workplace in which you are not valued in the least. Avoid working for Wal-Mart if you can."
bad,"As soon as I would clock in I would go to the garden center and the store manager would tell us to organize and rearrange everything to change the layout of our products then 10 -15 minutes he would change his mind. I learned that good is never good enough. the hardest part of the job was well everything, everything would change on you and it was never in the same place twice. My co-workers were great because they helped me get the hang of things. I enjoyed working with the flowers an the customers but at the same token, the customers would be so darn rude to you or ask you a question an if you didn't have what they wanted they would throw a huge fit and make a scene and walk out. Also they would say you are part time but work you over part time hours and only pay you part time hours."
bad,You stand at the register all day and only get a 15 min break. If you even got your break if there wasn't enough people then you didn't get it until way late. They never gave you enough hours and expected you to do everything even stuff not assigned to you for no pay at all/
bad,i have nothing good to say about working for this company. The management team all are on different pages about things. Nothing is organized or well thought out.
bad,I have worked for Walmart for about a year and this is my first job.with that said i would never reccomend any one to go and work for this company. I work full time and dont get no beneifits which is over 45 hours sometimes and i am a full time student.I come to work at 5 am and dont get off tilll 5 pm because of the lack of staff. The list goes on and on . The management is the worst thing that anyone could ever imagine.No communicationnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn at all.
bad,wouldnt tell anyone to work for this company. the women who are hire up in the company think that they can just talk to you any kind of way and dont even speak
bad,"My day at work consisted of 2 or 3 people doing the work of a crew of 10 people. Constantly being threatend of being fired for minor things. Almost nothing in the store is up to OSHA code. Extremely dirty and hazardous workplace. Constantly having work of favorited staff thrown on us, threatend being fired when we do not finish. My supervisor did not speak english, he only got the job because his brother was a manager. The only good thing to come from this job was i learned how to drive a forklift."
bad,"the place was very crazy, pay was low, and the mangers did not respect anyone and also took it out on the wrong people"
bad,Management isnt the best friendly people. They never listen to what the lower managerment needs and can do. Never follow rules like lower management does
bad,"this place treats employees and customers horribly. to emphasis on customer service or employee appreciation. this was a job I had during college. I worked from cashier and was promoted to csm which was the worst job of my life. Walmart is so disorganized and management are focused on profits not people! they cut hours, cut people that have been there for years earning the cap to save costs, they are so horrible I could go on for ever. They have such high turn over."
bad,They have absolutely NO opportunities for advancement if you're any of the following;
bad,"I did not like working at Walmart at all. The company does not value their employees or show any appreciation for their work. The phrase 'overworked and underpaid' is very true of Walmart. You cannot tell anything personal to a co-worker, no matter how much you trust them, because your business spreads like wildfire. You also have to deal with the customers who do not treat you as if you're a person. There are no enjoyable moments of working at Walmart."
bad,"Since a lot of people apply and try to work their, they believe that they can treat their associates how they want. Another thing is that once an associate is close to retiring, they fire them."
bad,I did like this job but I had several problems with the people that I worked with. The management treated everyone like dirt and the coworkers had very nasty attitudes.
bad,I would not work for this company again!!\
bad,Poor pay and lack of benefits not to mention the lack of appreciation for amount of money and merchandise saved to this store.
bad,If you want a good paying job then go for it. All they upper management care about is numbers. To them all your are a just a number. I work at a dc# and that is all they cared about. There is no opportunity for advancement unless you have a degree. They have been having managers step down down to associates. That is not fair. They do not care about any body else about there jobs because the are in management. Everybody that wants to work for walmart should look at all the factors. They care about themselves and nobody else. There benefits are bad. They claim they are the best retail company to work for I think you would be better off cleaning wipers on street at least than you would not be subject to production or a number. Because that is all the care about. I know from being there and I have seen it. The place is bad for people and any that applies should be aware that you may have a job now but it will be taken away from you if you do not meet there goals which is impossible. I know from being there. I hope this helps. There are better jobs out there then being a number.
bad,"Wal-mart is not a good company to work for. Wal-mart is the only company that I have worked for that they only give out yearly raises even when you first start as well as any types of benefits. The insurance rates are so high that most people that work there cannot afford to get the benefits, that is why about 80% of the employees are on some type of governmental assistance. Management is really bad, the store manager hides in the office all day and is barely seen through out the day. Human resources is not very helpful they do not help you with trying to transfer to another store, as well as lying about grants that you can get for school. Wal-mart prides itself on being a family oriented company which it is not."
bad,The job could be better management wise. They are never on the same page.
bad,"never trust anyone at walmart, everyone was talked about by the supervisor,"
bad,"I worked here for over a year, the managers started blaming me and a few other girls for what they were doing and got us fired. However if i had to go back i would have never takin the job in the first place. they dont give you your full breaks, you always get called back to the floor early and your not allowed to go and finish your break. I would not reccommend working here at all."
bad,it was very poor customers stealing sometimes i went the whole day without lunch
bad,"I hate everything about it, and management is terrible! everything."
bad,Wal-Mart is a horrible place to work for. They co-workers are fake. They will fire you if they don't like you.
bad,"Pay is too low for the work we do, no matter how hard you work, you set back and watch them advance others that don't work as hard or hire them off the street because they prefer to keep the people that are good in the job they are doing in that job. I don't feel that management is honest when you try to talk with them and they aren't equally fair with the hours that allow each to work. I give more than 100% to my job and I am always looking for something to do because I don't like to stand around doing nothing when we don't have customer's and I haven't noticed anyone showing any appreciation for someone who takes the extra initiative to do more than just what the job you are assigned to and cares as much about doing a good job for the company as I do."
bad,"As you have seen on the news and through rumors, Walmart is a terrible place to work. Please never put yourself through that kind of torture."
bad,"Walmart Supercenter has an ungrateful management team along with over worked and underpaid employees. Their benefits program is non helpful for those who have families and/or are single and trying to make a living for themselves. Their staff however, was friendly and enjoyable to work with. The word team went a long way with this staff crew. I'd have to say that the hardest part about the job would have to be the terrible compensation and lack of benefits that was received for the work that was endured."
bad,"went into work to a mess everyday, baskets of freight, merchandise, and hazardous waste. expected to help others in their departments, but not many were asked to help in claims, management didnt send help when needed only when we had ""company"" coming into the store. and with the associates we did have, we were worked harder for lack of help. my job was not hard but it got hard to get up every morning knowing what i was to expect everyday. i enjoyed the associates very friendly."
bad,"The actual people who were not management were amazing and hardworking, most of them. Management was terrible no one knew what the other had planned. Very unorganized and many racial discrepancies among management. Along with many other problems. It is NOT a good place to work for, they under pay and under staff their employees forcing 1 person to do 3 peoples jobs and penalized if not done the way they want, even though that person is doing 3 other peoples job."
bad,The culture has done a complete 180 degree turn since the company was in the hands of the founder. I learned that my coworkers were like family to me during good times and tough times. They were the most positive part of my Walmart experience.
bad,The managment team does not communicate with employees and therefore get treated as if we are in kindergarten
bad,"You work long hours, do some of every job yet only get paid for yours, work back to bcak shifts, get paid barely enough to eat off of, they'll fight to give you 39.5 hours a week just so they don't have to claim you as full-time, and it's just an all-around bad place to work."
bad,The people you work with and the ones that manages you are hard to work with. They have no respect for u nor customers at times.
bad,wal-mart treats their employees like slaves and customers like garbage
bad,"Hated it. Miserable. Stressful. Managers were rude and no longer cared about employees, a days work was always up and down and usually assigned more than a single person could handle."
bad,"learned about customer service,loved working with majority of all associates."
bad,The people are nice and helpful. I learned a lot about retail there.
bad,"Everyday, I finished all tasks asigned, and anything asked. My managers on many notes cussed me and talked to me like a dog. My anxiety and health was at risk due to the job."
bad,great customers but needs better management in the center
bad,They only pay low wages and only now hire part time or temporary.I worked in produce part time and have no idea if I ever will get full time like I did before.I feel like its organized slavery :(
bad,"Retail is very busy but the day would go by fast, it was peace of cake. I learned to take care of one thing at a time as well as one customer at a time. Take to patients and let them know what's going on, when I did that it was always great results. They where patient and nice and would come back later or would expect a call. Co-workers all helped and learned as much as they could just in case the inevitable was to happen, that one of us couldn't come in. The most enjoyable was bonus quarters!!!"
bad,"horrid management, terrible coworkers, hated working there. no union. made me dislike retail."
bad,"A typical work day would consist of nearly impossible time goals in stifling conditions, often encouraged to increase speed at the risk of worker safety."
bad,"The core issue with this job is that the managers governing your employment, largely, have never done any of the jobs you'll be doing in the store and adhere to an unreasonable corporate-generated task sheet giving them times your jobs should take. Naturally under Utopian circumstances those times are accurate, however you will never once have a perfect situation to do a task at Walmart because those very same managers, and supervisors, do not communicate with one another and often give conflicting orders or raise unnecessary obstacles to productivity."
bad,i was not impressed with the management team they did not know how to run the store. they were also all bullies. i was stressed out so bad i had to take a sick leave. i will not ever work for another walmart and i would not advise anyone to work there.
bad,"this employer has enough money to be its own country, but cant afford to pay its employees a decent pay or benfits."
bad,"This was not a good job in my opinion. Lack of knowledge of what needed to get done or who was in charge , and this ""was the people in charge"". There was to many who did not want to get dirty and would leave as clean as when they came . I was hired to run forklift and i worked with the inside crew tearing down display , shelving , and rebuilding when the time came."
bad,"Empty promises, and full of nothing more than cheap labor with no room for advancement. they say inside promotion, but they promote from the outside."
bad,"The core issue with this job is that the managers governing your employment, largely, have never done any of the jobs you'll be doing in the store and adhere to an unreasonable corporate-generated task sheet giving them times your jobs should take. Naturally under Utopian circumstances those times are accurate, however you will never once have a perfect situation to do a task at Walmart because those very same managers, and supervisors, do not communicate with one another and often give conflicting orders or raise unnecessary obstacles to productivity."
bad,i would stock shelves. i would help customers find what they are looking for
bad,From the start of the day after clocking in the stress begins. We are always short-handed and never given any help from other departments. Yet we are required to assist in other areas of the store regardless of the fact that there are not enough people in the shop to properly follow procedures and protocol. Our immediate supervisors have no problem helping out although those higher than they are insist that they don't. Honestly the only enjoyment I receive is working with my co-workers because we are the epitome of a team.
bad,I was treated poorly and degraded by management and other people all the time. was very unhappy and unsatisfied with their work and people skills
bad,"horrible work ethics, people do w.e they want. Not business savvy at all."
bad,a hard worker listing to what i have to do get it dont writ mack sure it done writ no sloppy
bad,"wal mart is very strong mistreaing their workers, and all so under paid for what they expect, not very happy how they treat every one bill it was very strest full"
bad,"Do not get a job here, low pay, managers will use and abuse you any way they can, you will never move up, full time hours are 28, treat you like dirt"
bad,"I enjoyed working at walmart and being able to meet new people everyday,It was hot in the summer time"
bad,"When I first started working for wal-mart I worked in the receiving and stocking end then I became a department manager over automotives, paper goods, chemicals and pet departments...I order the supplies needed for each department and helped customers get what they needed in a timely manor"
bad,"As únicas lembranças realmente recordavéis desses anos são as dos colegas de trabalho, os quais assumiram o papel de única familia devido a perda de qualquer possibilidade de tempo livre para dedicar-se a quaisquer outras coisas que não a própria empresa e principalmente as folgas não programadas que impossibilitavam o ""fazer planos""."
bad,"Productive, there focus is always providing good customer service and I enjoyed working there."
bad,Pretty much everything about working there was a sore waste of time.
bad,This is the place you work when absolutely no one else will hire you. Even then I think I would rather be unemployed. This place will literally suck the life out of you.
bad,"Benefits are horrible, hours are terrible and not much to gloat about when you see your pay check. Shouldn't be considered full-time with the pay rate received."
bad,"Not appreciated, pay is awful, benefits are terrible, drama is so full over there, gossiping including from the managers is just uncalled for"
bad,"low hours no benefits.No room for advancement. Manager did not,care about employees"
bad,"muito confuso , bagunça , nao sei como explica ."
bad,I was part time work. I did not the jobs beause they fried me for not take a lunch.That ok I will find a new jobs in san angelo.
bad,"Working at Walmart was definitely a challenge. I was a cashier at a very busy and popular Walmart so no matter what time of day it was, it was always busy. I enjoyed when it was busy because it made the shift go by quicker and I enjoy being busy rather than having to figure out something to do. The worst part of the job was when I needed a price check or change for my register. There was never anyone around and that would make the customers in my line annoyed and make my line very long which would make me frustrated."
bad,"There would have to be more of a understanding work team there, and treat everyone like they are on the same team. i would go in and go to see where i was going to be for that day,"
bad,"Its Wal-mart, the pay was bad, and the management was worse. I got in trouble for missing a few days due to my dads passing. It was not pleasant to work there other than learning how to use a telxon."
bad,"Walmart pays well but they dont keep anyone long enough! They treat you like dirt, work you to death, and you dont get anything in return but a burned out and broken body!"
bad,Encouraged and required to lie to patients about wait time and written up when you didn't. Expired drugs dispensed and written up if you protested. Never a break or lunch on time and never allowed to leave on time. But of course when HR saw you left late..well...you guessed it. You were written up.
bad,There was nothing good about working here the people were horrid!!!!
bad,well i did work for them very long at all it was okay for the time being i worked there they kept dropping my hours .
bad,"It is a fine line to get the most out of the company's resources and operate on a shoestring budget. WalMart is the latter. They are so cheap, they do not hire full time employees, except for management - That way they avoid most of the labor overhead expenses of benefits. They also refuse to give employees the resources to complete assigned tasks. Any questions?"
bad,I really like working there. All my customer came looking for me when they needed something in the store.
bad,"I believe that Wal-Marts reputation is pretty famous for being negative as an employer, so I will just say that it is all true. Possibly the most stressful and depressing place to work in the U.S."
bad,"I worked at a Wal-Mart in Toms River, NJ. Iwas pregnant and asked my manager to cut my hours down because working 8 hour shifts where getting to much. Let me tell you that I was three weeks from my due date. I didnt think that was to much to ask for considering I was three weeks from my due date. His response to me was I'm sorry but I am unable to change your schedule. So i proceeded to tell him I would not be in on that following thursday and friday. He told me that I would need a doctors note. I told him no problem I'll have it to you tomarrow. He then decided to change my hours. I think that he really thought I couldn't get a doctors note so then he could fire me. All the pregnant women I know that has worked there or still does work there, they are giving them problems also. I went and got my doctors note making sure the doctor knew exactly what was going on and he took me out of work completely. Like I said I was three weeks from my due date and if you ask me I made it pretty far without asking for my hours to be cut."
bad,I really didnt like the way i was treated as a worker there and i was treated more as a number then a person
bad,"Over qulified for the position I was in. Had to start at the bottom and work my way up, which is usually not a problem, but in this case I was flat out lied to by management and relatives advanced in my place."
bad,Working here is like struggling through middle school popularity contests. The employees that sleep with the managers and are friends on social networks are shown favoritism in some of the most egregious ways.
bad,"Horrible place to work. The co-workers were graet to work with, except the managment team was horrible."
bad,Come in start my shift and react with customers laugh and enjoy the company being around others.
bad,"you get no hours, they will exspect you to drive across town for 4 hours and in those hours you are over worked, not respected by managment and to top it all of the pay is bad."
bad,I was hired as a cashier never did cashier when I started working they out me in ICS because my work history but had me scheduled to work thanksgiving and black Friday sales with no training at all for cashier the manages was un organized had my schedule nothing like we talked about before hiring me. the hardest part of this job was the backroom because it was trashed nothing was in the correct place so it was a hunt everyday in ICS there the most enjoyable part of the day was help Wal-Mart's customers
bad,onde eu trabalhava nao era muito bom lugar dezorganizado e mau administrado
bad,Walmart has no structure when it comes to Loss Prevention. They overwork their salary management.
bad,"co-managers ,assistant managers don't treat employees right, they give you way to much to do . Is not a fun to work. you get stress out every day.Co-workers some are okay."
bad,"i hate my job because i feel as though i am the only person ever actually working. i get frustrated because the other workers continually leave me to do all of their work. this is why i seek other employment, because i am so unhappy in my current job."
bad,"horrible place to work. bad pay, no respect, poor working conditions"
bad,"My experience at Wal-mart was mostly fun except for the last month or so, seeked medical attention for anxiety and sleeplessness. I have met co-workers that would most likely stand infront of a bullet to protect a stranger. I have also met a few that would step over a stranger to protect a bonus check. Most of these people are friends with each other. What is most important to me is to be able to respect them all no matter what their deep seeded motivation might be. The hardest part of the Job is time managment I will have to say. There is always something that can be done. The most enjoyable part of my job is solving a very difficult task as fast as I possibly can."
bad,Stocked product for store
bad,"Higher management aren't the best in the field. I did not enjoy working for Wal-mart, except for my co-workers I did enjoy working with them."
bad,"The Wal-Mart management team is rude and one of the worst places I have ever worked. I don't know how they get away with being so mean. People are worked to death for such little pay. We are consistently told not to have overtime, but wait, you can't leave until you're done. If you get overtime, you have to shave it off during your lunch hour. There are times I have to take a 3 hour lunch. If you work overnight, you are made to sit in the breakroom for an hour or more and then you are allowed to punch in, You're asked to work overtime and promised your time card will be fixed, however, when you approach the mgr to fix it, he says, ""oh, you have to shave it off your lunch"". It's insane. The Wal-Mart I work at constantly have employees walk off the job or they just plain old don't show up, Two days in a row now, the morning cashiers haven't shown up!!! The managers on salary work long long hours without a lunch break, I have tried and tried to like it and overlook all this negativity but each day something else happens that makes want to quit yesterday. I am hanging on by a sheer thread!"
bad,walmart in bennettsville was new with to many new managers with no prior management experience and no good leadership. I we were told to do task with out proper explanation of the tasks given.
bad,"Poor customer service, poor management skills. You are worked like a slave and treated unfair, and they never like to work with you about scheduling issues."
bad,"I enjoy most of the people I work with, but the managers don't take care of their employees very well."
bad,"confused,learned nothing,management un prfessional,no going crazy and co-workers were the best part."
bad,Wendy's was ok for my first job as a teenager. But I'll never work there again.
bad,They expect too much for too little from the assistant managers. I do however enjoyed talking to the associates and building long lasting relationships.
bad,Cashier work or stocking products. I learned how to scan and type in codes for food and clothing. Its not a hard job at all.
bad,duties was operator fortlift @stocking material @also work in shiping and recievie department
bad,"You have to fill others slack, are promised bonuses for certain things in the store, yet I was never once given the promised bonus. You get yelled at for stupid things, management in your department can file false complaints about you and you can get in real trouble for it. Too much ""I'm in a better paying position than you are, so you're the dirt under my shoes"" and not enough ""I'll help you out because you're the little guy."" Not a really great environment if you're looking for a good company with possibility of moving up."
bad,"they do not know how to treat their employees,they under pay you and over work you to burn out"
bad,"I worked there and they are not fair to their employees, can only get part time work with no benefits."
bad,Uma empresa boa mas que precisa melhorar seu tratamento em respeito aos funcionários.
bad,"I learned that I would not, ever, advise anyone to work at or for Walmart. The hardest part of the job, would have to be the lack of work ethic that surrounded me at the location I worked at."
bad,"Lack of hours, pay, poor management. Buddy system with promotions and raises. Barely give enough hours to keep insurance if you are that lucky."
bad,Not enough women in their TLE Dept. This is it.. Not enough women.
bad,walmart is mean. the managers are not understanding and they lack leadership skills. they only talk to you if youve done something wrong.
bad,"A typical day begins with not having any clue what management wants you to do so you do what you think needs done. About 3 hours into your shift, about 3-5 managers will come and ask you to do a different project. Once you start on one, another manager will tell you to do something else(such as run a register, which you have had NO training on). At the register, you will have no clue how to do wic checks or punch in the produce codes so you will call for manager who will show up ten minutes later and wonder why your line is not moving and then tell you they never got the message that you needed assistance. Crazy place to work!"
bad,everything is currupt at this particular store. i learned nothing i didnt alread know
bad,Walmart will tell you things that sound amazing in your interview but once you actually start working there you will see everything they said was a lie. i worked for walmart for a month.. i quit because walmart would not work around my school schedule. i also seen them fire someone because she was also attempting to go back to finish her education.
bad,Walmart Kapuskasing is a bad employer.
bad,"as soon as you get to work you punch in and go directly to the register. I learned great customer service and money handling skills. the management was ok, no complaints. their was was to much drama among the co- workers. it really made me feel like I needed a new job. the most enjoyable part of the job is the customer interaction."
bad,walmart corporation only takes advantage of associates. they fill full of empty promises as career.
bad,i enjoy my job i like staying busy makes the day go by faster well there really not nothing had about my job my coworker i like working with them for as management they hire people that really dont know what there doing the company needs to treat there employees alittle better they would rather have someone who is lazy and dont come to work half the time learned how to do donuts bread markdowns make lables and trying to lean how to decorate cakes etc my day starts at 3 am i do the donuts bread stock mardowns feed america that is one thing i like the bread donuts go to a good cause and not just through away.
bad,Not a good place to work if you value and respect people. They do not care for or respect there employees.
bad,I hated working there the five years I did. Nothing was ever good.
bad,"a typical day at work consists of assisting customers and meeting their needs, management is very unsubtle, very discerning, they are not interested or concerned about other things you may have going on outside of work. They do no try to work with your schedule...Example: I am a veteran and i have appointments that are mandatory, rather than find coverage for the time requested off, they rather i call in late and miss hours. The hardest part of the job, there is not one for me, the most enjoyable part of the job are co-workers, they are helpful, knowledgeable and fun to work with. I have learned alot, such as inputting data and doing audits, changing oil, tires, and batteries as well as offloading trucks."
bad,This company doesn't care about its associates at all. They give you a petty 10% discount on stuff you don't really need and allow you to use it on food only one month out of a year. They fight you if you have to take any time off. They don't care if you or a family member is sick. They throw a fit if you have to take any type of leave and they treat you like you are extremely expendable. But to wal-mart everyone is expendable.
bad,"When working at Wal-Mart, you have to fight for all of your benefits, they work you like a dog for little money, and they don't care about their employees."
bad,we get under pay to deal with sooo much cant get overttime and they treat their workers horrible compared to other companys i've worked for i never have disliked a job so bad in my entire life.
bad,"If you're not a high school student and actually want to have an income to live off of, this is not the place for you. No Hours , Horrible Pay and claustrophobic work environment."
bad,"Quiet honestly I'm not going to say my experience applies to all Wal-marts but clearly taking care of the Associates, treating them respectfully was not a high priority held by upper store management."
bad,no benifits because they only hire parnt time. management does list to employees
bad,bad pay smoking room bad benifits not enough hours bs people to work with
bad,"My job was to make sure that everything that was leaving the store was paid for, marking the receipts. I would have co-workers, cashiers, managers, and stock men interfere with my job, by saying, "" It's OK!"" But it wasn't OK! A co-worker was leaving the store with a shopping cart full of appliances and when I asked for a receipts she said that they came from home for the luncheon. Big screen tvs were also interfered by co-workers saying I saw him pay for it. And with any interference I was written up. Three write ups and you are out of a job. A person left their job and this was a great opportunity for more hours, but instead of more hours, I got fewer hours??. Now after being fired, I realized that I was not related to anyone there. WALMART=NEPOTISM! IT'S NOT WHO YOU KNOW BUT WHO YOU ARE RELATED TO!"
bad,"It may have changed since I was there half a year ago, but I left because it was hard to move up, and the pay was very low, not to mention management was very lacking in communication and teamwork."
bad,You worked all over the store but received low raises. No consideration for family priorities.
bad,It was not fun .I was move all arand the store and I was land off for a missanderstaning.
bad,"wal-mart does not know how to treat their employyes,they abuse their nemployees"
bad,"made friends, hopefully not forgotten , hours where okay, nothing to complain about just had a better job opportunity!"
bad,"Learn time management with decreasing weekly hours and increasing production expectations. Co-workers moods and morale vary on a day-to-day basis greatly influenced by the stresses brought on by work (such as decreasing hours, managements requests for them to not get overtime yet insist they stay past their scheduled hours, not enough workers per department, the favoritism played by management that often results in associates and management being ""friends"" and one co-worker being listened to while anoher gets ignored)."
bad,I personally didn't like working here.. No benefits.. Minimum wage.. Never got over 20 hours a week.
bad,What a waste of years off my life! I wouldn't recommend a mule to work for WALMART!! They DO NOT care about their associates!
bad,Not a good place for someone with a family life. Typical day was very fast pace. learned how to do WIC transactions. management was very heartless. Hardest part of the job was working during the holiday season.
bad,"They lie to you as soon as you have the interview and you get hired on, after your hired, they deny all of it"
bad,A typical day at work the first Hoaleom you my formation Hassi you Ghraib
bad,No security. All this company does is use and abuse you. Whenyour fianely on your last leg of energy they make you train your replacement then they send you off.
bad,"The management is horrible, they were rude and biased and didn't take care of their employees and pets(fish) They didn't take care of problems that needed to be taken care of, my wife works there and since I don't they treat her horribly on a daily basis. Some of my co-workers I really got a long with but management needs some major improvement."
bad,"I was a cake decorator and I LOVED the actual work part of the job. I got to make childrens birthday parties special as well as weddings and other special occasions. HOWEVER, the managers cared absolutely nothing about your life or how you feel or anything. First, I had a manager ask me to come in at different times for two weeks than what i was scheduled so i assumed she had let other management know and changed my schedule. Nope, I was reprimanded for what they thought was 2 tardies and 1 no show. After pleading my case, i kept my job. Now my job was tuesday through saturday 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. One weekend was coming up and we had a tonnnnn of orders and because they had just fired the other decorator, i was the only one. So they asked me to work friday overnight after working 7-3 on friday. I agreed. So i left work at 3 and came back at 10p on friday. Well, i worked until 7a.m. on saturday then went to clock out and they told me no. I needed to make stock cakes for the cooler. So then, i worked until 12 p.m. Then I went to leave and they still wanted me to stay until 5 p.m! I had just found out i was pregnant and they were aware of this. When I reminded them about this, they told me ""I should stop being a baby and do my job before i get fired."" So I threw in the towel right there! Don't ever let an employer walk all over you like that and take advantage of you."
bad,manager was 2 faced she talked about everyone i will never worrk at walmart again nothing about his job did i like i hated it
bad,"the job was easy and repetitive. wage was commensurate with skill it took to complete. customers were rude and had a ""what can i get for free"" attitude. management was lousy at best.... lied, cheated, and unprofessional is an understatement."
bad,"This was the worse place to work. You get in trouble if you get caught by a customer on the way to clock in (which was located in the VERY back of the store and I worked at the front with the Bakery). I learned how to decorate cakes and I loved doing it. Management thought they could get away with anything. I had a manager touch me inappropriately and nothing was done, he is still employed with the company. Co-Workers were pretty nice and I am still friends with some of them. The hardest part of the job was dealing with store management. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. They were amazing. I loved my customers and hated to loose my job there."
bad,you are basically worn out because their standards are so hard to meet. the most enjoyable part of the job is when you get to go home.
bad,Management was biased. Job security was aweful. Hours were difficult. Payment was very low.
bad,"While working there I wasn't treated with respect, Managers wanted us to do more then what we were capable and if we didn't get a chance to finish they'd yell at us."
bad,I really did not enjoy this job at all. Low pay in they definitely did not care about there employees.
bad,"Worst place that I have ever worked for. Pay is terrible, work conditions are miserable, and management team is a joke."
bad,All of the managers are overpaid. Horrible benefits. Would expect more from the richest company in America.
bad,"I enjoying doing the job learn much it's just not enough hours, management is not the best. I enjoy working with a company that has good understanding with co workers. Theres not a hard part about the job i really learn a lot on my own.. Co-workers some or freindly and some not I'm looking to work on a job where it's all freindly"
bad,They want one person to do the job of 2-3 people. They don't believe in compensating employees for all of the work they do. Management has no respect and talk to you like a child. They do not listen or care about their employees. There is no staffing.
bad,this is a wonderful place to work with lots of new jobs to do every day never the same thing every day
bad,"This is the worst work experience I have ever had second to one other place. The employees aren't appreciated, the management team acts as if they don't have time for you, advancement isn't given based on actions but based on popularity. Horrible atmosphere."
bad,horrible place to work for benefits are ok only if you are ever a full time employee
bad,"The company has pros and cons but I personally have largely had nothing but bad experiences working at walmart. Typical workloads are pretty high, I often worked 10 hours of freight alone in a standard 8 hour day. Feels understaffed most of the time. I did learn a lot from management. I was trained to preform the duties in the event i needed to do them. So i have lots of opportunities to move up. I was in school, however, and did not take them. My co-workers were great. I love the people i worked with and I would have to say that was the most enjoyable part of my job. I got to work with my best friends. The benefits are decent but every year they take stuff away. New associates are started off at lower pay than i was. highest raise is only 50 cents a year as opposed to 60. new associates don't get an extra dollar an hour on sunday or overnight incentives."
bad,they really dont care about who works for them they made me work all night when i was just 17 and i was still in high school.
bad,"worst job- i learned that when you work for a company that values providing the cheapest prices always, you recieve similiar value as an employee"
bad,I have learned that working is just paying attention willing to learn new things and not being afraid of challenges everday it's going to be something different that happens you just need to know how to approach and handle the situation.professionally. A Typical day at work everyones making sure that they have everything they need to provide excellent customer service to the customers. Management they are concerned for the needs of everyone that shops and works at the company. The co-workers who says you can't have fun and do your job at the same time as a team. The hardest part of the job is when you are scheduled off from work it's home away from home. The most enjoyable part of the job is always when the family celebrates the Christmas Holidays together as a family.
bad,managment did not treat employies well.had to be outside in bad weather.
bad,meh it was all politics no room for advancement unless you were related to a boss wasted 5 years.
bad,"Cut wages across the bored and bring down the American standard of living while allowing few at the top to make absorbent amounts of money. Then convenience the public that it's all for the better of there community, that it will provide ""jobs"" (I use that term very loosely, because jobs usually imply pay; and here, pay is nowhere near the living standard for most employees). After convincing the people that this business is for the betterment of the community, force the locals to pay for the building of a facility through he use of their tax revenue's."
bad,This is not a family orientated workplace like they advertise. Management is very poor. They treat their employees like animals. We don't count for anything.
bad,I worked at the DC in cleburne for over a year. I worked 4 day work weeks and absolutely hated every minute of it. There is a lot of favortism and double standards. Needless to say i quit the insurance sucks and i do not recommend. While i was there we worked 10hr shifts if your were lucky mostly it was like 8 hours and you received 2 20 minute breaks and are always being watched and nit picked at for the littlest things. This company at one point was great to work for but after Mr. Walton died its about production and money money money they will cut your hours just to make a quick dime. They offer people lowers prices in stores by shafting there employees for it. Be prepared if you go it has a high turnover rate mainly because people find out how horrible it is. They pay high to make up for the hours they cut you dont be fooled if your intentions are to go there and work overtime and make bank your sadly mistaken you can work OT and then they will send you home the next day to cut it.
bad,I learned that walmart has poor managment its a fun place to work at.Other assoiates are not ur friends.
bad,awful place to work. Very bad management and lack of care for their employees.
bad,"they are not a very understanding place to work. typical day at work was stocking shelves and lifting heavy things all day long. some of the managers were better then others, most the people that i worked with stayed to themselves those that didn't were singled out. the hardest part of working there was trying to have a life and a family. the best part of my day was when i got to go home."
bad,"a typical day, work long hours,and no o.t. management was OK, co-workers were great. the hardest part about the job was nothing"
bad,"Honestly I have worked for Walmart for almost 10 years and I think its the worst place in the world to work for. I mean I am grateful for a job but the management doesnt listen. We have policies for a reason and me as a customer service manager I try and follow them but the minute a customer threatens to call corporate they bend the rules. Management doesnt know how to treat there associates, they dont know how to do schedules and they never motivate us or tells we're doing a good job."
bad,"Would be an awesome place to work if management weren't so rude. the only way to advance is if they like you. they are very unfair and is a depressing atmosphere. feels like being in high school all over again with all the drama and immature ""adults"" that work there."
bad,"poor hours, poor pay, working conditions very poor. managers at time i worked there were allowed to steal, with no punishments!"
bad,Wal-Mart USED to be an ok company to work for but now the corporation just figures out ways to cut hours and not to pay their employees for a 40 hour week. I would say most of the employees are on some sort of government assistance and barely make ends meet. Management is unprofessional and confidentiality does not exist. Last place to apply for any job.
bad,"worse place to work, they over work you and are not grateful, they never let me take my break, it always felt like i was stuck between a rock and a hard place, managers are never held accountable for theyre actions like yelling at associates on the sales floor, and discriminated against employees and retaliate in a undercover way."
bad,"received cash, checks and completed credit-card transactions, adjusted error and resolve complaints, stock, trained fellow wmployees maintained high standards of excellence."
bad,Wal.Mart is a fun exciting place to work. The only down fall is the pay. I feel I was not acknowledged enough for the work i did. To be 19 and the only person working in grocery from 7-4 Monday through Friday not even a department manager it sucked to find out that i didn't get promoted because in they're words i wasn't assertive enough but for the past year Grocery exceeded in sales with no manager but little help from others. Thank you
bad,Horrible horrible horrible they are a billion dollar company whom pay there employees next to nothing!!!
bad,worked to death and under paid! worst place I have ever been employed
bad,"0600-2000/2100-2000: work off the clock as required, assist associates and customers"
bad,Not an easy job at all.learned a lot about shipping and recieving management sucked.coworkers were not to bad.had to work all weekend
bad,these people dont know how to talk to their employees what so ever they treat them like kindergarten children they talk to them inappropriately just overall bad experience
bad,"A typical day of work, is filled with nonstop BS! Don't apply to Wal-Mart unless you absolutely need money."
bad,"Walmart is like modern slavery, you cannot have a life outside of Walmart. CO workers do not care about each other, management is horrible on solving problems. The hardest part of the job is the fact that you have to go in everyday. There is no enjoyable part of the job at Walmart"
bad,this company is horrible . I no longer work there or shop there for years.
bad,Walmart is not all its cracked up to be. The advancement opportunity is not there and the management is not people friendly.
bad,It was the most unorganized place I have ever worked. Scheduling was poorly done. There were never enough people scheduled and inventory was badly managed.
bad,"Not enough hours, low pay. Taught us to be friendly to every customer. Hardest part was not enough hours to pay for rent, or other bills."
bad,"Poor Management, Poor working conditions, Not will to work with you for any time off."
bad,"Well i was hired at Walmart, this past week as seasonal cashier. All would be fine and good if they didn't keep putting me off, and annoying me all week. By that i mean i have six weeks of work and they have already wasted one calling me. The first time it was to say come the next day, so i said fine. Then again they called the next day asking me for an interview, because they had no idea i worked there. Again today they called and woke me up, this wouldn't be bad if i had not changed my sleeping patterns, to adjust working nights. This time they told me not today but i quote ""sometime"" next week. i have had many offers since i was hired, and i wish i took them instead of this dumb job. Very unprofessional. Especially to a student, who needs the money."
bad,Walmart needs to hire enough people so all registers are going instead of just two or three
bad,go to work stock shelfs
bad,"The work is simple, and relaxed. Management is horrible and they try to run over everyone. The Co-workers of mines perform horrible customer service. I do not enjoy this job !"
bad,they where more nice to work for but i would not work for them a again
bad,Not worth the effort to do.
bad,"what do you expect, not much to say....we have all heard the walmart dilemma... and the store i worked for had the highest retail lost of any store that year....smh"
bad,You are a dime a dozen. People get promoted according to their popularity not achievement.
bad,Worked hard every day with knowing it was a temp position. Was under appreciated as employee.
bad,Terrible place to work. not alot of room to advance at all. I worked there a year and stayed in the same place.
bad,I learned a great many things while working at Wal-Mart. I learned how to be a manager and how to coordinate a team of people and allocate a pool of resources effectively to get the job done as efficiently as possible. It was always difficult to move up in the company as the store manager's friends almost always had first shot and the interview process was mostly a show. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people I worked with. The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with angry customers that look down on you just because of where you happen to work.
bad,"They only hire for part time which is not eligible for benefits, management is very disorganized, and they are not very understanding of employee needs."
bad,I worked for the company for one one month and in that month it was bad ...
bad,"I have worked for Walmart for 28 years and the first l5 were good. I was able to raise my two children as a single parent and work full time with Walmart. I believe when Sam Walton died and then a few years ago his wife died. The children just are out for money. Sam was about family and now the company is only about money. I really love the work that i do there but i dont like the rules and management changes that have been happening . I feel I have given most of my working life to Walmart and I believe they want the older assoicates to retire or just leave. They now can hire younger people and pay them less. I have alway been a real hard worker. Alway there when I was suppose to be and gave more of myself to this company. I am now looking for a new job because I got married and moved to Jackson, Tn. I now drive one hour to work and an hour home."
bad,Cut hours and expect you to work harder with no extra pay.
bad,A typical day at work is a lot of customer service. I learned a great deal about customer service.
bad,A typical day at work was stress full and they make you want to go home
bad,muy pesado y cansado ya q te querian tratar como si fueraz de su propiedad
bad,Though advancement is possible. It seems that this walmart likes to reward those who do not put their best foot forward. Tear the ones who work the hardest down. And talk to certain employees like children.
bad,"Disorganized, only partially functioning, too many chiefs, not enough peons."
bad,"Cross selling cameras, video cameras, print pictures, develope films, dealing with cash, cleaning the kodak machines, cleaning the film processing machines and so on. The hardest part of the job is to deal with rude customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is to process films."
bad,It is a nice place to meet new people and work with customers and work hard.
bad,No matter how much you clean up and make sure the artea is kept clean and everything is kept in place it looks like the job was never done and you are not recognized for a good job.
bad,I liked working at walmart but the some of the managers were always with a long face. When you called out to get change they would take a long time to bring it to you. Not a very good experience at all. I didnt like working 4 hrs 3 times a week. Not quite what i was looking for.
bad,"Cashiering, stocking, Most of all great customer service. Worked alot of overtime, came in on off days."
bad,blah blah blah I dont have much to say. Its a job when you need one and if you become buddies with a manager you just might get a promotion
bad,A typical day at Walmart could be consistently ringing customers. There for that gives me plenty of customer contact. This helps to improve my service to the customers. My co-workers work diligently and with little supervisor. This shows customers that we are well aware of our jobs and what is need to assist them. The hardest part might be when a customers does feel dissatisfied for some reason or another. The most enjoyable part is when the customers know who you are by name and look forward to you servicing them.
bad,The managers do not care what happenes as long as they can sit in the office and do nothing. The associates have a I dont care about anything adittude because no one cares about the store.
bad,While I worked at walmart I recieved nothing but attitude and slander. Some management were very nice and respectful especially when I found out I was terminally ill. On some of the nights I worked I would be given the toughest job to do and only a certain amount of time to do it. This company does not care about anything when it comes to their employees. I was fired for medical reasons and when I filed suit they lied and said it was due to attendance even though I displayed all required documentation. After I filed suit I still shopped at the store but because they were upset I filed suit they had me arrested for a theft that was never committed. THIS COMPANY IS THE WORST!!! I REFUSE AND FAMILY REFUSE TO SHOP THERE!!!! EVER!!!!
bad,"Managers and co-workers worked against each other, learned that they have a high turnover."
bad,i never liked working there. People were setting other people up for failure
bad,not a fun place to work. like walking on egg shells.
bad,Very stressful work environment. NO opportunities for advancement. Work environment childish.
bad,Have unsuccessfully attempted to contact market place management to change rehire status.
bad,"If you're going to work for Wal-mart do it during the day because if you're an overnight worker you're screwed. Nevermind the $1 an hour more you get paid. If you work overnight all you do is clean up everything day turn screwed up. They give you ""tasks"" and compute how long stocking freight and picks should take you and god help you on the nights where the computer says you have 10+ hours of freight because management will never send anyone to help you and if you work part time, management will expect you to work over until your work is done and rip you apart if anything isn't perfect. I'm trying my hardest to find a job to replace this place and I'm even considering taking a job that pays half of what I make now because this place is so god awful. If you try to work here do it during the day because clearly it's the easiest job ever to just wait on customers all day."
bad,the managers suck the life out of you and they dont seem to care about you having a family out of work
bad,"I typical day is usally stressful. I've learned how to be an idependent worker. I have been asked multiple times to be a manager but, the way they treat people I can't see myself treating people the way that do. The Co workers that work are the ones that get mistreated and the co workers thats been there for along time has history with the manager and they do as they please and less work. The hardest part is going to the job and its nothing enjoyable about it."
bad,The most enjoyable part of this job were my co-workers and that's it. We all were hard workers working for minimum wage and management didn't appreciate us. Employees were written up for issues never explained. Very unfair employer to work for.
bad,"not the place you want to work if you can help it. management sucks! No benefits, for at least a year!"
bad,"managment was never there when supposed to be, i got hurt on the job and was forced to make a claim with the company and was made to go to the dr that i was told would be covered by walmart and then ended up with a huge doctors bill.not concerened about employees nobody did their job and all responsibilities where put onto the overnight shift."
bad,they worke u hard for not a lot of money there hard to work for they work u very hard and talk to like if ur a child
bad,"they do not let you work overtime unless they can benefit from it.if your position is not busy and tou offer to help in another department even though you are not good at it,they terminate you because you can not meet production quota."
bad,I worked in the frozen so it always required a coat and then to go on the floor and stock shelves ment to take your coat off.
bad,"I suppose management is pushed very hard to get SO MUCH done in a very short time frame. These demands are passed on to us associates. That I understand. What I find incredibly unfair is that with so much to be done, they schedule very few associates for each shift.We are spread so thin it is not possible to complete every task. We are expected to do the jobs of atleast 3 people each shift. I take pride in my work, and get frustrated feeling set up for failure, though I am doing the best I possibly can."
bad,a typical day is busy running up and down helping customers solving customer's concerns.i learned to be understanding of others patient and observant.
bad,"I used to work in the Broussard location for a few months (seasonal) and I hated every minute of it. I didn't like the fact of how they paid you for being a cashier but wanted you to do things you were not qualified for. I would run the register, as well as, stock the shelves and assist customers on the floor with their shopping needs. I would have a flexible schedule which never allowed me the time I needed with my kids but on the weekend. The hardedt part of my job was getting on at around 11pm and have to be back for about 6;30am. the next day."
bad,"It was wal-mart. You would get pulled in so many directions. I didn't work here long, just while I was in high school."
bad,Worst place that anyone could work. No respect for the individual.
bad,"Managment never worked with your scheduel especially if you were a college student. I missed tests because management told me if I did not work that day I would be fired when I had given them a monthn notice on what day I would need off. You have no room to advance in this job and there are no good benefits. The hardest part of the job was working with your managers, especially the ones on salary."
bad,They do not respect their employes
bad,Manager would make me do all their jobs inculding mine they also wanted me to work overtime but refused to pay me overtime moey
bad,"It's a job, that is about all that can be said here. I have nightmare stories about this place."
bad,I checked out customers and helpled them find things if need be. Sometimes I would stock and help keep the front of the store clean.My co-workers were pleasant to work with. The hardest part of this job was dealing with management.
bad,the manager there treated their employee really bad. they talked bad to their employee in front of costumers.
bad,"Walmart expects you to do things that aren't possible to do in the time given. If you don't do these things, they find reasons to write you up."
bad,i had a bad experience due to lac of hours offered and lack of chances to move up in the company.
bad,the manager had just become manager and starting as a store standard had it out for us would not repair buggy machine and liked tearing a new one in parking lot were no cameras were not to mention discriminatory to different types of people was rude
bad,Unfortunately I wasn't able to rate them with negative stars so I gave the very least I could which is being very generous.
bad,"Always on time, never late or absent, always did what I was ask to do by my superiors, but didn't kiss no a.. Never was promote for any other department,others department request me including receiving, cause I was very fast and good worker but every time I asked the excuse was: I can not move you from the registers: I reply why?: answer CAUSE YOU ARE BILINGUAL !!!! So instead of make me feel it was good to speak to language I was feeling like it was bad, and finally when they move me was to TLE automotive,promising more hours but was a lie, and I was making 7:35 an hour with experience and a men without experience 8:50 for the same position, they make my life miserable until I resing from it..."
bad,It was a fast pace enviorment. It was my first job. I was a cashier.
bad,It's wal-mart
bad,Wal-Mart tends to operate on an all me scenario. They have very little interest in your personal needs and are usually unwilling to work with you to form a positive work experience.
bad,"Managers don't care if your child gets sick. They will hold it against you and cut your hours if you call in sick even if your child catches pneumonia. The zone manager at the janesville, WI. Walmart, barks orders at employees every chance she gets. The sad part is no one on the management team knows how to do half of the jobs at wal-mart! My co-workers were the most disrespectful hillbillies I have ever seen in my life. The worse part, employees are paid only a few cents above minimum wage and they refuse to give anyone full-time or benefits. If you quit with even a 2 weeks notice the managers will give a bad review about you if another employer calls them to ask about your work history."
bad,Balancing out tasks and supervising others
bad,The managers are mean and rude to you. They treat you like dirt.
bad,walmart is very much so a highschool job they dont reward or acknowledge experience when they see it.
bad,A typical day at work is strenuous and constantly busy. I learned how to multitask and get my work done in a very timely manner. Coworkers needed to be motivated to do daily activities and workers that did finish their duties were placed in areas that other employees did not fulfill their job requirements. The most enjoyable part of working for walmart was gaining experience and being able to help people.
bad,"stock merchandise, control inventory, ordering merchandise"
bad,i was only there for a short time but i did learn how to assemble bikes and i enjoyed the atmosphere it was very upbeat and energetic
bad,"When I worked at the Wal-Mart Center in Minden, La. It was very hard commuting back and forward due to low pay and hours being cut often. when you were at work management often force you to do your work along with their and treated you with write up or worse, fire you."
bad,"Rarely gives goverment required breaks,rarely allow bathroom breaks and meal breaks frequently late.Usually by time lunch comes haven't gotten morning break so you lose it.If lucky you'll have cover- age to give you lunch on time because if you leave gait unattented for restroom or regular breaks or even meal time you will be dealt with in severe manner up to and including verble warning,coaching, up to or including termination. This is no joke! They expect you to work in extreme cold and heat year round and just deal with it and hope you can hold it 6 hrs till lunch because breaks are concidered not a requirement but if fit in to their schedule of your work assignments then occationally permitted. Got about 2 out of every 6 breaks,and usually paged back to station only 4-5 min into my break. When I exceeded in many ways daily expections of job duties I still got substandard raise of 40 cents which is meets requirements and exceeds amt is 60cents but company dropped all raises down to 40 cents maximum in 2009 due to economy and has kept it same. Expect 1 to do work of 3 in most cases without extra pay or even benefits."
bad,A typical day is waiting behind a register all day with no customers. I learned how to ring in items. Management was too busy to keep track of all the workers. Co workers were fun and the hardest part was black friday.
bad,I wasted too many too many years with this company that doesn't appreciate the dedicated hours that you give. Seems they Only care about dollars and cents. Sam Walton who? His beliefs and values died when he did. So sad. The only difference between Walmart and Kmart is one starts with a w and one with a k. Health insurance sucks with this company
bad,"not a a bad job, work hours are kind of long but not bad for the pay, associates are very hard workers."
bad,"A typical day working at Walmart would include customers yelling at me, managers yelling at me, and overall just chaos."
bad,The management was partial to certain employee's and not very consistant with procedures I felt it was not a good inviroment to work in . Being the first pharmacy I had worked in I felt they did not take the proper time to train me in the insurance and input part of the job.
bad,"When I first started working there, it was actually pretty cool. I made fast friends with my coworkers, and overall everyone was very friendly. As time went on though, management really lacked in every possible aspect. The brand new store I helped put together with my coworkers became a terrible place, customers were unsatisfied, and more importantly, people were fired who had no business getting fired. It's like they singled out everyone who actually cared about the store and the customers and fired them for being good employees. Under no circumstances should anyone work here."
bad,"to meet some worker no cooperation during cleaning time,food dept to serve costomer to be patient,good server,fast,,co-worker-a team-work the best, work and some not follow policy,to enyoy keep busy, focus mind to our work"
bad,"Exactly what the summary says, the pay is awful, the management is worst and fight amongst themselves . The health care is okay though"
bad,"Assist customers with purchasing needs, resolve all customer issues and concerns, stock and rotate merchandise. Clean all product displays and shelving daily."
bad,I learned that i love high end retail not discount retail. The hardest part of this job is doing your work and everyone else job too.
bad,"unloaded trucks, stock shelves, did inventory, and price changes."
bad,"management is terrible, hours are terrible and the pay is horrid."
bad,Way too many people in charge that have no idea what they are doing. Some not managers very rude. Not only to fellow workers but costumers also.
bad,They do not treat their employees fairly. They make you not want to go to work and they blame the lower employees for everything.
bad,Terrible everything!! No stars. Management did not care about asociates at all. They don't care if you have kids or anything they just nag nag nag
bad,"The most enjoyable part of my job was being with the associates. Not management. All they would do is sit in the office. They rarely came out of there. And if they did, it was to tell you that you needed to do something that they could do themselves."
bad,"Walmart was the worst place I've ever worked. I won't go into much detail, sorry"
bad,dont treat people right
bad,•Gather customers’ prescription upon arrival.
bad,"A typical day at work would be cleaning up your cash register area, zoning around your area and serving the customers fast and m,aking sure they are always happy. I have learned much working for walmart. You learn how to work with other people and working fast and accurate is defently the best when it comes to being a cashier. The hardest part of the job is making every customer happy but the most enjoyable part of the job is making people happy and them showing their apperciation"
bad,walmart store 2269 is a bad place to work manangment is not very good . no respect not treated equally
bad,"Absolutley the worst place to work....If you like being lied to or doing more work than you are being paid for then walmart is the place for you. Management was horrible they dont listen to any of your concerns, the pay is horrible the environment sucks and it is all together the worst working experience of my life i will never work there again or refer anyone to them."
bad,"A empresa agradavel,o que nao ajuda eh a encaregada de frente de caixa.Tirando ela eh um lugar muito bom para trabalhar."
bad,Management sucks. co-workes suck. working there sucks. everything about this store sucks.
bad,horrible management team
bad,Wal-mart allow you to to gain experience.
bad,Walmart as a company is a great to work for. Finding a great location is another thing. Managment is very unorganized and unproffesional. Co workers are more concerned with other outside life than there own personal work ethics. Over all it is a very easy job
bad,"Walmart in my area ( Alabama ) has the worst management on the planet! Its a buddy system you can not get around, advancement is a no because they have ""special ones"" they give it to. They will write you up on a ridicolous things, although you have a doctor's excuse ! My co- workers was awesome but were some that will go back and tell exactly what you said to management and they write you up again without discussing the matter at hand. The most enjoyable part of my job was the kids and customers themselves."
bad,"Confer with customers by telephone or in person to provide information about products and services, to take or enter orders, cancel accounts, or to obtain details of complaints."
bad,"At the time of my employment, the management style was not the greatest. It seemed like things were no in order as they should have been."
bad,walmart was a dificult company to work for low wages and poor benifits worse job ive ever had
bad,"Walmart is terrible. It is not a fun place to work. They treat their help so bad. They degrade, yell, belittle their employees. The pay is not enough to live on unless your an assistant manager or higher. Walmart is only out to make money. They say they give money out to help the community and other good causes which is a great tax write off, but they should give more to their employees."
bad,"i did not enjoy working for this company,pay was bad ,and managment sucked !! not a plesant place to work"
bad,was working in the meat dept. restocked shelfs and working with customers request.
bad,Several managers telling you different things to do all at the same time and you have to do everything that they want you to do before you leave even if you cant finish with their demands
bad,unfair treatment of management by company lead to unfair and unsafe work.
bad,"Was with the company for 13 years, every year I was there company went downhill as a place to work for. Took every benefit that associates used to get. No more Profit Sharing, no more $1 hour more on Sundays, and the bonuses are minute and unattainable."
bad,wait on people and do what the managers asked of you sto ck shelves and help people assemble thing in lawn and garden
bad,Getting the machine ready to mop and wax the floor. sweep the floor before machine was used picking up product as i go.I learned how to use a buffer and scruber and what it takes to clean a retail store of that size.Management did a ok for the most part seemed a bit under trained in areas and a bit lost most of the time with the proper training in all aspecs of the store as well as emplimenting a customer fist style over task only would help the store go far. Co workers were good none hard to work with.Hardest part about my job was not enough poeple .
bad,"The job was easy just dirty working on cars, which i enjoy. I learned how to be safe."
bad,They treat you worse than the tools. They will break you for minimum wage and keep you going with false promises.
bad,"I learned that no matter how hard a person might work, they will never be advanced, appreciated, or treated with any dignity whatsoever."
bad,"Honestly, I think the only thing that helped me get in was my mother worked there then it seemed like they were trying to get rid of me as soon as I started. Always upset over doctors notes ( I was pregnant while I worked here) lots of politics and favoritism."
bad,hated working there to. the befits was awful and they never wanted to give us raise. That one of the maine reasons i quit and left them.
bad,The work place was a place were people that worked and theis peopl that didn't nut they were like by the boss on that shift so theyed get the easy jobs. I liked working. Going in geting things .done because as an unloader you were pressed for time.the one throwing the truck sets the pace for the night.so as a team mate you would make sure everyone wasn't struggling doing their part helping them out makes it so no one is at risk of getting hurt.if someome gets hurt risk is higher trying to coover there part.risk is cut down then everyone wont have to work as hard.
bad,"there is nothing to say about this place, walmart is not a very fun place to be whether youre being paid or paying them"
bad,There's no advancement unless you're part of a clique. Management won't listen to your concerns ever but will punish harsh for minor things.
bad,The only thing I liked about working here was my co-workers it is a very cut throat company they could care less about there employees thats why it's such a high turn over rate.There a multi billion dollar company that refuses to make anyone full time so they dont have to pay for full benifits the wages are extremely low for all the hard work thats expected to be done.You dont get any personal time for a year and then you only get 14 hours once you hit a year. If your deathly sick in the hospital even with a doctors note if you miss more than 4 days you can forget about your job.Management is steady changing and none of them are proffessional the list goes on and on the worst company I have worked for by far they don't deserve one star it's thumbs down all across the board for me and I know im not alone.
bad,reall was my break threw cause it was my first job and i will never do it agaon
bad,"Probably the worst company in the world. I worked there almost two years. I knew everything about my job. Instead of promoting me, they hired a mgr from papa johns who I had to train. doesn't make sense to me."
bad,"was working for wal-mart for 6yrs and ahalf my goodness never met a compny that you give so much also willing to work without getting paid for the job that your doing because even if you stay back for 5minutes just to make sure that everything was perfect they wont paid you for that 5minutes but you have to cut it so before you clock in you have to clock in 5minutes late so they dont have to pay you for that 5minutes you stay back that morning. i even requsted my daughters surgery off this is 2 months prior but they denied it, and what ever hapened to family first,"
bad,Walmart makes you think that your lucky to have gotten a job with them and that you can make it into a career and move up and its all lies. Their scheduling is horrible!! I had nights where i got out at midnight and had to be back at work at 7am. 1 day you'll work late nights the next day early in the morning the following day midday for 4 hrs (waste of gas) The cashiers are treating like they're dirt. They forget to give you your breaks. When I tried to move to another dept. they wouldnt let me even though i qualified and had started training they even started writing me up for bogus stuff just so i'd be ineligible for advancement for 6 months. The managers act like they're the popular kids in h.s. instead of acting professional. The pay isnt great either especially from a big chain like that. Save yourself the time headache and horrible work experience and apply ANYWHERE else but Walmart
bad,Hard to work for if you donot have a family then u are ok. No help at all.
bad,hardest part of this job at the time was being able to talk to your managers or assitant mangers when you needed to
bad,wal-mart is not a place I would recamend to anyone the management dosent comunicate with each other so orders are always diffrent they dont pay for the work they want I am a sales associte that is told to do a department managers job.
bad,"I am a Frozen and Dairy Sales Associate. My duties have included stocking all frozen and dairy freezers and refrigerators, checking of any outdated items, unloading and receiving frozen and dairy trucks, checking product temperatures and placing them in the proper locations, cleaning and eliminating ice buildup, lifting boxes and transferring product onto the floor along with many other tasks."
bad,I have worked for this place for over a year and have found out that everyone will stab you in the back.
bad,bad place to work did not like the staff dealing wiyh co workers breaks
bad,some co workers very unproductive managements ability to set realistic goal and adapt to crisis situations very poor. hardest part of job managers switching your task every ten minutes most enjoyable part when people got it straight.
bad,I personally did not like the work envirnment or employeers or employees and would suggest avoiding employment by any means
bad,While working there I noticed morale declining throughout the workplace once new management took over. The previous manager was great and would do anything for the employees and threw parties and gave the employees great bonuses. Once the new management came in all of that came to a halt and productivity quickly declined. Benefits went away and so did all of the extra incentives that made employees actually care to work. If you are trying to better yourself the company will not work around your school schedule and will look for any reason at all to get rid of you. The company wants people that do not have an opinion and if you speak up about an issue or an OSHA standard they will terminate you.
bad,"A typical night at work was assisting customers with locating an item , if needed . I worked as an overnight cashier and I truly enjoyed customer service. Gaving great customer service included sharing information about sale items and ringing the items as quickly as possible. At the end of a transaction I would thank them and tell them to have a nice night / day.The most enjoyable part of the job was being told how grateful the customer was for my excellent service to include a nice smile and a professional attitude.Just knowing that the customer was satisfied helped to make myjob easy.The hardest part of the job was listening to the lies that managers would tell and putting up with their ""I don't care "" attitudes. Their lack of knowledge and trust made it hard to work there."
bad,"me gusta trabajar soy responsable, enfocado a resultados de margen ,ventas, señalizacion, acomodo de bodegas PEPS, he aprendido a trabajar bajo precion en equipo,"
bad,"Well a typical day at walmart was.. Clocking in then heading to the front, Check people out all day inless I got pulled to help in the back room..."
bad,Things were better when the old management was there & the focus was on family & the customers now it seems the emphsis is mhow much money can you make but not take into acoount the employees.
bad,"walmart no longer views its associates as people, they expect us to work is hostile enviroments. they use fear to keep people from expecting respect, or reporting ethics violations. a large number of their employees need welfare to make up for their poor wages."
bad,A day at Walmart Learning to price match. I learned alot with the customers help. It was hard learning because i would have to accept what they said about prices at other stores. My accomplishments were that i helped others in there needs and let them know they are welcomed back and theyll get exactly what they need.
bad,Enjoyable with the fact that I had a lot of different customer interaction. Co Workers were cool to work with. Management could have been better as far as following the same rules.
bad,"A typical day consisted of putting back together the store. I learned many lessons here. It is a great way to get INTO retail and then leave after lessons are learned. This place is not for the young. Management (salary) was, malevolent. If there was a benelovent member of management, they were not there long and was fired for a rediculous reason. They would help you if they feel like it and then punish you for taking the help. Co-workers are what get you through the shifts. If you help them, they'll help you. It's a team building enviroment. The hardest part of the job was working nights. I enjoyed working with the people who were there and helped me. I made many friends."
bad,Its ok for now to work here but the management sucks and its overall a mess
bad,"This Co. has changed alot over the years that I have been there. By reducing hours, not regulating the management staff and hours they work. DOES NOT BELEIVE IN REAL TRAINING,SINK OR SWIM MANTALITY. WORST BENEFITS PACKAGE IN THE INDUSTRY."
bad,i work at here for two months and i worked hard. i could not finish my job everyday because i was to busy being called to do other people jobs. i worked in the grocery department stocking. i was always called to the register and to pull the trucks and clean up messes and to straighten up other departments. they would come around and ask why my job was not done and it was because i was called to other jobs. i enjoyed working with the customer.
bad,I asistent mangers and department managers give more work than one person can do they bully people in to doing what they want and when you dont they retalleat agenst you
bad,"A job that pays so little only to demand more of your time in a flexible state which doesn't give you the consideration to make life ends meet by having and addtional job. You only get advanced if you're the ""favorite one"". It's good to start off with for a temporarily job, but not permanent if you're seeking financial stability or growth from your education and/or experience. It's unfortunate that a billion dollars company boasts on its achievement and success, but can't even pay their employees at least sustainable amount with decent hours of work to suit second job or school life."
bad,"In my 10 years of working for Wal-Mart. I would say that its management to hourly relations is poor to say the least. Its poor wage compensation, management poor follow up and bullying techniques towards its hourly associates is the worst. Its overpriced medical insurance that does not cover much and poor associate moral."
bad,"walmart itself is fine, typical retail..but management at the stores is horendous...i have never been so disrespected and treated to so badly as i have by the walmart management. there is no room for advancement, and you are easily replaced, as they tell you daily. i gave 5 years to this company only to be kicked aside in the end."
bad,.. Aweful.. They want to keep you part-time to keep from taking care of your health...
bad,"A typical work day very very bad no help from Management what so ever, they expect you to do everything and they speak down to you as if you was a child of theirs. Very VERY HORRIBLE PLACE TO WORK FOR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,Walmart is an everchanging company but as they want the world to believe the associate is the last one to recieve care or consideration not only that but walmart recently sold out their TLE's to jiffy lube only telling TLE employees of this venture mon the 9 the techs can either become jiffy lube techs or try to apply for parttime positions inside neither of which are guarantee way to go walmart show america how much you really care. Walmart is always shorting full time associates with the goal to put them down to part time and offer no benefits a multibillion dollar company could surely do better.
bad,Customer service along with various departments cleaning and knowing the products. Cash transactions with cash credit along with various orders
bad,They expect for one person to finish a tremendous amount of work in a very short period of times. They do not care about their employees. Many people would quit in a short term.
bad,Horrible company to work for. Took away employee benefits. No internal promotion. Leaderless management. People from Arkansas trying to run a dot.com isn't working.
bad,"If you value your personal life, i would suggest looking else where. They don't pay for over time and if you do have to work over time they will ask/tell you if you want a job you will clock out and work anyways. I don't know if they have fixed that or not but that is what they did"
bad,Advanced is virtually impossible. The review speaks for itself
bad,"worst job i ever had. consideration of employees is awful. their attitude is who cares what the employees think, plenty are waiting for a job. just awful"
bad,Great opportunity to meet new people and expand my learning ability
bad,Hated working hear
bad,Walmart is a terrible company to work for in any position or job title.
bad,"Too many managers pulling employes in different directions. Horrible pay, bad benefits."
bad,not a very good place to work at the pay is not good at all. the peolpe dont care how they take care of there employees
bad,Walmart mangers were horrible they didn't care for there employees or for there outside life as far as family. Some managers and supervisors treat you as if your worthless and as if your a child back in school their disrespectful towads you and they talk down to some of there employees they also have there favorites as well.
bad,"There is never a ""typical day at Walmart, because every day is differs. There are days when the flow of day goes good, meaning the customers are nice and you don't have a pile of work that exceeds the short time you are there. Then there are the days when you are working 4 1/2 hours are you work load consists of of 8 hours, the customers are not in a good mood, you might get hit or called out your name or even cursed out."
bad,"Absolutely the worst company to work for ever. Poor management, horrible pay, total lack of regard for employees."
bad,A typical day at work is mainly the same everyday. Unloading the truck and pulling pallects to the sales floor. What I learn is you come to your work place to work. Not to make friends. Management is one of the harder things to deal with because not everyone are on the same page as they should be. The Co workers are some what easy to work with. Its the fact that everyone want to do it their way and not the right way. The hardest part of the job is unloading the truck. At times we may not have enough staff for that day and it may take longer then it should. The most enjoyable part of the job would be lunch. You get one hour to relax and regroup.
bad,Its An Okay Job Just Need More Hours Better Pay And A Career Job .
bad,"Show up, get told what to do, get excepted to do impoosible tasks in one day, get yelled at all day long, go home. Do same thing the next day."
bad,"Everyday was mainly about working your department, whether it be stocking, cashiering, or working customer service. the hardest part was showing up, the enjoyable part was the paycheck, even if it was a little small."
bad,Associates dont have coordination because of poor management. They cut off employees which adds more pressure and work to those who stayed.
bad,great its a cashier job that does not offer benefits or fulltime hours
bad,A typical day at Wal-mart is being asked to do the impossible every day and expected to do it with a smile. The co-workers for the most part are good we all can relate to eachother. There is always that click just like in high school that somehow never get in trouble and are always being promoted. The hardest part of the job is trying to enjoy any part of it.
bad,Not a good place to work at all. Place ads with temp. services for temp. to hire positions. Have people coming back year after year for temp. positions and never hire any of these people for full-time positions even though they have an application on file. Hire outside for full-time positions right in from of the temp. employees while they are on the job. Bad practices
bad,"the upper levels of management in this company are all about the bottom line. there is no heart left in this company for the individual worker. having worked for this company for almost 29 years I can say that when Mr. Sam Walton passed away the company changed and not for the better. Mr. Sam's philosophy was ""take care of your people and they will take care of you""! This is certainly not the case anymore. this company overworks the people who are employed there. they do not hire enough people to do the work that they expect to be done, but still expect everything to be done and be perfect. they look for reasons to push the long term people out the door and if they cant find them they nit pick until the person gives up and quits"
bad,"I did not like this job at all. I would never recommend this job to anybody. Management was terrible, they worked you to the bone with no praise, accused of things I didnt do on shift, managers argued with me for no reason or no fault of my own. Overall horrible."
bad,Walmart will not hire you full time that way they wont have to pay for insurance.
bad,"Working overnight or during the day, management is rude, uncaring, incompetent and untrustworthy. Policies change almost monthly and you are not informed. Benefits are bad, but you will be fired if sick too often. Some employees have passed, but we are not notified and cards are not sent to family. Some Store Managers are verbally or physically abusive to Co-Managers. HR investigations or allegations of harassment or discrimination is not taken seriously and leads to nothing. Managers may only deal with lost children in store if they have time or are not busy. They do not pay maternity leave. Paperwork for approved schedule changes, days off or any other important documentation may be lost or disposed of, so an original copy must be maintained at all times."
bad,Since Sam Walton died I have seen and heard from the old timers at WalMart how much the company does not care about thier employees. I seen it my self as well. Pay sucks the benifits suck they take from the employees to keep costs down so they can keep thier prices cheap. When we are in the slow time of the year they look for ways to fire people again to keep costs down and thier bonuses high. I was fired during the slow time of year and seen it happen every year I was there which was 4.5 years. Hate this company they don't care who the hurt to thier profits high.
bad,i hated this job!!! Barely saw my kids and i only worked part time (under 30 hrs a week). They dont treat their employees right.
bad,"1.Just waiting ,counting the minutes till you were in trouble.2.Extreem favortisum.3.Management non careing,judgementle,clickie,non-appreciative,absolutily not on employees side.4.Associates running scared of Management,good co-workes.5.Hardest,keeping your job.6.The Customers."
bad,worst company i've ever worked for.
bad,Not a good place to work staff dont work well with you or talk to you in a good manner
bad,"If there were things that hadnt been done during my shift, i had to stay and finish which was not a problem. But then the next day i would have to either take a longer lunch or go home early to make up for the hours i stayed. The managers were not communicating with each other and would each tell us to do different things at the same time. Co- workers would come in drunk, throw the merchandise when angry, and walk around goofing off instead of doing there job."
bad,"This new store opened august 2011, most management was inexperienced, hired in from lower levels and performed with a assertive incompetence. Most employees that worked hard were being over worked, picking up the slack for others. Management deployed many double standards such as holding others accountable for others mistakes. Example, excessive product orders, counter-productive work efforts, lack of proper training, multiple working standards for different shifts and work/safety methods per different manager. This in turn brought down moral and overall productivity."
bad,"A typical day at work is watching all the managers (when they're around, which is seldom) standing or walking around, but not really doing anything productive, especially when it got busy and there were long lines. What I learned is that they are deceptive in their practices. The management told me I had to use a ladder to get merchandise from the top shelves in my department as part of my job, and the safety department told us not to use the ladders. However, if we chose to obey the safety department's rules, then we would get fired for not doing our job."
bad,My review of Walmart is simple: the employee work many duties and work hard but are paid very little.
bad,"Working for Walmart was the worst experience of my life. They treat women as if we were beneath them and treated me with no respect and no appreciation. I was talked to and treated like a 3 year old and made to feel like I was worthless no matter how hard I worked and all the extras I volunteered for,"
bad,it was hard labor and you dont get payed for what your work for.
bad,didnt like me missing work due to my nanny dying so they fired me
bad,uncooperative management and work force. long hours little pay.
bad,"I was excited about getting back into the pharmaceutical world, but I soon was taken on the craziest roller coaster ride. I could write a book but I will refrain. My advice is to stay far away!"
bad,"I worked there for almost a year and they have no values at all. Everything about them was wrong, customer service, pay, benefits, management. But the job was extremely easy, until management notices how easy it is and moves you to another department and tries to fire you for moving to slow. I didn't enjoy any of it because of the management."
bad,Horrible place to work for. Bad management.
bad,At work i would just be ringing up customers at the register. I just learned how to use the register. The hardest part of working at walmart is putting up with the management. There are not the most enjoyable managers to be around.
bad,Would not recommend anybody for this job. They harass and threaten your job daily. Very large turnover in employees.
bad,I'm not quite sure how people that work at there do it but they put on a big smile and make it seem like its the best place ever to work i beg the different.....
bad,deli work did all the cleaning at night and served the customers and the management never stuck up for staff. customer is always correct.
bad,"A day at walmart is a chronical routine wich is unload the truck organize the merchandise and stock the sales floor.Managment was not always on task and unorganize.Co-workers were always working hard but never got support from the managment.The hardest part of work was the unloading process at walmart, no teamwork and no managment support.Replenishment would be the most enjoyable part of the job just because it gave me a chace to interact with customers."
bad,Go work at Walmart Bashford Manor in Louisville if you want to be the only one working and held accountable. Then have management bully you and say you are not working hard enough.
bad,A typical day involves me securing and selling high-priced cell phones while performing the duties of an Electronics Sales Associate and covering between two and five other departments as well. It is a fast-paced job that requires me to balance customer service with the execution of the duties required to maintain my department and push sales.
bad,"just not enough pay for any work done there,great people to work with"
bad,"The management is so blind and unguided. They have absolutely no idea what they are doing. The department managers are completely clueless and unless you hang out with them you will not get far in this store (Port Isabel). I recommend everyone stay away from applying here unless you're in a major need of whatever job you can get your hands on. The pay sucks as well by the way starting 7.36 compared to other jobs that start you off over 8.00 they want to make you a slave for them. Since when are cashiers supposed to clean windows, dust carpets, wash and clean vending machines, mop entrances, and use harmful materials without proper care. Sounds like a maintenance job to me."
bad,I would strongly recommend working somewhere else. Work for a local grocer or establishment where management values you like a person not a body.
bad,"You have to automatically get straight to work, there was no time to prepare yourself for your shift. When you needed management, they were no where to be found. Great co-workers!"
bad,The management needed to be replaced. There needs to be more workers in all of the dept. Some of the cashiers need to be replaced. The things that I have bought from the store is not worth buying cus it either broke or did not do what is supposed to say it does. There is know values or resepect in the company. It seems that everyone is only out for themselfs. Bottom line is this company is not worth the air I breath or my time or effort either.
bad,Did not care for personal issues such as medical problems or needs. Very unorganized and relentless to keep privacy statements to themselves.
bad,Walmart is the most horrible company to work for no good benefits. If you do get benefits you have to pay majority of your paycheck to get them. Management is terrible.
bad,"If you need any job work for them, just expect to have so much work you can never really get it done, and if you do manage to there is always more and they management never really seems happy there always under pressure so you work for no real compensation. Also they hire fire alot so expect to do other peoples work and to be expected to do work you have no real good idea about."
bad,"I had no choice but to work this job as long as I did, there were a lot of hard work for cheap pay. The managers were extremely lazy in helping there associates with recquired needs. This was a very shocking view of a greedy world, honestly what I learned through my 8 months working here."
bad,"The wal-mart job was a desperate move, great employee, and some managers but wouldnt recomment anyone to the job...."
bad,"Answered questions regarding the store and its merchandise.Computed sales prices, total purchases and processed payments.Greeted customers and ascertained customers' needs.Maintained knowledge of current promotions, policies regarding payment and exchanges, and security practices.Maintained records related to sales.Prepared sales slips and sales contracts.Recommended merchandise based on customer needs."
bad,"Day starts off with a meeting where management gives a review of sales for the day. After that the members of the staff find an available ""Price Scanner"" around the store to see what tasks they have for the night. Working at Wal-Mart I am learning what not to do when running a business. Me and my co-workers work together trying to find solutions to work more efficient but once we get a plan going management steps in to mess it up, its like they are against us. The home office and managers over each department to a terrible job when ordering merchandise. We get a ridiculous surplus daily of products that don't sell well and barely get the products that sell. The job is not hard manage just makes it hard. The best part of my job is working and interacting with my co-workers something management doesn't like us to do."
bad,the management was ok. the most enjoyable time in my job at wal mart is when i got off work
bad,"They do not respect they're employees no matter how hard you work you get nothing unless you suck up to the bosses, they make your life impossible to live and you do 4 peoples job for a half a person's pay."
bad,"Typical day at work. Worked on the cash register checked the customers out. What i learned how to run a register, and how to deal with the public. Management I think they were ok did not have a problem with them. Enjoyed my co-workers, we would help each other bag groceries if we did not have customers. the hardest part of the job was dealing with mean customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was at the end of the shift got to go home."
bad,To many managers and always was overloaded with work and not enough time to finish it
bad,"My typical day at walmart was boring but I made it work for me. I learn a lot my positon I didn't know it was different types of veggie or fruit. The management is horrible they didn't have no store director at all. My co workers I really don't know I came there to do a job not, but ones I did know they were amazing. The hardest part of my job was lifting all those bananas. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was lunch."
bad,this company thought that the associates and the managers
bad,they treat their employers badly management had no respect didnt pay for what they wanted you to do
bad,Management was too busy to help and solve problems. They expect you to work over 10 hours one shift only to force you to cut hours the rest of the pay period by shorteniong shifts or going into the computer and changing your time punches. If you do not you were punsihed. Deli was often short staffed.
bad,The store I happened to work at was not a very good place to work. Management is not very nice or professional.
bad,I felt like i was doing the job of three people. i received a 40cent raise after working there for one and a half years.
bad,"Walmart is a very coporate ran company. Store management has little say as to what goes on in your store. Management doesn't care about how much work you have, but they always expect you to get it done. They have a quota, if your quota is 10 hours they still expect you to finish it during your 8 hour shift. Most of their ""programs"" make any sense, and when they fail they are too stubborn to remove them. So, you get stuck with a bunch of bad ""programs"" that negatively effect they way you work or how your store runs. They have quarterly bonuses but the people who set the projections set them super high so it's almost impossible to get any bonus, and if you do it is too small to be significant.Walmart is good as a very last resort because they are constantly hiring with their very high turnover rate, however, if you still have options left out there I would try those first, second, and third."
bad,"Horrible company to work for. They give little to no help and expect you to have an a + department. No ones willing to lend a hand but your expected to. Worst 3 years of my life. Management helped when they needed to: before a corporate visit, inventory, and their was an occasional few who cared and helped their associates."
bad,"Managment was extremely rude, I didn't want to work for them at all. Every day I would go into work with a cloud of depression. They treated me like complete garbage."
bad,"Culture has change to more inpersonal management team,"
bad,It si not a good company to work
bad,Walmart is having too many turn overs for employees. Management treat you like you are slaves. They cut your hours and your pay is little to none.
bad,"From my employ during 3/1/2004-8/4/2006, I went from a slightly positive attitude about WalMart to a conviction it is the worst thing that ever happened to the U.S. I have witnessed in my employ such things as disposal of paint cans in garbage dumpsters, severe infighting in store between employees, abuse of safety regulations, verbal abuse from superiors, negligence on part of store managers. I was accused of failure to be team player because contractor left ceiling tile open in food cooler, and no other employee attempted to put it back in place as I did my job as maintenance associate. My walkie did not receive the call, I could not hear the PA call, and was held accountable for it. We were required to push only ten carts at a time, and had no assistance from inside associates until massive call-offs during holidays began occurring. There is no hygiene requirement, as one employee has been caught scratching her groin and rear, and still works as a cashier. There is no requirement for quality product, as entire pallets of food have been written off."
bad,"This is a company that Sam Walton built on family values. Since his death, Walmart has not continued Sam's dream for his business."
bad,the pay was not good and the benfits were not good. the hours were few and they did not give women positions that only men have
bad,"Working for Wal-Mart was the worst mistake of my life, the management team expected my team in electronics/connection center to take care of our customers, customers in toys, soft lines, put our stock away and be on front line as well and most of the time we were short handed. My customers are what kept me there but I would absolutely not work for Wal-Mart again."
bad,"long hours no life at all, management sucks and doesnt care about employees and pay is awful!!!"
bad,"The worst place I have ever worked, they treat people very badly write you up on a whim and pay you peanuts I will never work or even shop there again"
bad,"This job has poor management skills, you apply for one position but they require you to do jobs you did not apply for. Hours are cut around holiday season and they do not allow full time so you get no benefits until working their for two years. They talk to you bad and treat you as if your just a item instead of a team member."
bad,they not a good place to work for and the reason is the pay sucks.
bad,I worked in the middle of a mall. I had to convinece people to stop and talk to me about cell phones. I loved every moment of it.
bad,"Ok so this is the third time I am attempting this somehow the first two reviews disappeared on me without sending I think so I will say this I feel that the employees are underpaid and often are not given respect, many managers need to be put in their place, there should be more job opportunities full time, their hiring and promoting methods are questionable, after four years I put in for a transfer to the city I now live after a month they did a phone interview said they would be back with me in a couple days they had three more people to interview I never heard back and this really ticked me off I was not coming in as a new hire why should I have to go through new hire procedures and why could I not have the courtesy of some kind of response. If you are looking for a job and can find something else I would strongly recommend it."
bad,There was no typical day which is okay but there was just no pleasing management and everyone was so stressed out because of this. The hardest part of this job was just showing up and the best part of this job was going home.
bad,Only if you need a job.
bad,the management at the walmart in st Albert are not nice at all to there workers.
bad,A typical day at work with fun employees. What I learned was getting to know about the warehouse work. Management was okay at times. Coworkers were just fine and friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was trying not to hurt yourself lifting heavy work. The most enjoyable part of the job was pay day.
bad,"The people you work with for the most part are great, but its run like a clique in High school, favoritism runs rampant, and if you leave them you get bad references even though thats illegal."
bad,"Unless you are well liked by management, no way your climbing the ladder. Poor management skills by all managers. No people skills at all for the store manager. In my situation, they allowed ""hear say"" with no actual proof."
bad,"I hated working at Walmart, they hire you for 1 position and then make you work every where else but the position you were hired for. If you decide that you don't want to work where they ask you to work, then you get wrote up."
bad,"People are not ever scheduled to come in to work correctly. No one ever shows up for work in all the departments. Management have unrealistic goals for department completion. They hold you liable for your co-workers not coming in. The pre shift meeting is not to just tell you what you will be doing but to talk down and yell at the employees for someone else mistakes. They say the open door policy will help you but it won't. Anyone that has left or got fired can only come back if they kiss managements' BUTTS. Then they make you start over on probation even if you worked the department your in now. No one is ever there. Go see for yourself, The Wal-Mart is located on Vandyke and 14 mile in Sterling Heights, MI. This place is a joke, Great company to work for but steer clear of any store with management issues, ask around first!!!"
bad,Show too much favortism towards certain people and step on or around other employees especially the persons that are slower in speed to get the work done..Poor training/management thinks that showing someone a 10 min lesson on learning how to run a cash register should be sufficient enough and that person who has never run a cash register should be able to work on thier own and have management turn around and say you dont have what it takes to do this job
bad,I was fired while hospitalized. I was called on my lunch break to assist in a apprehension and management failed to tell me that they stole a Hunting Knife. I put in a bad situation.
bad,I am an electronics specialist who was sent to houseware? I also unloaded a truck by myself (because the people that are actually paid to unload the truck wouldn't do it) on one of the hottest days of the summer. I was fired for mixing paint for a customer nobody else would mix paint for. Management did not support me taking college courses. If I had a choice between Sitting at home and Walmart? With Walmart being the only place in the world that a person could work at? I'd choose to sit at home. PS: They still owe me $90!
bad,Company does not care about its employees. The only thing that they are concerned with is the business itself.
bad,This company does not care about its wmployees and you can not advance within the company if you don't know the right people
bad,"I was hired to do one job, and as they found out that I was able to learn quickly on the job I soon found myself being thrown around the store to go do this or that. I was working a managers position on a sales associates paygrade. I also had to fight for my hours, and the managers wouldn't work well together. This was not enjoyable, and after 6 months of working there I was already out."
bad,"i worked in TLE did shelve stocking and lubrication,oil,tires etc. the job was cool the people i worked for however weren't the most intelligent people, or the cleanest."
bad,"You get out of your employees what you put into them. The company is a joke Billions made a year yet workers live in subsidized housing, only eating because of food stamps, and are only alive because Medicaid. The co-workers are amazing people but the company itself is a horrible company."
bad,"You don't get the pay you deserve for all the hard work you do and the work is overwhelming. No benefits such as health care, vision or dental. You try to find full time work because you need to take care of family and yourself. I couldn't get a full time job after working for over 2 years part time because I was going to school full time. After finishing my education I couldn't find a full time job at the company, so I left. Brutal working conditions for low wages."
bad,"Working For ""Wally-World"" Had Always Been A Dream Job Of Mine Even In My days of Primary Education. So Believe Me, 19 Years Later When I Actually Got My Chance At Working For Wal-Mart I Was Totally 900% Ecstatic. However Within The First Couple Of Days, My Zealous Enthusiasm Turned Into Horror. I was being Over-Worked When The ""Other"" Co-Workers CHOSE ""Not"" To Show-Up For Work. Oh Yeah Sure, Those 1st Several Weeks I Was Making ""Great"" Money; And Being ""Patted-On-The-Back"" For All Of My Hard Labor. Notwithstanding Though As The Weeks Turned Into Months, And Then To Years -- I Seen How My Dedication/Hard Labor Was Being ""TOTALLY"" Taken Advantage Of. I'd come home dead-Tired, And Then Berated The Next Day For ""Needing"" To Pick-Up My Pace. So That My Co-Workers Wouldn't Have So Much Work To Do, When They Came In."
bad,They Are High On Themselves And Act As If They Are A Higher Race Of Human And They Treat Their Employees Like Slave Labor And Have No Respect For Their Fellow Man.
bad,"management treats employees like they are beneath them, very stressful workplace, benefits are expensive, hours are long, pay is low, there is no overtime pay but always overtime work required, you must take longer lunches to not have overtime on your paychecks"
bad,"Management make up the rules as they go. Shift consistantly begin with threats of loosing your job. No standards for employees; everyone uses profanity at all hours of the day, with no regard for others, themselves and customers alike. The hardest part of the job is not having the proper direction from higharchy and the most enjoyable part is lunch time."
bad,Management sucks and it is a very stressful job. They don't appreciate anything you do. They are always speaking negativity about you.
bad,"Granted, it is wonderful if you are part of the geriatric crowd or struggled to graduate from high school. For anyone who is looking for advancement in a career, go elsewhere. I'm not saying its impossible, and at some stores it happens rather quickly. I'm just saying at the Walmart I work at, in Moberly, you will not advance. You will only get the minimum raise available. You will not be recognized for hard work. On the plus side, if you've been there long enough, you won't be fired even if you call in repeatedly. I haven't figured out if it is because of nepotism or having to pay workman's comp, but they will not fire some associates no matter how worthless they are. There is only a limited number of full time slots available, and they are held by the older associates... the aged and feeble minded ones."
bad,You could break your neck at Wal-Mart and it wouldn't be their fault. Don't work for this company.
bad,They do not care one bit about any of their employees.. no matter what department you work in
bad,"I felt that it would be a great opportunity for me to be hired as a new employee in a new WalMart. Wow, was I wrong. The training is terrible, and is basically learn and goof up as you go. I don't know how many times I have told a customer that ""I don't know"" as I was never trained. The scheduling is terrible, a ""daylight"" shift can be 2pm to 11pm. Ridiculous. Management is aloof an unapproachable, and the levels of management takes a college degree to decipher. Customer sevice is not a priority at this WalMart, and the floor associates and Zone Managers would rather hide than help ring out customers. Zone Managers are snotty and rude, and look out if you have to ask one a question. I am supposed to be an hourly supervisor, but am treated as an outsider as a CSM. For some reason, this WalMart looks down on those who should be the most important-the people who take care of the customer directly. And don't come in the door with any experience as this place doesn't want to improve and doesn't want your expertise, either. This place needs a very serious review of WalMart's ""Three Beliefs"", particularly ""Respect for the Individual"" as it is nonexistent."
bad,"was a cart -pusher/helped customers out w/packages., worked part/time. Learned how to work w/ muliti-cultured associates.The hardest part was dodging cars in the parking lot---smile . the most enjoyable part was being around fellow associates that had multi skilles."
bad,"Working for Wal-Mart was never easy. The typical day involved stressful hard work, way too fast pace, and more work than could be done by one person. Management was the worst I have ever had. They did not care for any of the workers. We where nothing but numbers on paper. It would have been better if we workers where “Robots” or “Slaves” then we would have under stood the situation."
bad,"Management forces you to work off the clock and enjoys tripling/quadrupling/quintupling your work load without additional help. They enjoy putting employees into corners where they are forced to violate the companies imagionary policies, which management doesn't even uphold, and when they do so they are disiplined uncluding up to termination. Store managers like to put store assistant managers with no specific department experience in charge of that department. They will make you work 10 & 12 hour days and not pay for that overtime, instead they will deduct the overtime from your last day of that pay period, and still expect your job to be completed in the hour or two you worked that day. Absolutely no paid days off, company policy denies ALL hourly employes paid time off (including maternity pay), vacation time isn't allowed nor approved. The best part of the job is when you no longer work there."
bad,I still shop my local Walmart only because they save me money and I like to see some of my excoworkers. Walmart screwed me over due to presonal isues and not proffesional ones.
bad,"I do not like working for the Walmart company. They Hire as a part time associate and work you full time hours to avoid giving you benefits. They treat their employees horrible. I have learned verry good customer services skills working for Walmart, my co-workers are great to work with. The hardest part about my job is working on the weekends. I have a 1 year old that I hardly get to see to begin with and working all the time I never get to see him. The most enjoyable part of my job is some of the people I work with."
bad,"Worst place to work. Terrible pay, work you like slaves, no family time, management is basically a bunch of children in nice clothes that rely on the people there to make the decisions for them."
bad,I didn't like how i was treated as an employer and i was cheated on my hours. I wasn't treated fairly in sensitive matters that needed to be dealt with in a professional manner. They are not a employer that treats their employee's decent...
bad,it was a good enviroment to work in and the people are great awesome food and awesome employees
bad,"They don't work with you, expect more than they pay for and wonder why they have such a high turn over."
bad,Terrible people to work for. They degrade you as much as possible. Make rules and management never follows them. Never praise a person on job well done. Keeping anomosity to get more production. They do not want friendships being made there.
bad,"the job would be ok if they had better management, they ask you to do your job and everyone's elses as well"
bad,The worst place I have ever worked! Low pay. Most people dont do anything. Treats customers and employees bad. Terrible managers.
bad,"I don't like to bash places, but its all about the money not the help or customers. They have horrible policies that help witht the turnover of employees. to get cheaper help"
bad,i dod not like any of the management team and every one is stuck up and think they r better than you but thats just my oppinon
bad,"Worked for Wal-Mart for 11 years. When I first started, I enjoyed working for the company but they have lost their game over the years. They do not care about employees or customers. I was being harassed by store manager and they refused to do anything because he was golf partners with his boss. DO NOT WORK FOR WAL-MART"
bad,"horrible management, they treat u bad they dont work with you for school days, hours are horrible wouldnt recommend anyone working there"
bad,Associates are not respected nor are they cared for. The hard work and dedication is not rewarded and that is evident in the pay that the associates receive.
bad,Worst place I ever worked for... They dont care about their employees even slightly... They talk a big game but thats all it is... TALK!
bad,No advancement is possible to Over night associates. Impossible and heavy work load.
bad,Only work here if you are extremely desperate. This place is a joke.
bad,employment here is a last result
bad,I use to work for Walmart worst place I ever worked in my life!!
bad,"I could not stand any of the supervisors there, they were very ignorant but if there were different supervisors that worked there then I would of loved that job."
bad,Bad management the company has no regard for there employees. Benefits are not good if your part-time you have no room for growth.
bad,WalMart is not concerned about the employee. There only concern is making money.
bad,Walmart does not provide any sorts of job security you can be fired at any time for any reason. Salaried managers/ Store managers or very rude and if they dont like you they will put a target on you and you will be fired over something anything. Job advancement to department supervisor positions is not difficult but once you get that promotion be expecting too work harder and more over worked then anyone.
bad,I would not recommended people to work for Walmart because of the abusive nature that Walmart has towards people with disabilities.
bad,No fun to work....extremely stressful and the employees have horrible attitudesincluding some of the management
bad,just dont work for this company unless you have no other choice. they dont care about their employees at all
bad,I do not have any thing good to say about Walmart. I had to have dental surgery I went to my personal manger and told her what was going on she told me that i needed to fill out a leave of abuses so i did which was not approved after she told me everything would be okay.
bad,"They ask a lot of their employees, pay nothing, are inflexible, will fire you at the drop of a hat and bend you over to save a dime."
bad,"Management is terrible, no one wants to listen , pass the buck on everything. I told one I saw someone stealing they said they don't get paid to do security. I was so dissappointed in them. Sadly the open door policy is a sham. You don't feel welcome to talk to any management."
bad,Overall dirty place to work the employees a'rent happy to work there. The wages are low and the customers are very rude.
bad,Employees poor. Fighting for hours. Most of staff related. They get away with alot. Mgmt covers eyes to what is going on.
bad,They tell you that they run a family freindly workplace and they want you to have fun in a safe and productive way. Then they coach you and ultimately fire you if you do have fun. even though you are still being safe and productive. They even coach you ( which is a bad thing there) for talking to your fellow employees while you are working and still being productive.
bad,"Very poor benefits, extremely poor mgmt, constantly reorganizing almost quarterly."
bad,"I was harassed by my co-workers on a daily basis. I was labled a thief,a homosexual, and anti-social. I reported these problems to mgr. mark. He did nothing to stop any of it. The mgrs. have no morals or ethics. it is like working on a jr. high play ground. A bomb theart was called in to the store mgr. Mark had all the associates look for a bomb. He endangered everyone in the store. While he cowered with rest of the mgrs. in the locked office. After that I lost all respect for him. At the start of each shift he wants everyone to do a little cheer that is just embarrissing, at the enf of it he jumps around and says 5370 working safe is the way to go. He is the most unsafe person I've ever worked with. He walks in front of a 2 ton scrubber machine all the time. This is the example he sets for every one to see. Some one is going to get killed some day by that machine. Mgr. Mark is a compete and total hippocrit."
bad,I would not recamend working for Wal-Mart i feel that the managers treat their employees poorly!
bad,They treat employees like robots. You can work hard or slack off and you will most likely get the same raise every year.
bad,the company was not for the employees happiness at all just about making money and that was all.
bad,"3 days on 3 days off for thirteen hours is a terrible schedule. No home life, off with wife 2 times a month. No communication with other assistant that worked your three days off. Bad Comanger in store tried to be dominate male. Other Comanager or myself build as feature , then he comes in a wastes time moving it. He was never happy with 40 pallets ran during day. Associates forced to work on freight during day and did not treat customers with respect. How could they , if they got in trouble for not stocking frieght fast enough. Customer service was ""go away it is over there, leave me alone, I have to stock shelves"". They had 100 Letter to the Presidents in one month I was there. I left a Neighborhood Market because I could not move up . They would not hire or promote out of small format stores. I only worked for Bash for 1 month and am now unemployed. I told them I had Fibromyalgia and they did not care if I did or not. I worked 4 days and 53 hours and had my first day off. I was called to hours from 8 P.M. to work thirds and jerk would not take no for an answer. I could not work thirds with no sleep and Fibromyalgia. They would have to call an ambulance for me that night to take me to hospital. This was a high shrink store also, they would just push cart loads out to the Neighborhood around the store. I guy got a gun shoved in his face, duct taped, kidnapped, car jacked and thrown out into the street by two thugs four days after I left. No one cared about me."
bad,"a company that does not care about good workers,they fire people for something they did not do"
bad,is very complicated working for a company like walmart. Theres so many managers that the communication isn't there. If u do something thats told of you than you still will get in trouble by a different boss and so on.
bad,I did not enjoy my time in this company. They are very quick to pass judgments on employees. No one is treated fairly. I was in a situation where they were willing to go above and beyone for one employee but not for myself even temporarily. I would not return to work for this company.
bad,"This position fulfill my ""I need a job"" requirements. The hours were tough. It's only purpose was that it was a job. The people I worked with were GREAT but that has nothing to do with the company"
bad,I worked at Wal-Mart for a short period of time. Loved the customers! Management was very poor and only cared about getting their pay checks!
bad,The Walmart in Port Huron MI is a bad place to work to say the least. No job security! Everyday good people are scared they will get fired because of cutbacks. The store has to make a certain amount or else the corporate locations will make them cut back any way possible.
bad,Wal Mart was a very unwilling to complay with me on my terms for my pregancy and forced me to take my leave early; then when it was time for me to return to work; they tried to make me do work that i was not release from my DR. to do. I would not recomend this place for work to anyone.
bad,"I have seen the allot of people in the Area of the store, and allot have to wait forever for someone to help them an no one does, because they are doing what their boss ask them to do, then get mad and ask to talk to Managers, and the Managers talk to the Associate, but then the associate does more an more times."
bad,"Walmart in Seekonk, MA I have to say is horrible. They are always trying to catch you doing something wrong. Some of the management is nice, to a point and other are just mean or crazy. Example, I worked in the Electronics portion of Walmart. We had to arrange the Video games in plastic cases a certain way. The manager showed us how to do it ""Exactly how they wanted it to be done"" So it was done to there standards. Same manager comes by the next day and starts complaining that it wasn't done right and rips the video games off the shelf and tell us to do it over again. Another example same manager. Some one had left a box of swiffer on the counter and in front of a customer also interrupting the employee helping the customer, the manager start yelling that the table need to always be cleaned and flings the box on to the floor and walks away. The employee apologized to the customer. The customer replied its ok, I feel sorry for you. That's just two examples."
bad,"Walmart cares too much on just the profits and not enough on their employees. They overwork the staff and don't hire enough help, especially during the so-called slow times. the parking lots are always crowded with carts, yet they don't give the tools or allow bending the rules to get the tasks done. The non-managerial staff are friendly and helpful,"
bad,"Wal-mart makes their profit partially because the underpay and overwork their help. Safety regs. are overlooked, you are encouraged not to claim on-job injuries to protect their insurance rates and ""safety record"". A job elswhere is better than Wallie's."
bad,Management is obdurate with regard to scheduling work days.
bad,"You do not get paid enough to do the jobs they hire you for, since you do more than the job description says."
bad,At first things were good until they hired an individual who was totally abusive with his authority and whenever I would try and report him they seemed to always excuse his actions...
bad,"This company does not treat its employees very well. With the changes coming this year, and the way that upper management is being pushed by their superiors, the work environment is always angry, and none of the shifts can properly get their jobs done, so everyone gets yelled at and berated. the job would be good for a short-term part-time spot, but isn't a very healthy place to get invested in."
bad,"That’s why they only hire part timers so they don’t have to give benefits, they overwork you, but don’t want to pay a full time  salary they give you tedious work and don’t compensate for it"
bad,"Expect people to go against corporate policies while asking you not to. Do not expect to have a social life because your managers are always on vacation & never approve requested PTO days or even unpaid time off. Work every weekend & holiday-Don't expect to get bereavement, scheduling flexibility, or support of any kind. My coworkers & i were having mental breakdowns as they expect you to be 10 people"
bad,"I worked for this job for several years and witnessed how the company has gone downhill. There is an unfair point system, and there isn't any holiday pay offered. They are quick to replace you and slave you, no matter how hard to work. Their main focus is the customers which is understandable, but they have to realize that the associates make it possible for the store to run. Be prepared to be stressed out with little help from management."
bad,"They only care about pushing the numbers. They pretend like they care about their employees and will happily tell you that the employee comes first, but that's a bunch of bologna. You only get 5 points for sick leave. After that, you have to work your butt off to gain Protected Paid Time Off and it's never worth the effort you put in. Also, the more points you use, the less pay you get for the bonus at the end of the semester."
bad,"Worked 2 departments and equally toxic environment. Management sucks they demoralize you and work you like slaves. Unable to take breaks or you get in trouble. Hours are not flexible and are not understanding when ""life happens"". Always short staffed since management has no respect for anyone below their position."
bad,"Should pay their employees more, Don't get holiday pay for working on Christmas they have to used their PTO to get paid, prices are high not enough employees and don't know they're appreciated. overly High expectations."
bad,I worked during third shift as a dairy/cold stocker though most of the time was spent doing things that were not part of my job. During a typical day I would go to the section I was assigned to and stock the area or zone items.  It is very boring. I learned how to fold clothes. I did not know how to do this properly before.  I also learned how to stock and zone products. The management was not very good. There was only one manager that really liked me.They did not answer my questions very well. The hardest thing about the job was getting things done on time. I did not zone items in the amount of they wanted me to. I was too slow. The part of the job I enjoyed most was doing what I applied for or actually stocking the dairy items in the freezer.
bad,I was hired as part time and received 40 then when I requested to be put in system for 40 hrs .I'm now only being scheduled 30 hours down to 16 hours .I can't afford to feed or house my children with only 16 hours and live on that for 2 weeks . Walmart doesn't seem to be concerned
bad,Management down grades your work. Mgmt talks about you to other employees. Store mgr has his favorites and will tell you.. You are replaceable.... WalMart has severly changed over the years...
bad,Walmart i worked for twice an they were not understanding or fair so i quit managers didn't do there job correctly and took vacation an co workers got let down many times when they wanted a vacation they blame the wrong people or can't be real as a human bout certain matters
bad,"Terrible management they treat everyone with disrespect. Would never go back! They have many different supervisors telling you what to do every 10 minutes, when you are already working on a project. Ive seen a lot of people quit."
bad,"Walmart is not a good company to work for if you are at all a sickly person. You are expected to come in regardless or how sick you are, and doctors notes mean nothing. You are very likely to lose your job if you get hurt and need to be out more than a day. And in my personal experience my department manager would not listen to the orders given to me by the store and district managers."
bad,"While the other associates were amazing and great to work with, management was the worst. Even if you wanted to help other departments who were struggling due to being understaffed, the managers always made us do small tasks despite having already completed it hours before. There is no teamwork there."
bad,No life balance and too many hours all the time. Too many visitors that don’t know what it is really like being in a complex store. They come in and assume all stores are the same and they are not.
bad,"The environment was stressful and management didn't pay attention to their workers and how they were feeling. Overall in my opinion, Walmart is a horrible place to work with a stressful and gloomy environment"
bad,"After working for walmart I discovered that the managers do not treat their employees with respect , they will cut hours consistantly .I would not recommend working for this company."
bad,To much partiality.  They break you down instead of lifting you up. Not at all family oriented. I have a special needs child that needs to be supervised after school but they continually schedule to work till 10 pm.
bad,"Alot of favoritism , Short pump store mgr doesn't bother to even speak to associates/dept mgrs, only receive adequate help when corporate visits are going to happen, favoritism to Egyptian employees"
bad,Walmart is by far one of the worst jobs I’ve had. I seriously would only advise teenagers to work there. The managers are horrible and don’t take the time to listen to employee needs. It’s also a very dangerous place to be seeing that it’s been a lot of store shootings.
bad,I would not recommend working here unless you don't wanna work that much. They didn't give me enough hours to earn enough money to survive on. Overall my time there was awful and won't recommend.
bad,"If you have other options, DON'T DO IT! The pay isn't worth it and management neither appreciates your work ethics or respects the fact that you actually have a life outside of the company."
bad,"If they could monetize your soul and sell it in order to make their shareholders happy, they would. They literally only care about saving money and they'll cut your hours without a second thought."
bad,Management sucked. Pay nominal. Most co-workers ok. Some spoke about others in their own language right in front of them. Very few were toxic but this included co-workers in positions of authority. Have a history of spouting off about Teamwork...its total BS. The management had 1 or 2 responsible people who didnt treat others disrespectfully. The others ran off new employees they didnt like
bad,"Shareholders do not value a single employee in the company, if they did, then why give them these new ugly vests instead of decent pay raises, because to them the associates are a joke. Instead of passing something new that none of the hourly associates asked for or even want, how about taking the time to actually listen to what we want; a better MyShare percentage would be appreciated, not everyone in the company makes six figure salaries every year, and whenever the MyShare bonus is good, how about the store managers not wasting it on something stupid for the store, therefore reducing the pay out to the employees to nearly nothing, such as the remote control floor scrubbers, was it too much to actually pay people a few dollars more to do the job? Actually give employees a decent yearly pay raise, instead of a paltry 2 percent of their total pay, afraid to actually give back to your employees?"
bad,"if i could give this company zero stars i would. management sucks, they don’t care for you or your existence. they treat you like trash, and don’t care about life outside of work. if you tend to get sick a lot i wouldn’t suggest working here either. you can only call in four times before they fire you."
bad,The management at this store is disgusting they play on favoritism and brown nosing certain workers are allowed to come in whenever they please and are never given any points for comng in late .Discrimination is  major problem at this store by management they treat certain employees like dirt when you refuse to act like they think you should.  Workload is unrealistic and employees are .underpaid
bad,a typical day at work is where only 3 people do the truck and my coworkers sometimes curse the company. there are times that even the management are unapproachable.
bad,"I worked for walmart for almost a year. management was a huge problem. They are very entitled and discriminating. I was constantly harassed and attacked while working there. You could never be enough. the point system is awful, you only get 4.5 points. Every day that you called in will take 6 months to gain that point back. At one point i was running fever so high i almost fainted and they refused to send me home  in which i would’ve had to take the point and get fired  the co manager there has been reported numerous of times and yet has been addressed  overall walmart is not a good company  and they do not care about their employees"
bad,"Long hours, hard work, lowest pay of any position yet hardest on the body. They dont care if you're sick. I lost my job because I fainted in the bathroom and had to leave. Managers belittle you in any way they can. They try to work you like machines."
bad,Don't apply if you have family your off days constantly rotate you work every holiday an weekends your always short HR they claim you need to finish task
bad,"If you enjoy a hostile work environment, working the majority of weekends, and unresponsive management this is the place for you.  You will always work short handed, no regard for patient safety.  There are many  times you fear for your own safety with no support from managers or district managers when these instances occur.  Did I mention almost no 40 hour per week positions are available?"
bad,I believe if Walmart focus on helping it’s workers and making them feel as if they really care about them the company will go to newer heights. People have been fired from there that I believe for no reason. Also other get a pass because they help family works there in HR
bad,Walmart was a great place to work they treated the employees great and everything was lovely there I wish it was in Montgomery and I would have stayed
bad,"Walmart dont care for there good employees ."
bad,"I am sure that the store that I worked at is not typical of all of their stores, but it sure did dampen my spirits every time I had to go to work. It was always something for you to do that you weren't getting paid to do. And the management was disorganized. I hope they have pulled it together by now."
bad,Horrible management acts like they're better than you and treats you about the same tries not to keep people for 3 months to avoid giving full time benefits cant get an employee discount for 3 months didnt see my manager for 2 weeks at one point low hours bad pay just a horrible company to work for no one was happy there everyone was basically dead on the inside no one even smiled.
bad,"Walmart is a Horrible company to work for, Management doesn’t listen to you, you get passed up for promotions if you put in for them, you pretty much have to kiss there buts to get anything you want, so pretty much stay away from that dead beat Job it’s not worth the time and aggravation"
bad,Unqualified people in management positions not family oriented at all and dont treat you proper for your hard work they dont make career opportunities open to you unless it benefits them only instead of your family needs
bad,One of the worst managed companies I have ever seen. The Health Department needs to be notified of all the filth. Deli is disgusting! The management at this location is absolutely pathetic and very disrespectful.
bad,"In a typical day on the sales floor at Wal-mart one can expect to be over-loaded with the work of at least 3 people for oneself. If one is lucky then management will generally treat one with a mild neglect, and if not then an overt derision. "
bad,"No conocen el respeto. Los jefes no saben dar ordenes, son prepotentes, despotas y no les gusta q les respondan."
bad,"Unless you have no other option for a job do not waste your time,talent  or degree working for a company that truly does not value who you are as a person"
bad,Walmart was a  HORRIBLE place to work! The pay is not enough to live on and if you hit over time they MAKE you take a long lunch so you can’t get paid! They also spread rumors around the store. I hate working there.
bad,"No benefits, I tried to be full time, I get fulltime hours sometimes but instead they put me at full time so I get no benefits, since the company is cheap, everyone except managers are fulltime. Rude customers are always present most days and will blame the cashiers for everything, and I mean everything"
bad,"If you are ever in / hold a management position; you will be required to work 12 hours daily, then expect 12-16 hours shifts at least 2-3 days a week; you will loose 1 of your 2 days off weekly / every month; no extra compensation: once given a yellow or first coaching .... you automatically do not qualify for annual pay increase and might jeopardize a bonus as well. No work Life Balance!"
bad,It take a long time to become fulltime. Fulltime with them is 34 or 36 hours. They have you working in areas that make more but you don't get the extra pay for the days you work in that area.
bad,"It's a job. A good store manager can make a big difference on job satisfaction. Initially, working at Walmart was great until the store manager was [rightfully] promoted and relocated to another state. What followed was highly demoralizing. Whenever operations appeared to hit rock bottom, it was as if the ground opened and a sinkhole formed."
bad,"Management is joke on all levels. They play favorites and it shows. They are prejudice to a degree, Sad! They cross train favorites not deserving associates. I ask to be trained at something was told they couldn't because they had enough. But they turned around and trained a couple male associates. They have a point system you miss 5 days you can lose your job. Emergency doesn't matter!"
bad,"Hated my experience with incompetent employers. Rude, non-communicative, detached human beings with no regard for actual human interaction. All employees were just numbers to these people."
bad,"not only did they steal 192hrs of sick time, 100 hrs of personal time, but they also forced everyone go to different shifts and schedules. I've been forced to a different shift 3 times now, nights, graveyard, weekends. We also had to take our tools home and start using their supplied tools which are harbor freight quality"
bad,The managers do the schedules so they have off EVERY weekend and make sure the rest of the employees work EVERY WEEKEND! You have younger kids and you can’t see them because you’re at work when they’re home!
bad,"Bad managers, open door policy is a joke, expects you to finish your job to go help some one else out that ends up walking away, store manager is disrespectful dosent know how to talk to the associates, he dosent follow policy but expects everyone one else to"
bad,"not a good place to work , management of the store is bad , if you don't have other options than work in WM. I don't recommend this to anyone. there is no opportunity to grow."
bad,"never get time off, rude customers, work you to death, pay should be higher. learn nothing. no opportunity to grow or get a promotion. only closed one day a year. it is ridiculous."
bad,The walmart on albemarle road is a bad company to work at because of their poor employee management and their respect for their employees and donnt care about your schedule or your mental or physical health even when it is serious.
bad,"Walmart is vindictive and will target you for removal if your manager does not like you. I was told to leave when my manager found out that I had photos of her not doing her job. She was hired in as a manager a year after i had been working there."
bad,"Don't work for Walmart unless you enjoy being treated as a expendable, and unvalued associate. All they do is transfer their worst managers to the same store and then transfer them around the store when too many people have quit in that department."
bad,"No company should be run the way Walmart is, management is terrible. They will talk about their employees to others behind their backs when they do something wrong rather than addressing it to the employee. They don't care about their employees their only concern is satisfying  customers. I did learn a lot from their company though, mainly how to de-esclate stressful situations and remain calm and friendly. The most enjoyable part of the job was leaving."
bad,Walmart is a very difficult company to work for!!!!!! The management team treats you like they are better then you and they talk down on you.... The only good thing is the benefits and pay...
bad,"No open door policy, favoritism is highly used, and they disregard a lot of policies. The manangment gossips about their employees on a daily basis to other employees."
bad,Management will use you and not give the proper tools or help when needed. Expected to do more than the job description description. Management isn't apprecative of things certain employees do.
bad,"To sum it up, managers are not qualified to manage their stores. They don't care about employees and talk massive amounts about their superiors at that. The average management team got their job mostly by sucking up to the right people, or being the only option available. Talking to management, is pointless at best because ""you are wrong, and I am right""."
bad,The managers don't care about organization or respecting their workers. They work you WAY hard for weeks then complain and guilt trip you when you're tired and moving a little slower. You have almost 0 access to equipment necessary to make the job much easier and be completed faster. Also history of multiple store head managers being incredibly abusive towards their employees. Very toxic workplace
bad,"The managers was biased when in a right and a wrong situation even though the person is wrong they just go with the flow. "
bad,After 4 years of being belittled by management in a daily basis it was time to leave   No assistance from assistant or manager  Threats of “coaching” makes it impossible to want to succeed
bad,"Look for a different job as soon as possible, management won't notice how well you do or care how poorly other's do. When other employees are off you must take up the slack."
bad,It’s basically like being in high school. there are bullies and cliques. There are favorites so the bullies who should get in trouble don’t and the victims end up having to sit there and deal with everything.
bad,"Worst place I have ever worked. No training, long hours and they skip out on overtime. Managers make fun of customers and don't set a proper example. When questioned their response is I Don.t care."
bad,This place cares about nothing but the bottom line.  Poor customer service and horrible leadership.  All they care about is how many prescriptions can you fill and verify.
bad,"The benefits could be described more as disaster care, were expensive, and the company passed more of the cost to the associates every year. The management team had no concept of accountability. The job position responsibilities frequently changed or combined with another positions responsibilities to create duties that were unreasonable to complete in a workday."
bad,"Temporary job okay, learning cash register skills. Management personnel are micro- management and controlling."
bad,"HR associates are rude. Production rate is  nearly impossible to hit. Most managers show very obvious favoritism (letting specific people go home early several times a week, assigning people to certain places that make production easier to hit)."
bad,4393 location specifically. Friends and family club in the front. Watched assistant commit fraud. Went to ethics and was told to go somewhere else. Asset protection refusing to stop thieves but you get reprimanded for pulling unpaid items and switched tag items out of bags BEFORE the customer completed the purchase. Associates trying to start drama between you management. It's a bad place to work.
bad,"Want a job at Walmart,  syck up to the managers. Only way up. If anyone things you might get ahead, they seasoned coworkers will drag your name to the toilet."
bad,"Terrible Corporation, they don't care about employees or work with them when needing time off for family or children. Two faced managers, whom don't do what they say they will. They treat employees of the CAP 2 team like garbage. I highly DO NOT recommend the Mount Vernon, MO Walmart especially."
bad,"The Walmart here in Gillette, Wyoming is the absolute worse place I have worked in the retail business.  Truly, this Walmart is more of a prison camp than a workplace.  Zero positive feedback or recognition from management.  The management staff gets work done by yelling and threatening.  You are made to feel that your job is always on the line.  A store of this size is supposed to have 500 employees but we have less than 200 because so many people are quitting and hiring new people is difficult because the word is out as to how horrible this place is."
bad,"The bad Is they treat there employees bad, They cuss them, and make it impossible to work in these conditions, and they violate your HIPAA Rights, and confidentiality Rights as an Employee."
bad,"No, seriously don’t. I’ve been forced to work with people who sexually assaulted me because they, “didn’t have anyone else who wanted to work those hours.” Managers are allowed to make racist and religiously discriminatory comments, when I became disabled I was forced to demote, I did so. Now I’m being horribly bullied, having the chair and cart I have to have to do my job have holes ripped in it and cart destroyed. No one cares or will do anything."
bad,This job is alright if you like fast and slow periods and inconsistent scheduling.  Full time is 25 hours a week which is not enough to live on.  As well the managers are not often willing to work with you to resolve  scheduling conflict.
bad,Managers are not supportive and always insults cashiers. No holiday pay. No incentive. Not getting flexible schedule at all. Lot of cashiers don’t like to work at Walmart.
bad,I struggled with hrs  because I have 4 kids and it was hard for me to get a babysitter to pick them up I did cashiering and stocking and cleaned floor
bad,"A typical day is mainly you doing your work and everyone else's work. The pay scale is the same for everyone and doing more nets you nothing but more work. No raises, incentives, and if you are good in CAP 2 they hold you down from advancing because good workers are not rewarded. Management is lazy and do not care if you do your job, they only care about people who kiss up. Violence amongst employees is also never addressed. The culture is vitriolic. The most enjoyable part of the job is punching out and walking to your vehicle."
bad,"They suck! The pay suck! Also management I mad I wasted my time with Walmart thinking they was gonna change but, they didn’t they pick who they won’t to move up! And not the best Canada"
bad,"Working for Walmart is horrible. Company doesn't care about employees at all. Just greedy, greedy, greedy. All about their profits, profits, profits. Your children and/or yourself could be in the hospital dying and they don't care. Not flexible with scheduling at all. Will deduct your pay for changing departments even when they asked you to do so as a favor to help them out."
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend working for this company. Stolen items cost amount gets taken out of your bonus. Management also works hard to NOT give you full time, along with no benefits or holiday pay."
bad,"Management is changing so frequently I don't know who I report to nor do my coworkers.  COMMUNICATION between management and employees is practically non existent.  No one looks out for anyone except themselves,  SPECIFICALLY management . Associates need to learn their jobs by trial and error and common sense.  Promotion is impossible unless you are the correct race.  tthe correct"
bad,"This should be a last resort job. All of the management sucks, and for how much they talk about innovation, they sure don't show it. People are constantly going against the rules and ""getting away with murder."""
bad,"Loved my job in Niceville at first, drove an hour each way.   Loved the management, co-workers, and customers, who loved me also.   Always very helpful and respectful to customers, and did 2 people's work easily.   But was not appreciated and when they hired a new manager, a nasty ex-marine, who wanted everyone to submit to him, well everything turned 180 for me and I started to loathe working there.   So shortened my hours, but finally just quit because of the unnecessary stress.    They lost one of the best workers they ever had, and won't find anyone that can do what I did.   But that's Walmart for you.   Another slave plantation.   I'm on to better things.   Want to work outside again for a lot more pay.   I'm worth it and then some."
bad,"While the customers are always fun to help and interact with plus some of your coworkers this is the only benefit that I can see. No set amount of hours they often change your schedule without you knowing sometimes waiting until last minute to fix your schedule if theres an issue. Management sleeps with subordinates so there's favoritism.  No room for growth, no holiday pay. Everyone gets the same amount of money there's no incentive to stay with company long term. Dont work here hostile work environment had an issue with a coworker sexually harassing me and they did NOTHING to this oerson."
bad,"I did more then what was needed for my job and never got noticed by anyone. I did most the work by myself everyday downloading trucks, downloading pallets, separating all the items. But they still wanted me to finish my aisle by stocking before everyone else. Sometimes I would get put on more then one aisle or the manager would tell me he messed up and told me the wrong aisle. Work environment was horrible."
bad,An average day was often not good as management would play favorites with the morning crew allowing them to dump their work on the evening shift. I would only ask for assistance if certain managers were there as some would help but most would not.
bad,Working at Walmart cap 2 in knightdale can be very difficult with the lack of support from upper management we have a line that has been broke since I been there
bad,They lie they tell you one thing and do another. they also say they help their associates but when you go to ask for help they say there is nothing i can do. I also find the store manager to be sexist against straight people.
bad,"Mala gestion,falta de educacion total por parte de los Managers."
bad,Right when you walk in the door in the morning you are busy until the time you leave. There to much favoritism there. No one is hold accountable for the wrong doing. The hardest part of the job is no one has the right direction or on the same page. I like to keep busy . I always thank the people that work under me at the end of there day .
bad,Most definitely not a long term gig just something to get by. There is no respect between management and employees the whole team are snakes no matter which walmart you work at its almost like it's the culture. The biggest snake gets to the top.
bad,Walmart is one of the worst companies to work for you feel miserable every time you are there and if you work there in a decent position don’t expect to stay there for too long because they change your positions without warning they once sent out a teenager who had no snow gear on at all outside to push carts while it was snowing outside
bad,"Walmart is the worst company I have worked for, I was the produce department manager and was only paid 15.49 per hour. For a manager of a department that large 15 a hour is beyond exploitation but somehow they get away with it."
bad,"They are restructuring management throughout Walmart.  It’s called Great Workplace and it is to minimize management positions and give more management responsibilities to associates without a pay increase.  This new roll out will cripple most stores, and the associates that have dedicated themselves to this company are leaving."
bad,"Office politics is rampant."
bad,Simple the managers don’t care they work our buts  off and push us till we break then fire us for quitting they are rude racist and discriminative to fat and mixed ppl
bad,my walmart is one of the worsts in this state. Employee satisfaction is the lowest with people quitting usually about a week into the job. i only stayed for the pay. if you want to work somewhere where management truly does not care and will lie about company policies to benefit themselves or the company  don’t work here.
bad,The only thing Walmart cares about is money and management. They don't look out for regular associates and couldn't care less about there well being unless it takes money from there pocket. STAY AWAY FROM WALMART IF AT ALL POSSIBLE!!!
bad,"This place sucks so much. If you can avoid it do not work here. My manager was sexist, I did my job perfectly and got a talking to by the manager when others where not doing their jobs correctly. The management cares more about the sale and money then any of their employees. Save yourself while you still can and do not work at Walmart."
bad,A typical work day means you are on you feet all day stocking or helping customers. The company is a learn as you go they don't teach to much just got to ask question and hope it is the right answer.
bad,"Management gives you dirty looks if you are sick."
bad,They work  you out no benefits no bonuses little amount of raises a year stressful and hard to move up the chain try something different that’s back in th day who knows now
bad,"The interview was fine, but once I was hired it was clear to me that everyone there hated their job and was on their way out - and for good reason. The management is extremely harsh and competitive. You're constantly watched and management can go off the handle at a moments notice. I saw unprofessional behavior from several of the management staff and heard horror stories from my colleagues."
bad,Some members of management do not know how to talk to people. No accountability on anyone. Expected to do others jobs when they don’t feel like doing  it.
bad,If you don't handle stress well this isn't the company for you. Be prepared not to receive holiday pay but is locked into being in the schedule. Independently seek resources for answers. You rarely get a work environment were managers are willing to help you (depends on the area your in). Good luck
bad,Walmart does hire the disabled. They are the only place that would hire me as I am a paraplegic in a wheelchair. They gave me a chance. They continued to help when I had to take a leave of absence two years in a row for job related illnesses. They kept my job available for me when they didn’t have to. But the job is very stressful and hard on me physically.
bad,"I came off the streets and applied for a cashier, went for the interview and I was told that they wanted me for Customer Service Manager"
bad,Severely abusive enviroment. would not recommend to anyone to work there. management will not support active workers and demean anyone that tries to defend themselves from abuse from amnagement and other staff. Customers though where nothing but amazing.
bad,"Productivity expectations is insane, Management is the worst. Most of the employees keep me in a good state of mind while I was there . I learned how to operate a powered equipment called a CR/Center Rider . Management doesn’t care about employees, it’s all about them and their production. It’s the worst Company/place that I have worked in all my life."
bad,"Would be a  stretch place to work if store manager cared about the employees. I had a great electronics manager , but of course she followed the orders of the store manager ."
bad,Was great in the begining. They pile on more work that other managers dont want to do and expect alot in little time and no help. More work for little pay. If you request a day off you are denied.
bad,"Really poor management, always want to make you feel like you are worthless and they are the ones that do everything. "
bad,Unloading the trucks and Stocking its was good but the hour that I can’t do I was so tried but other then that it’s pay good people Friendly nice workers
bad,"Ever since whoever became the ""Big Boss Man"" up top has really let this place go. I worked there for almost 4 years and from day one to my last day you could literally see the down hill slope! The only reason people work there is because of the pay, and I would bet if you sent a secret employee in there they could tell you in a month or less."
bad,"I was an assistant manager at Walmart who did above and beyond for them. I was often the only manager in the store. I became ill and all of a sudden I was of no use. I used up my Leave of Absence and "
bad,Very stressful. If you don't kiss the right button you won't be going anywhere in the company. If you are not kissing butt they will try and find any little reason to fire you
bad,"No job security, ruff management, fluctuating & unstable working hours, not enough employees on the floor, the store is unclean, the isles are full & not enough space for clients. The fruit & vegetable section not kept clean & sometimes bad & smiley items are not removed or disposed off."
bad,"Gestão arcaica, com gestores arcaicos, submetidos aos caprichos e interesses de colaboradores do sexo oposto."
bad,Management is not good they rush you and you get no credit for work performed they expect more then you are capable of doing I would never tell anyone to work there Its not a very good place to work I highly say don't work there they Wal-Mart Its not a place I recommend to anyone Please don't work there
bad,"Do not work for this company.  They don't care about their employees. No matter how much they tell you otherwise  they are lying. You especially don't want to work for the store in Ruidoso, NM.  You will be miserable there."
bad,"Terrible work/life balance, expected to work long shifts at odd hours, unhelpful, scattered, and unprofessional management."
bad,I would never ever want anyone to work here! Alot of management are stiff and only care about themselves.. You say you want to be cross trained so you can change departments they say oh yeah we can do that start to for a few days then never let you go back to finish.
bad,Walmart wasnt a good place at all i was constantly getting yelled at and blamed for stuff i didnt do. they wrote me up when my manager would make mistakes he would blame them on me.
bad,"When I first working here, I was hard working, content with the job, though perhaps wanted a bit more pay. This was the second time I worked for this company and I had left on good terms from the last position to focus on schooling for a few months. After working in this position for about a week, my mother was diagnosed with cancer and her health was failing after a few months. I was depressed and as a result, I missed more days of work than I should have. I didn't want to do a job when I couldn't give 100%. When I told a manager about this, I was told to ""get over it"" for work and sent out to the floor. I stopped caring at this point. I missed even more days. I  always made sure to let them know if I would bot be there. When they did fire me, I only found out because I had been removed from the schedule and my discount card declined. Tried to go in and talk with them about it. They were always conveniently on lunch or off that day in HR. To this day,I still have yet to even get an email about my termination. If you are desperate for work, you should only use this job as a stepping stone to something better. Even among retail, it is the lowest bar I have seen."
bad,Corporate finds a way to cut the average worker out of  foull bonuses.  There is favoritism with schedule.  Never have epuitment that works. Noone that is an average worker is happy
bad,"Walmart is good for one thing, and one thing alone. The discounts you’d get becoming an associate, other than that nothing at all. You’re underpaid for the things you do, such as interacting with awful customers, to poor management and favoritism. Do not work here, unless you have no other option."
bad,I did not like my hours . I felt I was being overworked. The managers were very lazy . I would leave work at night getting home like 12 and have to be up at 4 to make it there by 7 am it was just hard .
bad,"Managers failed to follow their own policies, chose favorites, and some of them even slept during their shift. Retaliation was a 0% tolerated policy and when a manager retaliated against an associate, nothing was done about it."
bad,"I loved it at first but I always worked every weekend I never had off I requested it and it was denied, I was also stalked and harrased by a CSM for a month or so the manager did nothing about it, the workplace was horrible. And employees were lazy not to mention rude customers all the time."
bad,Full of selfish self-centered managers. The employee's are opertuneist. Your expected to do the work of 10 people in a very short time.They don't work with you when you need them too. They less then understanding when it comes to any kind of medical condition.
bad,"Training was scattered at best, the person that trained me couldnt make up her mind whether I should do certain tasks or not and would often get me started on something and ignore me when I tried to figure out how to do it and then say I shouldn't have been doing it in the first place. Two people in similar management positions kept dragging me back and forth and I would get told I hadn't done what I was supposed to do no matter who I listened to."
bad,I havent even met the store manager yet and hes been there about 6 months. Under paid fir how much labor I have to do compared to other roles. Theres never any real opportunity to advance there. They require you to have experience leading a team to advance from a normal employee but never give you opportunity to lead a team.
bad,"No communication"
bad,"They under pay you for the work you’re doing. The management there suck, they don’t help you when you need help they expect for you to lift heavy equipment by hand and by yourself"
bad,"They expect insane demands all of the time, if you need to leave for a funeral or something along those lines they will demand you to come in instead of going to pay respect."
bad,"They schedule you based on what they need but they don’t consider your availability based on the days you had already informed them you are not available to work due to child or family obligations. Or when you call in because your child is sick, they don’t care. They give you an occurrence each time."
bad,Management does not know how to manage anything the company is failing at the distribution center. It will continue to fail until they get experience.
bad,"Walmart is all about greed, no conpassion for employees or customers.  I love my job not the company. Helping my customers is a big part of my job. And I do it well. I always try to make shopping easier for people."
bad,"When I first started at Walmart things were decent not too stressful. However, as of late things are out of hand. My manager is great but others are ridiculous.  Other employees there seem to get the favoritism treatment. Our pay is unacceptable especially for families trying to make a living. Walmart is mainly for high school students or people who just need experience but nothing to make a career out of unless you are buddy buddy with other management"
bad,"Management didn't care about employees. Management wants employees stay late and finish all work. Or we had to stay after, Walmart does not pay overtime"
bad,"need better managers, work hours are long. They DO NOT CARE about their employees. They never say thank you, and ALWAYS HAVE AN ATTITUDE. They say its an open door policy but its not, you try to ask them  for something or help they ARE ALWAYS NASTY TOWARDS TOO. I would NEVER recommend this job to anyone."
bad,My work schedule would change daily and requesting days off are a hassle. You will be doing the work of four people by yourself and would constantly be told to hurry up.
bad,Worked for frozen/dairy section. Worst jobs I've ever had.management is terrible and the department managers don't like to do their job. I got payed $11hr and most of the time i Was doing the department managers jobs while they slacked off and were on their phones and wondered and came back hours later. To rush u and yell for not doing 7 different jobs fast enough. I was new and was left alone and made to run 2 departments by myself and then unload trucks and restock every thing and the worst part was. Being in the freezer that was probably below zero couldn't feel my fingers my face it was terrible and highly dont recommend anyone work for that position.Wal-Mart such a big company yet management is literal incompetent and dont care what u feel or how bad or tired ur feeling.  The hours leave u no time to have a personal life and the point system is ridiculous especially for people who are sick.they will threaten you with firing you all the time and.then they expect you to have a smile on ur face. . Never ever again. Dont Recommend it one bit! 0 stars
bad,"Walmart isn't a great company to work for. They book you in for shifts outside of your availability, whether you tell them not to or not. They don't pay well, they have pretty rude management for the most part, and they don't care about you and your well being, just their company. They also give the minimum amount of hours weekly. Very stressful."
bad,"They have unrealistic expectations and feel the best way to treat their hardworking employees is to bully them and blame some of them for thing they didn’t,t do. And then coach them when their unrealistic expection aren’t met by the one or two people they still have. All we ask for is some possitive feedback and a helping hand every once in awhile but that’s to much  the biggest losers are the customers at my store because we can’t help them without getting written up by our management"
bad,Management was very poor they expected 5 associated to stock the entire store every night. Day shift was more working top stock then stocking. If anything went wrong night shift get the blame. Extremely high associate turn over
bad,"I can't even express how horrible this place was to work. Easily the worst job I've ever had. Management was horrible, there were only 2 decent managers, one of whom stepped down from assistant manager and everything went down hill from there. The lady who took her place was the laziest excuse for an employee I've ever known. She was absolutely horrendous at scheduling (all the old ladies worked 7-4, and there were only 3 people on any given day to cover the front end, one person at each self check out, one on a single register). I was usually the only person watching the bigger self-checkout, 13 registers in total I think, at 4pm. All the alcoholics and middle-aged women pretending they're not alcoholics were buying alcohol at that time, usually almost every single register was taken, and I was supposed to help every single person all at once who then became angry at ME like it was my fault that woman is a moron and couldn't schedule reasonably. It wouldn't have been a problem if they had understood that people have lives and health issues and other important things going on outside of work and not fired everybody decent, which then forced everyone else decent to quit. This was all happening when the Scan and Go stuff started and customers were livid and yelling at us because we were doing what we were told to do, to get them to use self-checkout. We were even told to scan their items for them to make it look like self check out was being used, absolutely ridiculous, and the customers still bit our heads off for it. They abused the heck out of my schedule, had me part-time"
bad,okay place to work if your looking for something part time to do on the side to make a little money but not necessarily ideal if your looking for a steady job that pays well
bad,Most Walmart’s are more than happy to write you up for nothing. Especially if it was something you didn’t know. I do not recommend working at Walmart unless it is a temporary thing.
bad,Management is lazy and uncaring about employees  not there on weekends when the busiest and lack the skills to motivate and help associates out knowing better what to do
bad,"This company takes you for granted. Store was extremely under staffed They do not care about your hard work no matter how much you try to please them. Managers will bully you, make you feel stupid and overall just put you down and make you feel bad about yourself. The hardest part is to not get sent home from the bullies they call the managers to inflate their ego. Would not recommend"
bad,Managment at walmart is horrible.  They over work their good people while the slouches never have to do anything. When things dont get done which happens often because they run a skeleton crew they blame the good workers and they end up leaving. The lazy workers get all the breaks and never do much work. They will fire you if they dont like you. I've seen it happen to often ...its soul sucking. Would not recommend working there.
bad,The management team really don't like Spanish speaking people. They continue to fire associates that speak Spanish and want to move up in the company.
bad,"Managers are DISRESPECTFUL to their associates, they don’t care if your sick they still want you to come to work, they don’t approve your vacation days you have to keep going to them numerous of times before anything is done, if your attendance was approved by another manager you have other managers that will go back and put the point back, Terrible pay"
bad,Management is of no help  they run around with their heads cut off  corporate is no better  they institute policies and associates don’t know about them until they are affected. On top of that the safety of associates is not taken seriously.
bad,Management didn’t care about your well being and there was always lack of staff. I dealt with a racial issue that was never handled because. Management handled most issues very poorly and sometimes not at all.
bad,There's no opportunity to move up and they treat everyone like garbage. They don't listen to any of the associates and take time out of their shifts in order to make the associates lives harder. it's not bad for the first moth but it horrid afterward. don't think about moving up either.
bad,"Your expendable, their profit is all that matters. Minimal hours & no set schedule where you can work elsewhere. Most employees can barely afford rent."
bad,"If the CEO's would have continued in the old family traditions... and taken care of their employees like Mr. Sam Walton did, they would still be awesome to work for. Looking out for the Customer as well as the Employees... after all without either (good luck finding an associate  on the floor now) they have smaller income coming in and a lot more grievances from both sides of the coin...."
bad,"Management can’t get a hold on staffing and work people into the ground with 15 hour days plus mandatory overtime on days off.  Don’t work here unless you have to.  Find a job who doesn’t lie to you about scheduling right when you walk in the door.  Pays ok but not near enough for the amount of work they demand, there are much more reasonable employers out there.  Not to mention the culture is toxic and safety is a goal that they don’t really care about until your hurt."
bad,Horrible management no organizations skills ... Very discriminatory twords race not enough hours nor pay raises .bad experience for me. And never will i work for the company
bad,Work work work. They work you until you ar no longer useful. The hardest jobs you will ever work . While never being compensated properly and consistently being stripped of the the benefits that are offered.
bad,"Employees and bosses are bullies. Cruel treatment. Nasty, mean, evil people. Not a good place to work if you are a kind person, have anxiety, or depression.  Horrible people. It will drain you mentally.  $6000 deductible to use insurance.  Not worth it."
bad,"Walmart was such a waste of time for me due to the fact that they denied me advances at every turn no matter what I provided for them, I did more than anyone else could have done for them in the tme that I've done it in so with that Walmart is not a good company to work for regardless of what anyone says. Strictly speaking they will work you like a slave and expect you to work for scraps"
bad,"The management doesn't work, the ""benefits"" are pathetic, customers are disgusting and rude, coworkers are shady, and being a good worker means nothing any more. Horrible company to work for and the reason I am trying to find a different job right now."
bad,Poor management and nothing but mess! Walmart has to have the messiest employees ever! I hate mess. I definitely hate nitpickers! And people are too grown to be acting like little kids!
bad,"Managers never cared about employees, they didn't really care about the customers either, they only cared about making sure their own needs were met before their customers and employees."
bad,They tell you that this is a great place to work..... NO IT'S NOT! They show so much favoritism. Then store manager has  no clue of what he is doing.. when you ask to be move to a different department nope no chance in that they have men there that harass the women and they do nothing about it say oh we need the people! cashier who talk to the customer how ever they like very disrespectful i might add! that place is a joke they care nothing about you!
bad,Salary at walmart is based on 50 per week but you're expected to work 65+ without compensation. The paid time off that you're given as a salary manager is also your sick time.If you like unreal expectations and constantly changing policies that upper management only follow when it convenient or to terminated someone that don't like walmart is a great company.
bad,I don't like how they run the wal mart. It was very unprofessional and unorganized. The supervisor was never where she was supposed to be. They mistreated the workers.
bad,Does not value female empowerment.  Always will be good ole white boy hierarchy.  If you are a white Male you will be fine to move ahead.   The company is automating to replace humans but keeping the middle managers blows the mind.
bad,I had tried for 3 years to get on at walmart.. well once I finally got hired on they started me out as part time but told me I would be getting full time hours I have a 1 year old child to provide for and they were not giving full time hours so when I got my paycheck it was only 400 I cant live off that every two weeks I an a single mother doing it alone
bad,"Since I started working for Walmart, it's been a struggle. First, I didn't know that EVERYONE around you will give you their job to do if they can. If you're covering a break, they'll leave you stuff to do for them. Management doesn't really care, and some of them are not even trying to hide that. And of course, if they see that you really want to work, they're gonna treat you like a horse. You'll be exhausted to the point where you just can't anymore. Department managers are usually there just to scan the whole day, and talk (if they see you talking, they're gonna usually say that there is a lot of work that needs to be done). Just horrible! Employees don't have any rights."
bad,"Management acted like we were all in high school. A lot of drama, talking behind your back, favoritism is most common. If you were a hard worker you had to do your job plus managements job as most the time they did not want to perform their management duties. Management just likes to supervise but not actually work. You cannot report any harassment or bullying if it’s done by management because nothing will get done. Unfortunately a very disrespectful work place."
bad,I used to work for Walmart. For 3 years and the corporation desided to get rid of its full-time employees. So they started with the cartpushers and went from there. I was glad I left the sorry dang corporation!
bad,"never followed the rules, non-stop talking about bull and there was a bomb threat at my store. just a very toxic workplace was hired for one position but ended up doing something else. just don't fill out an application bad place to work."
bad,"Work is to much but salary is not enough to survive "
bad,"The job was exhausting they want you to do everything but don’t want to give you the correct pay for it. Long hours. however, I’ve gained experience in customer service. I learned how to deal with certain people. The pay is okay depending on location. It’s always crowded so you may or may not get a break."
bad,"I work here for a few years and the only good thing is the people working here. When something goes wrong, you will have to talk to management but I call them brick walls. They dont care and give you a bull answer."
bad,Advancement given to favorites. If you spend 2 hours talking to a coach a day. You get promoted. Otherwise. Good luck. Have to be related or friends with manager for promotion.
bad,"Managers have no idea what is going on, ever. The store manager is a crook who gives away hundreds of dollars of food and supplies to friends for a BBQ and writes it off as ""store use""."
bad,This place will drain you till their done with you and on top of it all they have usless management every single manager in walmart is just there for show nobody helps out when its needed
bad,The recovery after treatments was horrible and Wal-Mart didn't care about me any more. Even in a wheelchair full-time upon my return to work. Wal-Mart trulydoesn't care about there associates...only their profit.
bad,Management is awful just a group of yes men cowering obediently to the tiny power hungry tyrant of a store manager who is verbally abusive and rude. The personnel manager is just as bad and has no clue what he’s doing. Expectations are unreasonable and erratic. Want steady hours and schedule? Forget about it.
bad,The grocery manager will not listen to you or your availability if you change it every semester for classes. Will make false promises regarding time off. Will become mean towards you when regarding complaints towards that manager to upper management.
bad,"It’s a job, not a career. As long as you are content to punch your time card and do your job it’s decent. Those who try to learn more typically get used and abused into the ground."
bad,At first working at Walmart was very good then after two years I came back and it was never the same. It was horrible working there but I put in a total of 4 years together and the CSM never really cared when you get your break as long as they got one. I think if we respect each other at work Walmart would be a better place treat me like a human being.
bad,Worst place I have ever worked. They honestly do not care about you. Some managers are better than others but that won't matter corporate makes all decisions.
bad,There were management issues. They didn't follow proper guidelines for running the store. Most shelves weren't stocked and customers were frustrated. I would always be sympathetic to the customers.
bad,I hope you're ready to be held accountable for every action the manager above you makes. Because when you work here you feel like trash. I do not reccomend.
bad,Management is absolutely horrible. They are bad about favoritism. They expect too much out of one person. The other associates talk trash about the ones they dont like and if they don't like you they will find a way to get rid of you.
bad,"It might differ depending on the Walmart, but my experience was awful. I was the only one in my section. When I wasn't they would send people to ""zone"" aka busy work. You get 4 days to call in every six months sick or not. The benefits are only good for salary employees. They forced contracted Trocemployees to do unpaid labor. Usually have to work hours over because night people are too understaffed to take my position."
bad,"They are always hiring because they keep having to replace people who quit, Wage is minimal, work hours vary all over the place so you can't call income reliable. Favourite hirees get identified early; no chance for advancement or transfer if you're not one of the preferati. No use pointing out necessary repairs; they seldom get done. Good people to work with but not to work for."
bad,Wal-Mart really is a great company but they make really bad choices when it comea to picking a store manager. Every Wal-Mart I've been to has the same issue. That issue is poor management. If it weren't for management I would've stayed. If you're looking to be treated like a human being I suggest finding another company. If you enjoy being treated like a dog then go for it.
bad,Uma experiência a mais no currículo. Sou grata pela oportunidade. É bem próximo de casa.
bad,"Your opinion does not matter.  It is like the blind leading the blind.  In addition, the no room for growth.  The company thrives off of deceit and deception."
bad,This is the most stressful job I have ever had in all my years as a retail Manager. The expectations are not realistic ones. The hours you work are insane and your not compensated for the amount of hours you work. It is so much favoritism and retaliation if you do have a complaint. Upper Management meaning the store manager or market manager never listens to your concerns. All they want to do is drain you blood dry for more and more work.
bad,"Customers will literally treat you like dirt and management will smile and tell you it was your fault."
bad,"I worked at Walmart for 8 months and I wanted to quit every day I was there. The work culture is horrible and the higher a manager is, the bigger their ego and the worse they treat you"
bad,"You can not move up here. Management picks there favorites and it's hard to do anything. "
bad,It was a decent job. Just left because management couldn’t see my worth. The management had favorites and times racially profiled me in instances. Overall an ok place to work.
bad,"Stressful place to work, unfair pay, horrible work environment, and unprofessional management. This was without a doubt one of the worst jobs I have ever had."
bad,"Bad experience, I do not recommend anyone to work there. They worked me on days I wanted off and tried to make me work on my prom night senior year of high school."
bad,"A pathetic remnant of the store Sam Walton started. Yes they finally increased hourly pay, but took away sick pay, holiday pay, vacation pay and cut hours. Have been with them almost 5 years and can't get full time. If you should happen to get overtime during holiday season, they make you extend your lunch to take away the time. Really sad because it used to be a really good place."
bad,The job was fine up until people began quitting and management wasn't hiring to keep staff leveled. It would be slow at times so there was some ease. Sunday's are usually the busiest. Some workers don't give the same effort as you so that makes the job harder than it has to be. Customers can be rude and our managers didn't care if we were struggling. Could be wayyy overworked at times. Beware.
bad,Poor management. Unclear expectations. Managers love to settle grudges with each other by using employees as spies. Manager was very dirty looking at girls who were 15 and 16 inappropriately. Just felt disgusted when he was there.
bad,"I worked there for a couple of months, i got pink eye and they told me to wear sunglasses even though I was contagious and not able to do so without seeing a doctor for eye drops.   that is when i realized how they can care less about their employees and the customers safety."
bad,"The Management was not very good and they do not Not treat everyone as fairly as they should be , They treat others with more respect than others which is not right ."
bad,"Biggest problem will always be the company balamces its budget on the bottom rung.  Pay sucks for such an enormous corporation and they consistently understaff and overwork everyone.  Even if you land a halfway decent position with okay pay and your boss doesn't constantly breathe down your neck, cronyism and lack of proactivity are rampant at every location.  They claim there's a culture of positivity but there's a way more obvious subculture starting with department managers and moving up from there of ignoring problems and sucking up.  I've watched complaints bounce off Assistant Managers, Store Managers, and even Market Managers."
bad,"Management team talks to you as if you are beneath them. One of their ""pillars"" for their business is respect for the individual yet from hourly supervisors to store manager you are treated like garbage"
bad,Worst culture I have ever worked in. The management cares about nothing more than getting back to their office and sitting down. They also refuse to get you what you need to complete your job. Not only that they even put you In danger.
bad,"Most crooked company to work for. Managers are scared to stand with associates because they their self fear termination. When managers are found cheating, they are scolded not terminated. But associate s are held accountable for breathing wrong and terminated after 17 yrs if hard, committed work. Not afraid to give my name. I have a real story. Margo Parks"
bad,At every level of management there was corruption. I was terminated from there for bringing up breach of policies by management. Walmart doesn't care about their associates.
bad,"was given a write up for following a direct supervisor's orders by the higher up management; would have been nice to earn time off even for being ""part-time"" (classified as such even though working up to 40 hours each week) although I was wanting full-time and they would not take me."
bad,"There is lack of management ,communication ,understanding ,respect ,fairness, and equality . Find somewhere else to work.  They will pretend to not know what the issues are and/ or sweep them under the rug."
bad,"Management at my store makes me dread waking up everyday and having to put that ugly vest on. They do not care about the associates whatsoever. The favoritism is ridiculous. Lazy workers are not disciplined, instead everything that they don’t do is put on the hard working associate who doesn’t get recognition. The managers themselves are never even there, they all make time adjustments to get paid more hours than they are actually there for. They also make you work full time hours as part time so you dont get fulltime benefits. They only pay good because nobody wants to stay there and their turn over rate is horrible. I would not recommend anyone to work at Walmart."
bad,"Managers don't care about you, you get negative points if you are sick even for one day and if it was your first time, you do not get paid time and a half, instead you get paid time off which only really benefits you if you have been working there for over 10 years, if you are new, the time it takes to accumulate enough paid time off is embarrassing. The managers will usually deny your vacation time with a dumb excuse even if you put it in early, overall the experience there was terrible, if a customer complains about you, you will get written up even if it was a really dumb thing, for example you forgot to bag one item."
bad,"Don't practice what they preach.  Horrible treatment, they over work and under pay.  The culture is gone, no family feel like they pretend their is.  Managers are in experienced and treat associates like trash."
bad,Bad job overall I get paid 10 dollars a hour to work and unload 50 foot trucks all day sweating and getting one hour break for a 10 hour shift I suggest nobody go there .NOBODY
bad,"Management = Words can not describe how bad (reason I left)"
bad,The company is designed to minimize cost and maximize profit. In that regard Walmart is an amazing company. But they do not care about their workers and they demand as much work as possible with as little compensation and benefits as possible. Some positions can pay well and give the appropriate benefits to those who have unconventional living situations. But they will throw you under the bus the first chance they get to save the any penny they can.
bad,I am a team player but management are all for yourself. You ask for a day off denied. Why? The attendance policy is not fit for any worker to be offered. Life happens and u have to come in when life happens because u get a point and then it takes 6 months for missing an 8 hour shift... It TAKES 180 DAYS FOR 8 HOURS ...
bad,Walmart considers everyone expendable. They do not treat employees as if they have any worth. The company experiences many lay offs. Hard work is not valued.
bad,"Upper management has no communication with the employees or the management team."
bad,"Working at Walmart had to be the most stressful job I've ever had. The managers don\t follow up with anything, they expect too much out of the little people they have, and they seldom put in the effort to help associates. I enjoyed the work and my job but if there was a chance that management could have been different then I would have definitely stayed."
bad,"I have never experienced such a terrible place to work. Management is constantly doing nothing but hanging out in the AD office, they favor one race and treat them with benefits while discriminating against any other race. Management suggest we work off the clock when we can’t finish our work load while on the clock. Overall if you have the option between Walmart and any other place of employment, take the second option."
bad,A tenacious and committed sales professional with a 6+ years’ verifiable track record of driving results by consistently achieving and exceeding sales targets.
bad,Females sometime had to throw the truck which I think sucks. They are always on your shoulders about working hard and getting things done even if you are done lol. It was good but if you are temp you don't know if you're fired til the day you come in
bad,"The management team at my location is out of touch with reality at the warehouse. They know nothing beyond what they see on paper. The changes the business in general make to vacation time, incentives(quarterly and bi-weekly) are pathetic and just a handful of reasons to take money away from their hard workers, and their turn over rate is horrendous. They complain that they can't keep enough people to stay, but it's no wonder because of they way the company operates. Changes that can be made to the company, more specifically the warehouse I work, can be understood and made by a 12 year old."
bad,"Co-workers great, no communications with upper management, mis communication, favoritism, just disorganized completely at the store I worked at"
bad,"I wont say it was terrible working for Walmart but it was far from good. Trying to get a CSM to you for help takes forever. They dont hire enough people so its even more difficult to get customers through, RUDE customers esp furing holidays. They work and work you but have no patience but there are some great coworkers. Management can be cool depending on the store."
bad,"Will fire you even if your admitted to the hospital,  they still will count it against you. No hospital  notes excepted as an excuse meaning not caring about employees well being."
bad,"I’ve worked for Walmart about 4 years.... I work at the Walmart in Boardwalk square in Kansas City Missouri. It’s in a great area of KC, but it is a dangerous place to work, We have had bomb threats, employees robbed in the parking lot!!! It is a place that is very dangerous I can’t wait to get out!!!!!"
bad,"They push there cashiers to sell credit cards which leaves a lot of stress on them I left after a week cause I pressured all the time to get applications, its annoying customers should come first to them there second."
bad,"You can only call out 5 times before they fire you. Each point that you get takes 6 month to get rid of. They expect you to do so much with little pay. I was a cashier and I was never able to leave out on time. Management is terrible. I tried to get transferred and they gave me the run around. A girl that worked less than 6 months was able to transfer, but I worked there for over 6 months and they never did anything to help me transfer. The CSMs are never to be found when you need them. Each day I worked 5hrs and 30mins and I was only allowed one little 15min break. I always had to put piles of re-shop back and deal with long lines all the time for only one short break. They fired a cashier for attendance, but the only reason she was gone was because she had health problems. The lady told them that in advance when they hired her. You can only get a 10% discount and Walmart is picky about what you can use that discount on. The discount only takes $1 or $2 off and taxes adds it right back up. Everyone have to work on Holidays. If you call out on holidays, that is an automatic 3 points. I worked on Thanksgiving one time and they gave everyone that worked on Thanksgiving a 25% discount card on the last day the card was usable. They told us that we could only use the card on our break or if we were clocked out and the card expired at midnight."
bad,"Overall poor work environment with no chances of promotion and extremely expensive benefits. Management didnt care about anything and spent all day hiding in the back offices. Would not reccomend, no matter how desperate you are, it's not worth it."
bad,When I first started it was as a good company to work for. It seemed to be very family and customer or unit. Customer service was always number one and everyone looked out for everyone we got our jobs done and have fun at the same time. We were driven by cell we had friendly competition and it showed off butt towards the end towards the end Eva Mae time with them it became very stressful and difficult to even show up
bad,You can only advance if you are a robot. They are eliminating positions and making it almost impossible to advance. Walmart used to have a family centered culture. Now it is all about business
bad,"I highly suggest that working at Walmart is a last resort. They do not care about you at all. They will work you like a slave and require you to do many different task way outside your job description. And if you decline you will be fired or  reprimanded. The management team is horrible. However, I did learn alot about how not to treat people and what not to do."
bad,"walmart is a very poor place too work.you are expected too work as if you are 2-4 people and if you dont you will get ""wrote up"". the other associates are nice and work hard alongside of you but management is very poor and only does something if they half too"
bad,"Low communication, minimal crew with management and even less of the crew, half of it being drunk call ins. They don't have enough scanners and printers to hand out so we can all be affective. Working us 1 per shift is ridiculous, two people even if its 4 hours in would be better but not because some might wait to work freight until someone arrives. As busy as walmart gets, they honestly need 3 people per shift. One for zone walking and removing what's not ours,2. Work freight and 3, check for customers while all 3 associates switch off. Being one person, I also had dept manager duties as an associate and had to run to the back a lot leaving an empty floor to go get a product that might sell. There so discriminating too."
bad,Walmart is all about Walmart. They work you a lot and have not gratitude. The managers go out of the way not to speak to you and they lie to you all the time.
bad,"Great experience, the culture and fellow employees made this job exciting.  Something new everyday.    Glad I spent time there but now it's time to take these skills honed and move on.."
bad,"I was a meat associate and the management never reach out to us unless something bad happens, but never the good.  The main boss at walmart was cool at first but overtime he would be more hostile and the aura around him was negative.  He was mad at me for taking time off to attend my Mother at the hospital.  Instead of having a heart, he complained that he had to do my work for me.  I felt really uncomfortable."
bad,Treat u like trash left on the curb no leadership poor bonus might well not look for bonus full of excuses y you won't get your bonus no matter what just rediciliousness.
bad,"buena empresa , pero falta mas filtro con la jefatura."
bad,"Extremely poor management and impossible expectations. As an assembler my work load was tough and the additional handyman work (not a part of my job description) made it very unmanageable. As a sales floor associate I was supposed to work in hardware but, I covered multiple departments as well as hardware. the"
bad,"I had a hard time working for Walmart. If I requested a day off in advance and it was approved they would then change it last minute and would not change it back stating I would have an occurrence if I did not come in. They were not good with training, I had minimal training before being put on the floor as a cashier on Black Friday. They would get mad if you asked for help and there was a lot of drana"
bad,Walmart wasn’t a good company to work. It was a lot of favoritism and the pair wasn’t fair. They punished their hard working associate and the slacking workers barely got coached. Not a fair job.
bad,"Being productive and a good employee isn't good enough as the managers do not care about you or what your name is"
bad,"Over worked, under paid , not enough workers to do a decent job . Management has no idea of how short on help they are. All they care about is finishing the job, not how it's done"
bad,Awful management they treat you like trash and I even had a supervisor the cursed and yelled at his employees. I would never work at Walmart ever again.
bad,The company has in the past maintained a culture of disorganized and disinterested management. The company continues to find new ways to reduce the work force while apply more duties to the remaining employees.
bad,"You’ll be promised the world but don’t be fooled. When you sign on with them be ready to say goodbye to your home life. There is NO balance. You will work most weekends and ALL holidays. If you’re salary, you work 50-60 hours per week. You’ll end up bringing home less than the CSMs after taxes when all of your hours are taken into consideration. Upper management is a joke!"
bad,They paint this bright picture but they are all fake and have bad attitudes I’m speaking on all the managers and front office. Hr never wants to help and they treat associates like they’re over paid. They don’t care if you have a family and increase accountability on holidays while the front office bosses spend every holiday with their family. I can’t blame the associates for their negativity and low morale due to the way they’re treated ask any associates and they will tell you the same
bad,"Working for The Walmart store located in Tullytown is not for anyone looking for a fun, exciting, and worthwhile job. There is poor management across the board. If your interested in working for Cap Team 2 I highly advise not to. Both managers and supervisors in charge don’t treat their workers with respect, Not appreciative of Hard work, Work ethic, etc.."
bad,"I was doing a managers job in Online Grocery Pickup but getting paid nothing more for it. Was told it may eventually become an actual position where I would make more money than the average grunt man in the department. That was about 8 months ago. I left the company because the managers expected me to do the job to the fullest of my abilities but not get paid anything for it. For 7 months I struggled along and when I asked ""When will I be paid more?"" management kept moving the raise back a few months. Last I heard a coworker who was up for the same raise is going to wait it out. Management told them maybe sometime late spring 2020. A full year after we first started doing the work. A year of not being paid for the work we did."
bad,"From the personnel office to the Store Manager need to go intensive studies to the Walmart Academy. "
bad,"Management not good"
bad,Worst job ever.....horrible management......way off schedule....showing favoritism to old workers...... standing for hours... late lunch breaks and late 15 minute breaks
bad,Management is awful and not very helpful except for a select few. Im one of the few that works extremely hard and there are a lot of lazy people that work there yet everyone gets the same pay and it seems like the hard workers get treated more unfairly
bad,They do not support pregnant women. I was very undertrained and lost but expected to keep the whole store afloat. Very stressful and horrible schedule.
bad,If you wanna get fired for having health problems and treated like dirt. Walmart is it especially Town Centre. Lies and broken promises. Getting set up and they fire people with cancer.
bad,I worked at the dc in gas city for almost 5 years. It was horrible experiences after the first year management is awful and the HR and Plant Manager are absolutely horrible people. I had my grandmother pass away the day before Christmas eve and was told the wouldnt approve time off because they didnt understand a death in the immediate why i couldnt be there for a holiday weekend.. horrible place
bad,"They preach Respect for the individual, but have no respect for their associates. Walmart has become like a dictatorship and doesn’t give a care about their Associates who have given 10 plus years to this company. Don’t give hours to work. So it’s a part time job that won’t pay the bills!"
bad,It's a under paid dead in job for a company that cares less for it's employees no room for advancement or anything no matter how hard you try 3 years wasted
bad,Be VERY careful considering Wal-Mart as a career! If upper management gets a vendetta against you your work life will complete turmoil Horrible environment
bad,"The company has drastically changed over the last six years,now they are more stricter on sick time and having personal leave of absence. The are muti-tasking the store employees to death. Never enough personal to wait on customers."
bad,"I was stuck doing the entire Dairy dept solo and they expected all of it to be done in 7 hrs and that includes breaking down all the pallet's that came in that night an then if they come in late ya not given time to make any of it up and if you get hurt at work you get written up even if it was not ya fault!"
bad,I am never going to come back to Walmart when I leave. It was the biggest mistake I ever when I took the job if I meet that wants to work for them I would tell them to run
bad,"The coworkers were awesome, but management seemed only concerned about what they could write you up for. Promotions were really dependent on who you knew, not what you knew."
bad,Management never comes when needed the store is always nasty maintenance take their time to clean up. Managers are rude !!! A lot of favoritism. They let people walk out with stuff without paying.
bad,Cut hrs down to 16hrs/week. Management always on their cell phones watching videos in front of customers. They don’t care about customers or employees
bad,"When I got hired at Walmart I was immediately told that I would never get full time. Horrible pay and even worse hours. NEVER call in! Be prepared to work in every department. Somedays not even in your own department. If there hasn't been good sales, also be prepared to cut your hours. For a company that ""cares"" about their customers they don't care at all for the employees."
bad,"and every Walmart that I've been to it seems that the people there do not care have no idea what their positions are supposed to be another company policies or even go buy them they don't take the time to train anyone in their position or even give them the tools that they need to deal with customer service"
bad,"Walmart stresses that there is no need for Walmart to be a Union, because they have the ""Open Door"" process, If you are not satisfied with a write up or the way you are treated, you can do an ""open door"" and bring the matter up to the level higher. This sounds great, but practical use of it, does not work. There is ONE Market Human Resource Manager for all of Utah County. She is a great lady but she does not have time to look into anything. Therefore, nothing will be fixed or looked into. I was written up once and I did an open door because of retaliation and the Market Human Resource Manager took 3 plus months to get back to me with her results. She wasn't even going to get back to me if I wouldn't have ran into her in a different store. She told me that there is nothing she can do. This is an obvious response that she forgot to look into the situation because if ANYONE else heard these details they would be concerned and would look into it seriously. Walmart management, the majority of salary management, is immoral and unethical. They will only stand up for what is right if it doesn't have the ability to effect their career or chances of advancement. This is very similar to every other company but worst."
bad,Their starting pay is pretty decent but they work you to death. I have been working here for almost two years and i still am not able to pick my availability without losing hours. They don't care about you at all if you're sick or you need to leave work early it will count against you.
bad,"Management was too strict, like slave drivers. Workload was usually overbearing. The hours were decent, but breaks were too short. The pay is also way too low for the company to make billions of dollars a year."
bad,"Serving as a member of management in store#709, I have seen how toxic leadership can push out the best of the best. If you enjoy being belittled, talked to as though you were a toddler, or made to feel like your best was NOT good enough or threatened with write ups, then I would not recommend this job for anyone."
bad,The hardest part of this job is dealing with the management incompetence. The dauphin store has managers barely qualified to work as associates let alone assistant managers. The pay is a joke and the raises are usually ten cents. What would really help walmart is if they unionized atleast then the associates would have a voice.
bad,"It was just a bad experience, The manager was a flake and just blocked me all the way to the end of my training. I have a lot of experience with loss prevention but had to wait until I could not take the place anymore and quit..."
bad,"Worst job I ever worked at..terrible management (would hire new people every week), wasn't trained, my cashier manager would flirt with me constantly, made me work night shifts then morning shifts back to back."
bad,Assistant manager was a person with a Napoleon complex  he changed hours and lost me part time job. While working another employee started in with me assistant changed story and fired me. It also seem he rewote my incident report and is using it as my statement. Open door policy is a joke 4 store 4262 is a joke
bad,"It literally is a sinking ship."
bad,"Working at Wal-Mart is good for work during college but there is very little career advancement there. They can be flexible but you have to be on top of them if they try to change your schedule without telling you. Favoritism runs high there, you can be in a position for years and get no career advancement. But some employees will get great advancements and opportunities simply because a manager likes them.  "
bad,Management sucked! They work you like a dog. I was in overnight stocking. Christmas time will kill you. There was up to 20 pallets of toys your expected to stock in one night. They want you to work every freaking weekend to.
bad,The environment is very stressful. When you are a salaried member of management they think they own you. They call you in your days off and in your vacations. Very unprofessional upper management! Directions change in a daily basis and they don’t even give you heads up or communicate effectively. Favouritism is huge at Walmart and they think people can’t see it or notice it!
bad,Management likes to make plans they don't keep. They don't communicate with each other or employees. They treat you like badly and use you without promoting you. They are more likely to hire someone new and promote them than to recognize who is already there. Working there actually set me back due to a lack of work /home balance. They pay more starting than most but its not worth it to stay long term.
bad,Management was awful. They wanted to work us to death but weren't willing to help. They expected you to know everything about the store and procedures from day 1.
bad,"Managers don't communicate with others. And they're so many managers that if your doing something for one manager and the manager over another department doesn't know that you were sent, you will be written up. I was written up my 2nd week for not zoning an aisle, when I didn't even know what zoning was. No training no assistance."
bad,Use to be a great place to work. But over the 20yrs I was there things just got bad. Lack of respect for the individual and no morels of management and the store manager.
bad,"My paycheck never bounced but that's the only good thing I can say about working for this company. I worked for them in a salaried position for 13 years. You are nothing but a number and will never advance unless you brown nose. All the higher management from the District to regional are useless have no clue what there doing and frankly don't care about people or families. "
bad,"Management always claimed to have an open door policy. But was not there when you needed her.  I had requested accommodations through a program called Sedwick, which was supposed to be less hours worked. I was working 35 to 38 hours a week when I was supposed to be a part-time employee. This resulted in call ins due to my illness which resulted in my termination."
bad,"The management is so consumed with the outcome but do not want to help when it is needed. There motto is to point fingers at people and make them feel horrible, which they don't mind going out of their way to do that!  They have their clicks and you can not think that anything is private because the whole store will know before you even leave the office. This crew there is just horrible and I'm glad I escaped"
bad,"The treat their employees like garbage. Will try to fire you for any reason when they want you gone. I started looking for another job, because I was dissatisfied with my working conditions. Shortly after I started getting wrote up for the smallest and stupidest things. like a bag left by another cashier's costumer, placing change into a ladys hand 1 inch from it (I was told that was throwing the change into her hand.), lastly getting fired for putting a bandaid on my bloody leg. (because I wasn't gushing blood)."
bad,This place is horrible the management is horrible their customer service is horrible  I hate it don’t work unless. U need a job they do not care for you it’s only what u can give
bad,"Management was very picky, but never saw them helping. Rude management mostly store manager. They loved telling you how to do your job and wanted you to work with many hats."
bad,Very rude management with bad customer service skills and not enough hours at Walmart they treat there associates with no respect at all and expect you to be ok with it
bad,There is a lack of organization and communication in upper management.I have learned to expect the unexpected. Work with Wal-Mart is always a mixed culture and the associates are amazing people. The hardest part is working without the correct amount of staff. The most enjoyable part is teaching associates new things. It is great to see the shine and glow on their faces when they accomplish new things.
bad,"At first l liked working at Walmart, then I grew tired of it's disorganized structure, unfair pay, inadequate benefits. It got to a point where I was getting sick literally working there."
bad,Work environment was stressful leaving minimal room for even small mistakes. No options to make life easier or more tolerable for employees. Music was not allowed nor was sitting down.Tasks assigned included some outside of the job description.
bad,"The management was terrible, and they made me feel worthless any time they got the chance. They also did not care about my health or well-being and made life harder than it had to be. They were quite degrading and showed a lot of favoritism. I did love most of the hourly employees I worked with; however, the pros were far less than the cons."
bad,Walmart was great till you work bad people that don't do there task nor on time. Management don't care for employees. They care for employees that don't complain but others employees.
bad,"No set hours, a lot of awkward hours like (1:45-10:15). Management was so out of control they either didnt care to fire you or couldn't stand to lose you at all. They run on a point system 5 points and your gone. Unless you work a shift where they really need you, they will erase your points (which isn't fair to everyone around you). They will run you to any and every department and make you work even if you have no idea what your  doing"
bad,"Probably one of the worst jobs I’ve ever had. The management was mediocre and the new produce staff were lackadaisical. "
bad,Workers make 20k a year managment makes 50k.store manager brags about her 150k sad environment to be around. Oh &yea they bonus depending on location.
bad,"My Career (Job) at walmart was suppose to be a stop gap. I recently moved to Missouri and never worked retail so I said why not. Overall you have some great co-workers some “lifers” who been there for 10 plus years so they feel they know the culture and systems well which is a gift and a curse. Because their insight is great when brand new but the entitlement that comes with the job not so much. Management sucks they don’t listen and they have no set routine or rarely follow the standard operating procedures they plan as they go which is a headache and no real routine. Most times they’re trying to cover their behinds so they won’t get yelled at by the xo-manger or store manager. Turnover is high because moral is always low. And for the decent starting pay for retail they expect you to fly to the moon, mars and th Milky Way and back fro 11.50 . The seas is killer "
bad,I understand that missing days was my fault but no one and I mean absolutely nobody ever talked to me about getting close to high on occurrences and I was abruptly fired
bad,No consistency from day to day. Seemed like managment could rarely agree on job priorities. Hourly supervisors had better understanding of day to day needs.
bad,"I would not recommend working here. Management goes off of favoritism. No room for advancement unless you are a suck up. Also, some forms of racism involving customers and higher management. I’ve been with company for 4 years and had to work 31 hours to get 1 hour of PTO. No secure positions anymore. Every year they cut out more job positions. Be ready to work everyone’s job with no help."
bad,"This job is unorganized, management is irresponsible, they have rats in the store, everybody in management abuses their title and when there was kaose novody wanted to take control."
bad,"This was the one job I've had that I have actually hated. It is the only company I have seen that so openly does not care about their employees. Even if upper management cares about the lower level employees and do what they can, they become extremely limited due to corporate rules."
bad,This is the worst place to ever work at. Managers are very rude and find any reason to yell at you. They don't care about anyone but themselves and they don't train you to do anything right at all.
bad,"Walmart was one of the worst places I’ve worked. I really only recommend this torture if you’re a high school student looking for a summer job, and even then, don’t expect to have much of a life. Besides having zero respect for a persons home life, the amount of disrespect that comes from management makes this place unbearable. Do yourself a favour and exhaust all other options first."
bad,"The store its self is just filthy. The produce area is disgusting. No associate cleans, culls the molded produce. They throw new food on top of old. I do not buy from this walmart anymore now that I have seen this. I've tried cleaning multiple times and I'm told that down stacking the truck is more important. Like, No! If customers see what I see, Walmart would lose so much money."
bad,"I have been working here for two years and the past couples months have been the worst. Management is the worse, they never ever actually resolve people's issues and only care about themselves or their favourites. If you think about applying to any Walmart I'd suggest thinking it over. if I can give them a 0 rating I would."
bad,"Very rude managers, they claim that if you need something medically excused they can do that but even with a doctors fax they refused to help me and I lost my job because I physically could come to work."
bad,"They dont give you the hours you want to work even after you've been there long enough to deserve them, they dont pay you enough to be running multiple departments a day while management walks around doing nothing to help."
bad,Everything Walmart does is unethical.  From asking cashiers to not tell customers how much is left on a gift card to clocking out and keep on working.
bad,Pior lugar que eu trabalhei em 20 anos...
bad,"Don’t do it! You work your self to the bone, and get absolutely no recognition for your accomplishments! And if you decide at some point to take a management position, well all bets are off, the company then owns you! The store I worked for I helped get two programs off the ground and helped with my team to make that store, Super center of the year for 2016, all the while our store was going through a remodel and we were trying to get Online Grocery Pickup off the ground, which was an enormous task! So during the Holidays I got sick, doctors note and all and I had to be out 1 day and mind you I had no absences at that time, so the store manager got mad at me and we had words, I decided I had had enough so I gave a 2 weeks notice and he let me go right then! I was shocked at they way they treated me! I always went to work and did my job  and they treated me like a door mat!! I will never work for that company again!"
bad,The management at the Walmart that I worked at does not work together. On any given shift you may be told to do three different things by three different managers. Confusion and disorganization is rampant in the store I worked at. I would never ever recommend a job at Walmart. They are a culture of your Expendable I can replace you tomorrow
bad,"Everyone is pushed beyond their indurance. Only have about 20-30 percent of personnel needed to accom -plish job and provide customer service at an acceptable level. Customers are upset and complaining all the time abt lack of service. No compensation for working nights, weekends or holidays. Expected to work no excuses accepted not even sickness, family etc."
bad,"Nasty coworkers, inconsistent hours, constantly overworked, helping the customer always hurts someone else, management doesn’t support any of their employees, no job security, high turnover, customers are consistently nasty and cannot defend yourself in any way, chances for raises and few depending on what position you work, positions are consistently being removed and associates are forced to find a new position or are fired."
bad,Dont recommend walmart at all .. Senior management has an agenda
bad,"Work is simple enough, but there are many people working there yet only a few seem to do any work. Most managers are controlling with power as they sit in the office and do nothing, whereas other managers who actually are on the floor working to get things done seem to have no say over anything since they are not the store managers favorite. This is a theme across all Walmart stores. While many of my coworkers where pleasant to work with, many others were already broken down by such an awful work experience where nothing can get done due to poor organization. Departments are placed in the way of other departments for no discernible reason other than ""that's how we've always done it"" and it hampers productivity having to wait 10 minutes for employees to move for you to even start picking for items to place on the shelves. Avoid this place at all costs."
bad,They only promote low lives who lives consist of nothing but Walmart. They want to control every part of your life & trap you in their toxic whirlpool
bad,The managers were always hard on the cashiers. You get 15 minute breaks after working like 3 or 4 hours and that’s if they send someone to you. Didn’t get a raise the 2 years I worked there and they told me I was a good employee. Made the schedule like 3 weeks before and you can’t request time off without getting a point if you kiss it.
bad,"Walmart is not the company it used to be.  I worked for 5 stores in 2 different states for 8 years.  The work experience decreased over 8 years.  They took away the Sunday bonus.  The took away the overnight shift differential.  Department Managers used to have set Mon-Fri 7am to 4 pm shifts.  Now they are required to work 1 weekend day and have split days off.  The amount of stress can be debilitating.  The amount of  work is equal to what 3-4 employees used to do 10 years ago.  Most stores run on skeleton crews and only hire help during Blitz (Oct 31-Man 4).  They are pretty good about transferring stores and the benefits are good, but it doesn't make up for the pressure.  Constantly told ""If you don't like it, quit, we have 100 other people waiting for your job.""   Sad, but true.  Longevity counts for nothing.  I watched 20 year Department Managers busted down to Cashiers."
bad,"The only reason I'm still here is because they pay me $15 an hour, having said that I started at $7.65 and it took 5 years to get my current salary due to inflation.. they now give a percentage of your pay for yearly raises/evaluation. I got the max which with my current salary percentage was 22 cents last year, can't wait to see what this year holds for me!!"
bad,"Walmart does not care for its employees. If there's an emergency or any kind of issue in your life, Walmart would make you choose to either lose your job or keep working. A great example is a woman who had a heart attack was given a choice to keep working or lose her job if she gets in the ambulance. She lost her job. The excuse for their actions was that she missed to many days already and those were her only choices. Ex. for my experience was water coming out of a extension plug in. The manager wanted me to fix it. That is not a responsibility of mine. When something like that goes down you call an expert, he didn't want to. Of course he was furious with me and called an actual expert. Cry me a river."
bad,"In my store, #660 in Muscle Shoals, AL. the Management team is HORRIBLE. I work in the online grocery pickup and not a single manager cares if we get behind or need help. They get angry at us for being 'incompetent' "
bad,Walmart is a terrible company to work for. The bad reputation Walmart engenders in people's minds is well earned. One either needs to fall in line or face the wrath of a vindictive management structure designed to protect its own seemingly along racial lines. Where discovery of truth is left in the hands of persecutors and then everyone involved acts as though there was any veracity to the investigation. What a joke!
bad,Walmart claims to have an open door policy and wants to have a culture where people feel open to talk about issues and be part of solutions. Then when you go to them they tell you whatever to shut you up but never follow through with their end of tje agreement.  It's a never ending cycle of piling more and more on the employees and no pay raises (I had to fight for mine for 4 months) and just make your job harder at every turn. I'm really tired of feeling like I'm being beaten like a mule instead of respected as a hard working employee.
bad,"This is a terrible place to work. The scan speed requirement was ridiculous, department managers were horrible. Only the store manager was a decent manager. Would only work for Walmart again, if it is an absolute must to keep me from being homeless."
bad,not terrible but will drain your energy and make you hate it in the long run. management expects too much from one person and will let others get away with much. pay isn't terrible but good be better.
bad,I would only work at Walmart if you had no other options and you want to go to school but other than that I wouldn't recommend working with Walmart company
bad,If you need a job Walmart is an okay place to work. The customers are enjoyable and you can be proud of the low prices and how it helps low income customers.
bad,If you run the register be prepared for rude customers. Management will not support you in any way. I gave it right back to them. Got tried of having to fight daily for work hours for the week. You have to be there every weekend and holiday. Absolutely no overtime. They expect you to take a longer lunch instead of leaving early when you do get overtime.
bad,"Walmart policy says one thing, the management does another."
bad,I would not work there again unless higher in the company. There was a lot of stress everybody hated what they were doing and wanted to move to a different department then the one i was on.
bad,Company is focused on hiring only vendor contracted works and removing associates that have extended experience within the Healthcare and compliance industry.
bad,Always understaffed and management does not get the training they need so most managers do not know what to do no real room for any kind of advancement
bad,"they time you doing stock and it can,t be done in the specific time allowed the majority  of the time.this company was a great place to work for until they started to change the way your suppose to do them. If its not broken don't fix it !"
bad,"Harassment by Vision Center management. Unable to resolve with upper management. I documented, reported and finally quit. Working was unbearable! Management could care less."
bad,"If you come to Walmart you’re in for a treat. Some stores might not be bad but when you’re in cap 2 especially at 5469. You’re going to expect some bad things. Management pushing the same people over and over exhausting us. Putting people in charge when they shouldn’t be. Not firing people they should be. They pick favorites. If you wanna move up in ranks at this store good luck. Better off finding another place to work that offers more money and benefits or college. "
bad,"Highly political, discouraging growth even when you show you are willing to go the extra mile. It will drain you. If you have any condition or injury, get documented immediately and have specialists cover all possible incidents that might come up. It doesn't matter if you are missing a foot, you will be given ""productivity"" coachings/discussions for not moving relatively fast enough. Customer service is no longer priority despite what is loudly proclaimed, boxes are. They want you to find a way to move on if any customer takes more than a couple minutes. It's a policy that will be the downfall of the company, they will continue to lose technical-minded and creative thinkers. Asset Protection is turned on employees to create ""productivity cases"" when the employee is disliked by management for any reason. I have been accused of taking breaks too long on a day of the week I haven't worked in 3 years. I didn't believe the warnings of why people were quitting, now I have stayed long enough to see why. After 4 raises, 3 have been negated by increased base pay, so it's the equivalent of having worked here a single year. Essentially, you work under siege for a pittance, slowly having your enthusiasm eaten away and replaced by bitterness til it's merely the connections you have made, pure stubbornness, and that subsequent employers wouldn't quite understand the nature of the job place if you just walked out. So you stay, grit your teeth with pride, and fill out a resume to find a place to put your skills to use. That is growth at Walmart, realizing you shouldn't be there."
bad,"East Brunswick Walmart is the worst place to work for, the Market Mgr and the store Mgr are the worst bosses someone can work for, they don't respect anyone, if you complain to ethics nothing is done."
bad,I was a supervisor for my  front end cashiers my daily duties were support for my cashiers make sure that we were clean on the front end make sure pricing was correct handle cash with money gram we also did site to store for packages
bad,Never enough staff. Takes forever before you can get a lunch sometimes you don’t get a lunch. Managament was so young minded and unprofessional. Security is not tight it’s unsafe
bad,"Walmart values it's customers over their employees every time.  Almost everyone is part-time so benefits are unheard of.  Also, management is not for the employee."
bad,Managment is not there to suport their associates.  They say they are a family and ive seen no signs of that.  They tske advantage of you amd dont care about your family.
bad,"The management is absolutely terrible, they do not care one bit about their employees. You could be puking in the middle of the floor and they’d send you to break and tell you to come back or you’d get fired. All the CSMs are terrible but act like they are so overworked. If you want to be put down, disrespected, sexually harassed, and talked about by your own managers, Walmart is the place for you!"
bad,I was very frustrated by management and their inability to run this business properly. Many occasions i have seen the management decline customers and have them leave the store under unsafe conditions.
bad,"If you're considering a job in their warehouse. Be in perfect shape never get hurt or sick. No sick days. You will get written up. And if you get injured, lol, hope you have hospital money because they will turn down any claims and will not pay because ""you"" are at fault."
bad,It used to be a better company to work for. It’s no longer about the employees or customers. It’s about the higher ups and the keeping there positions
bad,"Download price changes, print new price labels, count product, move clearance products to clearance shelf, make price reductions. Management did not care about its employees.  They were changing policy, promised bonuses and did not deliver, claimed to have an open door policy however were often unavailable, had a high employee turnover rate.  The hardest part of the job was that it was not employee friendly.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was five minutes from home, therefore completely convenient to get to and from."
bad,"The old women sucked to work with, managers (especially department managers) would always shove their responsibilities off on you and get upset when you couldn’t do their job ON TOP of your job.  Management picks favorites, HARD."
bad,HORRIBLE management! You never have one job because you are always doing eveyone elses! It is implied early on that if you don't do what the management want you to that they will make your life hard.
bad,I was basically used by management because of my attention to detail and was even told by management on another shift about it. I trained 6 people and was promised management opportunities but was never even certified to ever even be a trainer. The only workers that desire to stay at the job do not even wish to advance in there careers. This is not a job for an ambitious individual. Be ready to sacrifice your well being just to make production.
bad,"Working at the Home office I absolutely adored this company, LOVED going to work every day, and felt I was important to my position.  I am now working in the field, and the management at my club has zero respect for the individual, club manager cusses and degrades other associates over the walkie talkies, throws things when he gets mad and overall he cannot be trusted by other associates. This is not the culture I have witness in the past and surely not the culture that you are held to at home office.  The new attendance policy in the field is a joke with no regard to family emergencies or taking the time needed if you are sick and need some time to recover.  I am so disappointed in ""my company"""
bad,Just No! Don’t do it! Walmart is heading in a direction that I wish not to be part of. Management and company are just going down and not fun to work there anymore. Feels like someone is always watching you. And they have admitted they do watch cameras.
bad,papillion Walmart very badly takes advantage of people. The store manager there is phony and all he cares about is money. It’s like they reel you in with good pay then treat you like you’re nothing. They don’t care how long you been there or anything like that. Every department suffers there because online grocery is the future.
bad,Management doesn’t communicate at all. So no one knows what’s going on have the time. They slave drive the good workers and let the slackers do whatever. Never talk to the employees with respect but rather like you are their teenage son or daughter. And last but not least will not work with you on hours or your schedule because “WalMart should be your first priority”.
bad,I worked there for a little over 4 years. I never had the proper tools to do my job at an efficient level and always had to juggle 3 or 4 things at once. It really had a negative effect on the health.
bad,"Walmart, or at least my walmart, has decided that constamt change is the road to greater profit. Raises are based on the entirely subjective views of myanagemt team, and goals are not expressed until you have failed to meet them."
bad,Walmart is not the place to work I worked there 16 years only to be terminated due to something they could of prevented by getting me off my register when I called them to not go over my five hours but they sent no one which caused me to hit my 5 hrs there for making me violate the policy not once but twice causing my termination.  I had a line of customers and was only cshier in garden center and also could not leave garden door unattended as its a high theft store. No door attendant ment I had to cashier and watch the door. They had adequate notice to get me a replacement but ignored my request and would not fix my violation. I was a honest dedicated associate who put 16 years in with many extra hours and never appreciated sometimes staying till 3 am in morning cause there cash recycler broke and i had to close store by myself dumping 24 registers and resetting the self check. as well as manage my cashiers as a Customer Service Manager.
bad,"I was injured on the job and punished for it. While it pays better than other near-minimum wage jobs, I would not recommend working here. They do not value their employees, and they take advantage of their employees."
bad,"Everyone is very clicky and if your not then you are setup to be fired. My manager and I were like water and oil. With that her and 2 sisters who worked in the same pharmacy teamed up and set me up with the most horrible customers we had to offer. That continued with bullying and them submitting false information and complaints, ultimately getting me fired. They never even gave me a clear reason on why I was fired just that they got multiple complaints from the same people your done."
bad,"Never had a job where I felt so unappreciated. Would come up with solutions to problems but suggestions would fall on deaf ears. More and more work piled on everyday, often work that should have been completed by other departments. No one seems to care about doing things correctly, no strong discipline or sense of roles. Was only going to be there temporarily and wish I had been. Regret spending any more time there then I needed too."
bad,Don’t work for Walmart if you’re a genuinely good person and want a really regular work environment.  Once I left I honestly stopped smoking because I didn’t feel stressed. I like helping customers but everything else I can live without.
bad,"Just an absolute mess from top to bottom, Rehired a known woman abuser but let’s go of great workers that would bust their butts."
bad,"Walmart doesnt care about their employees. Not like they used to. High turn over rate. Minimum benefits, straining work/ very little pay. And your personal life schedule doesnt matter they want ""open availability"" I dont recommend to anyone"
bad,"Depending on if management likes you, you can go far, if they don’t you won’t even get a pay raise. The company is about doing more with less. Lots of stress on you with little to show for it. The pay is not comparable to other companies and depending on where you live you can be living check to check"
bad,"They forced me to transfer after 8yrs and then I was fired 6mo after that while on medical leave! It I guess just depends on what store your at I've heard other say good things, I even bragged. Til they totally messed me up"
bad,I love my job itself and my coworkers BUT home office is making way too many changes and eliminating positions which is putting people out of jobs. My store is way understaffed but home office doesnt think so.
bad,Horrible with all the new changes and how they are treating their long term associates! Scheduling is horrible! Management team is horrible! The moral of the associates are at an all time low! No more job security and the have cut the associates hours tremendously to where we don't know how we will pay our bills! They don't care about their long term associates at all! They cut our hours so they're able to hire more new people in! Corporate needs to stop with all of these new changes that are affecting how we're able to live!
bad,Horrible Company   needs help with management  Company needs help with  associates the company needs help with the bosses . And the company needs help with running the cleaning of the place
bad,"I was on the night shift in the deli. Many days I would come to work and would be the only employee on the schedule from 2pm-11pm. Can you imagine running a whole deli alone? I had to cook, clean, and serve customers ALONE! No manager would come to help, unless it was my lunch hour n even then they would call me back at like 5 min before my lunch was over. it was a horrible experience and 5 years of my life was wasted."
bad,I was literally told to never ask a MANAGER a question or voice a concern If I wanted a chance at a full-time position. The training program is also a complete joke
bad,"Be prepared to work many positions. They have cut back hours so much, and people, which leaves more for you to do. They cut back on sick days too!"
bad,Need qualified Pharmacy Manager that doesn't micro-manage. Poor work/life balance. No quality training program in pharmacy. No respect for their employees.
bad,"Walmart is peek late stage capitalism on full display. Management is trained to lie to your face, and tell you that you're not getting ripped off as you work for minimum wage while your work load increases day after day, after day, after day.. etc. And that's just the retail side. I can only imagine the torturous conditions that production must go through. I've literally found hidden notes in the freight from developing countries with workers begging for help. It makes my stomach sick. Please boycott Walmart if you have the means to shop elsewhere."
bad,"If you finish the task you are given and ask a manger what else you can do 90% of the time you will get the response ""I don't know"". "
bad,Was once a great American company but no longer. If you are a manager don’t come here because you don’t get to manage any longer. Everything rolls down from Home Office and you are expected to follow it with out any consideration of area needs or people needs. They don’t want creative people or people giving ideas for improvement. Just do as your told. If you like that style then you should have joined the military where you at least have a retirement plan. 30+ years in management and upon retirement I laid down the keys and didn’t even get a thank you for 30+ years.
bad,"This was the worst environment of workplace I could have ever worked, beside the customers genuine attitude making the day go by, most of the workers were not at their best of moods when it came to being teams and sharing the idea of a family oriented place."
bad,"The managers were hard to deal with, and wouldn't let people do full-time. Co-workers were rude and always into drama. Some customers were nice, others were mean. The work is fine, during the holidays it's busy, but most of the time it's a nice pace. Okay starter job, but not long term."
bad,Needed to check into things more better and make sure your staff is taken care of because the customer is not always right. And if you are going to approve something make sure all things are taken care of then.
bad,"If you enjoy doing everything but the job you signed up for then WalMart is the place for you, Managment plays on your emotions. Ignores your grievances and does not listen to you."
bad,Not a place you want to work u less you want to give up a life outside of work. And it is expected you go 110% from the moment you clock in until you clock out.
bad,"Locked out due to lack of breaks on register, calling me to office during peak hours, promos never offered or given to unqualifired people. Poor hours"
bad,The managers would yell and scream at you and even if you were short staffed with just you working they expected too much. It would've been good pay other than the excess stress and constant threatening of losing your job even when you're giving 110%
bad,"Every hour felt like forever, the job is so boring and useless, they make it so you have to wait 6 months to switch jobs and that job is miserable, literally the worst job I’ve ever had"
bad,"20+ years and every last one has been worse than the last.  Only reason being there so long is pay in the area is horrible compared to cost of living, and since working for Walmart have a hard time even getting interviews for jobs."
bad,On some days work is good but more days than others it's stressful my body gets over worked and torn down daily behind the stress and extra work but the customers is what keep me coming back!
bad,"Management acts as if walmart is one big highschool, promotes their favorites while disciplining people that work hard. This job is absolutely based solely on who likes you and if you’re not it you get treated like garbage until they fire you or you’re forced to find something else. the only good quality walmart has going for them is the cheap healthcare and decent pay, but it was not worth the toll on my mental health nor a healthy balance between work/life"
bad,Be prepared to be used by management to make them look good and create sales as well as over worked and under compensated. You are expected to do your job as well as your other team members who get paid just as much as you to stand around and do nothing as well as deal with customers complaining about things that are out of your control. If you want to just collect a paycheck for doing nothing just get the job and you are golden because there is absolutely 0 accountability anywhere. On most occasions managers will treat customers with more respect than you. On top of all of that enjoy a nice 20 or 30 cent raise once a year for working 3 or 4 times harder than someone who just got the same raise as you.
bad,The store I worked in was very disorganized. Senior management was lacking. Too many employees on LOA. Culture in the store was poor due to lack of employee engagement.
bad,"When I started the managers and he staff talked up the job and said it was the best place to work. They have ok osh benefits the health insurance is expensive just for a household of 2. And that was a pain to get in the first place. Then they promise you 10 hour days 4 days a week...that is a huge lie! Then when that is brought up they say ""well there is nothing we can do about that, which I do not believe. So they work you anywhere from 12 to the limit which is 16 hours a day, so there is no life balance while you work during the Week. And when you are off on the weekends your body is in constant pain. If you get hurt on the job they either treat you like you are lying or try to push the fault and blame on you even when it is not always preventable, which ends in you getting a point on your ptl which is like a write up. There is more I could go on about but I think that is enough."
bad,After catching the flu I put in all of the required paper work for the time I would be out of work 3 days at the most and my manager instead told me he was just going to fire me because he had no need for employees that couldn't show up to work
bad,Sam Walton is spinning in his grave. There are wayyy too many managers telling you opposing things to do and complaining when you dont finish tasks. Permanently short staffed. Never get complimented or encouraged by management.  Always hurry up you're not working fast enough. Favoritism is rampant. Always cutting hours yet expecting more work done.
bad,"Intimidated by trainers and management to NOT report workplace injuries. Were disciplined if reported. Company made workers feel expendable. Unappreciated. Made you sign 'non-union' agreement before job offer, so intimidation from the start."
bad,management does not care about associates. I used to like working here when I first started but now I loathe it. there is no appreciation for the work and effort you do at this work place.
bad,"Very stressful , some of the managers didnt know how to talk to people . They have us a pay raise and then cut everyone's hours back to part time,  like we suppose to live off the money they were paying"
bad,"Management is awful."
bad,"I made this place my career for a long time. There is absolutely no job security. A small window for advancement and with everything going on lately, it's getting smaller. The management team doesn't care anymore because they are being run into the ground. The moral is low upon everyone in the building. The store manager has favorites and retaliation is a real thing."
bad,"So I have worked as a Cashier there for about 1.5 years. It is an easy job I’m not going to lie. However, the combination of rude (overall stupid) customers, lack of any benefits, stressful work environments, median pay, and a group of higher up salaried management that could not ever care about you, makes this one of the most painful and depressing jobs you could work for."
bad,This Company was the worst job I have ever had. Horrible management and supervision team. Bad work environment everything is messy and very unorganized and not very professional.
bad,"Management doesn't care about any associates below them, I was also harassed by a co-worker threatening to fight me for no reason. Aslo the customers suck."
bad,La gérante de succursalle est littéralement la personne avec le moins de tact que je connaisse. Même chose pour la gérante des caisses. Sincèrement c’est legit ATROCE.
bad,Used to be a fun place to work everyone was like family now its like everyone for themselves cant work together as a team should. Get yelled at for asking coworker for help. Associates think they are bosses of other associates and they can tell others what they can and cannot do.
bad,Wal-Mart is a round to clock job. It takes everything out of you. You get home and basically go to sleep to wake up for the next stressful day no matter what you do there.
bad,9 times out of 10 at some point in your life you will work at a grocery store like Walmart. Either as a cashier or a cart pusher or maybe even a door greater.
bad,Horrible work life balance. My personal experience may very form others. Every time they made a change to the schedule for a salaried manager it destroyed the work life balance.
bad,"I have never disliked a job that I have had until this one.  Micro-managed and store security watches your every move and falsely accuses of taking 12 minute breaks instead of 10 minutes, walking away from work area to get snacks when it is not break time.  I have never and did not ever do any of these things although there were other team members that did but somehow store security claimed that it was me instead, which was an absolute fabrication of the truth or an outright lie.  My father had a grave illness during three months of my employment and I never missed a day of work but had some late arrivals to work coming from the hospital and trying to assist my mother who was having a hard time functioning during my father's illness.  Walmart does not tolerate late arrivals, which is understandable when you are trying to run a company, but they have no empathy for those that are doing so as a result of a legitimate and very stressful family situation.  I do not have to have a pat on the back for everything but appreciation of the fact that I never missed a day of work during this time would have been appreciated.   Team member efforts are very unappreciated.  Terrible pay in comparison to your experience.  I surmise that the company was looking for a reason to get me to leave so they became knit picky about everything and started accumulating lies to add to my workday history to backup their story.  "
bad,"EVERYDAY and I mean every day there will be a customer that is disrespectful. You could come to work all happy and have it shut down by a rude customer. I worked in the self-checkout and they expect you to catch people stealing, but when you do you're supposed to call Asset Protection. Even when I would catch people AP did nothing. And the CSMs were a joke. If I needed help they would take their lovely time to come. The only good thing about Walmart is that they pay 11/hr but in my opinion, we should make more. All in ALL, don't waste your time. Find something else that won't make you pull your hair out."
bad,"try to go to school and get a better job don't make this "
bad,"Your entire existance belongs to Walmart. No family time, they will guilt you into coming in on days off or staying longer. They will make you feel as if your needs are just impossible or against policy. There is no growth, you will be part time from the time you start until the time you finally give up and quit."
bad,There's nothing more I could do to try and keep my job they don't want me to have it i like that job but management is horrible and expect you to get everybody else's job done in your
bad,"I worked at the Port St. Lucie location for 5 years before moving up here an transferring, since I been up here it’s been terrible for demoted, pay cut, and hours cut."
bad,Worst company ever. I've been here for years and have seen good managers pushed out the door. Favoritism and poor management. Corporate doesnt care ...
bad,"I love helping people, but there's an immense pressure to do the work of 2-3 people. I was usually throwing multiple departments by myself. The days that I had people working with me, there was often outside management in the building."
bad,"if you work at walmart ur desperate and i dont blame you the industry isnt flexible and you need a job were not the 1% "
bad,"Mine experience with Walmart kinda sucked. I had managers that wouldn't let me leave my position to use the bathroom, customers that would get mad, and managers that would schedule us closing and then morning the next day."
bad,"Favoritism, unfairness, horrible staffing on purpose for certain times of the year "
bad,its regretful the manager does not care what you do there theyll put items in different spots on the selves and the manager is races against black people
bad,Management in Walmart are very unprofessional not to mention disrespectful including this store manager he uses fowl language when addressing his management team not to mention entry level associates my fellow associates feel the same low pay for work that’s being done lastly too much favoritism you cannot grow with a company if this is how they run business!
bad,I would rather work at McDonalds . They Have Better Customer Service Than The Managers At Walmart . They Don’t Care about they Employees At All . Poor Work Hours And Dont Follow You Availability And Cut Your Hours Whenever They Feel Like It
bad,"Due to inconsistent managers that don’t know other departments they’ll tell you to do something that will later get you in trouble with the company as well as they don’t care if you have a medical emergency like infection from bad teeth getting into your blood stream and possibly hospitalized, they won’t listen to reason and won’t let you speak should you not feel comfortable doing something that’s NOT in your job description that you haven’t been trained for"
bad,The work environment at Walmart was not all too bad. The only thing I did not approve of was the long hours sitting on the register without getting a break. The constant back-and-forth and running around.
bad,"Walmart is not the best place to work. Sure, it starts out great, but as time goes on things that get promised will never happen. Such as career advancement, doesn't happen as managers show favoritism."
bad,"They do not care for their employees, i got hurt and when i was in to much pain to work, they wouldn't excuse the absence, even though i got hurt on the job. I'm also having issues with workers comp too. I was also very sick, and i had a doctors not excusing me for the day and they did not accept it, and would not excuse my absence. This is a terrible place to work at."
bad,"I recently left Walmart. March 29th was my one year. And as crazy as it may sound my manager has it out for me and I have no idea why. I worked my butt off, did the job of about three people some times even had to do things the manager was suppose to take care of but was no where to be found. Walmart is the type of company that if your aren’t friends with the right people you will get no where. They called me and only me every time someone called out, had me in the bakery some days and even had me unloading trucks and bringing our items to our freezer in the deli and stock them. There were days I loved my job but after about 6 months I finally realized it doesn’t matter how hard you work it’s all about favoritism. I have a whole list of problems and situations that I had taken to my supervisor, then my assistant then finally the store manager and in the end Nothing was done about anything. Even being called racial slurs by another employee and she had nothing done. I had 5 statements against her from people and nothing was done. So if you want to work somewhere and work your tail off for no recognition then Walmart is the place for you. Just hope you be friend the right ones."
bad,There is definitely A lot of favoritism Management Gives poor hours. Customers are Very rude. Management has Associates working In other areas but there own they rather get the hours for all Management then there employees. I do not recommend this job to anyone
bad,"If you like being bullied and not wanting to advance. This is the place for you!"
bad,There about money not there employees there not a possitive place to work .I think managers look at spreadsheats not there workers.Lots of back bitting to get ahead.
bad,"This place is more for high schoolers or just people trying to build a job resume not really a career thing unless you already put in the time and by time I mean 15-20 years. I worked they for a year and some change and on had a $1 raise. Sad part people that got hired  and was only on for a day up to a few months had my same pay rate, I got paid like a new hire. Not really any growth unless it was in your own store. They never wanted to give you hours. They were willing to cut off one minute just to save money and when I started I was only a part-time cashier making $8.40. They only wanted me to work 32 hrs not 32.01. They tried to take away my accepted OT as well. Once I had a family I knew it was time to leave because pay wasn’t able to help support a family."
bad,"The co-managaers and assistant managers are worthless,all they care about is their bonuses and would ask employees not to report accidents so they could get all their bonuse money . Assistant managers give the positions to people that they friends with ."
bad,"What can I say? It not what you would want to do for a living, and it seemed like nobody there did either. Poor culture, poor pay, poor management. There might be some good people in it but that doesn't make it worth while. I tried my best to improve what I could with my limited power and was always at fault for being unable to fix the problem that is walmarts systems. It seemed like people would fail upwards to management and blame their team for a broken system."
bad,Too much favoritism there some people can do anything they want like talking on their phone and not working and never get in trouble but others that work hard get treated like dirt .
bad,"If you're looking to just pay for basics or even a 2nd job, look somewhere else! There are plenty of other retail jobs in this city that will treat you better for the same pay. This store & most others in the metro area will make you job unhappy. Don't be tricked by the $11 hr. starting pay, you'll rarely get 40 hours a week, so you'll really get close to $9 hr. Low morale caused by abusive salaried management, your schedule changes every week, management won't be sympathetic to your concerns, only certain long term associates & favorites get regular days off, day shift associates that don't have open availability 7 days a week from 6am-1am will get their hours cut and even entire days cut. Cashiers frequently have to go outside to push carts when there aren't enough cart pushers on shift, tough when its very hot outside. This store isn't a super center, aisles/backrooms are cluttered with merchandise causing customers & associates to always bump in to each other, puts everyone in a bad mood. If you work on the sales floor, there's lots of manual labor & usually no team work in most depts. Management will frequently want you to stop a task in the middle- to do something else, then threaten to discipline you for not finishing the 1st task on time. Many of the  customers are nasty/mean and mess up the store daily, makes zoning in most depts, especially Apparel, impossible. Store is in a bad area, parking lot has common car theft, assaults. Some of the hourly associates are friendly, but it doesn't make up for all the negatives. Management tries to get us to work harder by talking"
bad,Walmart has taken away all incentive to work for them. your sick days and personal days can not be used unless you have used up all your vacation days and then it can only be used for immediate family. the production rates have sky rocketed so high there unattainable. if there is a accident and you get hurt you get wrote up cause it is your fault no matter what.
bad,"Fast paced, poor management, the hardest part of the job was dealing with disgruntled customers. The most enjoyable part of the job were all the coworkers who made the shift go smoother."
bad,"Those who work hard are never acknowledged, those who are on a higher pay rate literally do way less work than the people who get paid way less. It’s unfair and cruel. The work conditions are insane and inhuman , I wouldn’t recommend anyone work for Walmart."
bad,If you have responsibilities that the only reason you’ll continue to go there. Walmart doesn’t care about their employees. They are not family oriented. The took all our benefits!
bad,"Started in fulfillment promoted to produce manager received 1 day (About a hours worth) of actual training then there computer modules, i'd complete tasks then have to remove what i just did because uppermanagement changed there minds. The pay was absolutely terrible, lazy management that only husles when corporate comes in. This place is a joke and unless you desperately need a job i'd personaly recommend you go else whare unless you have little asperation or are a complacent yes drone with no spine. The turn around is high for a reason."
bad,It's a horrible place to work. Also it depends what position you work at. Also I got paid as much as the new people got paid.  I was there for 3-4 years. They expect you to work like a robot. They brain wash you to hate unions. The management have no backbone when it comes to right and wrong and they don't care about the workers. They just care about getting the work done and looking good to the upper management all the while taking the credit for the workers that did all the work. They used to have it you can top off getting paid $20 hr. It took like fifteen years to get paid that high. Now it will never happen they keep coming out with ways to not pay the employees that much. I have more to say. But I'm tired of thinking about that place. I was lucky to have a good work ethic that's the reason I able to stay so long. One last thing they would make you work black Friday and that day is on thanksgiving day. I didn't get to go to family and friends for thanksgiving for few years. If you called in you would get fired unless they like you. They had favorites. Also if you could do what I did there I think I can work just about anywhere. I have to much to say. When I first started a co-worker told me a supervisor told him I  wasn't going to be working there long. When I started and transferred to a different department and not counting the group that was there when I left 86 people had either quit or got fired or work other department. Also same supervisor would follow you to the bathroom. Also didn't want you to have a team lift because it would take someone off the line also supervisor
bad,"You get a paycheck. If you are lucky enough to be taken on as a full time status, not just work full time hours, you have some perks like 401 and stock and benefits. Walmart doesn't like to hire full time employees they will keep you in the part time or worse temp category as long as possible. Promises from upper management mean nothing people. Telling you right now. Management is not your friend. It is a corporate machine and will do anything and say anything to get what they want and will ultimately throw you under the bus and use you as a scape goat if necessary. Look out for your self. Study up on the policies. You are your only advocate within this pyramid of corporate bullies. Everything looks nice at first but when you scratch the surface and really pay attention you can see the rotting corpse of what used to be a family oriented business."
bad,Working Walmart was very stressful. It wasn't the customers or the associates but more so the Management and their unrealistic views on how the store/frontend should be ran. Their expectations were outrageous and unrealistic.
bad,"I could'nt list all of the bad things about working for this company. Getting your breaks is hit and miss, seniority counts for nothing. I was with them 15 years. Hours are all over the place, you may work until 1am then have to be back in for your next shift in the morning. Don't count on getting to do anything with family or friends on any weekends, ever. The list is long, I could go on and on."
bad,I have worked there for three months I had a kid on the way wanted to change to days but wasn’t able to change. I feel as if they favorite people and if you want to change but they are low on people for a shift they will coach you to stay there.
bad,not a good place for a growing person.a typical day is mangers not knowing what's going on. then customers complaining about Walmart policy. I would tell a child this is a good first job but as an adult no.
bad,Like I said if your desperate then go for it but if your not then don’t. It was the single worst job I’ve ever had. The turnover rate was so bad. They would hire you with the promise of full time hours but they would never give you it. After three months had passed I got two weeks of 40 hours each. That was it and I was promised 40 hours the whole time. If you got any overtime of your record you got in big trouble and they would threaten to lower your hours. I was treated very poorly and many other people were too. If you really need money then try it. They will be nice to you for about a week or two and then turn to there true form immediately. Don’t bother if you just want a job for money. There are better ones out there.
bad,"Come in  the first instinct is updating the hot case"
bad,"Walmart does not care about you, just the dollar. They will cut an exemplary employee just to keep hours down to please the shareholders. Walmart hides behind being a family business, that cares about families, while they fire pregnant women for missing ""too much"" work b.c. they are having complications and different things(look up there attendance policy)."
bad,A typical day at work included zoning the register aisle and cashing customers out. Some management was better than others. the most enjoyable part about working at Wal-Mart was meeting new people (customers and co-workers).
bad,"Management is alright but isn't great. This new point system is dumb because no associate had any say so in this ""new"" system. There just trying to get rid of people. Some management think just because they are a assistant manager or co-manager then they can talk to anybody how they want to."
bad,"Walmart is definitely not a reliable or decent paying job for a hard working adult. I was hired on as a part time cashier. My hours were all over the place. I'd work 4 hours one day, 8 hours the next day and it would remain inconsistent. I was repeatedly told I was a valuable asset to the company, so I felt I could ask for full time. I was told they would give me full time if I worked on Sundays. I agreed to their proposal. I had to maintain 34 hours a week for 12 weeks to be locked in as a full time employee. Every week when the schedule came out they still had me at part time hours. I continuesly had to go to management to get them to change my hours. I had to watch them like a hawk to make sure they changed my hours. I was not a priority to them. I felt like they used me and lied to me, promising me full time in exchange for my Sundays. They never made good on their promise and I don't think they ever had any intention of giving me full time."
bad,"Improving the Management will hep associate work their task better."
bad,I have never see a company that cares less about It’s employees you will never go anywhere unless you’re someone’s favorite. They work you like a dog and don’t pay you anywhere close to what you deserve I wouldn’t work for them again if it was the last job ever
bad,"It's a job if you need a paycheck but the hours are unreliable and so is management. You will hear different things from different managers that contradict each other so you never know who or what to believe.  Favoritism is definitely given and if your not a ""favorite"" you will be punished in a way by having your hours reduced."
bad,Es un ambiente bueno..  Las personas muy amables. Te ayudan en todo cuando lo necesitás..
bad,"This job is for people entering the workforce. This is not a career."
bad,"Managers were not promoted based off of merit and if they were then they lost all of that.  They promised me 40 hours/week however as soon as i started they were cut by approximately 8 hours.  In order to get my 40 hrs back i had to switch to overnights.  They want you to ask questions, however when you do, they look at you like you just asked how to breathe."
bad,"During the interview process they will promise you a minimum of 35 hours a week, which becomes 15-20 hours a week anytime it is not the Christmas season. Forget about health insurance, you are on your own there. Each manager has their own set of rules and policies. There is NO communication between members of management, one manager will expect one thing while the next will expect the opposite. The company talks about safety and teamwork but it is only small talk, one will regularly be asked to perform tasks that are not safe. Watch out for your fingers and hands! Make sure you brown nose to the managers because favoritism and politics takes place here. Do not prioritize serving customers over completing management assigned tasks, the managers will hate you for it. Some managers are on a power rush and will not hesitate to retaliate against you and sabotage your employment by slandering your name to other managers. Think self preservation at all times."
bad,I didn't really like working at Walmart. There was a lot of drama and stress and bad vibes. I didn't really like the hours or the ones I was working with. I honestly felt like I was surrounded but a bunch of little kids that didn't really help me on my first day. and my managers where never there really.
bad,"Management treated lower level employees like trash because they could, if you complain you get fired simple as that.i wouldn't recommend working for walmart to anyone."
bad,Where do I even start? Oh I know completely unqualified managers (most of them anyway) who care more about how the public and corporate sees each store. They will change your schedule day before you are supposed to work that schedule with zero notice! Only good thing about Walmart is the cool technology and innovative ways you interact woth the company!
bad,"My manager picked favorites and she ran me out of my job. Treated me and a few others like trash, hours are cut horribly,  terrible place to work. I was getting one day a week if I was lucky"
bad,If your not friends with management you wont get anywhere honestly. Management is terrible and they only worry about their bonuses. They cut hours often and wont even tell you a valid reason why. There is no overtime available but when it is it's basically like they are forcing you to stay over. They changed the point system so its really stupid how fast you get fired for being sick basically. The new point system is costing them more than before.I still only work here until i can find something else stable and that pays more.
bad,Walmart is a pun place to work with friends but recently wa lmart had gotten very stressful and they are hiring anybody for management with screening them to see if they have customer skills to relate with customers they are not keeping the ethics rules in the wa lmart industry
bad,Poor managment. They dont care about your home life or anything about you. They dont care how hard you work or respect your opinion. All they want is a robot that will do what they say when they say it and don't care if you work yourself into the ground. No respect for the work place they will talk down to you and degrade you infront of customers and everyone. Sad to say im still there but looking for different opportunities elsewhere
bad,This place was the worse to work at I never knew stocking could be difficult because i was in cap 2 for 7 months and the management sucks there stupid
bad,"IF you are looking for 6 month job, its great, but you're expected to give everything for a job that gives you nothing and 9/10 your management is just as abusive as the customers"
bad,I was a third shift stocker. Everyday my managers would tell me I need to hurry up or I could be terminated.. nothing like hearing that everyday to make your stress level go through the roof... Not to mention that the managers you feel like standing behind you with a stopwatch... The managers told me... They are high-strung people with lots of energy... So I will never be able to live up to their expectations... And they told me that they only want people with high energy levels.... Also none of the managers care anything about you.. if you're late or don't show up they will not call you to see why you didn't show up they don't care... I'm 47 years old and working at Walmart was the worst job decision I ever made... I will never go back to Walmart
bad,If your a salary manager you will consistently worked 55-60 hours a week and they will pay you just above what the start pay should be so they don’t have to pay you for any overtime worked. They will tell hourly workers they can not get overtime and then turn around and Mandatory overtime for there salary managers.
bad,"The company is one of the most unorganized company's I have ever worked for.There policies are always changing ,they don't value there good  workers,there turn over for staffing is very high.The morale is very low because of poor management skills, demanding and changing schedules.There is no set structure. I work at one of the Fulfillment Centers and there is no stability because you always feel like your job is in jeopardy.Overall I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone looking to make a career in the logistics field.The job could be very easy but the work environment is stressful.If your just out of high school or looking for a starter job then it may be for you."
bad,"There was way to many things wrong with Walmart for me to cover it in 150 characters but the biggest things are Walmart has 150 billion rules and getting 1 wrong will lead to a couching. For example I got relieved for scanning the things on the belt with the scanner. An assistant manager was walking by and told me that I could not due that, gave me a 5 minute talk about why I can't do that, and told me I needed to abort it and start over. Stood their and watched me until the next transaction was done. The customer even said that he was impressed in me and even noted that the 2 values where the same. But that's nothing compared to the time where a 9ish year old girl fell, hit her head went unconscious (and me being previously in scouts know what I'm doing) I immediately shut down my light, threw the sign on the belt, and told the customers to wait there, I circled around to help the girl. I checked her pulse, got someone to call a manager over (so they could call the police) I went to put her jacket under her head (so she wouldn't be resting her head on the hard ground) and got her legs elevated. Right then a manager passed me and signaled for me to stop helping this unconscious girl and I would have just ignored her and kept helping the girl but a customer walked by and claimed to be a nurse. She verified that everything I did was correct and took the next correct steps so I just believed her and a minute or so later the actual ambulance showed up. But ya WALMART WOULDN'T LET ME HELP AN UNCONCIOUS GIRL. They just expect me to stay there and not do anything"
bad,"Absolutely horrible place to work. The past two managers were AMAZING and very understanding, helped out on the floor whenever needed and knew how to do their job. This new manager is rude disrespectful, and uses things like your mental health struggles against you in your job. They dont care to follow your availability and if you say something they dont like or question something they are doing wrong they cut your hours. They are cutting everyone's hours yet hiring new people. You dont feel like you have that open door policy like they say you have when they use things you talk to them about against you and cut your hours and treat you like your garbage. So yah not the best place to work! This one specifically on Woodlawn. "
bad,The worst company I worked at the pay is bad. Everyone hours are consistenly being cut except for Christmas. I would not recommend working here for anyone.
bad,"Solo les importa tu fuerza laboral. Tu bienestar general les vale. Un sueldo bajísimo para todo lo que se tiene que realizar. No solo formas parte de un puesto, si la empresa decide que ayudes en otro lado DEBES hacerlo o te ""asesoran"". Ambiente laboral terrible en los puestos bajos ya que supervisores, encargados y gerentes te ignoran y solo entre ellos se realizan favores."
bad,"They overwork you and understaff your shift, then get mad that you didn’t finish the work of 3 people while also allowing others to do nothing all day"
bad,"My review on working for Walmart would be that it definitely taught me to become even more resourceful due to the lack of accommodations for various employees and their personal situations. I understand that there is an establishment of business to be managed and maintained; at the same token, the employees are being force fed hyperboles of job security, a family oriented work environment and, compensation for the unexpectancies of life, especially for those with children such as myself, amongst other discrepancies. I’m gracious for the experience and knowledge I’ve gained while being employed by this company. I’m currently in a pivotal position in life where I need to take a drastic step to ensure the financial security of my family and I. I believe that I will better myself and to do so I must exit my “comfort zone” to expand my horizons and attempt more challenging tasks as opposed to food industry, stocking, or customer service type occupations."
bad,"Just a job, lasted until something better came along. You get a write up for any minutes over 40hours always understaffed, so it's do it as fast as you can. If you're there more than 8 hours, you have to take a longer lunch break the next day to avoid overtime"
bad,It’s was one of my first jobs I had and it definitely opened up my eyes. Depending on the department you can either have a good department manager or not. Most of the time I never really had any guidance in doing things at Walmart. They pretty much just throw you out there and say go work. At the time I was working management was always picking favorites and picking on other which made the work environment very uncomfortable. Lots of gossip going around and just made things so unprofessional.
bad,"A typical is stressful as there is always negativity and effort to displace the employee.  "
bad,Walmart does not care about the workers or the customers. They hire people based on who they like and the put things in place to fire people easily. They are putting self checkouts I’m not to make it easier to check out but go save money and have less workers they are talking about robots that will stock the shelves too meaning even more people out of a job they just incorporated a new attendance policy that will make it easier for people with child and people in general to lose there job everything Walmart does is for itself and they pretend it’s for the customers and the workers. They also make everyone part time so almost everyone are without benefits
bad,Getting to sophisticated with technology.  Older associates and customers not happy with the newer technology of ringing up yourself cutting your own fabric not enough help on sales floor in departments when one person is covering 4-5 departments
bad,"Managers were rude, often picked favourited and made the new people do their dirty work. Gave me full time hours when i applied for part time. Didn't let me book time off, all the staff kept forgetting i worked there. No training aside from videos and they force you into working on the belt when you're not ready. Not very lenient"
bad,It was very stressful. I was pulled to every department whenever they needed someone there. The schedule was everywhere could be working til 11pm one night and the next morning had to be in at 7 am
bad,The job i had was fast paced they wanted you to unload trucks where everything was just thrown into a truck and not stacked right at all. It looked like someone had tossed the truck around thing had always fallen on the door.
bad,I really don't know how it is now but at the time i was employed there it was a mess poor management and lead person also store manager was just as worst I hated pulling up to that job because I knew it was going to be something new with the department manger.
bad,"From my experience,  management was terrible. They claim that you could come talk to them about problems but when you do they either make jokes abut the situation and or push it to the side with little to no change. They also showed favoritism to certain shifts/ positions leaving they least favorite shift/ position to do all the work. They barely give you hours as well and when you ask for more they either don't give it to you or they want you to call everyday to see if you can come in."
bad,"Walmart did not take well to my sister"
bad,Walmart lacks a lot of things. management knows not what they are doing causing lots of problems when trying to actually get the job done the right way.
bad,"I would never work at walmart. The managers dont have a clue what they are doing, hours were not good either. one week i would work 30 hours and the next i would work 23... no one ever did their jobs. i would always come to work and have to fix what the previous shift either didn't complete or did wrong. it was a very difficult employer to work for. and they have no family value ever. they say that they care about family but they really dont."
bad,"Breaks were cut short often,  racist behaviour from managers, bullying and belittling, unsafe, unsanitary, theft between coworkers was normal, injuries at work overlooked or dismissed."
bad,The management is not what it should be. They say they are here for their associates and listen to their ideas but they do not do that. You have to deal with rude customers day in and day and your management team does not have their associates back. I learned while working their that everybody is for themselves.
bad,"The day before I got fired. My task was to deep scrub 5 isles in the pet department and have it open up by 5am. I started at 10 pm. They wanted me to deep scrub 3 tiles into the new wax that was recently done. I told them it would look the same. Management tried with a doodlebug and water. Then he told me to strip all 5 isles. Problem is, that area had been deep scrubbed one too many times. I had to strip all 4 ends 3 times. All 4 isles, twice. I put down 5 coats of wax and had the floor open before 7am. The next day, I was fired for not doing 5 isles and for not having it the floor opened up by 5am. It was my third write up. My second write up was also about not having my area open at the time they wanted it opened. I have 12 years experience in Stripping and waxing floors. Walmart was over expecting a task to be done with too much work to do with little time to get it done."
bad,"Honestly everyone causes drama, employees complain about management and management is hardly ever around to see employees just standing around fanning on the clock. Management and employees make this job stressful"
bad,"typical day at Walmart is going in to work don't know if u are getting sent back to help unload trucks or being called up front to run a resigter or getting called over to grocery help straighten or put mederdise up on stuff.i learned not to expect to much at wal-mart.management was good.work place culture was a surprise,its hard to go in to work not knowing what u would get hit with,hardest part of job was knowing where u was pose to be but at times u wouldn't even be in that department.i  liked working there but u never knew what ur hrs was going to be."
bad,Love working for the people . The work hours where okay. Clean work places. The hardest thing was work with management.  To much hear say.............. No Team work
bad,I was a salaried manager and you are required to stay there until you have everything completed. You are required to work days off if you have not completed all of your weekly tasks
bad,By the time I retired I could barely stand to interact with any of the management at that store. They were liars mostly only interested in promoting and advancing themselves. Several were even fired as thieves.
bad,This particular store is focused on promoting from within and does not care about its employees. Managers are never on the floor and often do not provide help if asked for assistance. There are new employees at least every third week and others are quitting at an alarming rate.
bad,I did not work for Walmart. what part of that are you not understanding. I worked for a third party company as representative. not as aWalmart employee.
bad,This is a self serving company. They are most worried about the bonuses of the CEO's and board members than truly paying its workers. They only pretend to care for their customers.
bad,"I gave a year of my life to Walmart, and it didn't mean a thing, I worked harder than others but because I didn't kiss my managers butt I got no love. All the managers didn't really know how to make schedules or manage the store they were all young and not experienced and played favorites and singled people out. They constantly broke rules and wrongfully coached people including me. No promotions, benefits, or anything, and after a year a week before Christmas I was terminated for not working a day I was not even scheduled and when my manager saw that I wasn't scheduled she said to go home because she would find something to fire me for, and she ended up taking absences that I had gotten approved from 6 months earlier and unapproving them so that she would have a reason to fire me. So merry Christmas from walmart!"
bad,Management issues galore.  Policies often not followed and fraternization often ignored.  Unless you are part of the group you will be criticized and scorned.
bad,No appreciation for work done. Jobs are always changing - as in more work and responsibilities added with no pay added. Promotions are based on favoritism and not actual ability or qualifications to do a job.
bad,"While working at Wal-Mart I was constantly thrown under the bus for things I did not do, or were not my fault. I had one manager that disliked me and yelled me so constant that she would cause me to have panic attacks, then proceed to yell at me when I would come back to work after having the attack."
bad,"No time for yourself, scheduling is bad, expectations are way too high, minimal managerial help, low staffing, no resolution for employees, poor benefits and pay, and you can get written up for nearly anything. The CEO really needs to revamp his company around his employees."
bad,Very stressful working atmosphere. Skeleton crew staff with exceedingly heavy work load. Would often have to do the work of 2 or more people covering more than one job. Management interaction was very minimal unless something went wrong. Very little training for positions. Often no equipment or supplies to work with. Very little communication between management and staff. Long-term associates treated very poorly. Rules and policies changed to fit the situation. Very hard to get time off/vacations approved. I personally found no part of working at Walmart enjoyable but it paid the bills.
bad,"Higher up management does not care about employees like they say they do. If you are hurt on the job, management plays it off that it is your fault every time. SO do NOT fill out an incident report when it comes to injuries."
bad,"Do not work for Walmart. The management is poor and doesn't keep their word about advancement, the hours are poor, and if you happen to work over then you are always asked to take the time off."
bad,You can report anything because they either fire you or push you to quit. They do not care about anything. The store manager is cutthroat and does not follow policy.
bad,The managers don’t care how they treat people or the stress they take people through; mostly over things we can’t control at Distribution Center. If something falls out the sky and hit you on the head it’s a step 3 and it’s ALWAYS your fault. Walmart as a company are bullies. They bully associates; everyday your fighting for your job. The stress of losing your job no matter how much the effort you put in is ALWAYS there. Walmart expects  a machine out of you. The insurance isn’t worth it. Your still paying big bucks out of your check.
bad,"Management is the reason the store I worked at is not a good place. Never follow procedures, over task and work you. No care for emergencies or illnesses.  When I started it was fun and enjoyable. I learned just about everything, but towards my last 2 years it was horrible management and very rude and disrespectful store manager."
bad,"Honestly the management there could use some work. No type of customer service , dont know how to deal with employees privately which means everyone knows your business.  They tell you that you can get hours and work on off days, then they make you cut those hours by the end of the week.. it's just poorly ran and managed."
bad,to much work for Little Pay I can go inside the store and purchase a bag of apple and go sell them and make 2x hourly pay. life is expensive. pay people for their labor.
bad,"Often forgotten for breaks, does not close down cashier at the end of an shift.  Do not allow over-time. Up to the cashier to close down lines at the end of shift.  Supervisors are slow to respond due to very busy store."
bad,Was only employed for a period of nine months. I was hired as a seasonal temp but when offered a permanent position and even signed the documents was told a week later my season ended. Was not given a proper formal acknowledgment and when informed that I had signed all the paper work for me to be a permanent employee I was told that the documents were never properly filed.  Wasn't really disappointed since my time spent there was less than inspiring. I'd say only a handful of the management positions were actually helpful and good leaders. The rest were just there to punch in and punch out and really cared less about offering the proper help and direction a manager should.
bad,"Didn't care much for it,  they were terribly managed and definitely expected way too much out of their employees in the time we were given, it's awful."
bad,Management had a very bad problem with communication between each other and supervisors. They did what worked best for them without thinking how it would affect us as employees. They have little to no understanding how to do the job they are in charge of. Management picking favorites was also a big issue. Some people could get away with things others couldnt.. i would never reccomend anyone to apply there.
bad,"Do not offer 80 hour/base salary anymore for any new hire"
bad,"During my time at Walmart the very best worker on the shift was fired. Several of my coworkers threw boxes and 1 male coworker had a mental breakdown and yelled and cried on the floor. "
bad,"My experience was not very positive. There are very few managers in the store that actually treat people with respect, and dealing with certain members of management was the worst part of the job."
bad,"My hours have been cut warning and it sucks. A lot. Don't work here unless you would like to deal with rude customers, managers and even rude coworkers."
bad,"Had a medical emergency while on the clock. Ambulance should have been called due to loss of consciousness, but instead when I came to i was asked if i wanted to go home but was informed it would be counted as a point against me even though I was an hour away from clocking out."
bad,"The work at Walmart is not actually that bad, it's just kind of bland."
bad,"Cutthroat management style. Opportunities to advance were based on whether or not individual manager liked you."
bad,"The store is a major mess up after new store manager took over. He decided to become cheap. Was promised a higher level of pay but turns out only a dirty minimum wage job. For the amount of hard work that the staff do, that's not enough. Go figure why the store is in a bad situation currently. No one cares about the job since they're under paid and they like to hire students who barely know how to speak ENGLISH. Also their discount is a joke 10% on a billion dollar company... Really? Hours are horrible and don't count in ever being full time here even if they promise you since there are people years working there and nothing except empty promises."
bad,Change job titles and performance and pay even when you can not do the job you did not sign up for.  Managers sucked.  Will never work there again.  Yes.
bad,"typical day: chaotic"
bad,"I hated the Job and the workers."
bad,"I couldn't stand it there, they blamed me for everything even if it wasn't my fault and they are blaming me for getting injured there even though I slipped and there was no wet floor sign anywhere."
bad,Maybe good for college students. A lot of favoritism with upper management. They hire new people and cut regular employees hours. They could care less about you.
bad,I really did not like it off the strength that there's no structure no respect. Lack on this cummunication and no respect and no understanding A lot of arguments and fights
bad,"learned how to stock dairy & meat products, how to use deli slicer, make sandwiches, hot case foods, etc,"
bad,"There is a lot to do there. The pay honestly didn't match the work load. We are constantly stretched from dept to dept. I also feel like they blame associates when customers coming in rage off the street and we cant snap back when there threating us or calling us out of our name. Associates should be getting the higher pay because store managers and so- managers don't do anything or at least some of them. We handle customers and make, shelve products for sell. We are the one who cashes out customers and give them the experience. You barley see management. Only to write you up and make you do more then you already handle. The most enjoyable part is the charity to raise money. Everyone comes together. Oh yeah the holidays because it just seems so much genuine everyone kind. I don't like how if you get injured there quick to dismiss you. Point blank."
bad,Management is atrocious. I had worked there for 3 years and called in 3 days in a row sick and I was written up. I requested one day off (not a holiday or weekend) 5 months in advance and I was not given it off and I was told I would be terminated if I did not show up. The pay was subpar and the benefits aren’t great. I felt as if I could only ever get good benefits through Walmart services such as the optical or pharmacy. I left and never looked back
bad,"To start, the training you receive generally conflicts with the actual job and tasks that the management wants you to perform. As with most jobs the more you perform the more they expect from you, but rarely will you receive any extra compensation or benefit for going above and beyond. Employees can consistently arrive late or call out with little repercussion and the task load just gets dumped on whoever comes in. Rather than reprimand the problem employees management will berate an entire team because a task meant for 10 people wasn't completed when only 4 people showed up to work. When an employee actually manages to get fired it's usually from having called out too many times and you can expect it will be a few months before they finally hire someone to fill in the gap. As you can imagine this makes for an incredibly stressful work environment being consistently understaffed. The ""good"" employees combat this by constantly requesting (and receiving) time off leaving for a week at a time. The only time you receive pay raises is when you take a higher position within the company or a few meager cents when the annual cost of living raise comes around. I would never suggest working for Walmart unless you were in dire straits or just don't care about working conditions, which if that's the case you'll never have to worry about losing your job. So I guess you could say that there is an opportunity for job security for the desperate."
bad,"At first you will be treated good and to be friendly with customers(just a front).. weeks later some people in management will just blow you off sometimes and stop being friendly. Don't get me wrong, there some good good ones in there, but the buddy system is definitely at play here so you have to be careful on what you say and to whom because retaliation is possible in one form or another.They are understaffed in this dept, taking advantage of the ones there, making them do double even triple work, so it's basically stressful work, nonstop, always on your back just so the dept can meet their quota.Sometimes you just get 30 minutes breaks instead of the hour Schedule is inconsistent and ever-changing, so you basically have to revolve your life around it. full timers get part time hours at times. they only want people with open availability and it's hard to get a second job with this one. Not worth the pay."
bad,"Favoritism rampant, equality of benefits sucks, many of the benefits most other companies give to employers right away isn't how Walmart does it.  you have to earn them by working for a year or more."
bad,Did not like the management. They all have attitudes and they want you to respect them and they do not have respect you. They make money and the associates don't.
bad,"Working in the Garden Center as a stocker, salesfloor associate loaded soil, potting soil, mulch & stepping bricks also sometimes cashier. Always liked to help out my customers. Made them feel like their needs are always top priority. Always made them smile & made sure they were satisfied before they left my area."
bad,"Working at Walmart is not for everyone it is extremely fast paced, stressful and requires a lot of patience. Most of your time is devoted to helping customers which can be a good learning experience, provided that if you need help you can get it quickly. This job does offer a whole plethora of jobs to chose from which is really excellent but comes with on huge downside, if you wish to advance your position in whatever store section you choose you will find that management is not very willing or accepting to let you try and achieve that goal. When I heard of a new shift manager or similar position I was told by my managers that it was not possible to achieve, not because of lack of experience or that someone was a better fit but simply because they did not want me to hold that position."
bad,"1) Some managers/supervisors/leads are ok while others not, examples are: bossy, rude and will lecture worker in front of customers"
bad,"I did not enjoy my experience at walmart ,they had bad management. It wasn't that hard of a job but it didn't suite me. They were very short staffed and we were over worked"
bad,The company was not at all friendly to work at.the associates are out for them selves.management needs more training and to also learn how to treat and talk to there employees
bad,"mgmt doesn't have ppl skills"
bad,The interview process is great. They could work on working with you after you're hired so that there is less confusion. There compensation process needs a major update to our current economic climate. They could do ten times better with their work life balance. The management needs to get on the same page and be more communicative. The culture of the workplace suffers because of the lack of leadership and neglect at the management level.
bad,The minimum wage pay rate has left multiple employees that I am aware of homeless. They punish employees with fewer hours if they are not available 24/7 (even if that does not allow you to sleep).  They under staff to the point that the job (keeping customers happy) is impossible to do well.  The small 10% employee discount does not normally include food.  Training is minimal and the videos doing it are often out dated.
bad,"From the customers who insult you to your face to the managers who have no sympathy for their own employees, there is no respect or even politeness to  be expected from anyone if you are a Walmart employee. Part-time employees do not qualify for insurance benefits, and pay raises are annual and performance based - and range from $0.10/hr to $0.90/hr. You can set your availability for what hours and days you can work, but the less available you are, the less you get scheduled. No opportunities at all, ever, to be made a full-time employee."
bad,"Work anywhere but here, management/employees/csm are rude extremely rude. They don't want to take time to train anyone, and they treat you like garbage. They don't even give you any dignity as a person, they yell at you while they're training you infront of customers. The csms don't do their jobs, and just sit and talk to each other all day. If you complain to the manager about being treated poorly nothing will come of it, they pick and choose their favourites no matter their personality."
bad,"Stress every day, overworked and underpaid. Learned a lot about retail. Management wasn't very good and didn't help solve issues. Negative workplace culture. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the store operations when they were understaffed. Meeting new customers and working with some good people was the best part of the job."
bad,"im a cartpushier and im basically the servent of the store(lowest of the low). we are called to do the carryouts, claims, batteries, you name it. i am way too busy working outside because now they schedule 2 to 3 people per day and yeah, our store is a supercenter. we cannot keep the parking lot clean with that less people. i am often left alone to work on sundays night. like r u kidding me? i am also a college student that cannot work 5 days per week but somehow they started to schedule me 5 days per week (i am part time and supposed to work 4 days per week. thats what they told me when i got hired). the scheduling is getting worse now. the customers are just throwing carts everywhere in front of my eyes so they can make me mad, and i am the one who has to gather all those carts. management thinks they are the god of us so they rule over us. they say we should work within the compliance (20carts at once) but if we work that slow, they complain about why we are working so slow. i honestly hate it"
bad,"3 12hr shifts. Vary hard work. breaks are only 20 minutes long and a 30 minute lunch but that's only on the weekend shift the week shift only get 2 15 minute break and no lunch, production is 100% not many can make that, I do enjoy the people I work with, you dont get holidays off anymore, you do get Christmas day off. You dont get holiday pay unless you save up your pto time but you also have to use your pto for sick days or anything else, a doctor's note will not excuse you, you have to file for fmla and that is vary tedious, I've had 3 different managers in 3 years and 3 0r 4 ops managers, I had vary little training for the current position I hold but I did have vary good training for the power equipment. Management can be good or bad depending on who you have they are moved around alot. I have to be at work at 3:30 am till 4pm. Alot has changed since I started there and even more has changed since my parents started there, they have been with the company for over 20years."
bad,"Everything is beeping lame from the customers to the management, best job for first timers who really don't know how the workplace actually works or also good for extra money only if your really beeping desperate"
bad,A typical day at Walmart is like a lazy but one person have to do everything day although I’ve learned how to speak to people and interact with others In a perfection always manner.But I am looking for somthing that pays well in a good environment that is happy and hard working.
bad,"I would only suggest Wal-Mart to those who NEED a job now. It's not somewhere I would suggest otherwise. There is no form of communication between emplpyees, management down to associates. They expect you to put them first ALWAYS."
bad,The company causes it's own problems. Store salary management is push to be available 24/7 even on vacation and off time. The company also pushes for less hours for hourly associates. Then push unrealistic stress and work on skilled and driven hourly workers to fix stores and bring them to standard in a matter of days after weeks or months of neglect from understaffing.
bad,"Most of the employees complain about how bad they're spoken to and treated. Management is horrible to the staff."
bad,"The E-commerce facility in Union City is very unorganized , the morale of the building is very stressful , the managers threaten job everyweek with production with no room to stock anything with new merchandise  . Managers  are lazy and not one on one with the teammates , you feel like a number instead of a person . High turnover rate in the last six months , High theft rate team leads were stealing and security stealing pallets of items for years . The company hires people sight unseen with no experience “wonder why the warehouse looks like it does” . The company should have the ceo come through there and see what kind of place it has become . This is definitely the worst place to work im glad that everyone is leaving going to Dhl ."
bad,Managers are awful if u call in they hit u with an occurrence u could be dying at work and if u go home tjey hit u again management in the socorro Walmart is horrible so trust me don't get a job there
bad,"They recently changed our shifts and forced us to work on whatever shift they had available. The are extremely biased towards their ""Senior associates"" even though many of them work slower or do worse work than the newer ones. Some of the employees are ok but most are disgruntled because of the recent company changes."
bad,Is just a competition between associated and manegers. If associated do the job correctly they think they going to stay with they job and they start couching you for no reason. When they don't have the reason to do it.
bad,"The company only cared about seniority and if the ""seniors"" are at fault, they never got disciplined. They got to do whatever they wanted while all the new hires and less 5+ years did all the work."
bad,"Safety only matters when BIG Brass is in store. The rest of the time you ""make"" tools to complete job with a ten foot 2/4. Only SR. management is allowed to tell somebody they are not safe, regardless of what you see/do. And they don't."
bad,If you're looking for a job don't even think of applying here it is getting worse and worse every year management is beyond corrupt they have no idea what they're doing and all they care about is watching over your shoulder and catching you doing something CEO gets 220 million dollar bonus so go figure that's where the money goes the employees are not even a consideration. They look at you like scum you're treated like scum
bad,"Walmart is like a revolving door. Things happen fast around there. You literally can be there one day and gone the next. Always have something to fall back one. You are on 6 months probation, and in those 6 months you are only alloted 4 points, so dont get 4 or your done. Management completely sucks, never there when you need them, and unreliable when you need a day or 2 off."
bad,"I was offered $9.50 per hour when I got my first paycheck it was only $7.25 per hour. They refused to honor the original offer and I was better off working at McDonalds pay wise. Management does not communicate with each other. One manager tells you one thing and another manager contradicts what you were told by the other. Sent me to work in wrong department for a week before my actual area manager showed up looking for me to come work in the right section. You cannot even ask a question about something from a coworker because they come running to yell at you both for talking to each other which is ridiculous because how are you to learn anything about how to do your job correctly as a new hire. All while throwing this lie of a company motto at you that we are all a ""team."" They rely on their computer system to teach you anything. Basically if you like being thrown out into the store to figure it out and be totally on your own then you will love this job! It is total ""thunder dome"" with literally every man for himself or herself! It is a lonely, messed up, backwards place to work. Thank you."
bad,"made to choose between children and job"
bad,"The title roughly speaks for itself. Although the nature of this job is not synonymous to all positions and the millions of jobs this company provides, my personal experience has been unsatisfactory across the board. Zero care for shrink, cleanliness, or safety as managers only cared about quarterly reports."
bad,Don’t work here!!!!! U will regret it!   They are meanest to there best employees. Underpay good employees and push u out the door while expecting u to not complain
bad,If you have an issue there you better keep it to yourself because once you tell management about it they blame it on you. Instead of moving you to avoid problems they rather keep you there to deal with it even when they see its getting out of hand.
bad,It's about what you would expect from the largest retailer... You will be underpaid and the benefits will suck. You're a number and your corporate boss doesn't care about you unless you interfere with their bottom line. You'll work all holidays including like 3 o'clock start times for thanksgiving day. You should only use this job if you're in college or have no where else to go.
bad,"Walmart is not a good company to work for, as far as pay, or hours, they don't pay holidays or  give suitable yearly raises. You only have part time so that cuts down on benefits"
bad,"With as much money that Wal-Mart rakes in, they could afford to pay their employees a more livable wage. They need to do away with their point system. After so many, your terminated. If stupidity gets you fired, that's one thing. But life happens. If your child gets sick before you go in and you call off, it's points. Mo calls, tardies...points add up. The only thing they couldn't hold against you would be if you died."
bad,"Fast-paced, most managers are BULLIES. They are known for their flighty and mean managers. They don't appreciate much and don't like helping others. Hard place to get full-time from."
bad,"A typical  work  day  in all  were  alright,  you  learned  different  things  depends  on  what  area. As for  management,  I  guess  everyone  has  their  bad and  good  days  but,  bad days  shouldn't  be  in  the  workplace. Nothing  hard  about  it. As long  as  you  don't  have  anyone over  your  back."
bad,"One Best Way is a weapon to make you go against your ethics. They play favorites, if you are different not a good fit for you. They have a attendance policy that has much to be desired. If you want to work there never get sick and never get injured. You have to get an outside company approval if you are sick more than three days. They are looking for submissive people. They don't care if you have a family."
bad,"Management was switched around frequently and communication was poor. The managers player favorites and let other workers get away with things that should have incured multiple coachings."
bad,Terrible managers no hours and everyone is part time they dont have to go to 40 hours. Pay isnt worth the stress that the job brings from bad management
bad,"Bad management, treats employees like they’re nothing, and there were a lot of bad smells. They had a designated break area but that was the only perk. No benefits and never gave me extra hours."
bad,"Worked in ACC for 2 years at $10/hr. I busted butt, but was treated like a slacker. I did the duties of a service writer, sales associate and cashier while being a certified technician. I also did department manager work such as binning and capping without recognition. The technicians who did 1/4 of the work I did are paid more."
bad,Worst place to work for. Management WILL throw you under a bus for whatever reason they feel like doing. I really can't think of anything good to say about this store. It was really horrible and crooked.
bad,Managers have no idea what to do or don't care but will come down on you for not doing what you should do. Too much work for one person and couldn't leave until work is done. but get in big trouble if you stayed for overtime.
bad,There point system is terrible. They only allow 3 sick days or then you are fired. You get a half a point for being late or then your fired. they can play favorites by keeping an employee that causes work violence and has been written up several times. But then they can fire whoever they want for being sick or going over on their points. There priorities are screwed up and no wonder they have such a high turn over rate. I will never work for them again. There Personnel hiring team is terrible and there supervisors to train don't even have the time to train their new employees!
bad,"I worked at 4 different stores in CA over an 8 year period and each was the same. You have 5 levels of management, none of whom are on the same page, telling you to do something different. I can't tell you how many times I did a single task 3 times 3 different ways because the higher level wanted it done differently. Zero employee appreciation. They make the employee earn anything that should be given in appreciation. Low wages, and they went to an annual percentage raise, so if you are new and making 9 an hour and doing a fantastic job, you get 5%, yeah $0.45. But if you're a lazy worker who's been there for 10 years and makes 15 an hour, you get 3%, yeah $0.45. That is neither encouraging good work nor fair. Wal-Mart is a greedy, disgusting company and a horrible place to work."
bad,"empresa com funcionários muito antigos sem limites, gerencia e coordenação são sem pulsos e jogam com outras lideranças, ambiente toxico cheio de humilhação, funcionários antigos roubam caixa, medicamentos, tem funcionário com a 4 serie primaria trabalhando em farmácia, não verificam nem os documentos para contratar."
bad,"I am what they call a flex associate at my store. This means i do other peoples job every day. Instead of hiring 10-20 more people they are now starting to stretch everybody as thin as possible instead of getting more help. Like most others have said, terrible managers they don't care they just need it done without any hint of care. The atmosphere is dreadful no windows,lights that dim and get bright at will. A floor made of the flattest and crudest concrete known to man that will make you flat footed in mere months. The pay is ok if you live at home and just need money but if you have a family and you're thinking about it don't bother. Some jobs there are much better than others as i have done almost all of them. Cap 2 which is essentially the store slaves unload trucks then put the stuff on the shelves I would non jokingly let prisoners out on work release to do this job its that bad. I'm not going to explain every job that would take many more pages. The turnover rate is probably a person a day. Try to make walmart a last resort even though they will probably be the first company to give a call back. And if you do end up there figure out who your friends are and who is a walmart fanatic and will follow every rule and report the dumbest things instead of just taking care of them and avoid them. Find the little things that kill time or mwke your job easier and more fun. And good luck whoever is reading this and i hope it turns out good for you."
bad,"Ne respect pas les  heures convenue dans la demande, il n’y a aucune formation pour les nouveaux. Pour ceux qui ont besoin de plus d’explication pour comprendre c’est bien d’avoir une formation par le gérant au moins,mais chez walmart,je n’est pas eu droit à ça. Très mauvaise expérience, quelques employés très désagréable. Vos informations écrites dans la description pour amener le monde à postuler, sur indeed était que des mensonges...."
bad,"the things that you are told when hired are not what happens after you've been there for a few months.  they use up their employees then just let them quit and they seem to make it a priority to just chew you up and spit you out.  ""there is always someone to take your place and they make sure you know it"""
bad,"Walmart driver for 20 years."
bad,It was ok to work at for a little while but then I found out I was pregnant and started passing out. They seem like it was ok for me to be doing that. So I when to the doctor they told me I had to keep coming in for a few weeks so I ran out of points so they fired me.
bad,"Walmart would be a decent second job. As for a first choice it's a poor decision. Limited advancement opportunities for associates that are not friends of management with obvious racial and gender bias, poor benefits with a low rate of allocated hours makes it a poor choice."
bad,"A typical day was answering the phones, hanging back up returns from customers, cleaning up and straightening up mess left from customers. I learned not to ever work for them again. They scream and yell at their employees in front of customers. The most enjoyable part was the co-workers."
bad,They give you difficult tasks then tell you it has to be done in less than an hour. GM receiving was overflowing with merchandise that had nowhere to on the sales floor. The manager expects miracles to happen while they are on their 3-hour lunch breaks.
bad,"I'll keep this short but sweet. Do yourself a favor. Between immoral management, low wages, inconsistent schedules, and other shady dealings that happen in the stock room, DO NOT apply at Wal-Mart. I've sworn off of retail because of it."
bad,"company does not treat their employees good at all. advancement is not based on experience at all, rather it is based on favoritism. It was fun working with the customers and certain co workers. Management is poorly trained on actual operations on the floor. Company has no concern over family obligations and will terminate you if you have a small child that is sick and prevents you for coming to work."
bad,"Management target the associates under them and single them out, make every effort to run them off. Supervisors gossip about associates on their team to other associates and belittle them."
bad,"not enough pay. The management has it's favorites or is worried about getting fired,  so a lot of them cannot connect with their employees so so many are never noticed."
bad,Started out as a very good job. Quickly changed into a horrible job. Was not allowed to get over 40 hours in a week. No benefits. Low pay. Terrible management and almost impossible to move up within the company.
bad,The management was very grumpy/rude. I don't think that it helped to make my co-workers any happier either. Most of them walked around the store looking so disgruntled. No communication whatsoever.  After working a few 35 - 40 hour weeks I let them know I can't work more than 24 hrs and still they kept scheduling me for 35+. No store organization. Things on the shelf just didn't make sense. No wonder people can'take find things.
bad,did not care to work much at walmart. job was stressful. i worked there almost 2 years and never got promoted and couldnt sit or do anything like that.
bad,"Very disappointed in the way the management back stabbed each other to get whatever they want. No matter how hard you would do your job, no one ever thanked me for a kob well done. It was always how come this wasn’t done."
bad,worst place to work for unless you like getting down and kissing power hungry peoples feet that should not have been promoted most do not work with you and they promote people that should never be in charge of others ever since sam walton came out of the picture the company became all about money and no longer about anything else
bad,Working here was just a starting place. It seemed ok at first I worked over night with someone else to help me break down the produce truck. That person left without notice then it was just me breaking down 4 to 5 pallets of produce every night I would get yelled at if the whole truck wasn’t broken down and the truck would come in at like 2 or 3 and my shift ended at 7 I had 4 hours to rotate the produce in the cooler and break everything down and that’s kind of impossible to do by yourself and I never got any help till people got their at 5 am this job is not a good place to work at and how is a company that is worth 500 billion dollars not gonna try and help it’s employees with living wages
bad,"company will fire you for being sick/in hospital, does not accept doctors notes. company will also transfer you to any department they feel at any time. you are treated like another cog in the cooperate machine."
bad,terrible management and no work balance. do not recommend. many people will agree it must be a whole company thing. if you want to have a dead end job where managers don't care about you then this is the place to be.
bad,A unfair company where it wasthe ones moving up who werent resdy to the pay wasnt enough all the work we fid there was overwhelming management was very poor and unorganized
bad,"The store I worked for was the WORST place  that I have EVER slaved for. I had a great over night team, but they would say no over time allowed. Our hours were 10-7, and we couldnt leave until MANAGEMENT told us we could leave which was almost always 9:30-10AM. Then the store manager would yell at us infront of customers instead of being professional and taking us into the administration office."
bad,"You are expected to do the workload of 2-3 employees I do not recommend working here at all unless you like being a workhorse and feeling like you're getting nowhere. Managers like to commune in back rooms to chat it up, most do little work, just point and direct others. This co. is more about saving a buck than anything else nowadays."
bad,A typical day at work was usually stressful. The department would be ravaged and the items on the shelves rarely fit the labels beneath them and we did not have enough time to stock the shelves and organize the department. The people was the best part of the job. Among employees there a sense of camaraderie but a clear divide with the managers.
bad,"un dìa tìpico es limpiar la tienda revisar faltantes, acomodar ,recibir mercancìa, hay de todo tipo de personas ,hay quienes apoyan pero en general el ambiente es tòxico por la demanda de tiempo sin paga ,y la falta  a las normas,en mi caso el subjefe me tirò de un andamio, y puso en peligro mi fìsico al patear un cuchillo ambas conductas prohibidas. Lo màs difìcil es segùn las aptitudes de cada empleado manejo de peso de embalajes o atenciòn al cobro en cajas."
bad,Management team does not care about the interests of its employees. Salary is not enough for what is needed to be put up with. Black Friday and Boxing days are always a massacre.
bad,Management says they will fix your schedule when needed and give you the ok to take the day off when you need it but never get around putting it in the system then you're stuck with 4 points for a no call no show and only give you up to 8 points before being fired. Its a mess
bad,Poor communication. Insurance is too expensive and doesnt cover chiropractic care. Inconsitent management. Some work hard while others get by with minimal work but better pay. The pay scale is less for women.
bad,"• stressful"
bad,Working for Walmart was a good experience. There wasn't enough employees to do the work. The regular staff was overloaded with daily duties that were impossible to complete. The rate of pay was very poor especially for someone who has an education.
bad,"I worked hard, had no conflicting issues on the job , and arrived early for my shift. Big factor is attendance. You cannot get sick for the 90 days or take time off. My management took advantage of that and then some. Deceptive management and coworkers. For the culture Walmart is promoting, its completely unacceptable. Keep your options open and have another job ready."
bad,The time i spent working at Walmart was a disaster.Management had their favorites .Alot of employees did more than others and still wasnt appreciated.
bad,"There are no educational requirements at Walmart. That gives you (or it ought to) an idea of who they're hiring. They take PRIDE in telling you where they started out, but how many people in MANAGEMENT have an MBA???? Why do I have more education than most people at the store INCLUDING Mgmt? Why is it that THAT education is not used to benefit the store at a higher degree? Because I have a disability?  You would think someone with a MA degree + 15 credits would have a better job at Walmart....but then again....why would you think that??? I obviously settled."
bad,"I thought moving to a different store it might be a better work environment, unfortunately it was not. Management did not listen, rules were not followed. I am not one to cut corners in safety so I did not fit in well."
bad,"While there was opportunity for advancement, it was often taken with unexpected cuts.  I was promoted from Cashier to CSM, but was told after I accepted that it would be a part time position instead of the original full time position."
bad,Stressful work enviorment with increased workloads and undue hardships on all levels of associates. No work life balance as a salaried manager and you will be called in on yours days off and on your vacations.
bad,"Work is very stressful when you have unrealistic expectations for short staffing. Management have favorites, and seem to hold grudges when you have come to them with issues about said favorites. Scheduling is done by a computer and is not double checked, so one day you can be over staffed and others you can be the only person there for hours. Majority of the staff are fun, kind people, but there are also drama queens, and passive aggressive. They do have hour long lunches, and vending machines and a tv in the breakroom, though."
bad,"Overworked. Bullied. Overlooked. Never appreciated."
bad,"Stressful and no help. Managers always seem to think that by telling you that you can do it, it suddenly makes you work a 5 people job."
bad,Nothing much to say about walmart.  Stay away from the front end. And keep to yourself. And also do your job. Make sure if you keep track of your points when you call out. Reason why is once you hit 9 points your fired. They don't except doctors excuse.
bad,I have worked at Walmart for 6 years and It has gotten worse specially the last year hours have been massively cut management has been cut positions have been cut there is really only one person per department customers are mad complain nonstop and the company truly doesn't care about the customers let alone their own associates. and its sad that a company like this is actually the number one retail store when its so bad. now having said that I have learned a lot about retail customer service many how to manage and be a manger how to handle upset customers. a typical day at work is having serval different mangers given us serval different things to do an then having every other manger contradict every manger and then after that deciding which manger to follow the hardest part of the job and a typical day for this company and I have worked at 3 different Walmarts and its always the same for which place
bad,"Walmart is not a place for you to build and grow a career. As a corporation, they are not concerned with its associates. They make it seem that way until they find a new way to go after Amazon and will do whatever it takes including destroying associates' lives in the process. From a local standpoint, unless you are proficient with deception, you will not go far. Too many unqualified associates are getting promoted over more deserving and qualified candidates because of this."
bad,"With the mass amount of management no one ever got along and everyone wanted you to do something else, no communication, no staff to help, just a total disaster"
bad,This job was stressful and they require you to work crazy schedules the management only helps if it saves them no air in my store understaffed and nobody helped anybody finish work if it was needed
bad,"Walmart is a horrible place to work for anyone who works on the floor or warehouse they pay is terrible, the hours are terrible, poor management very limited the days you can have off, definitely don't recommend for anyone as a starting jo."
bad,"Fun placed work if you're young but too many managers and  not enough  people to hold positions, they want stuff done no matter what. Upper management already knows who they want for an upcoming  Position regardless if the person   Is qualified for it. Over all it's OK for Fresh out of school looking to start a career in the workforce but not a good place to build a career for a person who has a family and wants a life outside of work."
bad,"Manager and other lead pharmacist are demeaning. Nothing is ever enough and the atmosphere is always tense. Never appreciated for anything, literally. Your hours fluctuate and are not dependable even when job agreement states a minimum"
bad,They want you to perform a number of jobs that are for multiple people. There's not enough time in a day to do all that they require of one person. Not a healthy work environment.
bad,"Cashier was an easy job.  The employees are nice and work hard but put up with a lot.  The customer can yell at you and call you names and if you talk back they call you in the office.  "
bad,The managers at the Walmat that I worked at liked to play favoritism. They also were horrible at making sure there was more people to help out with the registers when we got super busy. My biggest thing was that you were just another nameless face in a big old company. The jobs I worked at and currently work at are friendly and they make sure they know you.
bad,"Don't work here if you expect to have a pleasant work experience. The Managerial team is very unreliable. Working with your schedule so that you are there the days you need to be and if you have things like Children,dependent pets or take care of an elderly family Member They will make it very difficult to cope with these issues and will schedule when THEY want you."
bad,"There are not enough employees, and the majority of them do not get enough hours or pay to live on. Many take up secondary jobs in fast food. Management is no longer there to help associates, they screw off while everyone else does the work, then they take the credit for it. When the current store manager arrived about two years ago there was a mass exodus, we lost most of the good employees, they were not replaced. We are under staffed, under payed, and overworked. Currently there are department managers leaving their position and switching to factory work. Do not work here if there are any other possible choices."
bad,WalMart essentially did away with the Asset Protection Manager position by incorporating it into operations.  Upper level management had no asset protection experience and made bad decisions
bad,not recomended. work is to much not realistic and people are not helpful in showing that it is possible to reach the goals set by the company. Goals are set to high and you will be written up for any little thing.
bad,"Bad management but a very fast fun place to work at.The people ask very simple questions, In over all it is a okay place to work with just the managers was nor fair or nice."
bad,"Since the induction of all managerial positions to only British associates from ASDA the company has had one goal, eliminate as many jobs as possible, except theirs of course.  The entire 5 year goal of the innovations department is to eliminate hourly jobs in the stores to automate everything from checkouts to cleaning the floors.  Its going to be a self-service retail destination."
bad,This place has no strong leadership.  Pay is low and hours are horrible.  Their benefits are also horrible.  You can be expected to switched from one department in a drop of a dime.
bad,"Hot, uncomfortable, under staffed, bad management. Would not reccomend to anyone. Every manager is shady or rude. Store manager did not care about you one bit. There are bugs and birds always in the store."
bad,"they will fire you for anything. they are a fire and hire place, they fired me because i was in hospital for birth and i didnt bring doctors excess fast enough"
bad,Stressful no family life favoritism. Management bad they will tell you to do something next thing you know your in trouble.Not flexible with hrs/days.
bad,"not a good job "
bad,"The whole time I was there it was total confusion. Management would come and go all the time. Always short staffed and pulling from one department and letting it suffer to cover another department.  Very stressful job."
bad,It was jus like any other day being at walmart just need another job because they terminated me because of a situation going on there but I would really like to start another job soon as possible.
bad,Stressful. Management was rude. DO not get enough hours. Have to beg for time off. Not enough pay. They did not pay all my bills and fired me for nothing.
bad,"It was fine at first, management is all over the place and they don't particularly care about employees. Stressful environment, and hours are all over the place"
bad,Walmart would work with any single people with no one to go home to. if you had a family they refused to work with you. if you had a family you worked every single holiday and weekend while the single people with no dependents or spouses would get every wekend off and all holidays off. How is that family oriented? They cut hours on full time but gave them to part time. ??? It was extreme bullying going on in several departments. Nothing was ever done about it. HR is the poorest HR anyone could ever even ask for. They shouldnt even have hr if theyre going to hire uneducated people for that position. The company itself is really run poorly. no morals.
bad,"This job started out as a good one, but 2 years at this place shows you that there is a strong sense of favoritism here, no opportunities, and of course the store manager doesnt kbow how to talk to people, countless people have caught him talking bad (saying certain employees are stupid) to other associates, they dont reward or promote the hard workers, just thebpeople they like. & now theyve cut way back on hours and they have told us in a meeting that our families dont matter to them."
bad,"Don't work here unless you have any other choice. The way corporate thinks the lives of their employees work is so out of it. Somehow they managed to find a loophole where they didn't have to pay us overtime. I could go on, but it wouldn't be worth my time, or yours."
bad,Stressful stressful stressful  all for self.barely get help.got to come to work sick or else always groomed work place. Managers always throw you under the bus.never speak listen show interest always more and more work never have enough time to do anything but always expect you to finish every task
bad,Managers are constantly lying to and about everything. I lost total support from them when I stood up about faulty machines in my Department They unstaffed my department every single day and I just got tired of the hassle.
bad,"Most senior level leaders spend majority of their day in back to back meetings, most are non-productive with no agenda or meaningful outcome.  In the past three years, most of the leadership empowerment culture has been removed, resulting in delays and lack of value and appreciation for experience.  The company is transforming to a command and execution reform vs. one built on talent and expertise."
bad,"The policies ridiculous especially with policy. There were no such things as a sick day. If you got heat exhaustion in summer, you have to work in the hot kitchen. If you have a sickness, it still counts against you for missing."
bad,"Awful place to work, hard work not appreciated, back-stabbing managers. They will make you work until you drop, they will not give you any positive feedback or recognize that you have done anything."
bad,I do not learn anything besides what I self teach myself Management treats there staff bad. I am a single parent with no family and they do not care that I have to find a sitter for my son they tell me my job is on the line every time I have to miss work for my child I am looking for a job that works around my child and school. My store manager is the only one that helps me keep my job
bad,down sizing and putting more work on employees. Expectations are high and some things can't be finish due to be short handed. In some areas it's over whelming.
bad,"The managers are puppets in a BIG puppet show, half of the employees are spies who eavesdrop all over the store and then report to management, so many who I trusted as friends turned out to be backstabbing fiends instead...misunderstandings abound when the only info management acts on is third or fourth gossip from one of their lackeys."
bad,"If you are the first service manager of the day you have to make sure you dont have any call offs or unfilled shifts. Put money in the registers and make sure they are running right. All day long you have to make sure there is enough shopping carts in the store and make sure lunches, breaks are on time and people go home at the right time. If there is a problem at the service desk with a return or anything you have to fix the problem and run the front end of the store all at the same time."
bad,"The pay wasn't horrible, but the scheduling ws inconsistent and there are so many employees that you just get lost in the mix of things. Management was very unfair with reviews and raises."
bad,"The job wasn't bad, it was the leadership. Wal-Mart never had enough people and were always angry at us. The Managers were very Selective when it came to how well you did your job."
bad,"worst place to work, no respect for individual even though its a part of their policy wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy.Pay does not compensate for the disrespectful atmosphere"
bad,"Very unorganized and cheap when i worked there but ive heard they are doing a lot better! So i might just go back to Walmart, because it wasn't a hard job."
bad,"It was boring, unsatisfying, terrible, and depressing. I would have the same conversation over and over again with rude customers. I learned not to work in retail. The main manager was atrocious and made all the lower tier managers do everything."
bad,"Worked overnight so it wasn’t too crazy. They don’t offer paid sick days and if you call in three times, you will be fired even if you bring a not from the doctor."
bad,"During my time working for this company, I have found that the management is very disrespectful. They will discriminate based on looks and criticize you for the simplest things."
bad,I worked for Walmart for a year and a half. In that time things were very unorganized and chaotic. The management does NOT know how to talk to people about things.
bad,"work culture is awful. the harder you work the harder they want you to work They want you to be completely flexible in your schedule, but wont give any thing in return."
bad,"I have worked maybe a total of 5 to 6 real paying jobs in my life, and none of them were as bad as this one. I worked as a typical stock man/inventory man when I was there. Sure Walmart as a franchise company offered health/dental/life etc. insurance. but the work was merely exhausting and repetitive. The management were downright awful. I've never hated people as badly as I did those there. They were possibly so disgusting and rude to their own employees because they were stuck in charge of such an awful store. The wages were per garbage, I could have made more on social security. Joking around with my fellow employees  for a the mere seconds we had was the only enjoyable experience I could have my entire grueling 8-9 shift. Around the last few months of my ""career"" there I started to check out, work much less, show up late, sometimes call out just because I despised it there so much. I remember the sense of relief and slight happiness I felt when they finally decided to let me go."
bad,"I was hired straight out of college to be an assistant store manager at Walmart. The training they provided was amazing and I was really excited about starting my new role. When I arrived at the store it was a huge mess. The back rooms were overflowing with inventory and corporate kept sending things we didn't have room for. Some items were ordered but were continually out of stock in the warehouse. A few commanders were upset because they never made store manager and would purposely mess up the inventory. We worked many, many hours beyond our scheduled hours because we were salary. Our associates we hired never stayed long because they did not make enough money for all the work they were expected to do. I did enjoy meeting customers expectations and helping them with their shopping experience but overall Walmart is not a good company to work for unless you are lucky enough to be in Bentonville."
bad,"My job consists of following up on task assigned to dm and floor associates,handling customers needs or complaints, work was fun with my associates all of them listened and were willing to learn, management was ok ,job is going more corporate and not really caring about the workers"
bad,"you will most likely be doing work that you were not trained to do."
bad,"If you want to feel inadequate and talked down to, then Walmart will be perfect! If you get off on humiliating and demeaning people then you should aim for upper management as it seems to be a prerequisite."
bad,If you work at Walmart distribution center you can expect to work at a really fast pace with production expectation constantly standing and looking over your shoulder.
bad,"Starting pay is 11.00, but you get low hours. So it is not possible to make a livable wage. "
bad,"I don't even know where to start with the company. The coworkers that I have worked with were incredibly nice and I made new friends because of that. But, the toxic management  management made me leave.I was a cashier and I also helped out with customer service and self check out as well."
bad,I loved what I did and I was good at what i did. I built relationships with people so that’s i could have a frontend that flowed. It’s sad my time with Walmart has come to an end but It’s now more than ever a Great time to start somewhere new and fresh.
bad,"Too many members of management, all telling you different things.  I have been doing the job of the Vision Center Manager for six months and they gave the position to someone else with no experience!"
bad,"The job isn't too bad, but the management is awful. For instance if you have issues or concerns with a manager and you take that concern to another member of management you basically get laughed at and the problem you had before only gets worse. Managers will target you at Johnstown, NY Walmart DC 6096. "
bad,"Typical day of work consist of multiple people calling off, or improper scheduling. Expectations of what takes 3 or 4 people to be done by one single individual. "
bad,"I liked working at Walmart because I was able to talk to a lot of people. In the beginning, everything was great, and everyone seemed nice. After about a month I realized that the management was not kind and did not know how to run things in an orderly manner. Every day that I worked, my breaks would be long overdue, sometimes up to FOUR hours overdue.  Majority of the time, I would not get sent for my break until an hour and a half past time. They would claim they didn’t have enough people, but really it’s that they didn’t know how to use the people they did have to where everyone was treated accordingly. The ONLY thing good about working for Walmart was the discount card, but you can’t even use that for groceries. I would not recommend working for them—it is miserable. People who are below management level only stay there because they need the money."
bad,"Very poor management , always felt like my life wasn't as important to the management team at store #0999 , never received more than 20 hours a week ! Cant live off of that pay ."
bad,"This is a company that takes advantage of people who are desperate. They treat their associates like dirt. Discriminate, poor management, stressful, not worth it."
bad,"I was a cashier for over six years and experienced four different managers.  The last one took the store into the gutter.  The place became demoralized, filthy and drove some regular customers away.  Many of the staff when I started had been there for years but the current manager made the culture too horrible to work in so many of us quit.  Which is quite disheartening because we were a happy bunch. "
bad,"This company is exactly what you imagine when you hear the word Walmart.  Walmart is so far behind in their HR model and if you are hoping to learn about your trade go someplace else.   The Sr Leaders in HR are not qualified to be in the roles they hold.  They are all best friends that came from Accenture.  They lack the ability to think strategically, influence, are totally disorganized and have no clue what good HR looks like. They just implemented the performance management forced distribution model- most companies abandoned that model 10 years ago because it is proven to discriminate.  "
bad,"I enjoy working with the customers and sharing knowledge with customers, co workers are mostly good .I have learned a lot thankful for the experience of working here."
bad,I'm not sure what to say about the company there is a different vibe for everyone. some people get what they want their are others who don't it's a popularity contest
bad,"Walmart:"
bad,"I hated working at this place because of the hours and the management structure, it was very lack luster and very abrasive, there was almost no time for life and family.  They also had unreal expectations of the particular job functions."
bad,It wasn't a really good place. Favoritism plays a big role at walmart. You'll get far if you suck up to the managers a lot basically you have to buy hour way up the ladder.
bad,"It all depends on who likes you management wise, if you are a hardworker and persistant you will only get so far, but if you are a brown noser and management likes the way you look or just like how you brown nose then you will make it far in the company. The ones who work their very hard are the department managers and they will get little to no credit but do the most work in the store. Being a D.M. is like one day you will be the best in the store ready for promotion theyre setting you as an example and then the next day your no good getting a coaching bout to be fired all because their expectations of you are so high. You can work really hard coming home tired and stressed out and the whole time they can be plotting to fire you. Wal mart is a good place to work if you never want to move up and just be a regular associate or if you liked to be stepped on or if you are a brown noser."
bad,"you could easily be fired if your unliked by the important people no matter how good or bad you are at your job there is no advancement really i worked there for a year and never got my benefits i worked 40 hours a week and was still only part time,"
bad,If you want a successful career in and you are not a Mormon don't work here. There will be no job advancement for you here. I worked there a year they only promoted people who had been baptized in the Mormon Church at this location.
bad,"While working at walmart i was made to be running around and pushing myself all while they searched for ways to save a company money"
bad,"Walmart is a horrible place to get a retail job. The managers from experience are awful. Many lack common decency and have very un reasonable expectations due to them having pressure from upper managements with un realistic job quatas with the ultimate goal of making as much profit as possible. I understand that's its busness and that's the goal, but I find Walmart quick to Sacrefice its staff in the process of this."
bad,"well a typical day at work there is hard you have to find something to do assistant don't know how to run the store we have new management  and there lack of integrity to the store is very low they don't resolve store issues, then they leave it all up to the associate to figure out"
bad,"Top heavy managers. Micro-manageing constantly. Wrong - doers are not held accountable. No ""respect for the individual""  as said in their own training."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working at Walmart. I worked in Electronics and I would work about 4-5 hours each day and always the weirdest schedules. so if you don't have a social life and don't care about how you are treated, then apply. But if you want a better pay, better hours, and managers who don't dump off their jobs on you; then apply elsewhere."
bad,With the change in management the store  has gone down hill. You can no longer make suggestions on how things can improve. If you make any comment you are thrown under the bus and blck ball. If you leave and apply and had a great employment record if you made any comments about managememt style you will never be hides back. It is a very sad affair. .
bad,"The work environment at Walmart has changed dramaticaly over the past few years into what I would call a very hostile work environment. The management seems to not care about the associates, they seem to only care about their quarterly bonuses. The company states they are a family oriented company but couldn't be farther from that."
bad,This job has given me guidance and experience yet many changes need to be made with in the management aspect of the company. The company has the potential to be much stronger if the communication was better.
bad,The managers will tell you to do something just so they can use it against you later. They will put unqualified people into positions then expect others to do all the work. Management refuses to help when areas are busy.
bad,"I took this position for extra money. The day was filled with mostly rude shoppers and lazy coworkers. "
bad,"to many lay offs and no more full time is offered ,  have to pay into your benefits out of your own money , there are  alot of ongoing training and gives u options to advance but you are not payed a decent wage  when you get a raise max is 10 cents,  they do not provide a work uniform but write you up if you cant afford a new piece, overall walmart is all about them and management not around to help thier employees make money its more to make u have next to nothing to force u into working overtime for more money"
bad,"They claim that the ""open door"" policy is the way to fix something, but when you go that route you get someone you talked about yelling at you or making your job worse. "
bad,to much favoritism and would not get on people not working to complete the job. working hard they try to keep you from advancing so you will keep picking up everyone slack.
bad,"I was a truck unloader, and occasionally a restocker, the managers were never around and most of them would yell for no reason. They often fired some of the harder working employees and replaced them with people who were not physically up to the job, making the job harder on the rest of us."
bad,This job requires you to be able to withstand not making sense and never having the tools to complete your job correctly and a constant ridicule of not doing enough.
bad,A typical day is having your assistant manager complain because the work isn't done when you have been off or gone.  You Don't learn anything beyond what you do and the management does not give you a chance to advance because she wants to keep you where you are.  The only thing enjoyable is working with the people that you work with. Assistant manager's forget that you have a life outside of your work.
bad,"The life of an ASM is filled with non-stop problem-solving and unrealistic expectations. Regardless of what you are told, be prepared to work an average of 70-hours per week with very little time for yourself. The company has included ""integrity"" and ""respect for the individual"" in its core values, however, this philosophy really only extends to the hourly associates and upper management. "
bad,"To much favoritism, management thinks your life should revolve around walmart. Not all mgrs. are bad but the majority are. "
bad,"lack of management and knowledgeable associates Not flexable with scheduling, poor benefits and pay..................................................."
bad,at a day at Walmart is get office keys and start talking to customers in what they need or if they found what they needed. give cash to the cashiers help other coworkers do audits and help with the closing
bad,Wal-Mart is a joke. They do not treat their employees very well. the way they coach you for calling in or having a hard time making production is crazy. they have a high turnover rate because we are treated like robots. your job with Wal-Mart is not secure. They will replace you very quickly and not even care. Some of the management is very rude. They are very picky on who they let advance.
bad,"Empresa , Walmart Brasil, empresa idonea, muito respeito ao individuo uma cultura muito forte."
bad,Walmart treats their employees terribly. They work them like dogs and treat them like they are dispensable. I would not recommend working there to my worst enemy.
bad,As a regular associate you will be fine. But as a Department manager it is like working in a who is a teachers pet type job. Management does not have your back at all.
bad,"N/A horrible experience, managers were not there when needed, training was sped up so they could just put you out there, cut breaks, only good thing about working there was some of the co workers"
bad,"Plain and simple, I would not recommend anyone working here. In this workplace, the bad outweighs the good. The pay and benefits are not good enough to stay and put up with the stress and junk that you will deal with. There are no chances for any type of promotion unless you are a brown noser and provide ""benefits"" to the managers. The raise sucks! I do not know any hourly associate that is living on their own that can make it by on a 2% raise a year. The raise goes straight to Uncle Sam, sadly. So, find employment elsewhere, because Walmart is not the place to be."
bad,"During my time as an Assistant Manager, it was extremely difficult to maintain a work life balance as there was always more work to do then there was time in a regular shift.  They rotate you through departments at their own discretion making it difficult to really make a difference. The job is very fast paced and labor intensive at times. The thing I enjoyed the most about working for Walmart was the great relationships I made with the employees."
bad,Upper management is more focused on themselves and dont care about their employees.  Upper management has their favorite staff that they protect and others who work hard are ignored
bad,"for starters, they taxed me so much my 2 week checks were never over $350. The people who work there are all lazy. They worked me until 12 even though I was in highschool, I complained, my mom complained and I was still scheduled too late on school nights"
bad,There were too many things that needed doing in a 24hour day and all were expected to be done.  
bad,"Walmart is a completely unfullfilling company to work for....They pay decently for the area,but the communication is terrible,the change is constant with no adjusting period to it,and after a while,you feel that nothing you do there is ever good enough...It has the potential to be so much more but the company fails at trying to take care of their really productive workers"
bad,Use wal mart as a last resort. They pay extremely well and the coworkers are usually friendly but the management there is absolutely terrible and needs a update on communication
bad,Working here was great at first and I learned a lot. We got a new store manager who ruined everything. She ruined the relationship we had with the community and creates drama when there is no drama going on. She lies constantly and throws the assistant managers under the bus all the time. The assistant managers try to help the associates as much as possible but is met with difficulty when the store manager gets involved. Nothing is ever good enough for her and she expects us to always be there. She gets her vacation but when the assistants try to put in for vacation she denies it. It’s a toxic environment.
bad,Management does not listen to associates. Favoritism is in our store. disrespect and threats from management. Upper management does not care.I have learned ow to not be a manger.
bad,Managers typically do not care nor do they even attempt to compensate if there is an emergency. Usual threats of terminations along with poor management.
bad,"Walmart was a very stressful environment and did little with bullying issues. I became miserable when working there and dreaded going to work. I personally, would not recommend working there."
bad,"Walmart is a terrible employer, the salaried management makes rash decisions and doesn't back up the hourly managers. The salaried managers treat their employees horribly."
bad,at the time I worked at wal-mart the management was poor and did not care for the employees. they did not care about any issues that occurred and would rarely addressed them. The employees made everything a game and did not take the job seriously. on top of all of that the pay scale was a joke. No person could work at wal-mart and survive.
bad,"Very poor management and training from managers,too much favoritism in the work place. Very few Pros like paid time off and health insurance and 1 hour lunch,no raises."
bad,"The customers would be somewhat friendly, as long as they got what they wanted. Management was inconsistent in the following of the policies. Many times they would not back the decisions that were made by the associate."
bad,"Poor management which never heard of reason, they simply don't care for anything or anyone, and neither do they know how to be a manager simply because they don't get trained for it, and have no qualifications to be one. Most employees are unhappy with their jobs and thus extremely unfriendly."
bad,"It is best to form close relation with your coworker for management are not that friendly and build a sort of mutual respect among workers,but company does not value the employees ."
bad,Management isn't the best. They create rules as they go..favoritism is a problem and they will write you up for almost anything. At first it may seem like the best job but slowly you will notice that the pay doesn't make up for the way they treat you.
bad,"I have worked for walmart on two different occasions in different cities,and noticed a disturbing trend.This monster company with billions in sales annually gets on people for any overtime ,has hardly any health benefits,and doesn't pay enough to keep up with the cost of living.Worse yet,any mention about union causes panic amongst managers and causes them to look for any reason to terminate .This company treats people as if their expendable ,yet tries to say they pay enough for workers not to form unions."
bad,Not a good company to work for at all. Most people are lazy and don't want to work and the management is atrocious and if you have a kid and have to miss work for doctors appointments you will lose your job and be told to get your priorities straight.
bad,"I worked in the meat, dairy and frozen departments and at times was the only one there for all three. Management was less than helpful and only knew how to crack the whip instead of taking the time to really see how to improve things. The scanner programs were not designed with perishables in mind so incoming merchandise that needed to go straight to bins the app on the scanner acted like it could go on the shelf. This, among many other faults, took time to work around to maintain FIFO requirements. Management was always yelling at us, five people total for three departments and two shifts, to keep up with stocking, cleaning, inventory, price changing, MOD setups and anything else they thought might be needed. So much stress that I took the next job out just to get away!"
bad,"Was put in charge of department and not paid to be a supervisor."
bad,The work experience is not good enough for me to be happy. The managing was fairly poor and I was look for something will be consistent and efficient.
bad,"Incompetent management, frequently did not have materials needed to perform duties correctly. Hostile work environment.  Management would berate employees on trivial matters that were beyond the employees control. Management talked down to employees as if they were children."
bad,Not enough training or team work to help an associate succeed in their positions management should follow up with their associates and show them they care about them
bad,"In the year I have worked for Walmart management has been slow to fix issues, will work you to death to accomplish the tasks of multiple associates and shows a great deal of favoritism for specific employees. Things that would instantly get you fired in other environments (stealing, threatening other associates, bullying) is largely ignored. When such issues cause greater issues the management team acts surprised or tells you to calm down even if you have informed them of the issue repeatedly prior to it becoming a greater issues. The work is made more difficult due to a lack of proper equipment and often multiple departments competing over the only equipment available. My advice? Don't work for Walmart"
bad,"Management unengaged in employees work. Cashiers often left to own devices for price checks, management over rides, and management often unavailable to assist. Just to be clear, I have nothing against Walmart itself, just the management at the store I worked at and how it was run."
bad,I could never get ahold of anybody that I needed to When I Needed Somebody. They have it now to wear a computer makes your schedule instead of an actual person which makes it a little bit inconsistent you're getting weird hours and then they don't schedule you for a whole week. I was very upset.
bad,The management team for overnights at Walmart does not work with you. They will tell you that they will do something for you and then fire you because of what happened.
bad,Walmart is a bad company to work for because they do not appreciate their workers.  They don't answer your questions about situations and they don't really help the customers.  The management team is not professional at all because all they do is sit in the afternoon office and eat or just do cbls so they don't have to be on the sales floor helping customers.  They also never have enough help on the front end checking out customers and they will fire you without ever talking to you about anything or you ever being coached.  I would not recommend anyone to work for Walmart.
bad,"Picking orders was very repetitive"
bad,You worked without much help. You didn't always have enough product. They expected us to do our job And do others jobs too.  They expected the employees that had been there awhile to be bossy to the new employees o
bad,Overall job was a terrible experience. The company can not keep supervisors. Went through 6 different supervisors while the 9 months I worked there. Was promised a bonus around Christmas time in which I never received. Was let go without a written warning.
bad,"Prepair to work like a dog and break your body to make the waltons rich.  You will never get a raise and if you do it will be 10cents, which is really a pay cut because of inflation.  The only raise you'll get is to their expected ""rate"".  This year alone ""rate"" was raised 15%,  and our ""raise"" was less than 1%.  Honestly it is a HORRIBLE place to work."
bad,"the jobs here are simple, but you will always be watched by the security office because they insist on watching the employees more than watching the people on the floor that may be stealing things like their department is actually supposed to do. Overal it is not a bad place. they just really need to get a new security manager for the store I came from."
bad,"Everyone works hard at Walmart.. It makes it easier when you a great Supervisor and everyone works together. "
bad,I dreaded going tin to work everyday at this job. I started out pushing carts back inside from the parking lot and then it was stocking the shelves and it was just an entire mess.  It seemed like everyone was always miserable and they took it out on everybody else. Management were always mad and grouped up and when you needed them nobody could every find them.
bad,i did not like my time at walmart. they cut hous after the holidays just when i needed them the most. they do not seem to care about there emploees  there is aleays issues with shceduling
bad,"They do train new hires, but they don't have enough time to train you well, so you will learn on your own here and there.  You do everything, even when you are not entitle to do it.  In order to keep the cost low, they hire few people to handle large amount of works.  On top of that, the pay is very low, super low.  In a hot day, no air conditioning in the break room, in a cold day is opposite : no heat !  Walmart do have air conditioning and heating systems, don't get me wrong. They just don't install it in break room  for employees ! NO !  You want to have cool air in a hot day ? Go walk around the store, just like customers, don't stay in the break room, you will become a dark sandwich soon.  The most enjoyable moment  is when you walk out of their doors, end of your shifts ! Yeah !!!"
bad,I think its a good opportunity to learn something new if you've never worked retail. I just dont think that the job is for everyone the management isnt the best nor is the customer service.Its like high school all over again and thats not how a work place should be at all.
bad,I highly recommend people look elsewhere for a job since the management structure of Walmart tend to abuse their workers. It is really stressful to work here.
bad,I was hired on and my hiring manager got promoted to assistant manager and began to move people to different departments. He was a very inexperienced manager and in my opinion should have never been promoted.
bad,It is an okay place to work Management didn't care about their employees and they started taking away everything from the employees and the only good thing about it was working with the customers
bad,"Nobody cared about your health. I threw up, told me to keep working. Sprained my ankle on the job, suck it up. Attendance didnt matter if you were in a snow storm and a travel ban, you still got in trouble."
bad,I worked for Walmart on the night shift for about 13 years in that time it started out fun then just got more stressful over the years as the company policies changed  going from happy to help to just get this over with so you can go home and the managers in my store just got more and more abusive as time went on when sam walten was alive walmart was a good place to work now its just a joke fullof brain washed managers and the hand full of long time employees. I my self do not recommend working for Walmart but that just might be a bad store I have herd that the are others that don't suck. the hardest part of the job is trying to deal with the loss of workers that leave and are not replaced
bad,The Manger would say racist slurs and no one to punish or handle the problem. If I could give them a Zero rating I would. So sad that they couldn't deal with the issues at hand. I would never refer or recommend this place to anyone.
bad,"Been at this place off and on for the past 20 years. It is a good job for someone young and with young children. But for older people it is not. The benefits are no good. The lack in good management needs to be reconsidered or retrained. The constant changes of the production is way to high to meet and plus they want you to work safe. It now is impossible to meet production, because now everything is at 100%. It use to be 95% to 100%. Just too many changes all at once."
bad,A typical day would be clear the floor of freight.  Cap the bins.  Put stock on shelves.  Setup for truck coming in.  I learned how lazy some people are.  The management is heartless. you ask for a day off and they deny it.  The hardest part of the job is dragging pallets around the GM side for the truck load the pallets are stacked so high you can't reach them.  The best part of the job is when the team you work with cut up with you.
bad,"I was one of the better performers at the store which I worked (best sales numbers, good shrink numbers, multiple people in my areas promoted).  However, I also demanded excellence and consistent treatment to and from everyone. My ability to work multiple days without rest was both admired and reviled."
bad,They are opposite of what they try to instill in you. They do not follow their own rules. They work you hard but don't want to pay you for the hours you put in.
bad,"They are very unorganized, they want to keep low staffing as possible, very misleading about their benefit, and every hostile work environment. HR is never in her office and manager form other department dont know on how to handle it or just dont  care."
bad,"I am a religious person, and i was working there about 5 months when a new manager was hired, at that point I was working Sun-Thurs, and he felt it was unfair for me to have every Friday and Saturday off. And due to my religious belief I will not work Saturday but he would not honor my religious belief so i was voluntarily ""let go"" because i wouldnt go in to work on Saturday."
bad,"Worst company to work for. Poor management, supervisors, and co workers. Ghetto and very unprofessional. Had CSM that wouldn't give me breaks because he didn't like me. Certain cashiers do as they please all day. They try to overwork the good staff, give you horrible hours, low pay, no benefits, and take forever to increase pay. I wouldn't recommend my dog to work there"
bad,"Would not recommend Walmart to anyone, they over work you, pay terrible,no over time and have to wait one year or more until you get made a full time employee and until you get insurance and other benefits. Only positive I have about the company is the 10 percent employee discount, came in handy when I was low on money."
bad,It's not a horrible place to work however it's hard to be the only provider of your household and have this job. The hours a different and they don't like you to have over 30 hours per week. The don't give you any health benefits until after you have been employed there over a year as well.
bad,"This company has a way of twisting words and making you  believe you are working at a great company  but come to find out that is not that at all."
bad,"Michigan city walmart was a nice store to work in"
bad,"They discriminate between associates, very unproffesional, and unfair. They make their own rules. Some Managers not all are very rude to Customers needs. Also employees will steal other associates food out the break room and the managers does nothing about it because there are no cameras in the break room."
bad,Hired on during a back to school sale. The overall management was very disorganized with how they communicated with their employees. I'd have to say the hardest part of the job was getting instructions on what to do. I did not remain as a truck unloader and became a sales member. What was concerning above all else was their interviewing and hiring process. This Walmart hired several people at a time every other week. It's an okay job if you are looking for something to get extra cash.
bad,Loads of drama took place at this walmart. Management got away with everything. Wouldn't help their employees. One of the overnight managers was a pig. He should have been fired long time ago.
bad,"I hated working here. There was constant stress. I was being yelled at all day everyday by customers and coworkers with no support from management. It was kind of a throw you to the wolves place. I didnt expect much going in due to the fact that it's Walmart, but it was so much worse than I could have ever imagined. DO NOT WORK HERE!!!!"
bad,The managers dont care about their employee's. They treat us like garbage and never hear anyone out to their problems. I feel like I could be making much better money with my skills somewhere else. I sell credit cards here and dont even get compensation for it. Just a free piece of candy or chips under a dollar. I feel miserable working here because i feel like no one appreciates me for all the hard work I do. Especially being the number one credit card sales person in my walmart.
bad,a lot of employees and a lot of dis organization and no instructions on what to do. they always changed my schedule without notice and had me do a lot of miscellaneous task
bad,I don't have anything really. After 15yrs I feel so I was mistreated. I was leveled do to home office cuts. Walmart was all I knew.  Very disappointing to my family.
bad,Not an organized workplace. They let employees come late everyday. Everything is hectic. Company is very backward and they are doing things way old. They have old rules and that's why they will never be like amazon.
bad,"I was a horrible place to work, the customers in the location where so greedy and self serving that It truly was a fight everysingle day at work if their perscription had a $2 co-pay. They are used to gettting anything medical free and completley dissrespectful if your tell them anything different. No to mention the employees where cut-throat. Even though you have worked there just as long or longer they tried telling everyone at their lever and below what to do or how to do their job. The cut-throat came in when a Lead Tech position was being buzzed about, there where a couple of people literally trying to get fellow employees that they have worked beside for many years FIRed because they where so insecure they wouldnt be able to compeite with the others. I was a complete and utter joke of a operation."
bad,Management does not communicate at all. They give management positions to people who are not qualified for the position. Takes advantage of the Cap teams. They do not understand when you are busy and can not take on more tasks.
bad,Getting into the groove on your first day on the job starts with snarling customers. Then right after you have every manager pulling you in each and every direction.
bad,"At first I loved it. Then it was apparent that nobody advanced because of job ability or performance. Favoritism is rampant, education and ability are a guarantee that you will be prevented from moving up. Employees are not valued, they are all replaceable regardless of length of time being there. The company is not interested in anything but making money, at the expense of their employees. I saw good people fired over ridiculous things, and people promoted to mgmt who were seen on camera breaking major safety violations."
bad,"I liked the work I did, but did not like going to work. I never felt like the company appreciated what I did. Management was not easily approachable, and rarely if ever tried to solve issues.,"
bad,"In all honesty, all of the management should be fired and actual competent people should be hired. Management outright lies to customers and employees."
bad,"Understaffed, Overworked, Bad scheduling, Underpaid, moved around the store, management doesn't care about employee safety. Penalizes workers for not endangering themselves to come to work during winter storms."
bad,"Working at Walmart is not something I would care to repeat. The customers act like they are better than you, and get angry with you when you don't know the location of an item, even when it's not your job to assist them in any way. I was talked down to a lot by managers and customers alike. Although I did not work there very long, it was honestly the worst of all my jobs. The only thing I really enjoyed about the job was working with my co-worker, Keith."
bad,Management was lazy id be the one just standing there awkwardly as customers had to wait for a manager to come fix the broken registers and the managers would be sitting in the brake room most of the day
bad,the environment there encourages people to be abusive toward cashiers and customer service managers management turns a blind eye and have the attitude if they can hurt someone they will and they openly are not helpful and generally state they don't care both in front of fellow employs and (customers) they only care for self convenience.
bad,Gostava de trabalhar  no walmart. Nao tenho o que reclamar. Me dispencaran por nao precisarem mais dos meus servicos.
bad,inconsistent hours. they're not flexible with you even if you have school. The crew was a nice group of people but the supervisors were too pushy when it came to getting things done. knowing we were always understaffed.
bad,American number one blood sucker retailer and worst for employees and management only good for shareholders and senior managers. but one day will come this retail company will cry
bad,walmart has a very poor management team. they dont listen to your needs or do the right thing for the team and the company. they dont hold everyone accountable for their roles in the company. the associates get little to no training and dont know how to do thier job. every man for themselves kind of job
bad,Management sucked and refused to give my raise. Customers were okay sometimes except for the old men hitting on me and the few customers who wanted everything free or a discount just for flirting with me
bad,"Very friendly associates, most managers are also nice.  My struggle is not getting enough hours that work with my family.  I have tried to change departments to get more hours and that hasn't worked either."
bad,"Very stressful most of the time. No holiday pay. You got health insurance thankfully, but the insurance did not cover much of anything. The management team seem to have a lack of communication and all had a power struggle."
bad,Worked for the company for over 9 years.  Most recently have been working 6 plus days a week and 12-14 hour days and the company has decided to eliminate my position.
bad,"They lie to you from day one - interview day - just to get you hired with zero intentions of retaining you to provide you the ability to advance rather but to use you in every way they can for their gain -  as if they own you. "
bad,"Walmart cares about making money for the people at the top. They don’t care about the people that actually run the store. The lines are always long because they refuse to give people hours, but are quick to fire people when they will not work 3 hours a day."
bad,Would not advise anyone to work here.  They do not care about their employees they just care about how much money they can rack in per day.  The managers were never on the same page so you could not get a correct answer on anything especially correct information on any policy.
bad,"Work constantly got harder and help was not there I was denied help retrieving carts at night even with very short staff and absolutely no security with homeless and drug addicts camping in the lot overnight."
bad,"Management is horrible. They really don't care much about the associates especially in the pharmacy. We never get those 15 minutes breaks. I honestly thing if they had better management , Walmart would be much better."
bad,"Managers above you never care about what you have going on if they need extra people they will pull them no matter what. Our store manager did not seem to care about our health and safety, you could be in the hospital and he would still fire you if he wanted too."
bad,"a typical day- "
bad,They would pull staff to different departments constantly due to the lack of staff. Management had terrible attitudes and did not treat employees fairly. Very high turnover rate.
bad,I would not recommend anyone working for this company.  They do not value their employees. They used to be flexible but they are no longer flexible and they cut my 40 hours down to 18 hours for each week which will make me lose my benefits.
bad,"I hated working here. it was the worst. they never helped you out, never gave ypou nyhe time of day. everyone was so strict. I hated it. it was stupid. id never work here."
bad,benefits were enough to keep  meds cheap otherwise Wal-Mart does not care about their employees.  Everybody was always looking to snitch on everybody else.  Very unrealistic goals for the work place.  Managers need to be taken out and shot.  Most enjoyable part of the job was walking away from it.
bad,"Don't get stuck in this never-ending nightmare , say goodbye to your family day one , be good at taking insults being belittled and down right threatened daily"
bad,When you talk to management they never listen to what you have to say a lot of cutthroats push too hard never got paid to what you had to do always demanding to do other jobs
bad,Nobody respected each other. There were noticeable cliques. Managers were discouraging and rude. Employees frequently stole from the store. Overall not a good place to work.
bad,"This job was a drag. They treat there associates as expendable assets that they drag through the mud with the ideas that you can get more hours. But then screw you in the end, by having you leave and hour after you get there to cut time, mind you that you came in to apparently waste gas and really tick you off."
bad,Very difficult to excel and move up. They never allow you to do your own work and then discipline you for not completing assigned tasks. Very frustrating most all the time.
bad,"When I was there my manager was a stripper outside of work due to the low pay. I was injured on the job and they fail to report it, very strict about hair color (They didn't believe I was a natural gingerhead and asked me to dye my hair black to look like the rest of the african american workers). "
bad,"I have enjoyed working here til the last year... I have watched our quarterly bonus decrease, morale go down and management that don't care. You work and redo others work. There is no accountability for what is done wrong anymore. I find things constantly that I would have gotten fired for"
bad,They expect too much out of you but don't pay enough. Christmas is the only day they close every other holiday is open and you don't get paid holiday pay. You are expected to be at work on Black Friday at like 3 or 5 on Thanksgiving day and work 12 hours.
bad,Well I never wanted to be an asst. because I didn't want to work overnight.  I got fired for talking about my family.  Well I worked in Meridian and opened a store and remodeled 2 other stores.
bad,"I will never recommend anyone working for this company. I have never worked for a company with this kind of environment. Some of my co workers where good people. As well as two of my managers. However, out of a store with over 200 employees this is not saying much at all. Most are money grabbing, moral-less individuals only out for their self. Caring nothing about the customers."
bad,Typical day was being yelled at by management and other employees and no one did anything about it. I learned that I don't like working in retail during the holidays.
bad,If your just staring out this maybe ok. Unless you are a manager or have been there awhile you have no chance of any type of advancement. I was assigned the minimum job far below my skill level.
bad,"All they are worried about is the ceo,s bonuses and the stick price .No paid holidays  not the same company ."
bad,Low morale. Awful management. Company is nothing like it used to be. They truly don’t care about their associates. It is all about making management and company look good and associates get nothing.
bad,company was a good place to work when i was first there i felt like family .. due to changes in that  company poor management and favortism to certain individuals its not a good environment to work there anymore ..
bad,"As simple as i can put this I would never want to work for walmart again after that work experience I personally had, Ive never seen a company treat their employees that bad ever ."
bad,Walmart is one of the worst companies to work for can’t get overtime and if you do get written up or coched. Managers expect you to do the work of 6 people with only 2 Associates. Its a lot of issues and favoritism and there is no advancement and your pay raise is supposed to be 6 months but I never received it. I was switched from deli to cake decorator and they refused to raise my pay.
bad,"Poor management , never gave me the days off that I needed for my doctors appointment, wouldn’t let me use my vacation time that I had saved up......."
bad,My department has poor management as well as lazy unmotivated workers that either don't show up for work or come to work to get a check.  They are able to take long lunches and change their time leaving department short handed and under staffed.  Work load is put on one person when department requires at least 3 people actually working to function properly.  Supplies are low and product is usually not ordered or products aren't there to provide for customers.  There is too much playing around on cell phones and associates taking long breaks and long lunches and not doing their jobs.
bad,You won't get noticed for your work. They promote who they want. Nobody is to be trusted. Managers are the worse. Your over worked and they expect you to do other people's work all the time.
bad,Do not work there. They only look out for them selfs managers will lie on you to keep themselves out of trouble. It is all about favoritism. About who you know or are sleeping with. You do not get your breaks or lunchs
bad,"I was absolutely stressed out by the end of my work shift. I experienced chest pains while there and had have sevral pricy test down to make sure my heart was still in goog shape. Luckily enough, than God everthing tested ok."
bad,I personally don't recommend anyone to work at this Walmart because its not a good place to balance your life. They want you to live for them and never give you time for you personal time. My co-workers are really rude people as well.
bad,The care less about their employees . If your not management they treat you like idiots . Poor pay. Half the time there is never enough employees working understaffed . Pay  is bad specially when they are so short staffed you have to be in charge of 6 departments.  Also management favorite curtain people oovcer others
bad,They don't ever have enough help and are too demanding.The hourly pay rate isn't enough for what is demanded of you. Managers were very rude and unhelpful
bad,I love being a customer service manager. But I don't like always being the 2 to 11 pm person. They are not fair about working other people on a rotation.I also enjoy talking to all the customer's.I also like the fast pace that it is.
bad,"Poor upper management, no structure, no communication, want you to do certain project but no equipment to do it. Worst place I've ever worked. They state that they are equal opportunity but if your not the right color your o of luck..."
bad,Overnight stocking is a lot of wear and tear on the body.  You are up when you should be asleep and asleep when you should be awake.  The stocking expectations where far fetched and unrealistic.  Not enough help for such big departments to be stocked.  We were timed on every task.
bad,I will never recommend Walmart to anyone.  In fact when asked I always discourage this as a place to work.  It was very stressful.  I was salary and therefore they could work me and my fellow assistants 16 to 20 hours a day.  Even on our days off we would have to come in to hire and do our paperwork as there was never time to do it during our work day.
bad,stock shelves help customers. some managers treat you unfairly. liked my job the work was kind of fun but you were rushed by some managers.had good benefits nice coworkers
bad,"If you are a manager at Wal-Mart expect to work at a minimum of 10 hours a day.  Most likely it will be be 12 -14.  During the holidays you can expect to be there for 18-20.  The weekly hourly requirement for managment to work each week is 60 hours.  And this is position is salaried, do not expect to get compensated for any time that you put into the company.  If you need help or guidence it is not provided, as all the other managers are under the same stress and workload as you."
bad,The management  seems to have lost touch with its associates.  Concerns were not resolved in a timely manner and associate morale was low.  The need to find another job was of the essence.
bad,it was very stressful. the managers nagged at you all the time. They would walk around and do nothing them.An make other people do their jobs. It was one of the worst jobs i ever had
bad,This place is an absolute garbage location for any Walmart to be placed. You come into a huge mess due to management not enforcing or caring on overnight or second shift then WE get held accountable for all the carts and freight THEY leave. Management has to be the worst thing about this place. They hire fools who have either given up or didn’t have a care to begin with. And the store manager? Constantly has time off and never puts in any effort of his own to improve the store that HE represents. Atrocious.
bad,absolutely like the co workers. Most of management are snotty snobs stuck on themselves and wont lift a finger to help no one but quick to coach someone about not getting the job done knowing dang well that some people don't work as fast as other. you break your back and don't get type of credit such as a thank you raise or even an appreciation. that makes people hate their jobs.
bad,micromanagement coming from all directions. Production requirements are very unrealistic and while job is already very physically demanding. Job security is non existent.
bad,"Unprofessional, weird culture walmart has, it's like working in a twilight zone, terrible management."
bad,"management is horrible, if you have anything going on they are more than likely not flexible with you or your schedule. they aren't very eager to help their associates when in need.  they are horrible at scheduling and making sure there is enough people to cover each department. there will be times you go into work and they have you preforming tasks that you don't know how to do or aren't comfortable with yet. for Walmart to make as much money as it does associates don't make enough at all."
bad,Overnight hours are horrible. You will be unloading pallets from trucks that have anywhere from 50 items to 150 items. The job is very physically demanding to say the least....
bad,"The management team is shuffled constantly so building a rapport with your manager is useless as they will be working in another dept or another store within 6 months. the store manger micromanages in the weirdest way possible and tells us to ignore head office directives. I even had her once say to my face that ""well im your boss and i sign your cheques so you better dam (language filter) well do as i say"""
bad,"I found Walmart to be very repetitive.  Once you are on duty you are assigned a register, then it is just taking customers money, scanning their purchases etc.  The other staff were typically unfriendly and uncaring.  It was very dull and uninteresting."
bad,They are rude and unprofessional company managers they are just unprofessional and they dont work with your hours at all they dont talk to you at all when it comes to your hours
bad,"A typical day at work consisted for me was making bread and putting it out on the sales floor, management lacked in communication towards employees. hardest part of job was picking up the slack of fellow employee who didn't want to do their job"
bad,"When I was offered the job they said they would work with my school schedule. "
bad,they were a horrible company wouldn't go back ever again. the managers were never there to help you with anything and they wouldn't stop a manager from harassing me when I told them over and over again it was happening.
bad,"Unfortunately, Wal-Mart isn't a great place to work. Management seemed to never care. The customers treated staff terribly which is a reflection on management's ability to project positive attitudes towards the customers through marketing."
bad,"Well at first the job was pretty decent, I worked in apparel so I was responsible for the clothes and then they moved to the fitting room. Where I had to stand on my feet in the same spot for 8+ hours on concrete floor. My feet and ankles began to swell so I got a doctors note saying that I needed a chair and they fired me. I mean I would absolutely love working at Walmart if it were under different management."
bad,"Walmart is a very hard working place, very few benefits for the new employees. Very low pay compared to other places to work. Very few people move up. Very anti woman."
bad,Walmart is by far the worst place i have worked. They treat you like your just a replaceable cog. The pay is far from fair compensation for the work and stress they put you through with a short team and impossible deadlines. Management is only there for themselves and  there is alot of favoritism at play.
bad,"I think the managers and the CSM are not doing a good job always never around when the cashiers never need them or to be found, also they are very unorganized"
bad,"During my typical day as an employee with WalMart, I was expected to maintain vast quantities of products. So much so, that would take several members of the team to finish in a timely manner. During these hours of operation I was also expected to be able to answer the incoming call line for the store."
bad,Company wide reorganizations occur every few years.  Severe lack of job security above store level positions.  Constant changes in company focus lead to very low employee morale
bad,Overall this job would be ideal were it not for horrible management. There are great benefits to be had. Most workers get along wonderfully in my personal experience. Managers have set unrealistic expectations so that no matter how good of a worker you are they are never satisfied with your work. They even say how horrible you are in front of customers and other employees which is against their policy.
bad,It's a great company to work but management is no respect with their lower management and associate. Asm worked over hours with no appreciation. Store manager told to ASM that's what I'm paying you for to worked over hour. Store managers off week end but ASM worked 7 to 10 days straight and giving ASM 1day off
bad,"I didn’t always dislike working at Walmart, depending on your manager it can be good at times. They are unfair on their workloads though. Daytime can leave work, trash, junk for overnights but don’t dare let overnights leave anything."
bad,"It is a ok company to work for but,my career type of work is Computer"
bad,I have worked for Walmart as a cashier/ customer service associate for a year now. A typical day includes poor customer and associate management. The work place is usually chaotic; it's sometimes hard to keep up. i find the only thing enjoyable is getting to know new people and holding small talk with customers while i scan and bag groceries.
bad,"My experience with Wal-Mart was not a pleasant one. My typical day of work consisted of many different managers ordering me to do many things at once, then chewing me out when I was doing a task I was assigned to do by a different manager. What i learned during my time here was that the company typically uses one employee to cover multiple people's worth of work. They typically didn't mind if a job was done hastily as long as it was done. Management seemed to suffer from a lack of communication and were unable to come to a consensus on what tasks needed to be prioritized. The Workplace culture was very fast paced. The hardest part of my job would have to be dealing with the demand of customers plus the constant nagging of management. The most enjoyable part of my job was when the management for my department had a day off."
bad,Constantly on the road. Was told that my role would be kept close to home (not the case). No logic in promotion decisions. Extremely poor leadership. No consistency from top down.
bad,"I ultimately left after being degraded by management for helping customers.  Any customer friendly establishment should reward their employees for helping, not insulting them."
bad,"The managers on a whole are lazy and don't seem to know there jobs. The place is so under staffed that the few people who were on the floor spend most of the time on the front registers. The managers are demeaning, and will chew out associates in front of customers. None of them believe in team work they all have there own agenda. there was often a problem getting coverage for lunches."
bad,This company does not value their associates or their opinions. They treat their employees with disrespect and lead with fear and threats. If you need a temporary job maybe as a cashier ok but anything else I would not recommend especially not management. You will leave this job mentally and physically drained from how they use and abuse you.
bad,"The work day starts with freight and goes on from there. I have learned to run all of the machines they have. some management is ok and some management need to learn how to respect people. the workplace culture is ok, they may have lost their culture. The hardest part of the job is the unrealistic expectations they put on you and then get mad when you can't complete them. The most enjoyable part is when lunch time comes or when it is time to go home"
bad,"If you are good fast working you don't get treated fairly. The more you do the more poorly you get treated. They won't allow you to move up if you work hard they only move up the people that stand around and don't do much. If you are a hard worker like myself and put them down for a reference they give you a bad one so you stay there ,( I have seen this happen to two co-workers who where the hardest working people I have ever met.)"
bad,"Health is always in question, mostly it all about the produvtion in stead of the employee, safety is always covered up and never blamed on the compant by design"
bad,"My experience was the thing of nightmares. Almost three years with the company and my stress levels were through the roof. It was one of the very few most miserable decisions of my life to come back for a second time. The management, while having much more than necassary, cared very little for my concerns as an employee and more about their own bottom line."
bad,"This company needs a complete overhaul of management staff.  They are prejudice and at many times unprofessional. I've been yelled at and lied to by the human resources manager, never to be treated fairly and accused of horrible things. Managers also pick and choose who they want to treat with special treatment and care less about people with the same job titles.  The government should put a shut on this company on the many discrimination and illegal treatment of employees!"
bad,"Working for walmart had a purpose that it served, if you are in need of a job right away they are likely the place to go to get your feet under you. However, they are but a stepping stone and staying too long can result in finding it harder and harder to justify the issues that are seen every day with favoritism in the workplace, poor management skills of the management team from department managers to upper management, very poor communication skills between departments, shifts, and roles to the point of the managers that are in charge of an area of work dont have any idea how things are run in that area. The people you end up working with are just as you would expect, they are regular people and most of who you meet can easily become close friends and your loyalty to your work is less about the company and more about not wanting the people you care about having to carry your load. Changes to the way things are run are always made on the fly with very little heads up, most of the time the new information is given either the day of or the day after the changes are made. As with most any other retail jobs your schedule is never a set thing and can be changed very quickly and done both without your knowledge or consent until it is already past the time they decided you should work and you are already late or you are let know two to three days later after the damage is done and you have no idea the changes were made."
bad,The management is absolutely horrible. I have never been treated so poorly. They are all way too young and over paid to be in their positions. I feel very sad for that company. I don't even like shopping there anymore.
bad,job did not offer many opportunities to advance in your career. was not allowed to work ovetr 40 hours and constantly under staffed management had very poor communication skills.
bad,"Breaks were never on time if you got them at all.  Favoritism runs rampant there.  People working there less than 6 months were given promotions rather than those who've been there for years.  Management said they would hear complaints and address issues, but that didn't happen.  Hardest part of the job is rude customers, not getting lunches/breaks on time, unfair business practices and promotions..I could go on and on but there isn't enough space."
bad,"Management will throw you under the bus for things you aren't guilty of. You can be their best technician, and still get the short end of the stick..."
bad,"You are required to do excellent work with no guidance, no supplies, very poor communication.  Scheduled breaks are NOT allowed in a timely manner.  Management is not available when needed."
bad,"Something about walmart just attracts the worst kind of people. Customers and managers expect ridiculous things and can be very nasty to any and most workers. The worst part is, I don't blame them half of the time. Very few employees or managers know what the company offers and what they can do to help customers."
bad,"The longer you're there, the bigger of a target you have on your back! The more money you make, management will find a way to get rid of you because, you are cutting into their profitability. Wal Mart #3259 is an absolute horrible place to work at! Unethical store management team!"
bad,"Un dia tipico en el trabajo es un dia comletamente ocupado."
bad,"I never once enjoyed working for walmart. The pay was Terrible and the management was a joke. The store was always filthy and unorganized. They were always so understaffed that as a cashier, I was also working in many other departments that I knew nothing about."
bad,Multiple employees have been caught buying alcohol on the clock with no repercussions. The stockers are careless in their work with no repercussions. The management have no control over their people making working as a team nearly impossible. You are only aloted 3.5 absences for a 6 month period which many people cannot handle. Our bonuses are based off of our inventory so the more products stolen from our store the smaller our bonus is. Shifts can range from 6hrs to 12rs depending on how much freight was ordered the day before making planning for a personal life outside of work difficult.
