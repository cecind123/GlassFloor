rating,review
bad,"If you like the old-timer style, go for it. expect routine works and no progress career and facing amateur decision with low-no commitment project plan and no career progress. Overall, you’ll be facing below standard of corporate oil & gas (upstream)."
bad,Management is in their business. They do not pay attention to contractors. THEY DO NOT CARE. No weekly meetings and so not know what is going on in the company. Lack of communication.
bad,not going to comment since I was not there long enough.  Leave it for those who work there longer than 6 months.  so thank you for the opportunity. kk
bad,"I hated my time working for Hess. "
bad,Management liked it when you were rude to employees and made them cry.  There human resource department was awful.  Management could do or say what ever they wanted to their employees and no repracussions.
bad,"will be doing daily audits, ordering.had to be on your  best with employees stealing,calling in sick."
bad,"did not enjoy job i was doing managerial work at sales associate level for low pay, was purposely never given 40 hours a week, and the employee to customer ratio was unfair for the workload , i worked busy weekend nights by myself!"
bad,I worked at the on in Baldwinsville. The management is horrible. You get treated like the scum of the earth with no hope of advancment or raises. Not worth putting in your application.
bad,"This was a favor for a favor place to work. If you like to be idle, then this is the place for you."
bad,"I didnt mind the work per say. But while I was there every thing was so disorganized the manger never knew what was going on some days I don't even think he knew his own name he was so lost and confused. The work basiclly consisted of working the cash registered, a little cleaning and then tracking lottery and ciggerettes at the end of the shift. That was not a problem for me that was kind of boring sometimes during an 8hr shift. My biggest complaint would have to be with the mangement team I worked under and the treatment I recieved when I went to them witha problem. So if you can handle poor treatment and disrespect then this is the job for you!"
bad,Hess is a non team playing company. They don't care about there employees. As well as there is very little room for advancment.
bad,"My typical day at work was standing all day, taking a break only when it was slow."
bad,"-Management is hapless and disengaged"
bad,"While it started off great, the job declined. I spent many years working hard and long hours. Gave up much time from my family to please Hess. Only to be passed up, after six years, for a management position to someone that was from outside the company - who was a friend of one of the interviewers. It was a huge slap in the face and that’s when I realized that no matter how hard I worked, it wouldn’t matter."
bad,"I have been a contractor at Hess for about a year and the work is very easy, however the supervision and management are horrible.  There is no communication and lots of unfair treatment.  There is a lot of drama and people who are in position to stop the drama are the ones stirring it up.  Would not suggest a long term career at Hess unless you enjoy daily cat fights.  This company grew very fast and the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing.  I will be glad when my contract is over."
bad,Corp Tax days are long & hectic with many deadlines.Tax Sr. Leadership & Management lack empathy & proper communication regarding their subordinates.  Sometimes work environment is hostile and colleagues are cut throat due to management's unfair treatment.
bad,"The job start off okay then in a short time I realized its not a true company. Its basically drama and gossip and management does not care about employees or safety basically everything was a joke. As long as the manager didn't really have to come in and the Asst. Manager didn't have to cover any shift they didn't care what happened."
bad,It appears Hess is preparing to sell the company. Once present care for company personnel has disappeared with new management. All signs are showing short term presence in the market.
bad,"After ten years the company in very different.  There is a steady stream of examples across the company of groups rewarding those who self promote and not those who perform.  The most recent cuts hit the worker boots-on-the-ground hard  while management across the company saw few cuts.  The reason for the cuts was to ""right size a top heavy organization""."
bad,If you are new they don't like you. They try to make you work harder then the ones that's been there the longest. You're not allow to talk while working.
bad,"they have been bought out by Speedway but back in New York, it was a great experience with this company. I really enjoyed working there. the manager is one of the best I have ever met"
bad,Got Treated poorly. Bad environment. People are more incline to cover their behind than doing the job they were hired to do. Not welcome to diverse point of view
bad,this job may be good for some people but it wasn't for me from the beginning i did not feel as though there was significant opportunity to grow in the field
bad,"I enjoy what what I do, but the ignorance of most of the customers are having an adverse effect on me, don't know how much longer I can last."
bad,seemed like a good job at first but management is extremely poor doing what they personally want not following any business practices and upper management doesn't care about anything said or done by their managers and just take everything said and questions nothing
bad,The worst job I have ever had. Employees would not show up you would get called in and then screwed out of other hours that you were scheduled in order for them to avoid paying you overtime or giving you any benefits.
bad,"Relentless back biting by co-workers and management. They prefer to hire unskilled labor such as fast food workers, ranch hands, ect.  No matter your oilfield experience or talents your either in the click circle or your OUT!"
bad,"Unless you're a manager, don't waste your time here.  Very top-heavy and management has no clue as to what the operations personnel do to make the company money."
bad,"A typical day working for this company would be maintaining the look of the store as well as customer service. Management was not helpful when it came to employees. It felt like he/she was always putting you down and not recognizing the efforts that were put into that days work or overall working method.  Co-workers were good, easy to work with and helpful if ever needing help with a specific task. Hardest part of this job was adjusting to numerous managers within a year or so time frame and having to change how we were taught to do something from one manger and then have to do it a completely different way when a new manager came. My time here was most enjoyable because of both, co-workers and the ""regular"" customers. Some days were made better because of the people, whether it was a joke they told or compliment that was given. After having left the company, on occasion I still run into some of the customers I used to see and they would always say I was missed. For me that is a great accomplishment and acknowledgement knowing that I made a different to someone and having put a smile on their faces.   "
bad,the hardest part of the job is no direction being given on the job if you are experienced. You may receive instruction the first few days but after that you are on your own.
bad,I have never seen a company that keeps so much dead weight in people that do not perform.  This was more than evident with the latest round of cuts with the corporate office and the people that they kept.  Very uncertain to where this company is going but to me it looks like the Titanic and its just a matter of time before it goes belly up.
bad,My work day at the hess station that i worked at was one of the worst experiences I have ever had.from start to finish ..I would start my day by signing in and no matter what ..if you had a good shift or bad shift the day before you got yelled at by the manger .You never knew what you were walking into everyday .After counting in the drawer you would start taking care of customers.Mostly register work..When we had the time we would stock out the shelves and cooler .. Towards the end of the shift i would go outside sweep and clean the surrounding areas..Change the garbage out. My co -workers were wonderful and made it a better place to work.the biggest problem at the station is the manager She does not know how to manage the people that work for her and does nothing but berate and belittle the people who work below her... I was physically sick some days from how my manger spoke to me and my co-workers..You never knew if you were going to get screamed at and have your job threatened every day.. If the management at the station was better i would still be working there.
bad,"V ery stressful environment from day one! Poor training or none at all! Old regime was only worried about place being clean,very dangerous place to work in the first several years.Final regime was much better.Company had little or no attendance policy,people constantly out sick,disabled which forced others to work almost twice as much.Family life/morale to  mgmt.never occurred at all.Very diiifcult to raise a family under their conditions.Co workers who were lazy or didn,t care seemed to be rewarded with less to do.Hardest part of the job were the long hours and things always going poorly.Enjoyable part was seeing how everything worked."
bad,"Speaking about only the Exploration Division, this is a terrible place for any G&G professional, regardless of your level.  For YP's it begins fairly-well with good training and mentoring opportunities, but you will quickly notice an oppressive culture.  Creative-thinking and asking what-if questions is highly frowned upon.  If you stick around long-enough to move up, you must know how the play the system.  If you are brought in from the outside, learn to say ""yes"" quickly and often!  In short, if you have any other opportunities in Exploration, I would strongly suggest steering clear of Hess."
bad,"The customers are fairly easy to work with, but the MANAGEMENT in the Wauchula , Fl. area needs a new profession. He disrespects his employees with his RUDE mouth and RUDE comments. The pay isnt enough to deal with his mouth is exactly what I told him."
bad,The store was new and after the grand opening and budget cuts several employees were left in limbo waiting to be placed on the schedule for hours to work. When asked if we were still employed the answer was yes just not enough hours or any locations that needed attendants! After 2 weeks of no scheduling I had to look for another positions and am sure they listed it as voluntary abandonment
bad,My days at Hess were very inconsistent. I could be scheduled for an 8 hr shift and work all night long if other employees did not show up.  Management changed very quickly
bad,"The closure of the Hess Port Reading put the operations dept. out of work. I was employed for 27 years until the closure this year 2013. Hess Port Reading lost quite a bit of talent in the business. "
bad,it was a fun place to work there for me because everyone I worked with I went to school with so everybody got along with eachother.
bad,"After becoming a shift supervisor, I practically lived at the store. Once I became a shift supervisor, there was no room for advancement unless I practically sold my soul to the company, and I wanted more for myself in life."
bad,"The retail channel of trade needs a serious 3rd party 360 feed back with and John's ear to listen then act. The old timers with strong work ethic live and believe in ""the Hess Way"" and are some how holding this entire retail channel of trade together. However, the thin political string may be a retail name changer. Politics, reactive manaagement, smoking mirrors, egos, fluff retail tours, high stress and inconsistent weak operations working countless hours makes this channel of trade very unstable. I feel Hess retail branding needs a gas station make over. Someone dropped the ball Leon handed them and they left Hess branded retail to run mismanaged. Someone is trusting in some of the wrong people to lead their HESS retail sites."
bad,"Hess seems to like having a lot of engineers, about a 1 to 1 ratio for field pumpers. They also layer on the supervisors, managers, superintendents and the likes. The company is not a results driven company, but a process driven company. Most days you will feel like you cannot get anything done. They like to spend money on projects that don't get completed. They also will throw away equipment, materials, tools and repairables because it's easy to start over than try to figure out how to completely overhaul a storage location. In short, if you like getting paid to do nothing, this is the place for you."
bad,Not a fun place to work if you are a go getter.  I felt very repressed by my direct manager who wanted to micro manage my activities and dole out small work scopes rather than larger projects that give one a sense of ownership.
bad,"Imminent laid offs are every year caused for unsure work environment.  Workers spend more time worrying about severance package than the company becoming profitable or cost efficient,"
bad,"Worked in the exploration part of the organization. First line managers were quite good, the top leadership was as bad as it gets: bullying, yes-man pressure, a real throw back to the 1970's."
bad,fast-paced work environment. There is a lot required of the typical manager. Co-workers are very helpful as far as peers go. There is a large time requirement for a successful operation. Advancement is possible.
bad,"It was a stressfultimr for the employees during the 2 yrs I was there, lack of communication and leadership,poor oil prices. And just a bad period through which everyone struggled"
bad,Was told to have only one employee.   Workers always called in.  It was a gas station atmosphere  I loved the customers.  Scheduling employees were difficult.  Constantly hiring.
bad,"My experience at Hess was not the best but it was not the worst; but, I have gained knowledge of how to manage the store at all levels. However, they can never be satisfied, and have me working under constant pressure. Meanwhile, my co-workers provided support and a family environment to help me through the days. The hardest part of the job was meeting inventory quota. Most enjoyable part of the job was creating the upmost customer service and seeing the smiles on many faces on a daily basis."
bad,Just enough room for advancement to keep you from quitting. Work environment is cut throat but it teaches you to play defensively and cover your own a**
bad,Hess was a great place to work until we kept getting robbed at gun point at that time i started to fear for my own life it just was not worth the time and energy!!!
bad,"Enjoyed working with this company, it was a very busy environment, the people are nice but my biggest challenge was the lottery tickets the person gave me the wrong numbers and was extremely rude assuming they would have been charged for an error, trying to explain not to worry that the manager will assist,she really over reacted but she left happy and peacfull store. Really enjoyed working on holidays always like being with family as they treated you .As for my co-workers some where great but i had one person gave me wrong instructions, the customers and employees enjoyed my energy and work abilities and this particular person try really hard to have me fired."
bad,A typical day would start out with me doing all of the general manager duties for the first 3 or 4 hours.  Then working the rest of my shift cleaning and serving customers.  This job was not very enjoyable.  Advancement opportunities and pay raises were very scarce leaving little motivation for workers to actually do their jobs properly.
bad,"-Boss was not always easy to talk to"
bad,Employees were hard working but often spent time working on projects that were not value added.  Innovation was hard to come by.
bad,"Love my direct reports/people I work with.  They are a fabulous group.  However, the outsourcing in every aspect of this company creates incredible dysfunction and problems.  Everything is done wrong all the time.  Accounting, IT, HR for starters are outsourced creating many obstacles when having to interact with these depts.  IT has come back in-house of late, which has improved services somewhat."
good,"I was hired as a contactor to help the AP team, but there was never enough work to help them in a day! team needed to meet a daily quote and no one would passed work in order to meet that quote."
good,The Management makes you work long hours with no lunch break. There are no benefits. The job can be very dirty and the customers can be extremely disrespectful. I was harassed on a daily basis by customers and management did nothing to help me.
good,Holidays Evenings Saturdays Sundays
good,"Manager was Thrived on Drama, Was Always calling people Mean names"
good,"fear of being outsourced, top-heavy management, antiquated systems and procedures."
good,"Arrived at work, planned the week/month, scheduled clients; had management cancel the appointments and replace them with higher paying clients."
good,Company is no longer committed to employees.  Aging management is not focused on building the company.   Activist investors are trying to correct the direction.
good,"it was a busy place to work at "
good,"my hess location was very laid back. you would cover the desk, allow customers to use their cards at the pump. responsible for stocking food and merchandise when it arrived in store, cleaning duties, coffee station attendant, paper work, checking id for tobacco products etc."
good,"-Days consisted of assisting customers and stocking the cooler/cigarettes and maintaining the coffee."
good,day was hard no help one person all day
good,Would be a great job if you have the right employees aroung you there always something to do some of the things are tidius like cleaning fuel pumps
good,"I worked for this company for almost five years. Started out Sales Associate to Sr Sales to Asst. Manager.Once I became Asst. is when it went down hill, did most of the other employee's work and had to work when ever they needed me, which I did. Never missed one day of work while employed for them. Was terminated for not attending a not mandatory Asst. Manager's meeting in Harrisburg. I was heart broken to lose such a decent job because of poor recognition of all my hard work for Hess!! I miss my Manager and fellow employees as well as my customers everyday!!"
good,"Male dominated as Oil and Gas is.  Senior women did very little to promote other women, just banded together with male dominated mentality.  Not helpful that VP had no children and understood little of that work life balance. "
good,"Now hess has been bought out by speedway, but prior to that when i worked there i worked for many great people and learned alot in the retail management field."
good,Im sure not all the stores were like the one i worked at. THe particular store i worked at made the experience of working there horrible. When i relocated however my experience improved dramatically. While i wouldnt work here for years upon years it was a god way to earn some money during my summers home from college.
good,I typically work 60 hours per week. 12 hour shifts with no lunch breaks. Low Compensation and no advancement opportunity.
good,Keeping store clean and orderly
good,The hardest part for this job was dealing with managment.The most enjoyable part of this job was interactig with the customers. My co workers were great to work with.
good,Working in a mans world were a woman will never get paid what she is worth even though she is expected to work twice as hard.  Fast paced made the days fly by.
good,"some of the people were nice, but departments were often unorganized with some people doing the work of a few. I found it difficult to deal with constantly being told I was getting a raise (up to regular starting wage!) if I would do this or that, and once I had upheld my end of the deal, they totally forgot about my raise."
good,"I enjoyed my job, just ready to try something new."
good,Good company if you are in the gas station business. Lack of associate hours.
good,"well organised, managment was kind, and it was well kept"
good,"Hess provides a basic salary, and some basic options. There are some perks such as tuition reimbursement, but it is not the optimal com pay out there."
good,"Got to meet new people everyday ,flexible work schedule. Nice coworkers,had fun."
good,The job was very demanding. Many meetings to deal with were a problem. Competition was very tough with a cut throat attitude.  Upper management seemed to be untrusting.
good,"enjoyed variety of tasks & doing multi-platform well and production  data editing/ loading/ maintenance. Wonderful colleagues to work with.  !  Enjoyed working in unconventional resources - horizontal wells. I enjoyed all ArcGIS training and being able to attend ESRI international conventions in San Diego, CA."
good,"The new HESS only care for the younger employee instead experiences, the promotion base on politics not on employee skill sets and experiences."
good,I wish not to  partake in this part. I was fortunate to have worked here for seven and a half years. Lots learned. Felt I'd be able to retire here however that didn't workout
good,"Hess has never maintained a single strategy long enough to make it work. Change is constant and every new SVP brings in new top management with their own ideas. On the positive side, individuals are extremely willing to help colleagues - a very collaborative environment, although that may change if they keep cutting back on projects and staff."
good,"Hess was not a bad company to work for.  They are no longer existent, which saddens me.  I enjoyed my coworker we all were team players."
good,Employees are hard workers. Regardless of how busy we are we're able to maintain a balanced work & family life.
good,"I worked alongside coworkers who were at least 20 years my senior and they were all great men. Management was cool to deal with because they didn't come outside too often. Lots of on your feet, on the move action all day. The hardest part was dealing with rude customers and the best was talking with the ordinary people with extraordinary stories."
good,"ensure selling floor was adequately stocked"
good,"I wasn't here long, but wouldn't mind working here again. My colleagues we great and working here felt like a family in the short time I was here."
good,The store would have been great to work for if it wasent for the management. The manager wasent very involved in day to day work life. The co workers and customers were amazing. Hardest part of the job was having to run to different departments one minute you would be running a register and the next you would be making pizza or sub sandwiches. My most enjoyable part of the job was being able to use my skills. I took American Sign Language as my foreign language in high school and there were a couple def customers that would come in and I could talk to them without them having to write everything down.
good,Very simple to learn what to just the basics are running the register and making donuts. 
good,"I worked for 9 different managers in 9 years. We generally were a ""big"" family. Both stores worked as one most of time. The last manager did nothing to promote the ""family"" experience. I learned many different aspects of Hess and the gas station business."
good,I enjoy the people within the Legal Department and in the field. I have learned so much about corporate life and the energy field.
good,Sold merchandise by using a security window. Had to get all products for the customers.
good,Hess is a good oil company to work at and they treated their employees pretty including contractors.  They start to go down a bit with so much outsourcing to India.
good,"Good place to work. The company is energetic, results-oriented and eager to bring strong qualities and administrative skills to a growing company. They addressed the needs of customers and staff to ensure outcomes that benefit the company's short-term and long-term goals."
good,"I know this is a structured formate, but what I wrote previously applies here.  I worked for Hess and not a company called Project lead.  Please refer all answers from there.."
good,Just went through a major reorganization.   Will take time to settle down and focus on future.   Activist shareholder is prompting company to sell assets and pay dividends.
good,The company is going through a change at this time. So there is no stability in the changing environment. The company is a good company to work for once the final blueprint has been completed.
good,In the 6 years I've worked for Hess the company as a whole has had 2 re-orgs (lay-offs and swapping people around without giving anyone a say) and 2 in my department alone. Pay is competitive and the working environment varies depending on whether you work in field or corporate. Can be very relaxed or overly stressful.
good,Moral is poor due to the layoffs.  Ran the company lean and the layoffs cut more people.  Everyone is doing twice as much now and they want more and more
good,These were small businesses that offered a great work experience for a young high school graduated.  The job required attention to detail and the ability to analyze large sets of data.
good,Most employers and general manager were good to work with. Upper management was absent until they needed/wanted something. Could have compensated good employees better.
good,No longer in business. Speedway bought them out and company fell apart. It is not in business anymore. Why do I need to give you review. Alot of people list there jobs because of this.....
good,Recent years Hess has forgotten that it is an oil & gas company and tries to work as a manufacturer. Management track incorrect metrics & knows little about business. Supply Chain forgets who the customer is & what Hess does
good,Hess was a fun place to work. It was my first job and gave me a lot of experience in customer service and money handling and taking care of a store. I opened and closed which gave its own experience. I enjoyed working for Hess. It was easy.
good,I worked at Hess for two years. The Dining Hall and employee Starbucks is a great perk. The culture and attitude towards women needs some improvement.
good,"good learning experience when it was hess but since it is taken by Speedway it was hard to work, because more restrictions for no reason."
good,"near impossible deadlines and no incentive, the work cycles are patchy but that goes with the industry. The company also has a huge lack of communication from the higher ups"
good,"Hess Express is a good company, but the type of company as a regular employee a stepping stone to gain retail experience if you want to stay in the industry and advance"
good,"I liked to work with them, good working environment and good partners of cooperative work with one an others."
good,its a great first job long hours and hard work but it was a fun job. The only downfall is that you can only advance so far in the job field.
good,good company to work for. good for a high school student. coworkers tend to be scumbags. i dont know about this response.
good,co-workers are very sociable and works well with other. they show a lot of respect.  costumers can be rude at times some are very friendly.
good,"Company is in a constant state of re-organization. Lack of preparation of well forseen projects by the poor management there causes employees to have to work long hours and miss the target for the project. Politics and favorites are a definite part of the work climate in many teams. Management finds one person to pin all of their failures on in order to stay on top. Sexism, discrimination, and illegal practices are alive and well in the company."
good,"A regular day of work would be clocking in and getting right to business, everyday brought something new to the table, my knowledge and help better learn and understand things i didnt know off. YES there is hard days but it helps pressure me into knowing that i can have bad and good days and cope with them."
good,"Company was decent, paid well. Watched 1 rig. Texas management was alot better than in North Dakota. Overall HESS is a decent place to work."
good,its a good start to build a business to customer relationship. From the entry level you are hands on. looking for an opportunity is hard but t get experience is great.
good,The company has up to date computer system to handle the business and location is good and easy to find.  They take care of their employees.
good,Hess is a nice place to work.  Although it is not a family company it does have the feel of one.  People are generally warm and are genuinely interested in your well-being.
good,"So we start in the morning making sure of all the inventories that are said to be their are there.  We then assign two people (6,000 Gallons or less Marketing Station) to service customers and the other to do the paper work.  Some of the paper work that is involved is as #1 mentioned all inventories. Then payroll or hiring processes.  Every two days we order inventory and every once a week clean uniforms.  Everyday we prepare for armored car and account of the money that will be sent to the bank.  Any discrepancy will be charged back as a penalty.  We then receive a call from headquarters daily to read back numbers.  In the afternoon we look at the morning cleaning such as washing down the pumps, hoses and floors.  We calculate the crossing of shifts to be accountable of monies that flow between the two shifts.  The process is subtracting opening from closing than multiplying the results to make sure of any breeches such as unauthorized pumping or breaking of seals.  Maintenance is a daily thing now simplified with electronics(change of nozzles although still remains mechanical at a lot of the stores still done by managers). Our peers are for the most of them distracted from the job tasks.  As a life balance it is an assurance of guaranteed employment unless you cannot cope.  The hardest part of the job is also the best part of the job and that is your office is outside in the weather.  We cannot stop for foul weather in fact we work harder with more demands on us...... The overall rating of the job is a three which will call average. We learn that with a little effort you can"
good,A typical day at work is busy.  I mostly work at the cashier selling merchandise and gas.  Helping maintaining order in the facility.
good,As an intern this was a great stepping stone in my career. I had to generate payable/receivable invoices as they are received by the counterparties. I contacted different counterparties regarding penalty reconciliation and also was responsible for checking and filing broker recaps. 
good,A typical day at work starts with me checking my product for my shift. I like to make sure all product is stock to ensure that I will have every thing I need for my customer. I also like to make sure the store looks nice. I check trash and windows and make sure the parking lot is clean and swept. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing what my regular customers want and having it ready when they come to the counter.
good,i had a few problems with the manager and because of class schedule i was fired or let go because of my class schedule was taking over my work but wasnt to bad.
good,This job was not for me I had small Children at the time.And the hours where not regular hours.
good,"Very busy, loved the fact i was alone working in my own space without having to worry about stealing"
good,- Very nice people
good,learn and build my experience for future openings somewhere else. minimum hourly pay for assistant manager position.
good,"Patience and understanding was quickly learnt, as most customers hate waiting on line. Thankfully my fellow employees were engaging,  Working in the freezer was the toughest."
good,Overall a good place to work. I enjoy the benefits provided and the people that I work with. Hess supports by providing training and classes to advance employees in their role.
good,I worked for the retail side of the company. They have since sold all retail stores and focus on oil drilling and processing. The retail job was a good job with very good benefits.
good,Team work culture is high. Management maintains good control over the projects. Provide a nice employee cafeteria with very reasonable price and good selections of food..
good,"Co-workers were a great bunch.  Benefits are very good.  payscale and possibility for growth at your position or within the company, not so much.  flexible work time."
good,"Work by yourself"
good,My local team was unfocused.  We had high turn over.  Moral very low.  Was harassed by team management.  Had a personal problem with me.  Was not able to resolve serious issues even after going to HR.
good,"•	Provided executive administrative support to the Vice President of the Global Supply Chain department and its 12 direct reports. "
good,"I work with different people, race, but that not change the fact that we are working and we need to be focus on work, and costumers satisfaction."
good,Underemployed position with no promotion manners and poor performance assessment
good,It is a small knit family type of business however a lot of politics involved.
good,"Management at Hess consisted of a wide variety of duties from "
good,A day at work was ok but harsh with uniforms that make you sweat and u work every day and could be stuck there on christmas.
good,"Manage the station. controling of inventory and ordering for the station. Training and developing of the station employee, delagating tasks and follow up. Scheduling of all employees. Hardest part is that most of the employees have no loyalty it's just a job to them"
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is mostly really good people to work with at Hess.
good,"Provided sales support pricing for oil, electric, and gas per volumes of customer requirements, Worked closely with salesman to provide yinfo in the field."
good,Managers are out of touch with reality and have no Idea of the Industry that they work in. Too much He said She said and Managers fall into the rut of one sided and not identifying the truth.
good,"It was a very easy job to do. A typical day at work consisted of assisting customers with the purchasing gas, lotto, cigarettes and selling and preparing food . The hardest part about the job is your on your feet all day."
good,Taking care of customers. Hoe to deal with different situations. It was difficult while I was employed. The culture was mixed. Dealing with angry customers. Dealing with understanding customers.
good,"Learned how to be your own boss. Work independently, responsible for operation of facility. Hire, train work with team to achieve goals in an atmosphere of respect."
good,"During the 2 years I worked at Hess (including after it became Speedway), I maybe got a raise once and it was less than a dollar. The management is good but the work environment and the weird customers make it really suck. I would only recommend this job to someone in high school who's just looking to get some money and doesn't care."
good,"Dealing with customer attitudes and constantly cleaning up after people. Other than that, this job is a lot of work all be it easy work, Pays between minimum wage and 9 bucks."
good,"It is a good place to work but there are a lot of guess repair work being done causing rework on the same equipment or areas. "
good,"I worked with approximately 18 other persons on a team that supported over 860 retail sites on a 24/7 basis. Besides providing daily tech support via phone and remote access software, we also conducted root case analysis of our work tickets generated in the month prior, maintained a knowledge tree, and conducted on field tech visits to our locations when deemed necessary. This was only a part of our daily responsibilities."
good,"It was an Awesome company to work for prior to 2014, however management is currently more concerned about profits rather then keeping good employees.  I think there are a lot of changes in store for Hess in the future."
good,"I enjoyed working at Hess -- the worst part of the day was the commute. The work was always interesting and on the cutting edge of exploration.  Technology, however, wasn't always on the cutting edge.  Strong tendency to favor younger employees and support their work even when it may not have been technically correct.  Not so great if you are over 50."
good,"sometimes work is ok, depending on the schedule you might not get any sleep, the hours and money you make is good, the new management is horrible!!! and the co-workers all get along. It's like a dysfunctional family."
good,"•	Provided each gas station customer with the highest levels of service and satisfaction at all times."

good,"Sell products to individuals, maintain a clean work environment. Management was easy to work with and understanding."
good,"I worked night shift, I learned how to manage the store and do inventory. I only worked with 3 other people. I worked by myself other than a couple times I Trained 3 different people at the store. Honestly There was nothing hard about the job. I liked that job alot the best part was getting to know the customers and develop kind of a relationship with them. Repeat customers is your most business and i made sure they were happy and came back for more. I made more money for that store on midnight shift a few days a week than the other 2 shifts made just due to the fact i cared about the customer i made sure they got what they wanted and made sure they walked in and smiled and walked out with a smile. Important thing is Acknowledge them when they enter the store. Then everything falls in place after that. They want to be noticed and feel special at times. I even worked holidays I worked Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years Eve, and New Years Day."
good,OK job but supervision is not that great. Money is good but being away from home hurts. Very confusion organization but all in all it is a good company to work for.
good,"mostly cashier, stocking coolers  great co-workers, 3rd shift, the hardest part was 3rd shift, the best part was co-workers and customers"
good,Get calls from oil field pumpers or supervisor and get a task for the day. If don't get called we go out and find things to fix or finish unfinished tasks from the day before. Co-worker two 63 year old men. Hardest part of the job is the physical labor in the hot summer sun. Enjoyable part is working with my hands and being outdoors in the spring and fall.
good,I enjoyed working for Eneterprise Products until new management came in.
good,Great pay and opportunities to learn but long hours and required traveling 2 weeks per month. The best field personnel I have ever worked with. Learned a great deal from co-workers with decades of experience. Recent changes in management and re-structuring has pushed some of the most talented people away.
good,"For the most part Hess was an exciting company to work for with competitive advantages, good professional environment and very high profile production and exploration initiatives. It was a stepping stone and a learning experience."
good,"This role for Hess no longer exists since they sold off this piece of the business and every piece of the business I ever worked for.  Other than that, I mostly enjoyed my time at Hess."
good,Excellent place during commission but when new supervision came into work place the moral went down. Upon new arrivals and commissioning learned a lot of new skills and helped me out in the long run
good,Its up to you if you want to grow with the company the you work with are friendly and helpful team player and customer and nice great work environment

good,"Hess Corporation has been a good company to work for during my 20+ years there, and I have met, worked for and worked with many good people during that time.  Hess believes strongly in creating a safe working atmosphere for its employees and continues to make positive strides in promoting a culture of safety.  The work/life balance is good, and Hess offers a comparable compensation package."
good,"Needs a HUGE revamp of their career advancement program, or lack thereof. The advancement of careers is based on a popularity contest and this does not allow for the best candidates to take on leading roles."
good,Great energy company to work for. With locations all over the world it provides many positions and locations to work for.  Great staff and I had an overall great experience there.
good,"Very low profile employment. Worked night shift, pay offset slightly, but usually slow throughout the night, gets busy towards morning for early risers. Got to see many sunrises, offset my sleeping however. met good people, and got robbed twice. Worked in a small cube surrounded by glass, bullet resistant glass not proof. Will shatter after few attempts of gunfire. only responsibility was to sell gas and cigarettes and oils."
good,I loved this job.  Worked with the best co-workers.  Very challenging and potential to move up the ladder.  It is such a shame they no longer are in business.
good,at any given point and time a customer could tear the fuel hose off the machine and create a dangerous situation. You must be aware of potential hazards that can cause harm to the environment and take measures to prevent it from happening. The safety of your customer as well as your team depend on you to lead so that everyone has a good experience day in and day out.
good,I was lucky to work in the remote sales office with a fantastic team who taught me a lot and in turn I gave my best to help them with their accounts.  It was teamwork and we celebrated wins together.

good,Enjoyed working with colleagues and learning about the differences of the Bakken Shale play verses other Shale plays.
good,It is a job where you must be able to manage your time well and multi-task. you must have lots os patients or you will not make it.
good,I moved up to management quickly in this company because they can see when someone can do the job and is willing to work for it.  Even when I went to the headquarters in New Jersey I found that corporate worked as hard as we did and had fun doing it.
good,OK working environment and enjoyable facilities.  Restructuring means a lot of changes.
good,"it was a good place to work with a lot of good people"
good,I love the customers but the supervisors was something else but over all it was a wonderful place to work the customers was like family an i loved making them smile.
good,"A typical day at work involves interacting with customers, running the cash register, and maintaining the cleanliness of the store. I have learned a lot about customer service and also have some experience in leadership as I am a Senior Sales Associate. My coworkers are hard working yet fun and enjoyable to be around. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unhappy customers and the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the satisfaction on customers faces as they "
good,"Hess Corporate is caving under the pressure of a Hedge Fund and is divesting the NJ Operations group (Terminals, Retail (gas stations) and Energy Marketing). Was a great place to work. Was being the operative word. Looking to sell the three units to 3rd party. People are in ""wait and see"" mode, but very options seems like Hess is for ""lifers"" like it once was. Sad day indeed (I wanted to be a ""lifer"")."
good,"Hess Oil was old-school culture/work environment/organizational structure when I started fresh from college. When dotcoms were introducing jeans at work, no ties, and coffee bars in the office; Hess was suit and tie, everyone goes to lunch and you swipe in and out when you enter the building."
good,You are given real responsibilities. People here are nice and knowledgeable.
good,The hours are sometimes difficult. It's a very easy job to do. The pay is mediocre at best.
good,Good job and I developed good relationships with the every day customers.
good,great for young person good benefits and great customer service safe work environment
good,Typical retail job. Most coworkers are friendly and helpful
good,Most challenging part of this job was supporting the company internationally. The team was multicultural which allowed the systems to be built and designed by folks with tons of experience in the oil and gas industry.
good,Worked at Hess four years.  I enjoyed my group and gave notice I would be leaving.  They outsourced accounting/ap department I was in.  The benefits were good and over all the employees.  The building was very nice and clean.
good,"The culture is defined by the leadership club. Ex Shell and Aera buddies. Some of them among the best I've ever had, a few among the worst."
good,There are many good things about this company: they take early career training very seriously and their early career program is one of the best of the industry.
good,I was there for 2 years and learned better customer service skills. Enjoyed the group there and the Manager also. It was a team environment.
good,"It's not a bad place to work, but they want you to be there for ten years if you want to make management, which I think is a VERY long time."
good,"I Like working with the law department, reviewing documents and indexing."
good,"Worked for Hess for many years, starting at the bottom.  Circumstances allowed me to propel myself into a manager's position, don't take it the wrong way, I worked and I taught myself.  Pay was decent for the amount of work I was doing, quarterly bonuses are awesome if you can get the right team together to make the differences needed to increase margin.  It also helps to be mechanically inclined, service calls can end up costing a lot of money for the littlest things so call up your fellow managers and see if they have spare parts, otherwise kiss that bonus goodbye and prepare for your marketing rep to chew you out over the P&L.  The only warning I will give is this, make sure your team knows you aren't to be messed with and make sure your rep knows that as well, otherwise you'll get into situations where people take advantage of you and if there's blowback it'll be on you."
good,"Dealing with the public is wonderful. I learned your attitude has to be good to deal with the customers an vendors. Management was ok,"
good,Variety of positions held always treated fairly. Compensation was always quick and fair. Treated with respect by supervisors and safety was a cultural atmosphere
good,"I love the customers that you see daily. It makes all the hard work really worth the effort. They really appreciate the things you have ready for them. Isn't that what it's really all about? "
good,Room for advancement stability creative control within reason strict on ethics but overall very relaxed company and they will teach you what you need to succeed.
good,"High focus on safety, even when it doesn't apply to your job. Lean Manufacturing focused. Support functions not nearly as recognized and E&P and D&C functions."
good,"love the compressed work schedule (9/80s)"
good,"This was a great company to work for and has been valuable experience. Safety really is the culture at every site they operate, not just a motto. Also an innovative company."
good,Overall positive company culture demonstrated by senior corporate leadership team. Engaged in several projects within multiple lines of business and various levels of complexity.
good,This was an enjoyable experience. I was surround by a team of people who made every effort to ensure the Projects met schedule. My manager was a great mentor!
good,"My typical work day would be come in count the safe in between customers, make sure food was fresh and ready by lunch time, count cigarettes in between customers, then while another cashier was there go in cooler and make sure everything was stocked full and kept stocked threw out the day. Deliveries were on Tuesdays and Fridays for the cooler and Saturdays for the rest of the store. i would check t make sure everything was in the order was there and then stock the shelves with what came in. i would organize what was let in stock room."
good,"Overall Hess is a good company to work for. They have a good pay scale and excellent benefits. However, for the size of the company, there are too many management layers.In fact, with their recent round of layoffs, they said they were going to eliminate layers. Instead they concentrated layoffs on senior technical staff and kept managers."
good,"Family culture"
good,Working for Hess corporation allowed my opportunities for growth. The company had many advancement opportunities which encourages employees to work for it. I'd recommend for company for anyone who likes working with people.
good,"Typical day at work was managing worker schedules, ordering replacement inventory, managing store displays and bank deposits.  People skills in supervising staff.  Staff was challenging as most were entry level and their ""call out"" required me to work their shift.  The hardest part of the job was keeping the inventory accurate as shrinkage was an issue.  The enjoyable part of the job was working well with associates and management team."
good,Well paying job working remotely on oil rigs in the state of North Dakota. Pay and benefits extremely good. Good working schedule of 14 days on and 14 days off. Lodging and travel provided by company.
good,It was a good company to work for until it got under wall street activist pressures and ended up selling the business that would have made money and kept the cash flow going in low oil price market. Management and investors probably regret the decision.
good,"Hess announced its initiatives to transform into a pure play Exploration and Production company.  Transformation plan include fully exiting several businesses, sale of mature international assets, pursuit of a monetization of its midstream assets, share repurchase program, and increase in stock dividend.  As such, there is no shortage of interesting and challenging work to help the company carry out its initiatives."

good,"Excellent place to begin your career.  Significant exposure to high level accounting and finance executives right from the start.  Also, helped me develop a good professional network."
good,The managers and other employees were all great to work with. Hess offers a 9/80 schedule which makes life a little easier.
good,"This place was a nightmare. Not for the typical reasons. The people working and in management were always fantastic, its the customers we often got at the location that ruined any good mood you may be in. its a gas station so I don't believe I need to say more on that matter."
good,A good company. makes sure you're trained in every aspects of the job
good,Very busy fabrication shop with a huge workload.Management was always willing to help you out when you had a problem with blueprints and were always willing to show you little tricks of the trade to increase your production i learned alot about metal fabrication.
good,"My shifts at Hess usually lasted 10 to 12 hours graveyard shift and I would usually have to return back to work anywhere from 8 to 10 hours later (sometimes as little as 7) to do another shift. The work was hard, the hours were strange, but despite all that it was the most fulfilling job I'd had in a while. It sometimes got EXTREMELY busy due to the winter season (It was located in upstate New York) when the snow plows would come through but the work was never dull, there was always something to do. The majority of my coworkers were very pleasant to be around, and the management at that location was some of the best I have had the pleasure of working with in a long time. The best part of the job was the sense of responsibility I felt while I was at work, It was up to me and another person to make sure everything was ready for the next day, since it was a 24 hour location."
good,"The position at the Long Island City was multifaceted; as you dealt with customers, managed planograms, P&L, and OSHA guidelines."
good,"I came in the morning and started baking donuts.  Preparing the coffee, hot and iced.  setting up the display case.  Making sure everything was ready for customers on time."
good,"They teach above average training for management."
good,"Great place to work,, except the weather can be very challenging in ND as it is not the greatest weather in the winters. But well worth the pay and time off between schedules"
good,"I was a cashier,counted inventory and stocked shelves and did lottery .I enjoyed the small store it was nice ,Not overwhelming and met alot of people ."
good,A typical work day was meetings and working on assigned projects. Learned a lot about Lean. My manager was very strong and willing to help. The work place culture was probably what you would find at most work place offices.
good,"Have moved to a different Corporate structure that is challenging and fun.  Direct contractors and imbedded personnel to the next work order needing to be accomplished.  Build an integrated weekly schedule and up to 90 day look aheads.  Currently, we are cleaning up our SAP system which is time consuming and tedious.  Learning new tricks in SAP and it's capabilities is the most enjoyable part of the job"
good,"People at Hess cared about helping themselves and others succeed. "
good,I worked at Hess for a season. It was a nice place to work. Sorry to see it go. My co-workers were helpful and friendly. I loved the customers I saw daily.

good,Take care of customers and incoming products. Handle cash and clean and cook. I have learned many management task here. Great coworkers.
good,"Excellent pay & benefits, management was deficient in defining expectations, co-workers were excellent, assignments were challenging, working atmosphere excellent. Opportunity for advancement, limited."
good,"Excellent learning and collaborative environment.  Recognition for job well done.  "
good,"When working at a Hess Gas Station it is all about how to treat people, from morning straight to the afternoon it is a quiet place to work, and if you are a student it is a good place to earn money while learning, the boss is a person who listen and adapts to things if anything should happen such as emergencies or personal problem. usually the duties working there are just being a cashier and making sure people are pumping gas right, also keeping the area clean of trash."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting sales goals. meeting new people. making friends. I learned alot about sales.
good,"learned how to deal with people on a one on one basis as I helped them receive the best customer service I could provide."
good,I liked the company and also enjoyed the energy business. People were very nice.
good,I worked as a cashier and did stocking when we would get our warehouse trk. in
good,Good Company
good,"Hess is a company looking to find it's way and find out how to function in the new economy. It's struggling between continuing to deliver the same consistent margin results, doing the right thing and upgrade it's aging stations and c-stores and find it's identity as an energy company, a chain of gas stations and an owner of c-stores. The later in the very bottom of it's priority and it shows in the assignment of funds for it's rusting stations, adding security systems, relocation sites to the new centers of business and traffic. As a business decision, the stations are properly ranked, with the gas and energy delivering the lions share of the profit, yet the public image of Hess remains those stations, that morning cup of coffee, that friendly face behind the counter. That advantage can not be underestimated and sometimes is. The Hess retail family are some of the hardest working people I have ever met, many having been with the company for a very long time. Many of my managers and crew were in place for a very long time. My support system above me consisted of layers of very experienced, professional people. Very seasoned, very street savvy. I learned alot about managing issues surrounding the sale of cigarettes, liquor and beer, pizza and sub sales. Extremely educational experience."
good,"I loved the fact that, you had regular customers, to whom I've built friendships with. The actual job requirements weren't stressful or hard. Loved working for them."
good,"A typical day at work was spent at a workstation, attending technical presentations and meetings.  Offsite training and partner meetings were common.  I learned wide ranging subsurface geological skills, communication and collaboration abilities and operational experience.  The position was extremely technically challenging and I excelled in many roles which delivered great pleasure and enjoyment.   Management structure was discontinuous and highly variable and the culture changed in accord.  The company company has been cash flow negative for the recent history and it effected opportunities and project funding.  As a result I was unable to achieve many of my goals."
good,"i’ve worked with the business leaders of Production Excellence, Operation Excellence, Global Change Management teams with requirements for IM systems and solutions.  As the Global Lead, my responsibilities included the roll out of the EDMS, Managed file shares migration and Managed Services.  Traveling to remote locations in North Dakota and internationally to provide onsite support and training for end users."
good,You get out of it what you put in while dealing with lots of corporate shenanigans.  Lots of people with lots of different idea's.  As long as you steer clear of the management and adhere to the rules you'll be fine.  Then you will still probably be laid off eventually.  Hess does it to everyone about once to every other year.
good,"A typical day at Hess was to fulfill my duties of coding of data utilizing the relativity platform. Interacting with supervisors and coworkers for the quality control process to facilitate accuracy & consistency of overall work product.  The workplace culture was very diverse.  I learned leadership and management skills, ability to wear multiple hats and analytical skills."
good,Flexible hours. Work a 9/80 schedule with every other Friday off.  Company is constantly going through changes.  Have had reorgs for the last 4 years.

good,"Engineers have a  very good, diversified development program"
good,"I didn't mind working for Hess, it was nice and especially during Christmas with those  Hess trucks.  Usually a fast paced job where I had to multitask between cooking and running the register, which I didn't mind.  I love to have things to do, makes a productive day.  My coworkers were nice and friendly, the management could of done a little better, but overall, it was enjoyable."
good,"A typical Day for me was hard work no play, I learned to work the cashier. Management enjoyed having me there. Co-worker if we got along great if not there was never an issue .. My job ot done.!! The Hardest part of the job was working in the snow. But I must admit I enjoyed helping customer if they had a problem with there car. and meeting new people"

good,"nice fun and very productive group of people to work with."
good,Come in stock and clean the freezer and stock area. I learned how to take inventor. I had some co-workers that were great to work with. The hardest part of the job was receiving the truck on the busiest part of the day. The most enjoyable part for me was some of my co-workers they really made the job fun. The people I got to meet were great.
good,"My job required me to manage many special projects and provide updates on a daily basis. I learned how to use SAP and Microsoft Access and enjoyed my coworkers. The most difficult part of my job was not having enough work to do, resulting in a lot of unproductive time. The most enjoyable part was learning how to use new databases and my coworkers."

good,"Managed workover, completion and abandonment projects.  Developed cost saving programs.  Trained new wellsite supervisors their roles within Hess.  Provided assistance directly to engineers.  Designing BHA assemblies and additional problem solving is the hardest but most rewarding part of the job.  Enjoyed working with co-workers, crews and the safety culture."
good,"Hess has transformed itself from what it was a decade ago in terms of senior management personnel, business strategy and operational philosophy. Very Employee friendly organization and generally every one is helpful. With recent divestitures, organization has shrunk significantly in terms of operated assets and employee base which has impacted personnel growth and development opportunities"
good,The atmosphere was not one of comradeship. Instead of being team-oriented. There were some they're intent on making others look bad by going to management and step on whoever they should that would Advance them or would cause them to receive favor. It really is bitterly competitive atmosphere.
good,I was employed by the retail convenient store side of Hess Corporation. Hess sold the entire retail end of the business to Speedway. They made sure all employees were taken care of during the sale of the company. I would still be working for Hess if they did not sell the company.

good,"Hess is a good place to work. Culture at Hess is that they believe in growing their own talents and believes in safety first. At times work can be stressful but as long as you share your work conflicts with your manager, they will give you extra assistance or time to complete your project. They are 100% supportive of sending you to training and field trips."
good,"There was a constant flow of customers purchasing anything from gas, cigarettes, lottery tickets, to hot or cold food items. There was a male and female restrooms that was cleaned  2 to 3 times per shift."
good,The company has a great culture and management team that is results oriented.  The benefits are good and the location in NYC is amazing.  The working environment is unique.

good,"A typical day at work was a fun time in itself, the staff was very friendly for the most part, and everyone was so remarkably considerate to new workers.

The hardest part of the job was when it was a holiday weekend, and there were a over amount of tasks to be done, but there wasn't as many people."
good,"My normal day consisted of nonstop customers getting gas,food,lottery, etc. This job was a little faster pace envirment due to it being a bigger store. Most of my coworkers were friendly and management was okay"

good,"Productive and a nice organization to work for , what really stand up @ HESS is the diversity of the people working for the company."

My co-workers at Hess were some of the best people in their fields that I have ever met, who I am still in touch with. They took pride in the work that they did and always did their jobs in a safe manner with the companies best interest in mind. The hardest part of the job was probably when we had to make temporary repairs due to operational time constraints and then have to go back and do the job again to make a proper fix rather than due the work correctly the first time. The most enjoyable part of the job was working for a well structured company and a great group of people and a management who made it a point to let the employees that they appreciated their hard work."

good,"Working at a gas station requires an understanding of the many regulations that will ensure your safety and that of the many customers that enter the site.  Managers must check for water levels in the the fuel tanks daily and sales associates must check the public area for hazards and cleanliness.  It is important to understand what policy states is acceptable during situations such as theft, armed robbery, fire, etc.  What may seem logical and right doesn't necessarily agree with policy.  In such instances, coordinate with your site/district manager for a compromise that secures the employees/customers and follows company policy.  What works in Florida may not work in Massachusetts."
