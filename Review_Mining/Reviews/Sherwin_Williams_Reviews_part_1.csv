bad,"Constant inventory problems"
bad,"Didn't care for the manager at all failed to train when he said he would then would go sit in the office and then would complain about my being slow because he sat down in the office instead of training made for a hostile work "
bad,They are not about empowering the employees and setting you allopathic success. They just want to pay you the least possible to do the most work and if they can keep you part time they will... absolutely no chance for advancement
bad,The cooperation as a whole was very selective to hire women but promote men. Managers were almost abusive and harassment is part of the job. No flexibility for anything and no one paid attention to your availability. Very stressful because as a closer you're always by yourself.
bad,A typical say at work  would be stocking paint supplies and running the register. I would also have to sit down with customers and try to sell them paint. I didn't receive and training so I had to teach myself.
bad,bad management poor culture very sexiest!!! not a place i would tell anyone to go work! if you are a woman you are not heard and if you care about safety work are belittled and treated badly
bad,too much favoritisms going there.  A lot of hard labor for little pay & make you work lots of weekends.  too much Politics and overall not a good company to work.
bad,Sherwin Williams is the most stressful and verbally abusing place to work if you want to work for managers that treat you like garbage then work here!
bad,"Very racist environment... And whoever reads this will do nothing about it... The mananment shows favouritism and all they care about is getting the paint out the door... This is nothing new at Sherwin William's and the old timers can attest to my words....Money was good, but the headache of racist mansngement was over the TopüíØ"
bad,"Nothing to"
bad,"Not the best place to be if you're looking for a decent work culture. The office is in a good location, but that's about where the culture ends for them."
bad,No time off often work7 days a week always wondered 6 day weeks woud tell you that you had to work Saturday on your way out Friday no time to spend with your family
bad,Very hot in the summer. Too hot. No water or any drinks on the floor on you. Must wear pants and long sleeves on top of PPE in the summer. Managers don‚Äôt care about no one except looking good in front of there bosses. People fight here like on the street. Was witness to two wild fights while here. Management did nothing about it. Matteson pays less than any other SW plant in Illinois. Machines are old and constantly breaking down. They need adjustments almost every hour from maintenance who have attitudes every time when called. This place is a joke.
bad,Upper management decides who they want to succeed. They treat some store mangers bad and fire them for no reason but let others get away with murder.i
bad,No comment about this job. Don't feel on expressing anything about this company.  There were unpleasantness between manager and employee. .I really feel uncomfortable on expressing my feelings.
bad,"High stress job, must be able to handle too many things are once. Management constantly ineffective and lazy. Issues within the company are constantly not addressed."
bad,Discrimination. Supervisor don‚Äôt now a think watch they‚Äôre doing even the hr ppl no experience at all won‚Äôt recommend anyone to work there..............................
bad,Te prometen algo que no es....sueldo muy carente ademas de ser extremadamente CUADRADOS
bad,"This company talks the talk of safety first but doesn't walk the walk. They put it's drivers thru horrible and dangerously unreasonable conditions. They condone and encourage walking large volumes of paint over unsafe and dangerous sites. The trucks are kept in unsafe conditions where as the drivers are responsible for the upkeep. They encourage walking into unsafe sites alone. The pay is unreasonable.If ever a job needed a labor union, this is it. They have no consideration for personal time. The dispatcher is located in another state and have no clue as to local driver conditions. There is little to no training. The ""Lead Driver"" I worked with was soliciting ""street workers ""for years on the job during company time with the managers full knowledge. This job is a horror show."
bad,It was ok for the time i was there but pay wasn‚Äôt enough nor enough hours.... I met a lot of great people but being in a hit warehouse was not for me .
bad,"You get vacation but not aloud to use 9 months out of the year. Management is poor, no communication, no incentives for going above standards and working your butt off just more overtime. 6 & 7  days a week usually 10-12 hours per day. No Joke."
bad,"Expects a lot out of you all the time, never appreciated, more staff would help and support from leadership would be amazing and game changing but is none existent"
bad,"One of the worst places I‚Äôve ever worked at. The location in vista you handle everything just like the manager but get paid next to $10.50 an hour after all of the money they basically take from you for ‚Äúretirement‚Äù not close to the $12 an hour they promise. No advancement possibilities, terrible coworkers, even worse customers. If you work at night you better know how to fluidly speak Spanish. Constant ‚Äúaccidents‚Äù with the cash deposit. I could go on and on."
bad,"The peekskill NY location is the worst store in the ny capital district, andre alford is the worst manager and jay hayes is a terrible district manager. I have worked by myself and being abused for the past 10 months, schedule changing last minute constantly, working lots of weekends and closings and having no support. Contractors were nasty and no one had my back. I put most of the star order away and andre never helped and always left as early as noon,1pm or 2pm. In the time I worked I have seen 3-5 ppl quit and resign and now me. I left this company and came back and I wasted my time by working in a store that is disgusting and extremely old"
bad,"The job itself do not require to much labor but don‚Äôt let that fool you, the people at Birmingham, Al plant can make the plant a living nightmare. The older employees pretty much run the plant and make the environment toxic for all the new people. They work 4 on and 4 off and it was the worse set up. You will work 96 hours but the pay is set up where you will have two 72 hour checks and two 96 hour checks. If you are looking for a real career this is not the place for you. I can‚Äôt stress how shady and low down environment was, and every new employee was ready to leave and haven‚Äôt even been a year yet."
bad,"They will have you do daily deliveries of 20 to 75 of those 5 Gallon Buckets of paint by yourself but only pay you 10 dollars an hour.  Their job contract they make you sign asks you if you can handle lifting up to 60 pounds on OCCASION but that many 5 Gallon Buckets is way more than OCCASIONAL LIFTING, I through my back out in less then a week and I was only part time. That much work is work 20 dollars minimum."
bad,"little to no training, communication is poor, management was biased and behaved in an unprofessional manner. Due to poor management many employees also conducted themselves in an unprofessional manner. there were never any plans everything was done at the spur of the moment, therefore mistakes were almost inevitable."
bad,"Poor Management, lack of security, treat customers better then employees. Over work & under pay at Sherwin Williams."
bad,"Long days, low salary, management barely paid more than parttime employees.  Senior management shows favoritism for attractive women and promotes them faster than men or more plain women."
bad,"You don't leave companies, you leave management and management in my experience with Sherwin Williams isn't something that was helpful to me. Regardless of the fact that I was over qualified for advancement and was a valuable asset, I was given weak excuse after weak excuse as to why I wasn't being promoted. 10/10 would not recommend."
bad,Ok place to work in i loved the environment and the manager was awesome ...... I really enjoyed working there especially working with paint and all the products..
bad,"Once held pride in quality products and the best service in the industry. The company appears to have improved business at the corporate level the last few years but down at where the paint is in the shaker customers are getting fewer. All efforts at the store level revolve around taking as many dollars from customers as possible. That is a wonderful business plan until repeat customers no longer visit. My investment in SW ended with a Valspar employee calling me on the phone to end my and two hundred others employment. SW buys a failing company and lets that companies employees determine my benefit to the business. ??? I was laid off as old Valspar employees that had not been in a Lowes store for weeks were allowed to now take advantage of SW benefits, better pay structure, and job advancement potential. I moved on to better employment opportunities."
bad,"√â uma empresa gigante atuante no mundo todo, por√©m com poder de decis√£o centralizada em poucas pessoas, tornando tudo muito engessado."
bad,"Its unfair that one person welcomes me for a interview followed up with 3 calls, she was female.However the male hiring person didn't feel the same..."
bad,"The contractors are rude and treat you like your their employee. Not enough time given to train. Supper old computer system and Terrible TV commercials. Lastly, the air condition system has been broken for 12 days in the middle of July, making it impossible to work in a store with no air-conditioning in Virginia summer heat. "
bad,I hate everything about the manager trainee program. It was a game and they lie to get you to work for them. this was the worst job i have ever had in my life.
bad,Not worth it. I worked for them for 10 years and it gets worse with every year that passes. I would recommend anybody to stay clear and anybody who works there to jump ship.
bad,"El trabajo es muy pesado, muy sucio todo y no dan capacitacion"
bad,"Great place for pretty people(if you are not young + good looking forget it), politics, backstabbers and those with no morals. Being a good liar will help."
bad,"I did not enjoy this job at all, conditions were awful pay was low. Not treated well as an employee which made me feel undervalued and used, I would not recommend this job to anyone"
bad,This company lacks integrity. They don't care about their employees or their customers. I would never recommend this company to anyone. I don't even recommend their products.
bad,This was a poor place to work. Management was almost non existent. No support. division went out of business locally. I would not recommend anyone to work there.
bad,"Poor management, very physical and fast-paced job. Low pay for what you are expected and have to do. Horrible scheduled hours. Constantly busy and horrible job training."
bad,"It was a terrible mistake. The manager was racist. Another employee stole from me and instead of taking action towards that coworker (that actually did no work) I got scolded an lectured about choices and got callled a ""potential terrorist"" because i was upset he wasn't going to do anything about it. Stressful work environment everyday."
bad,i was promised 28.5 hrs per week for the 3 month training period. the company never once came close to that figure. no training was provided. instead i was assigned to deliveries and freight. the hours were reduced steadily every week. the computer system to cash out customers is archaic. all in all this company really sucks !
bad,Easy learning about paint products and keeping maintenance of store. Management is very unprofessional which made workplace culture very uncomfortable. There are no real hard parts to the job.
bad,"When I first started Sherwin Williams, I really enjoyed working there. But all that quickly changed after a few short months. Sherwin Williams management treats their employees very poorly and they pay them even worse."
bad,Don't expect this company to look out for your best interests. Terrible pay for the work and awful management. You need to steer clear from working here because its not worth it.
bad,"They never pay me! They need contract a new and better personal to manager, the haven't the necessary security norms to work. "
bad,I have a fused heel and ankle I need to wear a brace thats carbon fiber it wont fit in a dress shoe Sherwin Williams told me that a running shoe wasn't professional after months of dealing with the pain I had to quit and they would not do anything to help me solve the problem.
bad,Management is very old school and compensation is low for what you are expected to do. A lot of work for little pay. Work/life balance is awful. You are expected to work all holidays except for Christmas day and Thanksgiving day. I have had to work New Years Eve and Christmas eve. Who buys paint on those days seriously. you get paid very little for a lot of knowledge. No designated lunch break they make you work right through.
bad,working in busy understaffed paint store with unrealistic expectations from upper management. only given part time associates that are unmotivated and lazy.  not a lot of incentive other than your pay check which is underpaid by every indicator .  No support and my observation and experience showed me that they only want to get warm bodies in the paint stores and after that they have no incentive nor concern for you as an employee.
bad,The night manager picks on employees if he doesn't like them he gives them a lot of robot tags to make it hard for them to make their numbers at the end of the night! He's a bully and it's not fair to others who have a family to support and lose their job because of him
bad,"The company has a high turn over rate for a good reason.  They do not train anyone,  most ""managers"" have not idea how to manage."
bad,"Desde quando entrei na empresa sherwim williams por uma empresa de terceiriza√ß√£o chamada garantia real !"
bad,"not a fan. there is a ton of pressure from upper management, way too many expectations and UN-written rules, and politics on if or when you will be promoted."
bad,"En pinturas y recubrimientos oriente distribuidor de sherwin williams en puebla, no nos dan las herramientas suficientes para trabajar y exiguen demasiado , no nos dan seguro social siendo que el supervisor tiene diabetes y el patron se enoja cuando le comentan cosas que faltan en la empresa aparte que piensa que todos le roban, en concreto mala empresa"
bad,Management just looks to make numbers. Although you might be great at what you're doing. They have incompetent people as managers not willing to help you out what so ever. Words of warning.!
bad,"Bom trabalhar"
bad,"Even when you have certification in interior design and arts degree, they still won't arrange a interview. Yes I'm leaving this review in hopes that a job you have been trying to fill for four months in grande prairie gets filled by someone who has no clue in color matching, tinting and good customer service"
bad,the environment was poor not supportive and they did not offer any training to help you succeed. I did not like management they were never available to talk or assist with any of concerns
bad,Expected me to work off the clock . Too many bosses telling too few what to do. Nasty attitudes ridiculous hours  stores never staffed had to work 12hours days ALONE
bad,"As a former employee of Sherwin-Williams I can tell you that this is not the company that you want to work for ,the managers are inexperienced bullheaded and selfish they don't like to hire in help or pay their help any money to do the jobs they are willing to set forth for you. Don't try to look for advancement at Sherwin-Williams because everything is already predetermined before you get there unless you're in the ""boys club"" !! The managers will try to backstab you and try to beat you out the door to get you fired if they don't like you. If you want freedom Sherwin-Williams is not the place for you. I strongly recommend anyone to think before working for this company. If you don't like to be talked down to and made to feel like an idiot don't work here !!!! Please don't make the same mistake I did. There is better out there !!!"
bad,"Nothing good say, long as your the right color , you fit in, good ol boys!"
bad," um dia t√≠pico de trabalho.muito corrido"
bad,Short term thinkers. Poor leadership. Systematically eliminate long term employees.
bad,"Management sucks. They say they have your back. It's all a lie. There all about corporate. Afraid to stand up for employees. Promises never come through. There's no trust . District manager is a pompous ""A"". She let me go without documentation and without a signature from me. An inceden that she claim happen 4 months earlier , I was approached 4 months after allegedly happen"
bad,"I would never recommend anyone to work there it‚Äôs ran poorly and overall a terrible place to work, machines don‚Äôt run properly, the maintenance team sucks management sucks it all sucked"
bad,"The hardest thing about this job is the way the managers take advantage of you, pay wise, working hours wise and attitude wise!"
bad,"Just typical Sherwin Williams, old code, old management style, nothing is going to change. It maybe time for the culture to be primed, and a fresh coat of paint."
bad,"Hiring recruiters, Hiring Management and Human Resources need to be on the same page with new hires and honor what‚Äôs written in the offer letter. Company lures applicants in my name and does not value any work life balance. Had a doctors appointments and requested to take time go. Human Resources states that they don‚Äôt offer generous time for their employees."
bad,"Starting from senior management in PR, the company is made up of mostly incompetent people who don't know how to run a good company. The employees are not esteemed and the staff meetings were a martyrdom. "
bad,They only give you not even a days worth of training and your by your self unless something get messed up then they want to complain about what happen and they also don't show you how to do anything correctly
bad,"They only care about business rely on point system  even if you are hurt on the job.. over worked unsafe infact over 70% of the employees are unhappy . If you're desperate for a job than it's ok but it's a revolving door. "
bad,"Work day starts at 6am to 4pm, M-F"
bad,"Terrible manager who don't know what he's talking about. He doesn't even know how to do the job I have, but yet he tells me how to do it."
bad,I was never trained I had to learn everything on my own. All the manager and assistant manager do is sit in the office and fool around. I would not recommend anyone to work at the sunset location.
bad,Not fun place to be in when your trying to find a fun and stable employment in order to be okay in this world. Sherwin williams is very u fair and does not care for part time employees
bad,The store brought in a lot of business. The name of the game was to sell as much paint as possible. Management wanted to push subcontractors to buy high-end paint products.
bad,"I learned a lot over my time with the company about coatings and customer service. Sales and interaction in store settings and in customers homes while on color consultations, however as a whole, the company does not take care of the employees. We are overworked for not enough pay, women are not given an opportunity to advance unless they hold a degree. People the have been with the company 10 plus years are overlooked for a promotion when people outside of the company with no experience whatsoever are hired right out of college, simply because they have a 4 year degree, no matter what field the degree is in. The best part of the job was some of the customers and some of the crews I worked with."
bad,"Tr√®s peu de travail car trop peu de commandes de client."
bad,"Revolving door.  long hours some management works seven days a week because there are no full time staff who are not management and part-time workers are hard to find or do not stay here for low pay and little to no incentives. "
bad,"I found Sherwin-Williams at the Career Fair at my university and began my short career with them in their Management Training Program as an MTP at first, then as Assistant Manager in a store over 100 miles from my home. I told the recruiter, who would also be my District Manager, that I had signed a contract two months earlier to purchase a home in Fort Worth and he promised I would be placed locally. "
bad,"Upper management doesn‚Äôt care about me as a person. I am only a number and I am replaceable and I have actually been told that by my plant manager! Plus no real support, like coaching or teaching."
bad,"To many cons to list. Micro-management , no fans in warehouse, drive 90 miles to get to first stop, Bad experience and let down. Hours and days are predictable but don't expect more than 26 hours per week and a bi-weekly check"
bad,Management lets dispatch lie to you without any discipline to them at all I felt working there that the drivers should have been able to stand a little bit higher than dispatch management did not care doesn‚Äôt care if you stay if you quit no matter what I decided to quit and they put down that I have bandit a load
bad,"They give a good wage to try to get people to stay, but don't bother. The three supervisors and manager are all dear friends out side of work, and if one doesn't get their way for any reason truck load orders(literal 52' trailers as in plural you have to pick in eight hours. With no help allowed from other coworkers."
bad,"If you can handle the smell of the paint fumes, then you have a job. Health and safety seem to be at the end of this company's list. Pay is NOT substantial. I learned some cool things about paint applications and stains, but that's about it. Forget about moving up with these guys, no such things as a good opportunity here."
bad,Mgmt all about micro-managing positions that are difficult and impossible to calculate by numbers alone. District mgr clueless as to what certain positions actually go through and effort required to complete job requirements
bad,"Overall they quickly advance assistant managers and store managers, less than a year in between  once customers get used to a manager being in that location you‚Äôre gone to the next. I was short staffed for three years. Everytime I had a team they‚Äôd take my assistant and allow them to move up and on which is great but with such a fast paced store I worked at, a solid trained team was needed. Would work three straight weeks with no days off because hours needed to be covered with lack of employees"
bad,"Its a great company to work with, only if you are a part time sales associate. The crazy ride to nowhere begins the moment you become an Assistant Manager. You will be doing things that make no sense and have little to no impact on growing the business. They, like any other generic corporate, say that the store is your business and you are the ones responsible for making it a success and then they ask you to step down if the business is not doing as well as they imagined while opening the store. Every sales based company works on lead generation, but they take it to next level by asking you to do anywhere between 40 to 150 lead gen phone calls every week on top of doing your daily store tasks while not giving you enough people to work with. "
bad,When you work for SW you are treated like a number. They only care about the bottom line. They don't care about their staff. I would say it was one of the worst experiences in my life.
bad,"No work life balance!! If you‚Äôre sick  prepare to work or  lose your job. only getting promoted if you‚Äôre a DM favorite/ puppet not because you work hard. Lazy management, they never want to work so they overwork and make the assistant manager do everything."
bad,Equipment Is outdated and doesn't match the docks at most locations. Forklift that don't work. They wanted me to backup on pallets. The pay is low and the driver has to load and unload with no assistance from the branch personnel even though it is their order going out. They want you to load/unload loads like 66 5gallon buckets of paint by hand.
bad,"Sherwin Williams treats drivers and counter help as replaceable and the turnover is incredible. at my store over the three years I have been there "
bad,"Being a maintenance tech here with this company, which is a household name. They promised me one shift, then put me on another, not even caring about my lifestyle. Supervisors are never on the same page. A person of color doesn't really need to waste their time here... racism shows!!!  I work very hard and I'm honest, but that goes unnoticed. A caucasian comes in and is a no call, no show and doesn't perform not even half as much as I do, but he gets a permanent position in 3 months... PEOPLE OF COLOR, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!! Money good, but not enough to deal with the modern day slave masters."
bad,"Managers are required to work a MINIMUM of 48 hours per week and are salaried to work 40 hours. Assistants are a MAXIMUM of 44 hours and they do not approve of overtime, they just expect the manager to pick up the slack without any compensation due to being salaried."
bad,"Employees in the store i worked in are honestly GREAT, but the company doesn‚Äôt offer full time work or positions even though they will tell you that you can work your way up in the company. This job is good for someone who wants to make the minimum income and work the minimum hours. Only benefit was that the hours are only Mon. - Fri. I had a great time working with the guys at wood side but just didn‚Äôt make enough money there. I was hired to be a warehouser but in all actuality I was a warehouser/delivery driver/sales associate/customer service rep/porter/and everything else under the sun."
bad,"The management is stuck in the past and is reluctant to change.  They are overrun with meetings and there is no follow through.  Items that should be addressed in 3-4 weeks take 3-4 months before they are willing to challenge manufacturing with lab results.  Manufacturing personnel are given too much autonomy and are allowed to ""reject"" paint formualations based upon their success manufacturing the product whether another similar plant can make it or not.  The research personnel do not attempt to make products that are ""manufacturing friendly"" they are only concerned with pleasing marketing."
bad,"All this company cares about is sales. You are a salesperson, no matter your title. The management has no problem leaving one person in 3 roles for months at a time. I've seen people that were there for 6 months put in charge of a retail store alone, and asked to work 55 hours a week to accomplish this."
bad,"Culture is horrible and I learned absolutely nothing. Stay clear of this company.  It is very old school, and hasn't put the resources in place for it to be successful."
bad,"They will hire anybody that is ex- military as a supervisor with no knowledge of the job ,little to no training. HR isgarbage as well. Operation manager was a young boy that didnt understand family values and the plant manager was a hot headed person walking around mad at everyone all the time. If you become permanent the pay is good,otherwise the job is terrible."
bad,"Terrible place to work. It was understaffed the entire time working there, poor training, disrepectful city and regional managers who treat you like cattle, and the pay is not good even if you are a manger working 60-70 hours a week"
bad,"I should have known when, during my interview, they asked me if my husband or father would have a problem with me working, but I was young and naive. Misogyny is the norm, and this is a hugely hostile environment for women to work in."
bad,"-A day repetitive, deteriorating body mechanics and some cases toxic environment. "
bad,"Management shows favoritism to new millenial workers and the company structure promotes those type of workers.  If you are older and have not already become a manager, no one wants to talk to you or listen."
bad,Needs improvement at the 8200 store location was unorganized and needed better management to help get the store to where it was needed smaller warehouse should be more organized
bad,Long hours no heat or air conditioning .Poor management the rules d set for company does not apply for everyone.Rules only apply when they need to for management.
bad,"District manager is a joke, made terrible decisions as he was not aware of company policies. And after making a mistake because of his lack of knowledge he was not man enough to admit he was wrong and make things right"
bad,"If you looking to be treated like nothing work here. Your pay is barely enough to gas up your car. Managment treats you like dirt if you in the retail stores. Sales representatives treat you like a slave if your In the retail store. Basically if your looking to work the retail location DON‚ÄôT. "
bad,"They don't offer raises or advancement to anybody who's isn't already in a management position. They reward poor managers who have terrible numbers while failing to retain exemplary talent. Their wages are very poor in a management track,  especially for a company that requires a business degree. Their favored tactic is to take someone fresh out of college and barely retain them for 2 years at a very low wage."
bad,I was with them for a year-and-a-half In that year I saw 10 people come and go no such thing as job security management was a joke they had one manager running to stores who was never there to do his job and they fired people for things that had nothing to do with Sherwin-Williams if you got in trouble outside of work you were fired my advice stay away from Sherwin-Williams there is no advancement no management horrible hours and it's a horrible place to work
bad,Management is more involved with Politics then actual work load.  Always understaffed no matter what store you are at.  The worst part of the job is dealing with upper management they care nothing for the employees only sales.  The most enjoyable part is the people that work in store with you they are generally good people under the same stress as everyone else.
bad,"Supervisors lack any good leadership skills. I know what good leadership looks like; 12 years in the us navy showed me. "
bad,My boss made my time there very unpleasent other then him I was on my own most of the day and was able to communicate with other workers or straight with customers.
bad,Poor training available and all you do is reports. No fun to work for this company. Management team is more interested in the value of the stock rather than giving the sales team the necessary ammunition to succeed.
bad,"I am looking to work for a company that cares about their employees, my experience has been very unexpected and I need to move on from this company,"
bad,Would not want to work for this company full time. As a consultant the people and environment was a challenge..
bad,"The culture among the customers, mainly the contractors, was extremely misogynistic and I couldn't continue there dealing with it. "
bad,N+1  incomp√©tente qui ne sait pas g√©rer . Consignes peu claires et stressantes
bad,"purtroppo in questa azienda hanno fatto la fesseria di aver assunto tanti marocchini e tutti imparentati dove si coprono a vicenda,la maggior parte sono lavativi nulla facenti!!! questa cosa ha rovinato l'immagine dell'azienda"
bad,A desarrollarme profesionalmente y como persona siempre demostrando √≠nt√©res y honestidad en todas mis actividades
bad,"people would are always worried about others, management has no clue what there doing you learn how things are done on your own miserable place to work would not recommend at all."
bad,The manager was very rude she didn‚Äôt give me the proper training and expected me to know everything she was very basis the orders and hours can be very stressful and your hours just don‚Äôt add up to your paycheck including overtime!!
bad,"At Sherwin Williams, you work for a massive company that doesnt care about you."
bad,"Poor management, HR department, and training. Absolutely no work life balance. Unstable hours, usual weeks are 6 day. Management never informed employees if they had to work  overtime during their shift uniil the last  half-hour of a shift. unfair practices when  it comes to advancement. Advancement rarely given based on job knowledge and ability, and not all internal jobs are posted but given to individuals close to management and HR representative."
bad,"No explanation needed. Shouldn't be here in the next few years. If you don't kiss there bottoms you WILL not excel no matter how well you work. Managers are terrible over-payed puppets is all. Front office manipulates every thing, the handbook, the forcing of overtime. Your basically a well paid slave."
bad,Don't really care for this place.  They might pay $20 an hr but your at work all week.  The days you have off your so tired you don't want to do anything.  If you don't mind spending all your time at work instead of with you kids or family then this is the place for you.  Wasn't for me.
bad,"Sherwin Williams is essentially the McDonald's of paint stores. Except way over priced. They teach their employees just enough to sound sound competent and then have them sell their over priced paint. Unless you are management, the pay is terrible. SW expects everything from you, but refuses to compensate you for the effort. The district manager micromanages her stores and is a complete b to her employees. Only high schoolers or college dropouts should work at Sherwin Williams."
bad,"They don't care about their regular employees, only those who qualify to be assistant managers or managers, everyone else is expendable.  They will find anyway they can to screw the regular employees over.   Only managers (people with degrees) get bonuses and trips and taken care.  Everyone else get nothing.  They will hire you for one job and when you get there say you have to train for the store and then not let you or give you the job you originally were hired for.  The only good thing about working at Sherwin as a regular employee is you get 40% off paint, not supplies just paint."
bad,I was a manager at store and I had an inexperienced assistant who was 24 yrs old and has no clue how to run a store. There upper management is a joke and they only like you if you can make them money so they can brag to other districts. The favoritism is unreal and unprofessional. They love turn over and don‚Äôt care about you unless your making them money the second you stop they‚Äôre out to get you. They try their hardest to keep you from getting unemployment at all cost even if they have to make stuff up.
bad,"This is not a good company to work for if you are seeking growth. After being there for over a year I only received a 35 cent raise. They overload you with work and do not appreciate the hard workers. The Management knows nothing about nothing, they have no idea of what is going on with the workers or the work environment."
bad,"I worked at the Birmingham Plant and it was horrible. Valspar was good. Then they hired an idiot to run the plant. The guy has no respect for anyone. He will yell in your face like he is some kind of drill instructor. The pay is OK, the benefits went down hill fast. They preach safety but they really don't care about safety. I would recommend anyone looking here to run away. Most people working there are looking to leave. They are very understaffed and it will stay that way. You can bust your butt and it will never be noticed. People aren't getting raises on time. The boss acted like it wasn't a big deal, and would not help them."
bad,Sales job. They only care about how much paint you are pushing out the door. Management always believes that the customer is always right no matter what. They have ridiculous sales expectations.
bad,"Hands down the WORST company i've ever worked for(although i'm sure there's plenty as bad). Management cared absolutely nothing about its employees. In fact, it was pretty much musical chairs with management. Extremely toxic work environment. Dead end job where the skill set didn't translate outside those walls. The pay was solid. I worked the night shift as a Paint Maker in Beltsville, MD.. I sometimes sit back reflecting  & thank GOD he rescued me outta that situation and was able to get my career back on tract. I would NEVER recommend this company or any of its products to anyone."
bad,Upper management does not care about staff employed at retail locations no matter their position. Do not follow Alberta labour standards properly when compensation for employees is concerned. No opportunity for a raise no matter how much extra you are willing to do or how flexible you are for hours. Gave me more responsibilities without giving a raise...
bad,"Not a good place to work. Very political in all aspects, promotions and even attaboys are based off of who you know and how hard you playing their games, not your merit. A typical day will involve near obsession with product knowledge, standard customer complaints, and the added drain of moving 4-500 gallons of paint two or three times throughout the day, by hand. Their is no work life balance, obsession with the company is a requirement. Management is out of touch with life on the front lines."
bad,"If you like working to forget about your sad life then SW is the place for you. Nothing like a ball and chain to keep you from experiencing life. Sure the pay is good, but it is not worth it."
bad,"In my experience, this job was the worst.  Management treats you like a number.  All they care about is how many rollers you can get out the door.  This is a ""fortune 500"" company that either can't or won't afford air conditioning and forces their employees to work in temperatures as high as 114 degrees.  I don't understand how this is even legal.. As far as advancements are concerned, only men get promoted at this site.  Management doesn't care about you AT ALL.  They lie through their teeth to get you off their back.  They have no conscience.  I would not recommend working for this company or buying their products."
bad,"If you want to work your life away on old technology out of the 60s and deal with a bunch of workers that don't care about their jobs anymore, and you have no parts and you work seven days a week with poor benefits other than the retirement. This is a fortune 500 company with over $11 billion in sales and they run it with like there a broke or in bankruptcy."
bad,Howard Street is an awful place to work. Management sucks. Equipment is very old. Poor training. Everyone I work with is looking for another job.
bad,I took this job with the understanding that I would be moving into an Ops Mgr position fairly quickly. What a joke! The store manager hated me from day 1 because she wasnt a part of my hiring and wasnt a part of that conversation. Askimg on several occasions what I was promised. Inwas pushed out the door quickly. Dont even apply here. Youll be looking for a job real quick..
bad,"Outdated, poorly maintained, old equipment, poor leadership, poor training,, decent benifits, pay a little low for area, it's a job is about all I can say for it. Employee Saftey is horrible,"
bad,"If you're a woman, don't waste your time. The whole company is a boys club who even go out of their way to make sexist rules in the work place. They have MEN running women only meetings. I worked my butt off for 3 years just for a bad assistant manager to make false claims and slander me to force me to resign, while I was on vacation."
bad,This 153 year old company has no representation of minorities in the higher roles and targeted minority management for harassment. Many felt unfulfilled under most recent management team.
bad,Place is managed by home office. The production rates are so high it's almost impossible to obtain. There is no team work it's everyone for yourself. I felt like I was at some point going to be hurt working there because the newer people cut corners to hit rate which means being unsafe. Pay and benefits are great other than that horrible place to work.
bad,This place killed a 50 year old man in my time there I watched this guy and learned a lot from him but it‚Äôs not worth all he went through to get no where . They only care about production not the employee even if you are learning disabled and provide proof .
bad,"Worked at Holland plant for over 2 years. High turnover rate for employees. No job training they put you with a person that may or may not help you . Long hours , super hot ü•µ 1st shift is really hard to get . All jobs pay the same so even if you are busting your butt off the guy texting all day doing nothing gets paid the same . No communication between shifts , no down time to fix or clean anything until something‚Äôs so bad happens they have to shut it down. Lots of employee accidents due to long hours and excessive heat . Very poor Human Resources department and management. Play favorites and bend rules for certain people and not others ."
bad,"Manager was fairly new and poorly trained me. Threw me under the bus in front of customers and was very condescending and disrespectful. The assistant manager helped me a lot, but the manager sabotaged me through very exaggerated write ups. Manager blamed his mistakes on me in front of customers and was not consistent with training or policies. Job was physically demanding and understaffed. Most stressful job I ever had. Decided to leave instead of escalating. Pay was not worth the position or the area."
bad,The company is changing. ‚ÄúDo more with less‚Äù is a big phrase being thrown around. They stretch you thin and berate you for not being able to keep up. They recently got rid of Pensions and don‚Äôt understand why tenured people are leaving.
bad,Had an accident that wasn't my fault and they started screwing with my hours and work schedule. Keep looking! You will live in your truck! !!!!!!!!!!!
bad,"I worked in a district credit office for over 10 years. The culture in the office is very male dominated. All the managers are men, all the workers are women. Management turns a blind eye to inter office conflicts which creates a hostile work environment. Women are rarely given opportunities to advance, particularly mothers. Management has an open dislike and lack of respect for the employees that work for them."
bad,"Work days were extremely long and tedious. Everybody is out to surpass your performance. No one cares to examine if something is completely right, nor safe. Very dangerous conditions, in which, to work."
bad,"the work culture is hyper masculine and i really didnt feel like i understood any of what i was selling people. unless you've done painting or deck staining in the past i really would not recommend working here... cleanliness was not at all a priority, manager nitpicked a lot of things that i did. contractors will treat you like trash if they dont know you. overall a terrible experience."
bad,"Don't get me wrong, this was not a paint store.  It was not a paint manufacturer... it was a site purchased by Sherwin.  The people left in this plant can't stand anyone hired by Sherwin.  They are used to doing very little work, and feel they are superior because they have the small company mindset.  example... It's okay to make a massive environmental mistake.  Sherwin is no mom and pop company. You have deeply cut rules for everything, However, at this site there is no training, there is only expectation. Massive favoritism, and even some risky practices going on.  I never felt valued, I never felt respected even though I'd been in my field for many years.  The Culture is to bounce management around particularly plant managers quickly.  Most don't know what they are doing from jump.  Most don't stay long enough to learn the names of the staff."
bad,no real opportunities unless you are American. in the Valspar acquisition the sherwin williams EMEA amployess have suffered from the joining. all management is now of Valspar. give it a few years before joining the company
bad,"No lunch breaks at most stores, 10-12 hour shifts are typical. Short staffed. Decent pay/benefits. Stock program was ok. Very hard work, still growing."
bad,"FOS: Full of Sht. They don't care, you won't get promoted, and they will squeeze out the last bit of life you have left. Long hours, physical labor, not such thing as a typical day, and no such thing as breaks."
bad,"co-workers in general lazy always trying to get temps to do there work, everyone is always pointing fingers and not trying to correct problem"
bad,They treat their employees terribly.  Company is constantly changing policies and not properly training or equipping staff for the changes.  Managers are given too much free reign and not held properly accountable.
bad,No chance for advancment without having a life line hard to move on up
bad,Sherwin is not a good place to work. They don‚Äôt value their employees and if you get hurt they really don‚Äôt care. They just want you to get back to work because they need their numbers. They treat their employees like machines and are very rude to them. If you don‚Äôt have a family of life it‚Äôs a great place plenty of mandatory OT all year long.
bad,I was harrassed by management after telling them I was pregnant and had no choice but to quit because I was close to losing my child due to stress. Horrible place to work.
bad,"After talking with HR and management during the interview, I left with high expectations of advancing quickly, due to my degree. Nine months later, I was still a temporary employee with no benefits. I was early to work every day. Always stayed a little longer to help clean up. Met my quota almost daily (more than most people working there). They just had no real desire to have me advance like said during interview."
bad,"Good place, bad people . I liked working there while I there. I wished the situation was in a better condition with the people currently there, but non the less I wish them all well."
bad,"This is not a company you want to work for. If you are not either a manager or an assistant manager, they could care less about your well being. This managers role is to give out pointless orders and the higher-ups expect you to follow them blindly. The starting pay is good enough to start but the MAXIMUM you can receive on a yearly appraisal is $0.40. There is nowhere for improvement or advancement in this company and it is a horrible place to work. Steer clear of this place because your quality of life will slowly deplete."
bad,"no advancement, managers heavily dictate your breaks, hostile work environment, and nepotism.  the hardest part of my job was getting through the day.  the best part was leaving."
bad,Upper management does not care about employees.   The pay is highly incintivised and annual budgets are set as to be almost impossible to achieve. Company culture encourages backstabbing and undercutting
bad,"The pay isn't worth the amount of work you do for them. Worked with a guy who claimed to do so much work but ultimately really just pawned his duties off on others and took the credit."
bad,The Baltimore Plant is one of the worst  places to work the job is stressful from the employees to Management. Do expect teamwork or to form any friendships
bad,Stores are always understaffed. Management is incompetent and upper management doesn't do much to help any of the problems. Expected to continue with all regular duties even when there's only one person who is able to complete the tasks.
bad,Really stressful place! Management is very poor!! Really hard to maintain a healthy personal life management does not care about employees at all. you will be paid good but isn't worth it and you breath in paint fumes all day not good for your health!
bad,Not a good place to work not enough hours and not enough  money no overtime and you can't move up managers are ok they get all the bonuses and the drivers get nothing
bad,"The work you like a slave and then blame everything on you when something goes wrong. Equipment not working well or up to date. HR is for corporate, not for you."
bad,doesn't tell you anything and they have a lot of lay offs. management doesn't approve of the union and does everything to under mind them. employees have no sense of job security
bad,"A typical day is mostly taking and making orders for contractors. There will be times where plenty of DIY customers come in but for the most part all business really comes from contractors."
bad,"When it comes to the office side of Sherwin Williams, there is very poor management and communication.  You are expected to know how to do your job with very little training.  The atmosphere is very chaotic, and no one seems to have a firm gasp on what they are doing.  People come in with a lot of enthusiasm, but it gradually disappears over time."
bad,"I got fired for having a spill.  The boss and lead on second shift are a joke and are total liers,  got harrassed every week.  They keep changing up the warehouse flow and process and can't keep any employees"
bad,"Sherwin Williams is a great place to work outside NYC. The company's sole purpose within the city is profit and excludes employee enjoyment and fair treatment. While many employees within the company are considerate, the management is poorly lead. I have witnessed many explosively angry individuals in positions of power in SW. Job security is fantastic, but that means these angry and frankly unhinged managers can act in deviance of corporate policy. "
bad,"Typical day of work is code"
bad,"I have worked for Sherwin-Williams for over 10 years.  when obamacare rolled out, they cut us all down to 28 hours per week, to avoid paying our health insurance.  When I was forced to get a second job to pay my bills, i could only work at sherwin on weekends.   Since I was no longer working 20 hours a week, they took away all my vacation time."
bad,"the job is cool, but you better have a degree if you ever want to advance in the company. No degree and you will get no where fast in this company. They give anyone with the degree a position first, Even when your skill set is better. Basically the people without the degrees train their soon to be managers and assistants. Pay sucks, hard work wont pay off. You will break your back for dirt pay while the management gets all the pay and bonuses while you do all the work they take credit for. Pretty disappointing really. They do not take care of the employees without a degree. I will continue to look for new employment."
bad,My main compliant here is that the pay is horrible and even if you move up it doesn't get much better. Stay Away!
bad,Sherwin Williams is a good job the drivers should get full-time hours with full time pay the hours are flexabile. culture Is great positive thing is meeting people
bad,"Nothing "
bad,Store manager is fantastic and runs the store great but upper management could care less about the employees that are hourly they don‚Äôt care about you they don‚Äôt care about your life you‚Äôre just there in dispensable to them
bad,I worked 95% from start to finish being employed at Sherwin Williams. Maybe 2 days off in a month. Lied to about getting the weekends off & being with ones that matter to me.
bad,Everyone else is just a number and chesspiece. Middle managers have it the hardest because they have to look the employee in the eye while doing upper managements dirty work to protect the shareholders. All about the shareholder and stock price.
bad,"Great job, but could not enjoy the job because there was little to no training. Job is very detailed, and without proper training you will make a LOT OF CRUCIAL MISTAKES"
bad,"The workers are Great but management really needs alot of work. HR dosent help you out. All Office people stick together and its a On your own situation. "
bad,"Key holder and full timer for years. $14 an hour while they bring in 10+ college graduates who know absolutely nothing at $19+. Working 10+ days in a row, 9 hour days. Under staffed because they won‚Äôt pay anyone livable wage. You will go from part time to full time if your lucky but you will never grow from there without a degree."
bad,"If they restructure and need to reduce people they will never lay anyone off ,they will harass the person calling them on Christmas Eve with some stupid demand for example or something like that. They will do anything to be able to say they don't terminate people. Also if  you supported Barrack Obama you better keep your mouth shout because even the CEO makes it quite clear hes a republican. Do yourself a favor and stay clear of this company."
bad,"This company is only for certain people, myself and my brother have worked for the company and they favor non blacks way more here, if your a minority you will be treated like your still working in the cotton fields! Only work here if you have no other choice but you will regret it if your a minority!!"
bad,"Fun place to work but not much training, Learn as you go mostly. Nice people but the group i worked with smoked a lot of weed. I didn't learn much more of what not to do on training someone."
bad,I worked as a delivery driver for over a year at sherwin williams. For the most part its a pretty chill job but the hours suck and the work is hard. You will mess up your back and they dont really care.
bad,All about making your numbers and quota for the day while picking. Physical job so if you arent prepared youll be in for a rude awakening. Safety was number 1.
bad,"Fast paced and good place to work. They had good pay..You could learn different jobs in this company, so there was room for advancement."
bad,mixing and driving paint. Learned about paint. Great mamnagement and co workers. Hardest part opf the job was store owners and most enjoyable was driving.
bad,"Com a alta nas vendas, o dia de trabalho √© corrido."
bad,The employees that I had to work with were subpar.  My impression of my daily duties were unclear as a manager.  It was more like manual labor where I had to pick up large 5 gallon buckets of paint and it hurt my back.  I don't recommend being an Assistant manager here or a trainee.
bad,"Trato agradable"
bad,the manager was not available and left me to train and run the store without recieving pay
bad,"start work 730 a.m. sell, organize orders and deliver paint supplies to DIY and commercial sites."
bad,Good option of hours but the work is a lot harder than explained to you in the interview  I came home from work in pain every day  you are exposed to a lot of fumes that cause headaches constantly
bad,"Overall my experience was pretty bad, the right doesn't know what the left is doing. Management treats people like they're replaceable. And if you complain they hear you out but then nothing changes."
bad,"I worked there for 4 years, Planned to retire there, Until everytime my store got a new manager I had to work with that persons particular ethic.. Did not matter to his boss if he was not paying my holiday pays, or keeping me from getting vacation pay using excuses like I did not maintain certain amount of hours to get vacation pay."
bad,"Credit management staff is always playing 2nd fiddle to the sales staff. Many poor decisions made knowing that there was no credit - or in some cases, legal - basis."
bad,No flexibility at all and you are constantly micro managed.  The pay per hour is ridiculous.  Most people work two jobs to make ends meet. The management is poor quality - they only care about numbers.  They hire a lot of temps and there are constantly people leaving and then they hire temps and it starts all over again.  They don't believe in respect if you do something wrong they scold you like you were 12 years old.
bad,It was ok for part time work. Hours were flexible. People were nice. Customers were the best part of the job. Good training was provided. Only con was FT not an option.
bad,"Typical manufacturing environment hot and fast paced. Coworkers are good, training is ok, vacation and sick pay is nice. Healthcare coverage is good and holidays off are great"
bad,"Very poorly run Sherwin location "
bad,"Not the greatest job held, but the work experience was pretty beneficial. The biggest pro about working with Sherwin-Williams is that the stores close by 6-7pm."
bad,Es una gran empresa pero los inversionistas son lo que no administran bien su negocio falta de apoyo laboral
bad,"Sherwin Williams can care less about their employees.  It's all about how much paint they can get out in a matter of minutes.  Employees nor family values are look upon nor valued. Racism is prevalent."
bad,"I didnt much like this job. the people were set in thier ways, and it appeared no room for growth. they found out I was in College, and treated me differntly."
bad,"difficult staffing, frequent turnover of co-workers"
bad,The staff is good and the management team is alright they act like they care but really they only care about them self‚Äôs there vehicles are always breaking down
bad,"Management will say they care about your safety and well being but at the end of the day it IS about the output of production."
bad,"Working here is definitely a reminder of how racism is over looked! Individuals use the ‚ÄúN‚Äù word as if it isn‚Äôt offensive. And Management was informed, but did not proceed with proper procedures to enforce punishment!! As a matter of fact they are still employed there!"
bad,"This company does not present the best opportunities for career advancement, the salary is not the best(depends on where you're located for bonuses that can make your salary great). Supervision/management is not great, company morale starts from the top and its not great."
bad,"My experience with SW was that if you were good at your job, you got to do extra work without extra pay or appreciation. Management for some employees was very strict, others not at all. No bonus and very minimal 2-3% yearly salary increase if you were lucky. Not flexible for family/sick time. Yearly reviews were very formal and not necessarily helpful. The overall workplace culture was depressing and demanding for hard workers/certain employees. The building itself needs serious upgrades. It is dark, damp, musty, heating/cooling issues and no real sunlight in most areas."
bad,All about the company!  It‚Äôs like a  revolving door at the company .  Morale is very low at this company. People are scared to speak out.  If you do your gone! Work life balance is horrible.
bad,"Skills, training and experience matter less than if you are well liked.  Nepotism is rampant and friendships are valued more than doing the right thing."
bad,Extremely stressful and underpaid. To get anywhere you need a 4 year degree and a good pair of akl's. Advancement is limited and environment is stressful.
bad,"Short term sherwin williams is good if you go to school. But they will take advantage of you if you are willing go out the way for them. If you are not a manager or a sales rep you are not an asset to the company. Most people leave sherwin because of the unappreciation from upper management. I have had great managers who are older sherwin williams employees before but todays generation of young management are lazy and imcompetent, I am surprised some people even get hired as managers. Do not fall for anything upper management tells you get everything in writing."
bad,"Overworked. Pay is not bad but burn out is high. You get to a point in your life where you say the money is not worth it. If you want to experience what it feels like to work in a China child labor factory, this place is for you."
bad,I would definitely give it a 5 star rating if there was more people of color working for the company in the northeast Ohio area... HR lady out of Strongsville Ohio is a racist and will find a way not to hire a person of color... she makes the final decision....
bad,Lack of advancement. Have been their five years and have requested several times to be promoted to a management position.
bad,"They have company policies in place but never stuck to them. Having the schedule be made a week before the new work period and expecting the employees to just go with it, especially after multiple complaints by the staff to the District manager, the employees were ultimately disciplined. Leaving when they want, and never followed protocol. Lots of contractors don‚Äôt deal with Sherwin and have moved onto Benjamin Moore because of Sherwin unfair policies and practices. Poor management and sales tactics. Management only wants to benefit themselves but often the part time employees are often blamed."
bad,"Thankless, high-stress job that has zero work-life balance. The culture is toxic and I wouldn't recommend employment to my worst enemy. Pay is decent when you look at the number; then you realize you're working 60 hours a week to attain it rather than 40."
bad,trabajo dentro de todo tranquilo con 15 empleados dentro de todo muy buen trato con las personas
bad,"I gave sherwin williams a year of my life as a dedicated employee. I worked as a delivery driver, the people who dispatched me were rude and had no idea what traffic was like being that dispatch is thousands of miles away. I was the face of the company as a delivery driver, i risked my life driving hazmat loads in bay area traffic, yet they could not even pay me enough to make rent. You can do better for yourself."
bad,"This place has inexperienced management. No sense of camaraderie. People are always worried about getting in trouble. I wouldn't recommend it. About five years ago yes, but now, no."
bad,"Typically I begin the day off by fronting all of the items in the store to ensure if not that atleast our store is presented to be full. I then fill the tinter station so if we happen to get involved in a rush we want have to stop in the middle of an order to refill it. Then i stock and organize the front as well as the warehouse trying to utilize all free time. Help customers, make deliveries, apply payments to accounts and make suggestions as necessary. I've learned alot that i can use in my own personal endeavors wish is the most enjoyable part of my job. Only thing i feel is a problem is racial tension that tends to be overlooked if allowed."
bad,This job was one that does not slow down. It was refreshing in the beginning to learn so many different things that were necessary to do the job well.
bad,In my experience they lacked staff and poorly trained the staff they did have. Not a good place to be if you want to move up. Decent starter job however.
bad,I was there for six years and in the beginning the training was good. Then they went to 24 hours and everything changed. you felt like you were part of a machine they would push you hours overtime never fix the machines which is not safe for people. New management came in and to get a feather in their hat they pushed us more it was a terrible environment I'm so glad I'm not there
bad,"Being assigned to afternoons, I did more warehouse work than driving.  Every store's warehouse section that I observed was over crowed."
bad,"poor mangers. They average 29 years old. No experience with dealing with empolies . If your not a kiss good luck.  Lack in safety. Talk about safety bring something up and you get a nasty eye. Dismiss your opinion."
bad,I worked there for 14 years and it steadily got progressively worse from year to year.  the pay and benefits are alright but you work hard on a difficult production system. There is a lot of mandatory overtime including weekends.  Expect 12 hour work days from the end of March till the middle of October with Saturday work required regularly.
bad,"It‚Äôs fun for the first 3 months, then before you realize you have sold your soul, your trapped."
bad,"This review is mainly the location at which I worked. My manager was condescending. Very fast paced and stressful, with no breaks. Physically demanding."
bad,Constantly looked over for promotion and current manager does not help with training.  Not enough employees to cover shifts and no overtime offered to help cover shifts
bad,"The store managers will make or break your career."
bad,"Expected to travel during non-work hours with little flexibility. Additional compensation was not offered for employees that had higher rate of travel, nor were Supervisors understanding of difficulties presented by such travel"
bad,Worked their 18 years. Management only cares about money in their pocket and that goes all the way up the ladder. They choose to practice unsafe work habits.
bad,"people would cut each others throat. an abundance of back biting. salaries were low, which is why i left when Duron called and offeres me a job. Management was only concerned about getting bonuses rather than trying to held the people under them"
bad,"I enjoyed my time with the company until I became a store manager.  District leadership was a joke, especially the city manager.  Be willing to give up a lot of time to the company, because they expect more from you then you can accomplish in one day."
bad,"I  worked at a commercial store and stayed very busy most days, but the management system was absolutely disorganized and too many co-workers that were full time acted as manager and often went against what another employee may have said. There was not a good teaching system for new employees and not a lot of room for advancement or full time positions. If you were a part time underdog employee you often got pushed around with lack of help of full time employees with experience. This job made many of my co-workers along with me feel absolutely incapable of having confidence with what we were doing at this job. They were however good about sick days and there were a few sales reps that were helpful."
bad,Does not use employees for their full potential. Undergoing restructure and has cut many positions. Not great pay/benefits for the job. Each site is usually understaffed an people move around too fast. Must move for promotions.
bad,"Great Sales Culture."
bad,As long as you can act like a doormat for customers you will do great. Most of the managers only care about making sure they keep the customers and could care less how the customers treat you. The pay is a joke for the work and the managers are the only ones that get any type of bonus which is ridiculous. How are the managers the only ones that receive bonuses or receive any kind of training with all expense paid mini vacations when the employees that help make the company can't even get a Christmas bonus or a decent raise.
bad,"very bad management"
bad,Helping costumers with color selections and sales. Also helped with store up-keep. Management was nice about flexible hours but otherwise hard to deal with.
bad,Been with Sherwin Williams for 7 years now.  Have done everything that they have asked me to do and have applied for promotions recently and I have been past over for someone right out of college. I understand the importance of a college degree just don't know how someone can run a store with not being there for more that a couple of months. 
bad,Lost's to do that does not involve what you should be doing too much emphasis on calling and harassing people for business you become an active algorithm
bad,Warehouse was unorganized turn over rate was high it made no sense. Then they want to rush you always complaining it was never enough even when you caught up. Just a bad experience job was easy but just the people
bad,"It was a very nice job, laid back, but the hours are horrendous, Part-timers cant get any hours, not sure if that is company wide or just were I worked."
bad,"Sales goals are difficult to surpass while given part time efforts from younger high school students. SHW acquired Valspar due to a greedy CEO and it caused the company to focus on raising prices while cutting higher salaried employees at the store level. Very poor management decision to promote personnel who fits their agenda and liking rather than the well performed employee seeking new opportunities. Being with daily customers is what I missed most. However, dealing with the attitudes of part time employees and their lack of motivation was aggravating."
bad,"Working at Sherwin Williams is not easy, as you are expected to do the work for several people if your store is low on staff (without extra pay). Sometimes you have to be there for 12 hours or more depending on the work situation. Upper management is only worried about profit and not about the work culture they are harboring with their neglection of issues their stores could have."
bad,"The job just isnt for me, management isnt great and the turnover rate is way to high. flexible hours but the job doesnt pay well for the amount of work you do and you have to do things way outside your job description"
bad,Automotive division. Product failures on a regular basis was the norm. It got so bad Management w trying to coverup the the defective products they were selling to customers. They blame it on the application process so they wouldn‚Äôt have to warranty the problem. I haven‚Äôt had a product that worked consistently in the 20 years I have worked here. Good 401k program and benefits. Not great pay.
bad,"Management does not really cares about production needs."
bad,a typical day at work here requires you to lift and move gallons of merchandise all day long on top of them requiring you to retain their professional accounts and do cold calls to encourage new accounts be opened. The training is extensive but so is the turnover rate due to corporate not changing out old managers at a store level. They are not interested in learning any new ways to run a business.
bad,"10 years ago it was about good products, great service, and good looking stores. The relationship with customers mattered. SW keeps getting bigger and bigger and going away from it. We are transitioning to a box store mentality where everyone is replaceable, but we work in a technical field where you cant just plug someone in after someone with 5+ years leaves. It doesnt make sense to us on ground level but the corporate offices dont care as they are only worried about the stock price.  It is all about the ""What have you done for me lately?"" mindset.  A lot of number shading and checkbox mentality going on.  Its not about being good at your job anymore."
bad,Worked there for 4 years and enjoyed the first 2. Original pay for the time was pretty good for a young guy back from training. First years raise was solid. Management was talented and worked myself and my coworkers to create a balanced and team focused work environment. Overtime things from the Top down focused more on profit margins and sales goals and the appreciate for workers lessened. Eventually new managers were less focused on working with and creating a good work environment and instead focused on store profit as sole focus. I understand that profits matter for business but disagreed with the change in mentality towards work and management and was let go. Do not recommend this company to anyone.
bad,"Not enough staff!  Glass ceiling, young an ambitious? you have to wait and gain ""experience"" by then you get burned by the monotonous work and heavy work, If your plan was to move into corporate good luck, you will either be a manager or sales rep for a very long time."
bad,es una empresa de principios pero mal administrada
bad,DO NOT WORK FOR THIS COMPANY.  I work for the warehouse side of the business and they will work you to death.  Don't get me wrong I do like having some overtime but they will mandate you everyday plus saturday if they can.
bad,"Management that doesn't have any idea what we do in our department. Low salaries and yearly redundancies. No teamwork from other departments, HR doesn't listen to their people and the issues in the work place"
bad,This was a temp job it was supposed to last a month was promised a 1000 dollar bonus if I lasted a month. Job was cut short for lack of product. Never got my 1000 dollar bonus because job was cut short. Would not recommend unless you are looking for quick work.
bad,"Valspar was probably one of the best companies I‚Äôve ever worked for, when Sherwin Williams took over I immediately started to looking for another job, Sherwin Williams cares about their stock holders and their bottom line not their employees, I‚Äôve seen them layoff employees that had been with them for over over 15 years without thinking about it twice, the expectations of their employees are unrealistic, there is no work and personal life balance because the stress of performing at an acceptable level will be in the back of your mind from the moment you wake up till the moment you go to bed."
bad,"It was an average job, with average pay and average co workers. Its mostly seasonal, busy in the summer, very slow in the winter. The painters/customers were nice."
bad,Maybe I just had a bad manager but working at Sherwin was extremely cut throat which is why I left.  The employees are nice but the managers (at least mine) was terrible.  As an IT worker it was very clear that we were expenses.
bad,"Was supposed to have 2 weeks of training was thrown on the floor tinting paint the first day on the job, mistinted paint and got it all over my brand new clothes the first day. Management was not very open to listening to employee concerns. would not reccomend"
bad,The routing for delivery drivers isn't very oragized. Could use cross training for slow times that way drivers can help in the shop if needed. Most of the people are great to be around and fun to work with.
bad,"Very tough for the lower employees such as the sales associates.. upper management needs a revamp for sure. Needs to be more people in the store to help out, because it does get busy and its quite tough to do it alone... especially if you're a sales associate."
bad,"Honestly everything about it sucked, the usual customers were rude, my co workers were rude, especially the manager, and not cooperative they barely tought me anything about paint, and the pay isn't that good either, I would recommend looking for another besides this dump"
bad,"Benefits are ok, although health insurance could be better. They have Aetna."
bad,"My day normally starts out with me making coffee, purging machinery, and opening POS systems 1 and 2. I take on an array of challenges everyday that consists of colors, problems, and specifications. An example for colors would be which color contrasts with a certain color, and questions such as, ""why does this color look different at my house?"" An example of problems would be answering questions about different products we have to fix issues a DIY or contractor may have. An example of specifications would be answering questions about how one product would be better than another. ""What are pros and cons of this floor product compared to another floor product."" My co-workers are good people, but not very dependable. In the paint business you have to know your products to help customers with their daily needs. The hardest part of my job is picking up where another worker has left off. The most enjoyable part of my job is explaining products to customers and receiving positive feedback. One must be dedicated to do well in business and even then you may be overlooked constantly."
bad,"Was terminated for having diabetes. Loved my job and begged to be able to stay. But since I was diagnosed with diabetes,I was no longer worth being employed."
bad,"There‚Äôs good employees working at Sherwin-Williams in the stores,district management seems more concerned with advancing their own careers ."
bad,The job was great until I had a slip and fall and then they fired me because of the slip and fall and then the doctor told me that I could return to work but they said that they had let me go
bad,"Overall the job began flexible and worked within limits without issue.They worked with me when I had a baby while employed there and also when there was an issue it was tried to be worked around as best as possible. After certain things got switched around with people coming and leaving location and employment the environment changed for the worse. With being strung along with opportunity and underestimated in my capabilities, as time went on it became less flexible and more of a chore for the drive I had. With almost and hour drive coming in for 4 days for 5 hours at a time and getting time taken away from my family when I could have worked 2 days and been fine. And that only didn't work because I wasn't going to allow to be stuck working weekends forever  with no end in sight. Also with being stepped over for someone less experienced than you in your field is very unsettling also, especially when your teaching them their job and the only reason they got the promotion was because they had a degree. Not because they were experienced enough for the occupation. Management has no say in their assistant manager even though they run the location individually."
bad,"management have no idear how to run a warehouse "
bad,"Management is very unprofessional, people spread rumors like it's high school, and bad training. The turn over rate is ridiculous. Can't keep new hires due to lack of training."
bad,"if you are a good worker with great work ethic, avoid this company like the plague!!!! you will not receive raises as promised and you will be over worked and then skipped out on paying for the extra hours worked."
bad,"unprofessional it was not the place to be alone which they did often. they didn't wait for you to learn the products they make u learn on the fly, telling guests what u can remember"
bad,"The management is terrible at all levels and they practice excessive favoritism. If you work at a store that clears 2 million a year you'll have all the hours you need, support from higher up and pays on the back all around. If you work at a store that makes 1.8 million a year then you get 1 part time employee who both have to work as little as possible, and 2 managers who are required to work 50+ before getting OT. They hire people for management positions based on friendships and familiarity not qualifications. Oh and they say occasional lifting up to 50lbs, but a 5 gallon bucket of paint weighs minimum 55lbs, and can go up to 100 for the specialty products. One week I had to put away approximately 3500lbs of freight, by myself, with no lifting brace and while having to help customers as well. You'll have to do cold calls if you have a key too which is awkward if you're not multilingual. All in all, if you get a good location, a good manager, and being into crossfit is a plus, then you might have a good experience there. But in my experience 90% of my coworkers from my store, and nearby stores I was in contact with regularly, strongly disliked working there."
bad,supervisors and management are all friends who are two faced. Complete high school atmosphere. Expectations far exceed job title. Zero work life balance working 6 days a week and always on overtime. Air health is horrid causing employees to have medical problems. If you never want to see family or have time off you‚Äôll be a great fit.
bad,"There is no diversity within Sherwin Williams. The company consistently hires African American employees ahead of other candidates. Including Caucasian,  Hispanic,  Asian and other ethnicities. For every two whites or Hispanics hired 7-8 African Americans are hired. In management also. Recently"
bad,"Como gerente de tienda, me daban las tiendas con poca venta y ya cuando las ventas eran mayor al presupuesto me quitaban la tienda para poner a los consentido y les llegara a ellos el bono"
bad,"Management prioritizes profits over all else, leading to a culture of extreme competition between sales reps and at times questionable ethical practices."
bad,"Company is too political more concerned with production than the employees training and wellbeing, they treat you as a number, and not as a person mostly derives from a push from the top and managers who have no back bone, and rather push the employee rather than take time to train. In manufacturing it usually safety, quality and production, but all they push is production, and only address the other too when something goes wrong then it back to the push.!!"
bad,"I wouldnt say dont work there, but if so make sure they train you on everything needed to know, the pay is good but the chemicals are strong and sometimes faint but deadly everyday thing be cautious and safe  you know what you can handle and cant"
bad,"Sherwin Williams had everything I was looking for after I graduate college, great benefits, competitive pay for Managers, and tuition assistance. Once I became acclimated in the position as an assistant manager it was easy to see  some of the problem within the company. Many if not all of the stores in the area were short staff, mostly due to the pay rate. Part time staff was minimal and hard to find. Pay rates were not comparable to that of the market. Due to this problem the managers  and assistant managers had to pick up the extra hours. As Assistant you were only paid time and a half for 40-48 hours, after 48 it went back to your standard hourly rate. "
bad,"I enjoyed the team atmosphere and people I worked with.  That being said, I was overworked and ended up being responsible for 5 other jobs than just mixing paint and dealing with customers.  I also was performing managerial duties without managerial pay.  I applied for an assistant manager position but a person with no experience and a college degree was chosen over rne.  I gave the company a year and a half of my time and effort with nothing to show for it.  It left me disheartened and discouraged.  I left the company when I realized they didn't appreciate my outstanding performance and potential to grow."
bad,Upper management and HR have an agenda for who to hire and promote. Staff with many years experience are overlooked and when you try to speak to someone at HR they go behind your back and tell your supervisor.
bad,"For Sherwin Williams, it seem to depend on what store you end up working at. My first store was great. After i transferred for more hours. The management was much worse"
bad,"Long hours and very short staffed. Constant learning considering new products and new customers. Upper management was great. The hardest part of the job was the lack of life/work balance."
bad,"watch lines, transport materials to and from warehouse to and from lines, dig out materials and then put back the stuff in front of what you  need, dirty"
bad,"The culture at Sherwin Williams was extremely negative and intense. If you have a positive or bubbly attitude, this is not the company for you. Some managers were okay and others would do anything to make you work in solitude so you did not converse with peers. Pretty miserable for a retail setting where typically sociable people are recruited to join the team so that they can make the customers feel comfortable and welcomed."
bad,"Sherwin-Williams has no concept of work-life balance. They expect you to constantly be available at their beck and call (or a customer's). Their low compensation does not outweigh this enormous con of the company. They do not pay fairly considering all the time their employees dedicate to the company. If you work in a store, you do not receive any special trainings or feel valued for your contributions. You are the one who interacts with their customers (aka you are the one who gets the sales for the company) everyday, but they do not pay you accordingly. Employees who interact with customers are some of the most important but the company does not actually reward them or value them like this."
bad,"Its all about 1 thing. If you are willing to move around the COUNTRY, their is great opportunity for you. If not, they will use you and spit you out. You are just a number who is training your replacement."
bad,ok place to work and use you skills. your mind is not challenged everyday and the culture is balanced daily. the people  is the best  thing about this job.
bad,Wasn't offered any training or developmental plan to grow within company. No focus on younger sales associates with potential. Only benefit was learning how to work with sales management software.
bad,"The multitasking skills requirement is no joke! "
bad,Decent job got to travel a lot and met different people in various locations and businesses. This is a good part time job unless you can get into the management
bad,"If you like paint, go for it. The job is not for a college graduate. Its for individuals who work their way up. You will feel extremely over qualified will working the position. Will also work long weekends of 10+ hour shifts some weekends"
bad,"Sherwin Williams was just a passing through to me. I met some amazing people who worked there and became close friends with some of my coworkers. However, it's just a day job with not much room to advance."
bad,"Good benefits, easy to learn, hard and heavy lifting. Several different shift options. Paid holidays and vacation days, annual pay raises and possibility of bonuses throughout the year."
bad,Job was stressful. A lot of micromanaging. Always want you to do more with less. Limited employees for store do your work week can be inconsistent. A lot of favoritism in my district. It was good to start with but the work environment in store is rough on the body and not healthy. Great to start out with but I would not want to do it forever. Most careers stop at sales rep.
bad,Organization has lost it's identity and forgot what made it great.  Employees that built the company through hard work and dedication were no longer necessary once Valspar came onboard.
bad,working at a retail store was fine problem is no full time positions. working at the district warehouse was a lot of being taken advantage of for the have to stay late and get things done because I didn't have any kids. people with out kids get the short end of the stick.
bad,"Didn‚Äôt see myself moving up in the company until THEY needed me to take a position (although position I applied for)"
bad,"management can help make or break your advancement. they train you to do the basics and expect you to somehow have all the other knowledge with out training."
bad,"At one point ran a store as key holder for 3 months, after manager and assistant manager quit. Promised promotion and went for 5 different store interviews and got none. Never compensated me for my loyal work. Worked 14 straight days once, with an entire weekend by myself."
bad,The company has good benefits but recently they just told employees that the Beltsville plant was relocating in 2019 and after that  management began to get cut throat towards employees to prevent playing lay off packages to the employee's. Through my 2 years I was never written up or on any probation and I witness multiple employees cost SW a loss in profit from recalls and distress batches but now that they are relocating 1 mistake and you are out the door no matter what the allegations are. The overall culture was bad and most employees was not engage with job and had very bad cleaning habits throughout the plant one of the main reasons of the relocation and the lost in profit from employees mistakes.
bad,"Recent college graduates, do your self a favor by avoiding Sherwin-Williams Manager/Sales Rep Training program. Upper management does not promote based on performance. They promote based on favoritism and race. Good ol boy system."
bad,Sherwin Williams places a lot of un-needed stress on employees. Management is expected to reach in-obtainable goals and work 48 hours per week. Upper management are cookie cutter executive types with no understanding of how the business is actually run.
bad,"The company is okay to work for but this company shows favoritism to other employees and based on that that is how an employee can be promoted. Managers act as though there your best friend but be careful because they are documenting your every move. Don't trust this company. There are sneaky and do things that are unethical, trust me I been through it several times. Don't apply!"
bad,i join this company when they are newly setup in Malaysia. so they have many space for improvement. however they are giving 13 month salary and good entitlement for medical benefit.
bad,"It's a fine job for a young person, but don't get stuck there.  Get out as soon as you can.  They overwork and pay as little as possible, no surprise."
bad,"Job was alright, very repetitive, management was the worst. Workers are not appreciated at all, and no recognition is given ever. Greatest thing I ever did was leave."
bad,All about the numbers and their profit margin sacrificing the quality of the job. The management side of the store will out-trump the salesman and the salesman held accountable.
bad,"I had worked for Sherwin Williams for 2 years and had nothing but trouble.  The Management lies constantly to you buy dangling career advancements in your face and telling you that you need to do certain tasks to get those positions.  Once you've over work yourself to complete the tasks given, the job opportunity never happens.  They will hire an unqualified employee above you (for the same position you've applied for) and then you will have to train that person. In my experience the company never told any of the interview candidates that they did not receive a position, you would just see the new employee start working in your store and it created a lot of hostility towards the new co worker.   The Management of the store I was in would be too open with customers and they would let the customers know the inside operations of the business as well as information about employees work behavior and personal life.  The contractors at Sherwin were way to involved in the company ""Drama"" and ""Politics"" it is like nothing I have ever seen before.  After leaving Sherwin Williams I still to this day hear false rumors being spread about me by the store Management, members or the Sales Team and other Store Employees.  The Management has the team brain washed into thinking something that is far from the truth.  If you ever going to apply for this company all I have to say is Good Luck or RUN as fast as you can.  I'm glad I had left this company when I did."
bad,At the location i worked at it was very hostile and high tempered place due to the management team. After clocking in i would immediately figure out what orders or things were screwed up the day prior to fix before the customer would come to pick up their orders. This placed a lot of pressure on me and painted the day in a bad color. From that point i would try and assist the warehouse workers fill any back orders. The warehouse workers didn't have the best attitudes to deal with. This would continue through out the whole day which gave me a great dissatisfaction for my job.
bad,"SW used to be a great place to work, since current management stepped in it is awful!  Used to be a 10 hr day, now it's either 11 or 12.  Management will not listen to anything the employees have to say, it's either their way or no way at all.  Picking is a terrible job.  The only good part of the job are the employees."
bad,"Is heavy lifting, a stressful place, no great medical benefits, management is political and systematical, co-workers are just out of motivation, really they need a better job culture."
bad,"Good benefits"
bad,"Customer service helping contractors in the early morning getting their day started and retail customers throughout the day.  Mixing paint, matching paint, answering customers questions about the different products in store, accounts payable, accounts receivable.  Hardest part of job is being able to match anything spot on whether it be paint or stain.  The most enjoyable part of the job is learning about all the products and the different qualities of paint."
bad,"stated 6-6:30 morning non stop until 2-2:30 dealt with a non compliant coworker wh played rather than worked, dealt with customers on repairs and ordering parts,ordered parts for stock,"
bad,The work is very much labor and customer service. You have to learn what clients want and look their account up in the computer and make sure it is correct then mix and fill their ordered paints.
bad,"This company only wants robots! Don‚Äôt become a robot. The turnover in Canada is outrageous, only the most dedicated or desperate stay. I had five home store managers and five different sales managers in 6 years. Check out the turnover rate of TMPs, I certainly lost count."
bad,They expect you to pick everyone else's slack and then tell at you for working too much they also create an environment where everyone is constantly over worked and stressed out
bad,"Not a good place to work especially if you are looking for a career in that workplace. The opportunity to grow within the company is hard and the management does not care about you, instead they criticize on if you dont get something."
bad,"Management is poor, almost impossible to fire anyone within the company, which attracts poor employee's. Hours are long and include weekends. Always understaffed, and pin other stores against each other with the bonus structure."
bad,"In summer, you can expect to work an average of 60 hours a week. They won't tell you if you are mandatory Saturday until half way through your shift Friday night."
bad,"Too many issues with apathy from workers on up through management.  Poor quality and lack of equipment, and what is there is often in some need of repair."
bad,"Some customers are cool, but most were rude and condescending. I would have stayed longer but management was ubstable, one supervisor made idle threats and the other smoked weed before shift and did nothing all day."
bad,"It's a decent starter job. Very physical with little room for advancement. There is no real intellectual challenge, it gets boring. If you can handle listening to people complain constantly then this is the job for you."
bad,Worked a lot of hours and it is a very toxic environment with chemicals. They changed my shift while working there and it was not conducive to my family lifestyle
bad,"A typical day at work involved doing tasks for four different people, in four different departments. I learned a lot, as it was my first corporate job, like learning voice mail (I was very shy in the beginning). Management was generally supportive, with few exceptions. My direct supervisors were great. The workplace culture at first seemed open and friendy, but morale dropped suddenly after about a year. Parties stopped, celebrations stopped. Hardest part of the job was that I was the only one with computer that worked on DOS, but I spent a lot of time teaching others to use their new windows computers, having worked on one since I was 8 years old. The most enjoyable part of the job was creating reports for my bosses (and their bosses) that earned my accolades and were, I believe, helpful to the business."
bad,Very fast paced company.  If you have a flexible schedule in your personal life this position would be a good fit. Competitive pay and relocation is provided.
bad,Anything above a store level at a district management are so out of touch with store and new store issues and new customer issues. They are too busy looking at stats for each store and new worthless programs and ordering by app. Which doesn't even work and puts workers through more work so they don't get in trouble.
bad,Sherwin-Williams is the typical modern corporate retail environment where you are expected to constantly make sales in over saturated markets. Odds are you will wind up competing with your peers instead of the competition.
bad,I tried to do 4 interviews to go upper level but they don't even call back for result. they are kinda watching to your face color. They just want us to work not any time to sit and get a short breath. They have very good benefits and best insurance that I have ever had.
bad,"My managers have worked for Sherwin Williams for 30+ years they said it was years before they even got full-time, at least 4+ years. Even longer for management, I'm sure unless you have connections. They are very flex-able with hours which is great but if you're looking for full-time look elsewhere. No benefits really hurts when you only have 27 hours a week working every day mediocre hours with no promise of a future for many years. I hope to find another job soon."
bad,"Not much to say, company has issues.  Doesn5 care for employees.   Cares more about numbers.  Employees all complain.  Morale is low.  No real opportunities unless you‚Äôre a favorite. Promote only people who suck up. Not very fair amongst best for the job."
bad,Management shows up and leaves when they want. There are no consequences for management. Nobody cares about you in this business. Contractors make women feel uncomfortable and no one cares. Manager sits in the back and plays on phone and doesn‚Äôt work at all.
bad,No comment on this job- Up and down for the most part of this job- Long hour with no compensation for 24 hour support -which is required-  Currently not a good work culture
bad,Pay was not that great as store manager and no work life balance. Required to work 48 hr work weeks at minimum. Asked to run million dollar business with no help at times.
bad,nice place when I started then you have to be up your DM butt to get
bad,I worked for SW in college to earn supplemental income. My boss was ok to work for but the higher ups were terrible. I would hate when they would come to visit.
bad,"Company does not care about employee, they pick and choose who management like. The ones they like, are the ones that get promote and get big and better stores too. Constantly working, on your days off you don't have time for anything but sleep. The workplace is really relaxed (have to wear uniform). I learned a lot there but each store doesn't use the same products so the stuff you learn at one store really doesn't transfer over to the next store. Each store is trying to reach goals so each store is very competitive so that causes conflict within each team as well as customers. Most of the time you will not work anywhere near you where you live. An hour or more max commute."
bad,"Can be a good company to work for, unless you get on the ""bad side"" of certain members of upper management, in which case the local district manager protects his ""boys club"" and pushes others out."
bad,"Management is everything at Sherwin Williams. If you have a poor manager, your job will be miserable. Working is fun and fast-paced, and you meet tons of new people constantly. However, HR and upper management don't worry too often about their employees and their well being. Their managers will go to lengths such as stalking and harassing, and HR will do nothing about it. If you ever feel threatened or unsafe, HR will get rid of you instead of trying to fix any problem. They are a very hush hush corporation and do not like employees that can think for themselves."
bad,"I would not recommend someone to work here.  Depends on what kind of store you get. If you have good part timers then it is not so bad.  If you are sick you must come to work or last minute find someone to for you, which is unlikely."
bad,"Sales Manager is a great job."
bad,Disconnected upper mgmt not for people that want a home life too lean with employees will beg u to stay in busy season and broom you when it is slow. K
bad,My employees were a joy to be around. District manager Doug Hawkins is one of the worst bosses I've ever met. Understand with this company there is no work life balance. They see it as if you don't want to do the job they'll relieve you of your duty and find someone else...and they'll pay you as such. Low pay and weekly hours ranging from 55-to-80 hours a week was normal for all management.
bad,very poor work life balance due to lack of staff and a district unwilling support stores. Lack of culture due to staff constantly leaving
bad,"Sherwin Williams is a decent company to work for but they are corrupt in how they advance their employees. Favoritism is very present. Not a lot of training is offered, at least at my location. There are no official lunch breaks and the contractors are often impatient and vulgar."
bad,"Management is okay. Its all about mixing paint, selling paint, and selling materials. its not the worst nor the best. Its a great entry level job."
bad,"the warehouse staff I worked with was pretty cool, however, the task of carrying hundreds of gallons of paint everyday was harsh. I would not work there again unless Im in the office."
bad,"Produto:"
bad,Expects the unexpected. Higher management will make the most unexpected (stupid) decisions. Many of the stores are understaffed!!!!!
bad,Between the pay and benefits the job is a good one for the area. Management's clear favoritism for first shift and unwillingness to do what needs to be done makes the workers frustrated. If a strong gm were in place it could be the best warehouse in the county.
bad,"Not enough work, too much down time. No real hard dates for when testing needed to be completed. Did not receive needed requirements from developers when we were supposed to. Were told to retest defects that were never fixed, thus the issue was still there. "
bad,If you like it good for you. Very good pay and good benefits. I do not know how much more I need to say. 
bad,"Earnings for shareholders are everything. Sherwin cares about sales. They dont really care for employees, customers are only $$, and if you arent well recieved you may not find advancement."
bad,"Sherwin was like any other factory one can imagine, it had it's good days and it's bad days...."
bad,"Micromanagement taken in the form of unneeded cameras and two senses from other departments."
bad,When I first started there I informed them I'd work everyday but Sunday due to my church hours. I worked every single Sunday since I started working there.
bad,They try to take over all kinds of industries and then bar you from working them as another part time job. They only hire part time for the most part. No benefits!!!!
bad,"While I did not enjoy my time or experience with the company, it was a great place to learn and develop my managerial skills. My direct manager was inexperienced and could not development me as an employee."
bad,Hard to move up while they are hiring outside the company. You don't feel as if they care for your well being no structure only numbers. You're seen as a number not an employee that can help grow the company.
bad,"I was told by my district manager that Military Leadership school did not amount to anything. Very Very disrespectful. They are all about hiring outside. I was in the Training store, in which we trained the soon to be managers. I was denied a Assistant Manager position, but was skilled enough to help train them."
bad,"I've heard one of the managers urinated in paint. They always playing around. Everyone is treated differently. I stopped caring after a while especially when you see no one else does. Met some pretty cool people in the process. A couple of down to earth laid back drivers. The associates and management sucks. Just giving my honest opinion. The pay is terrible, especially lifting as much paint as you are demanded to. I'm making 14 hourly now doing less than I was doing there. Don't know about benefits only 40 percent off products. Not many fulltime driver positions. But they always need drivers lmao cheap company. Bunch of wolves in sheeps clothing."
bad,"alot of off time in store, busy mornings but staff and management gossip within each other. HORRIBLE for a team work environment. dont get me wrong the company is not fully messed up by these people but its a large percentage that encourage this."
bad,Difficult culture to excel in.  Currently there is a very toxic environment within both the field sales organization and corporate environments.  Few people feel comfortable or want to stay long term.
bad,"When I first started, Sherwin was very supportive and acted almost like a family to it's employees. Over the past few years, they have adopted a more big brother/micro management approach to how they treat their employees. Contracts & discounts for large customers are handled at a corporate level, yet the same high sales & margin expectations are pushed on the stores. "
bad,"fair pay and fair hours, it was going through a management change at the time so it was pretty messy and disorganized. must be able to lift pales of paint and learn about the product"
bad,"Only had two good managers the rest were pathetic and didn't deserve to be in their position. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone, the pay is too low."
bad,"Work life balance is not found with this company. You work hard and are expected to be a machine. Once you reach store management you are better taken care of (compensation wise), but store employees that are looking to move up within the company without a degree are too often overlooked. As a manager, it is hard to give deserving employees a raise, terminate employees that are not a good fit with the company, or even hire good applicants. There needs to be a large culture shift in the company that starts with corporate leadership. As a company that has been around for over 150 years, and a leader of the coatings industry, you would think that Sherwin-Williams would be more adaptable."
bad,"Multi billion dollar company that will only hire part time employees with no future outlook on moving up to higher roles, including full time status. Although managers  in stores and staff is great, the company itself at least within the California districts dont express much care about their employees even though they are the face of the company in storefronts. It's one thing to go over safety and procedures of policy anyone can talk about how to better your customer service, but  it's another  to show quality hard working employees who want to move up   the actions it takes to move up. Overall. Sherwin Williams is just a learning experience. Once yoube mastered the skill it gets boring if you can't expand your learning. "
bad,"My boss wasn't the best but she was nice, Sherwin is only good if you are fulltime, being part time sucks! But all in all, it was an okay place to work, I would not recommend it for a part-time job."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this employer to someone that I didn't like, much less someone I did like. They are of the practice of promoting not the best candidate, but, rather the best brown noser."
bad,"Very busy"
bad,Management is all over the place with a terrible lack of communication.  They let the talent that lies right under their noses slip away because they'd rather hire/promote people they like over qualified and experienced people.
bad,"- A typical day at work was stressful depending on the position held"
bad,"La gestione e pessima come la politica aziendale"
bad,they have good benefits that's about it  hard to move up Job Security/Advancement Management sucks Job Work/Life Balance its okay it will do for now I guess
bad,"I am more of a apparel retail person not improvement supplies person. It was never a good fit. The store is small and you may get 6 customer in at opening and it declines from there.  I am used to working at big box stores. "
bad,"Worked with people who had no experience in the paint business. Did the minimum job requirements, increase my worked load as I remained un compensated for it. Started with a really bad Manager, to a point it became a conflict. Contacted my City manager and District manager about the citation. Did nothing! to aid me in the citation causing the issue to escalate then finally applied for another store and resolved the issue."
bad,non era prioritario l'interesse aziendale ma era prioritario l'interesse corporate ai fini del mercato per un incremento di quotazione
bad,Usually a new manager in the store with like every year and a half.  No advancement without college degree. Seems like rather hiring associates with in the company to move up they hire of the street and train 6 weeks to be a manager.  With that being said that manager has no knowledge of products and the clients that come into that store.
bad,I worked at SW for 15 years. When I started it was great then over the course they stated giving us 12 percent sales increase demands even during the recession. They took hours away from part time associates from 28 hours down to 15-20 per week and told store managers to work the additional hours. It got to be a joke.
bad,This job is great for college grads and anyone with a college degree.  Not family friendly and horrible work/life balance.  No breaks and eat on the go.  Exposure to chemicals and nasty contractors who yell at you when it is someone else's fault.
bad,"Challenging projects"
bad,"Batch and reformulate formulas for thermo traffic paint that goes on the pavement of roads."
bad,Management makes or breaks your experience. Mine overworked me in the summer and so my winter hours are cut back to the point where I can‚Äôt afford my cheap rent in my own family‚Äôs basement. Only $200 a month and I can‚Äôt afford it. Have had to get a second AND third jobs. Have had to sell half my possessions.
bad,"Company pays well, however, upper management in our cal bay district has been a disaster for the past year or two. New DM came from Florida, all around a good guy with good intentions to improve the district. City Manager on the other hand has ran 20+ Store managers, Assistant Managers, and Sales Representatives out of the company due to lack of leadership and people skills. Will constantly make promises they can‚Äôt keep and make bogus excuses on to why they can‚Äôt happen. Will try to con you into taking over unwanted positions. If you refuse to take it, there will be some kind of personal vendetta against you preventing you from ever progressing with the company."
bad,"As an In Home Color Consultant,  I am challenged each and every time I meet with a new customer.  "
bad,Long 12 hour shifts that are busy to very busy. Reactive maintenance but we were working to make it better. Management could be better. They offer some support.
bad,"Typical day , tinting and selling paint, and selling paint supplies , interfacing with retail and commercial customers, taking and filling orders for paint  over the phone and inputing orders into the  computer, receiving and putting stock away that requires some heavy lifting ( 50lb plus pails of paint). "
bad,"The departments are very siloed, causing a lack of cohesiveness and opportunity for career advancement. Pay below market salaries without incentive plan."
bad,They  are ok low pay. Didn't like that job had to drive to tulsa everyday. Didn't want to pay the employees that much. Tulsa district wasn't too good and still not.
bad,"Sherwin is just an ok place to work. They need to focus on training their employees. ALL EMPLOYEES. Store managers need to make sure that their employees are watching the correct videos, and taking their own start tests. I have watched managers and assistant managers sit down and take the tests for their employees or even hand them the answers. If you want good employees that know the products and services and how to sell it all they need to do the trainning."
bad,"Would never work for them again. There is absolutely no work and life balance and here in the south its the good ole boy syndrome to the fullest. Being a woman in this type of company is very difficult and almost impossible if you done have ""tough skin"""
bad,Typical day was very long witb no help availableif you were sick. There was no part time help in the budget. No advancement available. By yourself most of the time
bad,This job is simply retail when it comes down to it. There is no better way to say that you take the abuse from customers while pleasing the masses. Management is normally young and there is a lot of turnover.
bad,Management has gotten so focused on driving stock and sales number they have forgotten what has gotten them to where they are.       Can be a fun place to work but can be very stressful and time limited with the over abundance of duties required. Along with providing excellent customer service.
bad,"The job experience here is quite good but there i limited room to grow and learn new things as the job is too simple. "
bad,Demand 200% at all times without any thought to you having any type of family time outside of work. Expect to be on call at all times. Great people to work with though.
bad,"Typical low wage paying job. I worked my butt off here and have nothing to show for it. They put lots of pressure on you and you feel bad because they are greedy and will only give about minimum wage."
bad,I worked here for over three months as a driver. Employees are started on a part time basis from 12PM until about 4PM monday through friday with a 10/Hr. rate. Full time is reserved for friends of management to be hired over you. The training I received consisted of about 30 minutes of conversation over an 8 hour day and a couple training videos. I was forgotten about for almost a week and swept the warehouse for almost three hours per day. You are required to have a smart phone with GPS that you will use throughout the day at your cost. The benefits and stock options were good but most people may feel burned because of spending more time and money driving to work than you will make.
bad,no training inexperienced operate -stressful corporate culture very dangerous enviorment --poor equipment--parts usually unavailable and have to be fabircated
bad,"This job pays very well but isn't worth the stress or not being able to have a life. worked here for 2 years and was on major overtime. Wasn't able to spend time with my family and missed out on a lot of major events. Management sucks here. They play favorites to the brown noses. They also really don't care to try to work with people that are going through a difficult situation. They are always firing and hiring new people as well as good employees quitting. There is no air, it gets to be about 120 in there and you have to wear long sleeve cotton shirts and pants (Uniforms that they provide you.) I would not recommend this place to anyone I care about."
bad,"The workday started early and ended late (at the division office); majority of the time you are never caught up on work due to the workload being so heavy. Even though it is a team environment you are still responsible for yourself. There are also some decisions you cannot control b/c so many other people involved in decision making. I learned a lot about analyzing credit, P&L, Equifax and things along those lines. Most of the co-workers were shady and talked about you to others. Only a few that were truly genuine. The office is broken up into about 5 teams based on regions in the southeast, each with a supervisor. Only 1 supervisor was decent, the others were rude and talked about their employees to the other. Hardest part of the job was trying to get the massive workload done on a given day: there were numerous emails, phone calls, list you had to complete, reviews, etc just in one day. SOOO much work. The enjoyable part was office activities, that's about it. The job itself is so stressful. They tried to give incentives by having contests to top performer awarding he or she with a $100 or $50 gift card, but essentially just to get you to work harder! I would never go back to work for this company."
bad,"I think I would like Sherwin a lot better if I felt like my needs were being taken into account. I am forced to drive 1.5 hours every day to work and 1.5 hours back. I didn't choose this location but was willing to cope until a position opened up. However, 5 positions were open and none were posted for my relocation even though I made my personal hardships clear. Instead I was told that none of that matters and that I had better get used to it. "
bad,"Management took all the credit for any accomplishments. Terrible work-life balance. Decent pay, good stability. Over worked employees on a consistent basis. Intensely misogynistic atmosphere."
bad,Steady work. Co-workers don't adapt to change well. Great management.
bad,"My day always starts out with answering the phones for memebers who may have questions about their accounts or want to perform transactions over the phone. I started as a Davis Staffing employee which is a temp agency in Hammond, IN. I then was coverted to a Sherwin Williams Credit Union Employee by the way I performed my job duties. The most thing I like about my job is helping those in need who may come in the credit union without hope and they leave with a smile on their face. I am still improving on the job, which leads me to ask questions if I am unsure and try to learn as many things as poosible"
bad,Help increase sales and increase store cliental using Lead Generation.
bad,"The job started out well and I enjoyed it a lot. The schedule was flexible and the work culture was friendly and welcoming. However, things turned for the worst when I moved to a different store. The company hampers the hiring process when associates leave, so there were long windows of having to run a store short staffed with no new co-workers in sight. I helped manage a store with only two people, including myself, for over a year. For a store that is open over 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, it was very stressful and hard to manage. Management did little to understand our situation or provide us with help. Eventually burned me out and the pay simply wasn't worth it. Plus the only true career opportunities are all in Ohio so you have to relocate if you want to truly move up in the company."
bad,"Just like with most jobs, it's the people you work with that make or break it. My co-workers were some of the most honest, hardworking guys I've ever met; i'm still good friends with a couple. But the management above store level (and sometimes at store level) is full of exactly the kind of incompetence there are millions of workplace jokes about. Moving up past full-timer to Asst. Manager is near impossible if you aren't a previous sherwin intern fresh out of college. Impossible deadlines and endless busywork abound. The customers are about 50% good, 50% bad depending on which location you work at."
bad,"Unless you only want Part Time hours, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!"
bad,I usually got my schedule for the next week with 48 hours advance for that following week. Manager and Assistant always were arguing over how to run the store with little to no resolutions.
bad,was working 12 hr shifts alone and was harassed by customers. police had to be called. My district manager promised i would never work alone again. I was working alone within 3 weeks of the incident.
bad,This is a good place to work if you need temporary work while you look for a real career elsewhere. They seem to favor hiring inexperienced kids right out of college over promoting their experienced workers.
bad,"During a typical day of work, I would stock shelves with product, tint paints to customers' desire, assist customers in finding products, and carry out transactions. I learned about the different types of paints and their applications as well as specific properties. The management was lackluster. The company itself was overly concerned with meeting numbers and insisted on unnecessarily pushing products onto consumers in order to meet sales goals. The corporate structure was overall detrimental. The hardest part of the job was trying to learn a lot of new information in a short period of time so as to better service clientele. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the customers that came in regularly."
bad,"Great products, benefits, and fellow coworkers are like family. That is where the positives end. All about checking items off on a scorecard. Need to continuously grow despite local economic circumstances."
bad,"Having worked there for several years, mostly in the stores, I will be the first to admit that they are a very successful company that generally goes unnoticed.  However, this success comes at a price for those employees on the forefront, selling the products, which is generally the store managers.  A salaried position, which means you will work from 45 - 75 hrs./week and  receive the same pay. I can't even begin to count the number of countless weeks of 65-75 hr work weeks during the summer, weekends included, that took away quality time from my family.  In addition I had a stretch where I worked open to close (7 am - 6 pm), with no other employees for 21 days straight because the District Mgr would not get me any help.  That is seven days/ week, including Sundays.  In addition, if you take pride in recruiting, hiring and building a tremendous staff of your own, you can expect the District Mgr. to take your top prospects and place them at other locations while you're left holding the short end of the stick (again) and working 60 hrs./week to cover the voids left by middle management.  Getting promoted can be difficult as well because once you show your loyalty or dedication by working all of those hours in the store, why would they want to move you out of there for a promotion to a sales position??  After 14 years, I finally spoke my mind and that did not sit well with the DM.  How dare I speak my mind and let him know that I was uncomfortable having my top employees stripped from my store and work an additional 10 hrs./week and now I am not a ""team player""?  These are things"
bad,"when you are hired in as an assistant manager (which is most likely the only full time positions available) you don't have much of a choice in which store or which manager you'll be working with. I had the better part of a year working with a sexist and condescending manager. He would belittle me and make me feel useless. I was never delegated any tasks. He would openly mock minorities and women in front of me and customers. After he moved to another store, it was me and another part time employee. I literally could not take a day off. I could not close the store early, or leave to get food, or leave to use the restroom when our toilet broken. I have felt like a prisoner tied to the store since I was placed here. I have tried to switch rolls in the company but have been denied 5 times. I am done."
bad,If you like working all the time and being given impossible tasks while understaffed this is the place for you.
bad,"In my two years with Sherwin I have found myself the sole full time employee for a store open seven days a week, thirteen hours a day. The works is good, the people are great, the customers are awesome for the most part - but they can't keep the staff they need to support the rest of the employees. Great opportunity for bonus and advancement."
bad,The company is just average. Not really a family setting. Never feel like you are close with anyone in the company.
bad,You have the opportunity to learn a lot about financial reports and sales. You learn about how to maintain and increase margins and profits and the customer service is superior with the company.
bad,THe job is okay it can be better high intenstiy work enviornment but if you stay busy you can get through it looking for something else you get complacent at this job
bad,"Good company to work for but they do not care about your personal life. They want a manager there 24/7 and don't pay part-timers enough so you have no help ever it seems. And the stores are very competitive with each other. They only care about hitting their numbers with their phone calls, doesn't care about quality anymore."
bad,It was a pretty easy going job. I thought the pay was a little low. There are advancement opportunities if you want to work for the company as a career.
bad,This company is bad to work for because they don't make just anyone full time. you need to have a college degree to have a full time job at Sherwin Williams.
bad,Nice place to work just need the right management and make sure you don't let them take advantage. The job does have room to advance from time to time.
bad,The company is a great company to work for overall.  Have to be willing to work long hours and lift 50 plus pounds.  The pay and benefits are good and it can be a great place to start a career.
bad,Worked for Sherwin Williams for close to twenty years and liked it most of the time.  Left because there was no room for advancement because of politics.  Found a better job.
bad,Regular show and the game will be fun and fun with the new updates coming out soon but it will not be fun until you can fix it and it would mean the best app ever to the whole world and it will get you a better review
bad,"A good starting postion and led to advancement later, taught me to be prompt and enjoyable after many months of learning and practice"
bad,The employees had no significance they replaced you for being a minute late at work no matter the excuse. I dont know what else to say this expects alot of information. we worked inspected parts. management made people work outside there job titles. treated employees with disrespect.
bad,"Very bad Work life balance, will not get help when employees are lost stuck running a store 60+ a week. They will work you to the bone. Its a great company to work for but they do not care for thier employees much"
bad,"We mixed 10lbs and 50lbs buckets of paints for our clients. I did a lot of computer matching of the colors that clients bring. I learned to manage and at the same time be a trainer to my guys. At the end of the day, I learned to do minor accounting.and paperwork. I managed four male employees. I learned quickly how to manage strong personalities. I hire and fire employees. Also delegated duties etc "
bad,"A typical day at work included anywhere from one to three deliveries to various customer sites (construction, residential, etc) followed by the remainder of the shift breaking down and putting away stock.  I learned a lot about the ingredients of various paints and coatings, the operations and finance of the business, and store management.  Workplace culture was blue-collar but good people.  The most difficult part of the job was custom matching colors and customer service.  The most enjoyable part of the job was making deliveries to customers on-site."
bad,Great opportunities for advancement. I was able to learn the in's and out's of running a business from beginning to end. I had to recruit  and staff the store. Maintain current business along with creating new business to grow sales. Come up with a business plan for each year and execute plan. I also had to maintain minimum of 50 lead generating calls per week. This included cold calling or face to face sales calls.
bad,"They make you deliver hundreds of 5 gallon paint buckets which weigh about 50 pounds each to construction sites all over the area. Not only do you have to walk on mud to deliver the buckets but you have to do it quickly because dispatch tracks you by gps and they are very rude if you are not speedy.  After one shift your back will feel it! One more thing, they never hire full time unless you get a bachelors and work for them for many years."
bad,"My boss was very submissive and would allow certain workers to perform jobs poorly with no consequences. However, the environment created on the job site was fun and energetic."
bad,They only hire part timers it's nearly impossible to get into a full time position and if one does open you have to compete with the other part timers. Good company but doesnt want to pay for benefits which is why I think most stores have 2 full timers only.  One being manager and other being the assistant.
bad,"Upper Management is always breathing down your back, fast pace work environment, contractors are either super cool or the worst customers to deal with, there is no in between, upper management hardly ever lets you do your job"
bad,Daily working .Good management.I am enjoyable part of the job
bad,I learned how to use hand tools operate a machine be responsible and work by myself without have to worry about anything else. It was a good place to work but i had to leave it because im going to start college soon.
bad,The most enjoyable part about working for SW is by being completely relieved of the headaches and lack of organization.  The blind is leading the blind. There are great things about SW like the competitive pay and benefits but other than that.... nothing!!
bad,"I would manage the part time employees, satisfied homeowner and contractors needs and maintain our existing customers. I interviewed a few potential candidates for our part time position we had to fill. I loved working here, my boss was very laid back and helpful."
good,"Management was poor, when multiple family emergencies happened was not allowed to take time off. Training wasn't done well, very little training went into the actual physical mixing the paint of stains."
good,"Empresa muito boa para trabalhar, por√©m e dif√≠cil para conseguir crescimento."
good,Often a fun place to work the co-workers are great and mostly works as a team. Management can be hard to work with however and the hours are inconsistent.
good,don't like it I learned how to apply paint. my manager is a strict lifeless rude person. My assistant manager is the best I love her. the hardest part is lifting the 5gallon buckets. the best part is when I get to leave
good,"I liked the company and the general manager, but the assistant manager should not have been there. Abuse of power, bad attitude, and not willing to go the long way for a customer in need. The knowledge she knew helped but that came with how long had been working there. This company you should have the want to get to know your customers."
good,No room to grow and lots biased attitudes. Manager and assistant manager cover each others backs so they always look good in front of the district manager.
good,awful place to work at. The management is awful its a very cut throat store to work for. The management only care about themselves and what is good for their personal lives if they can cover a shift or not !!!!
good,"decent pay, but you will have no family or personal life, its a around the clock type of job ,its hard work, and will have your sleeping pattern off, if not use to it"
good,"Very easy part time job, physically demanding but management was awesome and flexible with personal life schedule. Pay is low for job requirements and not a lot of opportunity to grow within company."
good,pay is good but the hours are tough when trying to balance family life.Your only given a lunch break half way threw your shift. And you on your feet the whole time your working.
good,"I love the people I work with. The job pays great, has 401k and stock programs. Awful insurance!. After 26 years I have 30 days vacation. Worst thing is rotating shifts every 3 months for 26 years."
good,"Never asked for any time off in a year, asked to take or switch two days off (one for a 1st birthday the other for a school related event) and got back nasty messages from my manager.  She didn't allow any of the employees to talk during the day unless she initiated it."
good,"Fast pace environment, on your feet. Providing customer services, assiting customers with products and supplies they need for jobs and to complete jobs."
good,"company pays decent to well. the biggest downside is you will work way more than 40 hours a week but never be payed for it. when I brought this up to management I was brushed off multiple times. if you dont mind the less than desirable work life balance its not bad though. you have to learn about a pretty boring industry in my opinion (paint and painters were not fascinating to me). But you get a chance to manage your own store and find the ups and downs and being ""married"" to a business. I will say I use to have delusions of wanting to start my own company and this job taught me that is the opposite of what I want. good experience for a athletic kid out of college but I would learn what there is to learn and move along."
good,"if you want to put your head down and work its a good place to work, but if you want to move up and be promoted you have to deal with a lot of favoritism and politics."
good,they took the overtime from free sign up to secret seniority I do great in my position but my manager blocks me so he can get his numbers but won't let me advance even tho its based on me applying or bidding on the position
good,"Long days, long hours, often with minimal staff.  Hardest part of the job is being on your feet for twelve hour days and often more than 50 hours in a week"
good,"Even though I picked up and completed portions of other workers duties, I was never given an option for working more hours. The paychecks were small, I feel as though I should have been offered more hours since I did extra work. That was not the case however."
good,"It is the single most important thing to them, so don't bother trying to advance beyond store management if you don't have a four year degree. They always give priority to the Management Training program people, since they get them right out of college."
good,I spent many years here. The beginning was the best time to work there. Now they are more of a revolving door. Many good employees let go while I was there because most managers dont stand up for their employees.
good,"Sherwin Williams is a good company, but working for their distribution is very tuff on the body and your home life. we work six 12 hour days a week and are on a very strict production rating. The pay is good, healthcare is good. Management is cutthroat and if you don't play by their rules out you go. They say they have an open door policy but when you complain about management or work conditions you put a target on your back, and management will go out of their way to make your life difficult."
good,It was okay good out of high school job. I would definitely not recommend it as a career but was decent job that helped build my resume. The management was decent
good,"Poor management , long hours, HR caters to popular employees. During my tenure, every year got worse and worse. Poor equipment, tight budget, understaffed"
good,"the job was jun, but they were not considerate of anything outside work related. they would tend to put more work on your plate than you could handle."
good,"The people I worked with were alright, but the company as a whole is ridiculous. They focus on mainly just making more sales and money as a whole and don't worry much about their employees. We are just a number to them!"
good,no upward mobility and schedule is constantly changing. job hired for  was taken and given to someone else. hours change. part time are only allowed 28 per week and good luck getting those 28.
good,"The company is growing fast. Most employees have little or no training, and it is a sink or swim environment. The average employee is in their mid twenties, and the culture reflects this lack of maturity and experience. Their was not a lot of team work actually occurring. Conversely, there was great expectations for employees to work together to achieve results. This resulted in frustration when trying to acquire the necessary information need to perform your job. No one knows what they are doing, but they are all working really hard at looking like they know what they are doing. "
good,The complain about OT constantly but dont give you enough staff to succeed. The Business model does not line up with reality. 3 people running a commercial store 7 days a week is absurd. Im very physically fit and they run you ragged. Very political when it comes to promotions not always based off of performance.
good,most of my day to day was helping customers and mixing paint i would great customers and provide guidence when choosing the correct paint for the job
good,A typical day of work here includes leaving covered in paint and lifting heavy objects. It also includes assisting customers in choosing the colors for their home and mixing and delivering paint for construction sights.
good,"¬∑         Checked in-coming merchandise and prepared out-going orders and shipped as instructed"
good,Decent Retail Experience can be justified for the lack of pay one receives for the all the work put in
good,Scheduling is everything if you are trying to get something done. We always learn from our customers we only have to pay attention they will tell us so. Quarterly meetings with current customers is worth millions in the long run.New customers are to hard find and very expensive. Steve Covey 7 Habits will get you through any situation.
good,"Its not the dream job anyone asked for, it just got the bills paid and gas for the next day. You learn about paint and the local community people. In order to get promoted you apparently have to relocate and that wasn't going to work out."
good,"Okay company to work for. I was overworked and taken advantage of, and not paid enough to make it worth it. Management was a disaster. If the pay was more for the work that was required it would have been worth it"
good,"Too many managers, to really be productive. Maybe it's I live in New Orleans, I could count on a ride along every 10 days from someone wanting to get away from the North and hang in NOLA."
good,Good job to work in if you want to move up in. Only if you have a college degree though. Managers will throw you under the bus if need too. Only get promoted if you re liked. If you are anything less than a assistant manger then it‚Äôs not worth it
good,"Very busy store,  Very demanding physically.  Never knew when the schedule was going to be changed, had to look at it multiple times daily and call in on days off."
good,"I worked a lot of 5 hour shifts without a break to eat.  I bought Ensure to drink so that I could get some nourishment.  I was never out or late but when I had a very serious family emergency and could not work for two weeks I was fired.  "
good,"Working 50 plus hours a week, chasing a sales budget that most of the time felt unattainable. Store is open 7 days a week, and you have an asst manager and part time help, not fun."
good,Malos jefes en cuanto a formacion y educacion. No forman al personal y el trato es vejatorio y mal educado.
good,"It was fun working there, but being the newest employee, I always got the short end of the stick on the hours. The manager wasn't very professional and pushed the work onto the other employees."
good,the job was stable but sometimes felt like workers were taken advantage of due to their situations. sporadic schedules long distance work made life after work awkward to work around
good,"This company does not care about you and will not pay you a livable wage let alone what you deserve given the amount management every part time employee has to taken. I have worked at this store for 2 years, speak two languages fluently (reading, speaking, writing), have the third key to the store yet make only 9 cents more than a new hire with no experience and no other merits."
good,"The machines were easy to work as long as you‚Äôve payed attention in training, the pails were to heavy to lift when its filled with paint, start your machine and check to make sure everything is working well before you start your day, check to make sure you have a clean work area so the clutter wont be in the way"
good,most of the heavy deliveries  would go out in the morning so i must say the lazy drivers would hide untill the trucks went out. then they would take the smaller loads and be out all day have gone out.i delivered 3 to 4 thousand gallons a day. but all that is important is me proving to that i can and strive at into stoarge containers.
good,"I did not like it, the supervisors were terrible and the employees were rude. They also gave me all the dirty jobs which i did not hate but i can do alot more then grunt work"
good,Provided prompt service. Helped people find colors and choose the right paint for the job. Kept track of orders and deliveries for commercial painters. Had to be able to lift 5 gallon buckets of paint alone when you were the only one in the store.
good,A lot of childishness happens there like some people having the lack of motivation to do a job or to get things done that need to be done rather they just be on their cell phones or hiding in the back so that they don't have to deal with customers and rather poor teamwork
good,"Their process is ridiculous for drivers you use manual pallet. The stores are in very tight location and you deliver very heavy pallets of paint sometimes the store employees aren't able to help due to customers so your rushing every day as they make you drive 200 miles away to get your load for delivery and than start your deliveries which makes for a very hard and stressful day or night. "
good,"Good job to learn about customer service and how to properly interact with different individuals like home owners to professional painters, while attending college."
good,"Wasn't treated fairly, guest were fun to work with and learning about paints and stains is a lot more fun than it sounds. Overall I would recommend people to work there as a summer job or temporarily but not long term."
good,No room for advancement with out a degree. Experience counts for nothing even when you have over 20 years of it.Job does not pay as well as it should considering the money it cost for customers to buy product.
good,"Good company with great benefits with one major downfall: Management does not know how to inspire its workforce to achieve their highest potential. You have to belong to a ""Click"" in order to advance in the company."
good,"The work environment was aloof, without much possibility for advancement. I would recommend this job to a high schooler or younger college student."
good,"my typical work day was unpredictable, I learned something new everyday ,management is very critical, co-workers were eager to assist, hardest part was being a temp, most enjoyable part of the job seeing a finished product with your name"
good,"Long hours, management does not do a lot of work, the assistant managers and full time employees do all the work"
good,"They are good people to work with and do work around schedules when you need time off. Strict on amount of hours you can work weekly."
good,"Sherwin williams was good as far as pay and getting enough hours to work, however they dont treat employees very wells and if you have a family forget about seeing them. Often there is mandatory overtime which isnt bad every once in a while, but there were times overtime was mandatory for 3 months straight. Its very physical and extreme temperatures"
good,Coordinate materials and tools for proper customer satisfaction lift operator .
good,Great customers that are patient and understanding. Short on employees and managment is never really around. Pay is decent but you dont really benefit from it cause they cut hours constantly.
good,"Management is outdated and haven't been in the roles that you will be doing.  Blind leading the blind.  Also, the customer service industry is getting harder everyday!"
good,"By far the worst experience at the this plant. They treat you like a dog, make you work ‚Äúmandatory overtime‚Äù or else... Plant Manager & Supervisor were always saying safety this and safety that, when most of the equipment was broken down and they knew about it and didn‚Äôt care. Numbers are whats important. When the inspection comes from the big boss‚Äô they hid machines that looked bad would make it all look like its a normal factory. Then after the big boss‚Äô look around and say great job guys keep up the good work, they make you put all the broken machines back. Sneaky plant."
good,Doesn‚Äôt seem like anyone stays with the company for very long. Always someone new to train which affects customer service. Management always wants you to do more for very little money. They need to offer more raises. I can barely afford to eat because my cost of living is so high and my income is so low.
good,"Very repetive work"
good,The company has good benefits but the amount of disrespect you have to deal with on a daily basis is not worth it. They will tell you you have to stay 4 hours overtime 5 min before the bell rings. All the supervisors are friends so the friendships get in the way of being professional. They let men harrass women there.. if the management dont like the women being harrassed they will make her feel like it's her fault and shes the problem. I could go on but   it really sucks cause the job isn't bad but the management and HR ruin it.
good,Hit goals or you wont make it very far. Advancement opportunities are unlimited within certain divisions. Expect long hours and few breaks. You will learn a lot if you are willing to learn
good,"they expect you to bust your axx and give your life to them."
good,"The company itself is quite good"
good,"Starting with Sherwin Williams as a CSR was great, but through the Management Trainee program, management wasn't very supportive.  Harrassment is swept under the rug and didn't spend much time on training for the position.  Any complaints went unresolved as the manager's actions were just hidden.  The environment was very toxic and was very obvious towards the end as I heard what happened to the previous Assistant Manager and the position's high turnover.  This was a stressful environment and was to the point where it started affecting my health."
good,It was a big hard core because we had to do things fast but it was fun working with a lot of people and staying in a hotel over there while we worked.
good,"10hr days, not all ways work to do. management was not at all good. he was always behind. your ideas wher not taken, he did not comucate well. we often had work days of nothing to do yet we are told we need to produce or els"
good,Sherwin-Williams is the kind of place that you would work if you did not need to make a lot of money. Few extra bucks in your pocket is what you get. In my opinion it is meant for the younger people.
good,Management is from the top down and all about the numbers.  They always need more.  They are never happy or pleased.  They are really out of touch with their workers and clients.
good,I had a hard time the 3 years I was there cause management never took care of bullies and other coworkers actions. Harassment wasn't handled very well.
good,Empresa no segmento de tintas imobiliarias com boa presen√ßa no mercado de lojas especializadas.
good,The only advancement options available are for management positions. Part-time employees have little to no incentive to work. If you are young and fresh out of college there are a lot of options for advancement.
good,"I accepted a part time driver job away from my home in the hopes of that being a stepping stone to the local paint factory. The HR folks told me to look for job listings that they had posted for the local factory, which were non-existent and they seemed to not even know the listings were not posted."
good,"It‚Äôs hard to have a life while working there. Not very flexiable at all. Working late night everyday, and weekends and holidays. You don‚Äôt get paid enough for what you do. Always underpaid."
good,"Tasks and responsibilities are endless and require more personal time that what is included in the salary. Although the pay is well and  the position taught me numerous things regarding sales and marketing, it is soul sucking."
good,Productive and good work experience. Good sales experience and product is easy to learn. Easy paced and work speed is not rushed. Salary is low and could be more.
good,"Be ready for a lot of hard work as an assistant manager."
good,"One of the better retail jobs to have. Training material is poor for new sales associates, will take several months to feel confident in product knowledge."
good,There are 2 12 hour work shifts...You work 3 days a week. They don't really pay enough.I did like some of the employees and managers. No real chance of advancing unless someone retires or dies.
good,"At Sherwin we service contractors and loyal customers. Starting from the 7AM to 7PM there is never a dull moment. There is always something to do. Having a good atmosphere and helpful coworkers helps during those times of complete chaos. The hardest part of the job is having to fill large orders of 1,000+ gallons of paint, as this can be very taxing on ones body. The most enjoyable part about the job is being able to have fun while working with some of the most comical co-workers in the world!"
good,"This is a big company, and this makes it very hard to move up.  The pay is also very bad."
good,I enjoy the staff and the learning opportunities that you have
good,"The first few years were really good, after management changed and they lost a lot of the builder business it kind of dried up work wise. I couldn't keep on working more less part time or when it was a crisis."
good,"Great entry level pay, but that's where it stops.  Stores are under staffed.  Very anti veteran/military."
good,I worked very hard for this company and had a 75% increase in territory sales. I only left this position after the bonus promised was not paid.
good,"Great company, not much room for advancement. Hours are too long, feel lost in the company."
good,"Great Company but not very good training , I had good training when working on the floor but when I changed job description I didn‚Äôt receive any proper training, it became a hostel and stressful work situation."
good,Not good for single parents who needs to get their children to school. The morning hours are not the best. If you get a four or five star rating you can kiss your raise after a year of hardworking goodbye.
good,To work up until you get hurt. If you get hurt by are just like any other company in United States or anywhere by are gonna get rid of you somehow and I don't care anything about you anymore and you will not get your job back after all the medical loon everything is over with they will write you up
good,I learned a whole lot about paint and customer relations. I also learned basic warehouse skills. I was always interacting with customers and handling money.
good,"Business/succession model was smart, but employee morale was terrible. They need to find a better way to make people feel as if they are doing meaningful, significant work."
good,"Journ√©√© de travail int√©ressante,pas de possibilit√© de d√©veloppement √† l'√©poque."
good,My district wasn‚Äôt the best and gave me a bad experience. Other districts out of az seem to have total opposite reviews. Staffing issues and no support from upper management and not many advancement options. Good for basic experience and Trainee learning.
good,This would be a great job for a retiree looking to fill their days. Management positions require a bachelors degree regardless of the field of study. Raises are given only once per year and there is a $.40 maximum.
good,"it's an ok place to work overall. the management structure isn't great. Managers don't always listen and each department just wants to pass blame, you get that at most places though"
good,Seniority is everything here. If you are low man you will be pouring sweat all day and night while the older crew enjoy a nice relaxing time in the climates controlled area. The work can be a lot at times and not very much at other. The pay is pretty nice though.
good,"Some things I learn were employee training methods, meeting deadlines, Most of everything their is to know about paint, organization, how to run a store , how to prepare for an audit, how to read spread sheet, paying bills, weekly scheduling, maintaining store operations and team building skills."
good,"Overall the work experience I had at Sherwin-Williams was not to bad, although it had a lot of cons and few pros. If looking for a job that has great coworkers and is flexible for lunch hours then this job is for you; but I do not recommend starting here if you want to move up in a job."
good,It would be a better place if everyone was on the same place . If the warehouse was cleaner and everyone could live a normal life as well . And if they thought of their employees as human beings.
good,"As a part-time employee, I enjoyed the small office collaboration, the diverse contracted employees, and the fast-past sales and customer service environment."
good,It's really hard to move up in the company. Part time is really part time(only 28hr/week). Do not work here if you are looking for full time. You will work part time for at least 1 year before being considered for a full time positon.
good,Although I made it 12 years none of them were easy. SW demands are very exacting and one needs to be at the top of their game to compete year after year.
good,must be favored to move up...work extremely hard for not enough pay...management from the top down doesn't see what the face of the company does everyday...
good,The DSC in Effingham used to be one the best jobs in the area but a few years ago it took a turn for the worse. The management is a joke  and very hard to work for. The pay was always the best for the line of work we do but other companys have come in and pay more.
good,"carry their items to their vehicles. When business was slow, I would usually go through each isle and see what we were low on and go in the warehouse to get the items I need to stock the items up. After that, I'd go into the warehouse and work on the shipment we got for the week and stocked it in the back where it needed to go if it couldn't go on the sales floor. I never realized how many different kind of paints there were and the grades for each one. The cheap inside paint is good for rooms not used often like a guest room or closet. The higher Quilty paints are better for high traffic rooms like the living room because people will constantly be going through it and rubbing against the walls and the paint won't peel as easily or fade as quickly. My favorite and also hardest part was learning the different types of paint and what each one of them can go on and how good they are. Getting to become friends with most of the contractors was pretty great also."
good,"I was hired as an in home color consultant, worked primarily in the store with retail experience. I loved working one on one with customers to help design their projects."
good,"If you are working in store, You are treated poorly. Assistant managers, managers, and the reps are treated far better. The company doesn't invest in new equipment which makes doing work not as officiant as it can be. The environment and moral can be so awful in certain locations, it takes a big toll you mentally. I came into this job hoping to grow in placement and be treated right. I got the exact opposite. They give no incentives to keep people and show appreciation for peoples works."
good,"Long Hours, Management has its favorites. Learned a lot about business and reports. Best part of the job was building relationships with contractors and helping them."
good,"So I started with Sherwin Williams four and a half years ago part-time, and I gotta say, this was really good back in 2013. I was working almost thirty hours a week and did really well with pay, problems then started after that."
good,"There is a lot of heavy lifting and little room for error during busy times. Zero full time employment, unless management, and only moderately competitive pay."
good,Constant fast pace day helping customers and building work relation ship. Satisfaction with working with others solving issues and making purchasing requests.
good,"This was a good move for me to grasp the experience of an Outside Sales position, as well as Operations Manager experience. Overall, I would say the pay was mediocre for the work needing completed week to week. Worked a lot of extra hours from home, without any additional compensation. The support of management was also mediocre. "
good,"I liked the place, find people that are somewhat competent."
good,"Working in the store can overall be a fun experience, although it does come with many challenges. Challenges would include"
good,in the time that I worked at Sherwin it was great until upper management really messed up the swing of things and got rid of a position that was desperately needed.
good,It was an ok job. The management was generally stressed about the business and I never met anyone more senior than the in-store manager. Very little training involved for a job that's relatively technical with all the products. It was chill and boring some of the times and stressful at others.
good,"pay for part timers is poor for what is asked of them."
good,"It was fun working there at the beginning, but clashing with management became harder to deal with as time went on. Also, it was very hard to advance in the company."
good,"There were more than ten store locations within a 15 min drive from my house. When hired, I did training in a store that was half an hour away with a promise to relocate closer once done. The next store I was relocated to was 45 minutes away. Thankfully it was only temporary floating while they found me a permanent store. However, despite my multiple requests to be set closer to home, the permanent store I was relocated to was 60-70 minutes away. "
good,"Sherwin Williams was a fast paced, demanding and stressful place to work. The employees are underpaid, under appreciated and in certain cases are severely under staffed"
good,The day at Sherwin consisted of putting stock away and taking customer orders. Management is dependent on the chemistry between management and staff..
good,At first working at Sherwin was great the gave lots if hours but this is me coming out of the military. I them found out that I was getting paid way to cheap for the job I was doing. I loved my first manager but after that it was a really bad experience for me
good,hard work for a just a bit over minimum wage and no opportunity for advancement if you do not have a bachelors degree. There are a lot of young college graduates with manager role but lack strong physical work ethic.
good,"did not grow the number of people to perform tasks as the number of stores grew.  The stores are under staffed an turnover is high. Training is on line and employees ""guess"" at right answers"
good,I used to love coming into work when I had a manager who cared about his employees and customers. That all changed when he left and another came in. My current manager is not prepared for this job and it's reflecting on our sales. It gets extremely stressful when you try and sell stuff to a customer and then to realize there is no more product in the store.
good,"Alight place to work, really depends on location of the store. Some locations are busier then others. Very fasted pace, quick learning is a must as well as memorization."
good,"Mostly male work environment. Not a female friendly environment. Is a very physical job. Learned a lot about the industry and feel like I was trained well however, (like all companies) there are many politics involved when moving up the ladder."
good,"Sherwin-Williams is a great place to work if your in college, not so much if your looking for a career and don't have a bachelors degree. I've been there for two years and am unable to advance, in this company because you need a four year degree to make a living. There is a lot of heavy lifting involved with five gallon pails, on the usual you move between 80-200 gallons a day with singles and fives. If you move up and take a key in this company they want you to work at least half the weekends on a job that you can't average more than 28 hours a week in a year. So you sacrifice your weekends to make a bit over minimum wage and not be able to make a living."
good,"Another top performing company with good intentions but poor initiatives. Career growth is dependent on the location of your store and the ability of your shoppers to buy paint at $50-$60 a gallon. In well off suburban neighborhoods this is a fantastic sales approach but in urban areas where household incomes border on the poverty line, its terrible. Most of the money that you want to make comes in the form of quarterly bonuses. Without making these bonuses, which hinge completely on gallons sold and $ per gallon, you end up taking home a very modest salary. The controllable bonus is a decent kicker but you only get that once a year, usually sometime in February for the previous year. The job is a grind, top performers are rewarded with new stores and sales rep positions, and up from there. But those people usually come from store where Duration, Proclassic, Emerald and various other expensive lines are sold in quantity. This is what I noticed in the 3 years I was in the Detroit District. Stores taking accounts from other stores, and then those same people want to act like they don't know why customers are leaving home stores for new ones. To sum it up, there were good sides and ugly sides. If you get hired in make sure you know what store you are going to and fight to stay in area's of high growth and high household incomes. Do not take a store in a poor neighborhood, you will like the title but hate the job."
good,This was not the best job I have had.  The hours were varied and the lack of upward mobility was astounding.  Preferential treatment was given to certain employees.  Many of the employees seemed bitter about having to go to work.  The compensation was pitiful and the lack of benefits was unimpressive.  Management was good at what they did.
good,"A lot of work for not enough pay. Learned how to sell to customers more and how to bump up my customer service. Learned to multitask a lot more while on the phone,customers and online orders coming in. Got to work with a lot more cash and check transactions."
good,While Sherwin-Williams pays you well for your trouble it's not enough to justify the absolute lack of support you receive from upper management.  You are expected to be on call 24/7 regardless of vacation or personal time.
good,"All about numbers and making money for the company, not the store. Unrealistic expectations! Not very good advancement opportunities."
good,Long Hours. Nights and Weekends. If your store is understaffed which most likely is you can find yourself working 13 hour days and not getting paid for it. Bonus structure is soft. Only great thing about the company is its benefits.
good,Fast paced job with emphasis on getting product to contractors to complete their jobs in a timely fashion. The great focus of the team to get the product matched to color specs and the hard work that goes into bringing it all together made the time fly .
good,Learned valuable skills in the chemical industry. Made valuable contacts and learned how to trust your co-workers. Earn a degree if you want to advance.
good,You work 44 hours a week and that includes 4 hours of OT. You don't have a set schedule and you work some weekends if not all as you store manager dictates the scheduling. They don't tell you that most stores are not properly staff and that you will most definitely have some shifts where you are by yourself for hours if not the whole day. You are responsible and for Lead Generation which in a nutshell is cold calling except for those contractors you see day to day so you should have a good relationship with them. You will lift all day ... those five gallons weight about 30 pounds. It really takes a toll on your body. About 90% is physical work. Management is biases they always know who they want in positions before you apply but still encourage you to do so.
good,"Let me start by saying that it is extremely hard to get a full time position for this company.  I have heard rumors that this was a great company to work for.  You can only hired as a temp with promise of 8 months and temps on priduction floor last between 1 day and 3 months on average. Personally I work in the lab and my co workers, most management are great to work with and very compliant although my direct manager has been completely ignorant to myself and almost every other employee. She has gone as far as saying ""Who cares about your kids"" When asked if i could switch shifts 3 weeks in advance because of a child care issue. Her excuses for anything i have asked have been absolutely ridiculous and i have always got a ""No"". Being a temp is hard and it seems like management does not care that they have an ignorant and completely unqualified manager amongst them. I could go on about this particular manager but there is no need. I am grateful for the experience and happy working with my co workers and will probably be more grateful when my time comes to an end."
good,"Good Job with great growth opportunities"
good,"If you like working 52 days more than an average person then SW is for you."
good,Watch your back. Trust no one. Customer service way below standard. Only reason customer s stay is because they are under contract. Warehouse safety a joke. Manager just one lie after another. First twelve years good until management change. A monkey can do what he does and do better
good,"Being short staffed a typical day was very busy and hectic. The staff still was able to complete the demand, which built great relationships with customers and staff."
good,"A typical day at work is assiting customer with their painting needs, helping them decide on colors and getting the right product for their jobs. I have exceled in talking to customers in a professional manner in person and on the phone. Management in our store is great, besides our schedules are constantly changing after it is posted. I am the only co-worker besides my manager and assistant manager. We all work great together. The hardest part of my job is building confidence in our everyday customers. Most people think painting is a ""man's job"". The most enjoyable part is knowing you made a difference in someone elses lives, whether it is picking out paint colors or just talking to them. "
good,"work at 4:00 am, 2 20 min breaks during day, usually leave between 12:00 and 2:00 pm, pulled orders, loaded trucks, some coworkers could not drive forklifts well, they could be a menace to everyone else"
good,"This company keeps adding longer hours with no added employees. Employees are spread thin & in this work, that causes injuries. It is a great entry level job to those that don't mind the hours."
good,This was a great place to work while in college. The district manager did not appear to be someone of a high education or business background.
good,There is always something new to learn everyday. I work with excellent colleagues who are willing to help. What I enjoy most at my work place is working in teams and communicating with vendors both
good,Baseado em ter trabalhado na loja que mas vendia na √©poca a comiss√£o era pouca
good,"It's not a terrible place to work, flexible hours during part time work, nice staff and nice customers or contractors, overall decent place to work. A good starting job."
good,"Sherwin-Williams has a quick paced work environment, lifting upward of 100 lbs., proper cleaning of facilities using appropriate chemicals, and well versed in customer service."
good,Career progression is difficult to achieve in this company but if you want a stable and secure job then this is the place to be. Work/Life balance is a huge problem in a lot of teams and will take a toll on you. Non monetary benefits are good but these come at the expense of below market salaries.
good,Great expert  nice people management horrible and prejudice need  more organizationally and communication skills with employees loved working night shift  was great for my family life
good,"Good place to work as far as employees and work... Management had never done the job they were managing. Cut hours because of a ""law"" but when employees got a second job they would write employee up when They wanted them  to work extra"
good,"This job is not for everyone. If you are looking for good pay and advancement, just forget about it. The company takes to long to get things done and don‚Äôt follow through to what they promise. Get everything in writing and be careful. I did learn a lot and met some great people that I worked with. To bad things didn‚Äôt work out."
good,Always on the go at this job. Fair pay for a college student and flexible work hours for school. Management was kind of off but still okay. There was hardly time to eat lunch.
good,man I don't wanna write a review of this. everyone has their own experience. I was not very good at this job. got harder as it went on. it was not always so bad tho
good,The scheduling and organizational process was not defined well which made it stressful to keep customers satisfied.  My goal was to streamline the process to alleviate having to do the initial job more than once.  The people I worked with were great but did not have the leadership or organization skills to make this happen.
good,I enjoyed working with the contractors and homeowners. I was a female in a male world though and they guys loved treating me that way. I was treated like an idiot all the time.
good,The management is not very good and unprofessional. You are constantly belittled and torn down. You are also interrupted almost every time you speak and every idea you ever have will be thrown out the window.
good,"Toxic employees get to stay despite blatant disregard for authority, common courtesy and basic decency towards coworkers.  Outright refusal to follow instructions and active hostility are just accepted by higher ups due to career length."
good,"Good benefits, easy to work at, managers and development process is chaotic. Reorganization is common. Resource management is poor. Training and opportunity to grow are completely up to you, managers don't develop you. Promotional review board process requires manager to nominate you with accolades and directors compare and award promotion based on merit. You will never get nominated if your manager doesn't like you regardless of your merit/accomplishments."
good,"Sales driven company. Great people to work with and work for. Lots of chances for moving, but they pay for very little to help move you and your family."
good,i dont have anything nice to say about sherwin.  i am only filling in this feild because for some reason I am required to rate them as an employer. I would rather not participate in this.
good,"I had an issue with one of the managers. He was a bit of a hot head. It drove away a lot of hard workers that were good for the company. I was asked to stay at the store after I asked to transfer. I was offered more money to stay on with that manager. I took the offer, but later regretted it."
good,I was let go after almost 3 yrs of servicre. They said I reache'd probotion twice  within a year.  I was not notidied of my first probation. I would say their human resource department needs work.
good,Does not hire enough help.  Overworks employees to the point of mental breakdown. Expects people to just handle it. Needs to hire more help. Promotes from within.
good,Big dumb company with little creativity involved in the day to day. Work between 44 and 50 hours. Not sustainable. Women and minorities advance in order to fill quotas.
good,"Empresa de grande porte, boa de se trabalhar bons benef√≠cios."
good,"Typical day involves helping customers, making deliveries, putting away stock, cleaning, and making sales calls, especially if it's a slower store. Many of the stores are staffed with a bare minimum of employees, so if you work on a weekend, you are usually the sole employee for both days."
good,"while working with this company they did give me a job,But everything I learned was by doing it myself right or wrong and learning,long hours even after work to help deliver or pick up items for customers a lot of the time on my personal time,on your feet 98%"
good,"I worked part-time as a driver and delivery to area store locations and customers"
good,"ok place to work, not compensated enough. opportunities to move around, but have to relocate. has great training and you learn a lot in the business.."
good,"The job pays fairly and the benefits and retirement package is good but you have to get past all the gossip and stabbing each other in the back at work."
good,Regular retail job for the most part. Expectations are higher in this district than essentially any other. Double edged sword in a sense. Summers are brutal
good,"It was quick money due to the fact that they pay weekly, but the work being done was worth more than I was working for. They also worked long days sometimes going over 11-12 hours."
good,"Typical workday consist of Arricing at the store and get orders ready for contractors. Mix paint for DIY customers as well."
good,"It was a steady pay check. I did not like how each day, month, year you had to start all over. If you did well  or outstanding yesterday and had a bad day today you were not good enough. I like hard work but dislike being walked on by management and customers."
good,"falta una estructura empresarial, los puestos claves no son ocupados por personal con experiencia en ellos"
good,A typical day is 8 hours of tedious work that's hard on your back. You learn that you're expected to produce the most compared to to others who are able to do other functions. Management is back and forth on their calls. Typically let down by what they say. The majority on first shift are older people nearing retirement. Sherwin-Williams is desperately seeking new hires but can not hold anyone. The hardest part of the job is keeping up the pace to make production. It's very hard on your back. A lot of people end up on disability for back issues and some with neck issues. Not much enjoyable other than the paychecks
good,Sherwin Williams expects their employee's to live and die SW.  They want the reps to be on the road from 7am-5pm and then spend their personal time working on admin tasks.
good,This place would have been amazing if the manger of the location wasn't a complete idiot. Not really much else to say about it. I would recommend this place since I'm sure he was fired by now.
good,"It's a high volume job that requires someone with good attention to detail. There's a lot involved which can be too much for some people so there's a high turn around. If you can stick through it, and prove reliable you've got a good solid employer."
good,They hire a lot of people but then do not have enough hours for everyone. The people that get scheduled a lot of hours do not go to work and the people that get get scheduled little hours are always working longer than scheduled. everyone works part time even if they are hired full time
good,Shoveled the entrance way. Set up colorants and usually had about 1000 pounds of paint to mix in  the AM . I would check in stock when it came in and put all stock away. I would call do color consulting when needed and delivered paint when needed also.
good,"they treat management great, other hourly or part-time employees not good at all"
good,unstable environment to work in. poor management. stressful. cut-throat and too competitive. No social life or student life outside of work and often scrutinized.
good,"Nice group of people that care about their work. Managers tend to micro manage us which is frustrating. "
good,"Come into the store and help customers while solving problems with our contractors, keep store clean, do batching and cycle counts. Management is great and same with co-workers. Learned sales/management. Hardest part is explaining a problem to a customer and why it is causing this problem."
good,"This is a good company for someone with a degree who wants to move up to a management position quickly.  There is good training for those who are interested.  I am not interested in management, and they don't offer any room for me as far as advancement, hours, and benefits are concerned.  I have enjoyed my work experience with this company, but my current situation requires me to pursue full time work with a reputable company with room to advance.  I would like a base pay and commission."
good,A great place to start your career as a young professional. Sherwin-Williams has an excellent management training program for recent graduates that does a great job of preparing former students for a career in retail. This job has rigorous hours and the overall physical demands can be strenuous.
good,Sherwin Williams is a good Company but there is no room for advancement in the company
good,"meeting to people"
good,"Uma empresa agrad√°vel, transporte fretado, refei√ß√£o, conv√™nios, a equipe muito boa para se trabalhar"
good,"It was nice because you got to know the people that came in almost daily, And it was fun meeting so many new nice people.My boss was a good manager in his own way, And I did learn from him nothing is set in stone, Hard work usually gets noticed. But the hardest thing there is trying to get full time work they dont like to do it."
good,"A typical day at work isn't too busy since this is a new store that has been opened for a 1 year and a half. It consists of taking care of customers, filling orders, opening new commercial accounts, cold calling, and training and development. The hardest part of my job is being away from my family, the most enjoyable part of my job is building relationships with my customers."
good,"14 hour days"
good,Learned how to successful manage a 2 million dollar  branch. Have to deal with unkind contractors and superintendents.
good,competitive environment selling to independent contractors. Difficult to add innovation. Products became commoditized and sales were based too much on meeting the lowest price. Service was valued to a limited extent.
good,Great for teens looking to build their resume. It teaches responsibility as well as helps to improve customer service skills.
good,"atuei como operador de produ√ß√£o 1 na produ√ß√£o de tintas operando cowles,completagem , pesagem, moinho"
good,typical day is based on experience. if just started will be delivery driver and work in the back. once start learning the job you start to mix paint and help customers up front. i learned a lot about paint products and correct ways to use the products and how to apply them. management was the only bad part about the job. co-workers were good and productive while enjoying each others company.
good,Everything was great until my hours where cut and and handed to my co-worker. only getting TWO hours a day.
good,"overall a good place to work, just don't expect to move up in the company."
good,Enjoyed the company and my co workers.was able to complete my task with the help of co workers and really enjoyed the job
good,Sherwin Williams always fucused on training their people to be able to complete the job at hand in the most efficient way possible. They are a big corporation and you must be willing to do all the task they require to advance.
good,Management sucks they definitely don‚Äôt care about employees concerns.. nor do they try and do things to show they appreciate the employees they are all about the money and what they can keep in their pockets vs seeing what they can do to make everybody happy!! A lot of hard work for the drivers yet they don‚Äôt wanna pay nothing!!
good,"Overall a good place to work, unfortunately they are out of touch with the market when it comes to benefits, salary, and management style. A highly competitive field, they do not have the leadership necessary to excel and grow."
good,Nice people to work for. Did not like the fact I was told I would have home time during the week buy I never got any.  Would get home late Friday night and have to leave back out normally on Sunday.
good,"Too much pressure put on us and lack of proper management. Broken machinery doesn‚Äôt get fixed. The pay is decent, but they expect too much. The environment is okay, really dirty job. Paint everywhere. Very strict rules."
good,Working for them part-time is considered a side job due to the average pay and hours that are given with minimal benefits. If you are working inside it's and easy job and if you're doing deliveries then its a hard job due to the intense labor of carrying the heavy products in an efficient time in any weather.
good,Sherwin Williams is a good company to help you go from a job to a career with hard work. Sherwin Williams provides a stable work environment for able bodies employees.
good,It was a nice place to work in. The pace is high and there tends to be very little down time but it's nice to keep moving. Overall it's a chill place to work and not very difficult but the upper management tends to be very slow and not very helpful.
good,"Extremely fragmented corporate structure with no synergy and very limited cross functional communication.  Your personal experience is completely dependent upon your department but most people seem happy."
good,"Good place to start employment history.everyday is a learning challenge, and you be surprised how huge the paint business is.there is paint on everything you can name.there slogan is ""paint the world"""
good,"Ran by women, advised by engineers that have little or no production experience. All have the 'not invented here' mindset. Limited or no upward mobility unless you come from corporate"
good,"I work 8am to 5 pm, there is a lot of emphasis placed on arriving on time, we still have to clock in and out for arrival and for lunch. I have learned a lot about communicating with the customers and collecting money on their past due accounts, I have great coworkers."
good,"Expectations can be unrealistic in comparison to resources and support provided, good benefits, good culture, work life balance is difficult. Good for promotion within"
good,"Typical say requires answering at least a dozen phon calls and helping at least 20 customers in person daily."
good,"Sherwin Williams can certainly be a good career choice as it is generous to high level people who retire, but as a part time job the demands, stress, and responsibility outweigh the barely-above-minimum wage they offer."
good,"For over 150 years, Sherwin-Williams has been a leader in the paint and protective finishes industry."
good,"This company is booming when it‚Äôs booming "
good,If you're not management you are not going to make a living wage. They offer a pretty good health plan but at a price and will consume most of your paychecks.
good,Sherwin Williams gave me the opportunity to enhance my career. Advancement was difficult unless you had a degree. Ones position was always dependent on performance and sales budgets. To be successful one had to be out on the street growing your business every day.
good,"Good Benefits, no room for advancement, poor management, great hours, no weekends. Great pay for the job you do, unless willing to relocate dont look to move up"
good,Job is not the worst but not the best and pay isn‚Äôt great.  Time off in the beginning is only 8 days. 44 hours a week is expected plus weekends.  Need to add more part time employees.
good,L'azienda √® un colosso stabile e sicuro nell'ambito delle vernici.
good,Great fun work environment.  Easy job with little stress. Customers are very friendly and I learned a lot. I would absolutely recommend this job to to a friend.
good,"The training program for Sherwin Williams is top notch. To learn as much as I did in the time that I was training was pretty impressive, but the actual job is not glamorous by any means. It is a lot of physical work and a lot of long hours, depending on your store manager. You do receive bonuses quarterly and yearly based on the performance of your store, which is very nice. The biggest downside of Sherwin Williams is that if you want to advance, you WILL have to relocate. It is not an option. Do not let anyone ever tell you otherwise."
good,"this company has taken micro managing to a new level,employee turn over is high, moral not so great"
good,Mixture of wholesale and retail businesses. Worked with paint and contractors and homeowners. Met a lot of great people.  Corporate atmosphere could be a little stifling.
good,"Empresa multinacional, com filiais no mundo todo,consolidada no mercado brasileiro entre as lideres do segmento."
good,"The company is great to work for with lots of perks when you meet your sales goals. With rapid and continual growth, there is plenty of opportunity for Career advancement if your a driven person. Only downside is the employee turn over, long hours, and stress of meeting customer expectations and sales goals. I enjoyed my time here most of the time, but looking for something with less stress."
good,"Understaffed, Long Hours, Fair Compensation, Poor Work Life Balance. Excellent teams that do the best with what resources are available. Good job security and mostly great customers."
good,"I learned a lot about the business during my time with SW. I was trained well by my first manager and learned a lot. I was a really successful Assistant Manager and Manger and that is due to my initial training when I was first hired. I have made great relationships and still have those relationships to this day. SW was my longest tenured job, but one of the most stressful. Work life balance was tough but it was a tradeoff with the compensation. Being recognized with awards at banquets was very gratifying because you now see the fruits of your labor."
good,Fast paced job extremely stressful you have to make Make Your Mark Daily. Extremely physical job with lots of overtime. Had plenty of money lots of overtime not to work.
good,Money is good but all you are is a body there. All they care about is them numbers 7 days a week for 6+ months is common slavery. Point system is Poor
good,"Sherwin-Williams has a lot of camaraderie in their stores. If you get a store with an awesome crew, you would never feel like its work and the day will go by faster. it's sad that the hours are so limited and that pay its horrible as well and upward mobility is only given to a select few."
good,"Pro: Teaches you a lot about being a manager.  Responsible for every aspect of the store: hiring, ordering, billing, sales, lead generation, customer service, etc."
good,"The other employees were always very nice. the contractors were also very respectful. I liked working for Sherwin Williams, but the job itself was something that i just wasn't interested in at the moment."
good,"Every district manager leaves an impression on their district, good or bad."
good,Insane work hrs 7days a week in the middle of summer 30 days + with no days off no time for summer activities with children and  families. Would be alright if they balanced work and life more.
good,The plant moral could use some work. The employees don't mesh well with management. Supervisors are the middlemen. Decent benefits for non-union employees. 401k and Pension.
good,"The job keeps you busy, you learn alot of product knowledge and how to coordinate colors. Customers are nice usually and are relaxed. It is physically demanding though."
good,"I personally had a pretty good experience at SW. I worked at multiple locations, with some great people and then some.. not so great, but that's everywhere. "
good,"Tons of room for advancement, however currently expanding too quickly causing poor work/life balance. As manager required to work +48 hours weekly, and have little say about location you are placed in. VERY difficult to move to a location closer to home, which increases the gap between work and home life."
good,"You will learn a lot of things from Sherwin Williams.  They have a lot of opportunities to learn about management, sales and operations.  There is a room for growth if you try really hard and look for opportunities."
good,No consistency in schedule which makes work life balance difficult. A lot of pressure on management. Excellent place to learn skills early on in entering the workforce that you will utilize throughout career. Really good benefits. They have embraced a women's club since the early 19th C and is still around
good,If you get hired this is a good place to work but its rough. It requires physical labor. Most facilities don't have AC so you sweat in the summers and freeze in the winters.
good,"Alot of pushing off responsibilities onto new employees.No work life balance,,,,not enough money for the work involved. Hard work not enough benifits."
good,Communication can use improvments. A lot of teams that dont really communicate with each other. Business is done differently in each group. No streamlining of a simple process.
good,"Hectic all the time, contractors mostly. Nice people. Management has much to improve on including relations with employees. Best co-workers you could ask for. From 7am to 2pm it's non stop. Depends on your store and area though. Best part was the customers. Wonderful hard working people. Having a 401k as a part time employee was great."
good,They don't pay enough but the people are cool. Dispatch is in another state and do not have sufficient knowledge of local maps and areas. Can be difficult to communicate with them.
good,"Sherwin-Williams is good place to work if you don't mind the slow pace at the store. They pay you well, but they don't really train you, you have to really think on your feet at times and learn their products."
good,Enjoyed working there until we started a family then time with them became difficult due to low employee staff. Working long hours and weekends because someone would call in sick.
good,"Management tries their best to be fair to employees from what I‚Äôve seen, but corporate greed means low pay for hourly and full time, thus, high store turnover.  Customers are promised out-of-this-world pricing by sales reps to close the deal, then find that their pricing goes up regularly, again, due to SW corporate greed, leaving the unprepared paint-mixing store workers to be argued with by irate customers. Reps end up throwing store workers under the bus to bolster themselves, which creates resentment."
good,"This job served me for what it was: a paycheck. Outside of that, i don't know that i would suggest it unless you love sales and/or love paint. All in all, they treated me well. I have no real complaints. The immediate people that i worked with were great."
good,"Either you're doing way more than you're supposed to do, which is more than you can do, or you're frustrated that things aren't getting done. For new graduates, MT program might be okay to learn a bit about general work and client service. Hours aren't great as an Assistant manager. Working with part-time employees can be frustrating."
good,"Arrive at the store early, greeted my fellow employees."
good,Good company. Stressful hours can make good money but lose it all very fast. Can make a good career out of it but you will also need to move at somepoint to further your career.
good,No opportunities to advance within company. If you're looking to move up start as an MTP.  All the stores seem to be competing with each other rather than other paint companies. Benefits and salary are nice incentive to work here.
good,Enjoyed working there just wasn't provided with enough hours to live on. Manager was a little rude but overall good environment. I would recommend people to shop at the port orchard Washington store
good,"Advancement was limited greatly by quotas. NO LOYALTY AT ALL over 10 years of honesty, integrity, professionalism meant nothing in the end. This is one veteran that wishes they had been honest in the beginning and I could have served somewhere else."
good,"Mark stock items using identification tags, stamps, marking tools, or other labeling equipment."
good,"Jornada laboral muy buena, horarios de trabajo incomodos"
good,I learned alot about running a business but its more to it than they were offering looking forward to doing marvelous things going forward so I had to move on.
good,This is a great job to gain experience but is not conducive to a family lifestyle. Gives you the skills needed to advance your career. They offer a well rounded benefit package to full time employees.
good,It is a good job overall. The main problems are with the management. There are several discrepancies in scheduling and micromanagement is an issue. I also feel that we don't always hire the best people. Some orders and tasks get confused often as well.
good,"It takes several months of training and learning about the products to feel confident in helping customers with the various products. There's also responsibilities including unloading trucks and stocking products using forklifts and pallet jacks, sales using a register, learning painting techniques and correct application products such as brushes and paint sprayers."
good,"I worked for this company for 3 years at two different stores. I worked as a Sales Associate. This company does not pay nearly enough for how difficult the work is, how much garbage you have to put up with, and considering how much each store brings in. Over my 3 years of working there the prices went up regularly about every 3-6 months, while your wage stays the same. It makes it really uncomfortable to try and sell a nearly $70 gallon of paint to someone, I eventually just started to recommend to people to wait for a sale because of the ridiculous prices.There is not really any opportunity for advancement in this company and the starting rate is relatively low. It seems the only thing the CEO and upper management care about is the stock price, and could care less about the people who actually make them the money."
good,"Good paying job, but bad equipment and work environment. If you like working 7 days a week, then you will like it at Sherwin Williams."
good,"Very secure company, great position if you love working with all kinds of people.  Very fast-paced at times, and heavy lifting is required for success.  Must be a people person."
good,Came back to Sherwin Williams after being gone for several years.  The culture has changed dramatically. Over time for salaried employees has always been expected 48 hour work week for managers. I had entirely to many 65 hour plus work weeks not including 2 plus hours commute time.
good,You learn the difference between the paint products and what they all have and do. The management is full of knowledge and helps you learn quickly. Co workers are friendly and easy to get along with everyone helps everyone. The hardest part is when a customer isnt happy with the product or would rather buy else where do to the price. Most enjoyable is when you make a customer happy and every time they come back they ask specifically for you.
good,It was okay for the moment. Wasn't always bad but wasn't always good either. Met some good people. Worked very hard. Under all weather conditions. Made good over time money when hired in after a year as a temp.
good,"Delivering hundreds of gallons of paint and supplies to job sights was a normal occurrence. It was good experience delivering large company orders to out of town locations, and operating a heavy machinery such as a forklift in very tight spaces. Toughest challenge was single handedly organizing a very cluttered warehouse, but results proved very helpful and productive for the business."
good,"Poor organization, very hot work environment, employees not treated equally, nothing given as promised when adquiring job, dont have the correct tools or parts available to do the job right, and machine operators make as much or more than the mechanics, which mechanics should make more. Also no formal training or orientation when starting job. No teamwork whats o ever, leads are rude ,need to learn how to treat people with respect and value the hard work done."
good,"Typical day includes ringing out customer sales of mixed/tinted paint, lifting or moving gallons of paint buckets. I've learned the types of paint and rollers. Hardest part of the job is the rush and rude customers. Most enjoyable part of the job is satisfying a customer's paint/color needs."
good,I learned the most about how to sell at Sherwin Williams. They had the most extensive training and required activities during my time there.
good,"Wish a store that had over 1 million dollars in sales would have at least 1 full time employee (not including manager, asst manager.) Because of the lack thereof, after 1 year I still am a part-time employee. All year I was told a full-time spot will be open when the new year starts, but didn't happen. Plus since I was worked so much at the start of my employment, I averaged 8-9 hours a week for the final 2 months of my first 1 year term of employment."
good,"Love my job I have 38 branches with 200+ employees under me, on a typical day I give direction to the branches all day long.  I love the HR part of my job Offer Letters, Job Postings and Terminations.  The hardest part of my job at this moment is they made the Admins part time starting 1/25/2016 loosing our benefits. My family is more important then the job and need full time and benefits."
good,Hardworking place that require drive and motivation. Everyday you learn something new and useful to help further my experience. The days are also well spent with management that trust in you to do what's right in the store. There are times that customers start to flood the store but my helpful coworkers and I always stay cool and approach the situation accordingly.
good,it is a good starting job with great day to day assignments and a good work enviroment. Only downside is that there is no possibility of advancement from this position.
good,"I appreciate that I have had the opportunity to work for a Fortune 500 company at Sherwin Williams, however it has many pitfalls in the advancement of its employees and their welfare. "
good,"Buena, es una empresa a nivel mundial muy reconocida, donde el campo de aprendizaje es amplio."
good,Sherwin Williams was a relaxed place to work.  I did not have someone breathing over me to get  my work done.  I feel this is very important to increased production and good employee morale.  I would recommend Sherwin Williams as a competitive employer.
good,"√â uma empresa resiliente porem muito tradicional e com processos muito antigos. E que no momento passa por uma transforma√ß√£o em suas bases."
good,Very unhappy with the management and their treatment of the hourly employees.
good,"- Sherwin-Williams operates in a variety of retail, commercial and industrial segments throughout the global economy.  My affiliation and knowledge base lies within the retail and commercial segments of the manufactured coatings industry.  Typically, this involves working with commercial/industrial contractors and homeowners to achieve their professional and personal coating needs.  Product recommendations/troubleshooting, personalized service and pricing considerations are the primary components of this aspect of my job.  In addition, inventory management, new employee training, following environmental and EPA regulations, and the proper operation and maintenance of company resources are essential components of my job.  "
good,"A typical day at work includes: customer service, inventory management, placing orders, receiving orders, problem solving, matching colors, mixing paint, etc.  I have learned alot about how to talk to people and how to confront people when necessary.  Management needs to relearn what it was like to work in the store.  They need to get back into touch with their employees."
good,"Very fast paced , hard work, co workers were helpful, the hardest part of the job was mixing the paint, I learned there was a lot more about what goes into paint."
good,"Sherwin Williams is a good company that provides steady work for its permanent employees. I learned a good deal about what it takes to make the Cadillac Of Paints. My co-workers were the greatest. Always helpful, truthful and patient."
good,"The Sherwin-Williams Company will put you in a role and there you will stay until your retire. Doesn't matter if you do a good job or not, they just don't want to re-fill your position. Compensation is low in comparision to other companies BUT you'll always have a job."
good,OK business but not for proactive and motivated employee. Advancement limited due to wealth of older employees who refuse to advance - blockers for upcoming leaders
good,"Working with the Sherwin-Williams paint stores has been a good experience. My time this past school semester was accommodated with workable hours and time for necessary projects. I'm taking some time off from school to find either another part time job, or steady full time work."
good,"I managed inventory and resolved customer issues by providing quick, thoughtful solutions."
good,"I can honestly say this has been one of the worst jobs I have had, never before have I been conscious of my gender as I was while working at Sherwin. It definitely is a man's world and unfortunately I am not a man."
good,"A typical day at work involves accurately filling customer orders while following company policies on billing, shipping and customer service. I have learned much under current management as they let me undertake a managerial role on many occassions, which has allowed me to develop skills in the field of management. I enjoy working with management as well as my co-workers because we all work together to reach certain goals. The hardest part of my job is sometimes dealing with disgruntled customers, but we always find a solution.The most enjoyable part of my job is that I have the opportunity to meet different people everyday. Overall, it is a good company, but there is not much room for advancement and I am looking to develop a career in business management that will allow to develop new skills while highlighting my current skills."
good,"Most people were good to work with, but upper management seemed disconnected with those at the store level.  Some decisions upon advancement can be very political."
good,its easy to get stuck in a routine at this job which is not bad  thing but the hrs could be a lot better and so could the way management treat employees
good,Very large work load for very small pay.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers.  The hardest part of the job is the loss of connection from the executives to the field.
good,Great benefits. Culture and ethics is not in the fore front.  All branches are not on same accord. Cultural disrespect is a norm. I would not recommend at level entry.
good,You learn a lot about Paint. 90% customer service and customer help. This job does offer nice exposure to different avenues in the business world. Its great for networking and moving on to a better company.
good,Mainly dirty work while in a uniform so it doesn't make sense to have one I could understand a t shirt. Work with a lot of customers based on construction of drywall and painting obviously.
good,Hard work for low pay but it wasn't too bad..clean and nice building what else can you expect in Richmond ky I dont know what else to say..there were some jerks who worked tjere..in fact most were jerks.
good,"I start my day lifting paint and delivering paint to different locations. You meet up with clients to receive their paint buckets and products. It's not that hard of a job,but they could pay you more for it."
good,"Fun job, loved being out on the road, picking up and making deliveries. Everyone I worked with in and around were cool and fun. Overall a fun job, I miss it and I would go back if the pay was better."
good,"Sherwin Williams MTP Program is focused on sales, operations, marketing, and financial analysis. This is a old school business with lots of growth opportunities, unfortunately, it is not a 21st century company."
good,"Pay could be better, management is bad, sometimes rude customers, easy to learn trade skills and construction. Long hours 6 days the week, and biweekly pay."
good,"Upper management gives you unrealtic goals that are impposible to meet, in the interview they tell you this is YOUR business, but you follow their rules and regulations"
good,"Sherwin williams is WORK!! it's not hard work but it is work and you stay active. The stores are micromanaged by district managers that sit behind a desk sending emails via their district coordinator. They only allow you to hire 2-3 associates to work at the store aside from the manager and asm and then they think it's okay to leave one person to open/close the store. No CAMERAS, no SECURITY, no SAFETY. I sat in the store numerous nights and closed the store alone because of being understaffed. The pay is decent but for how much work we do, it is not enough. I worked hard for this company for two years and when I needed to relocate with the company because of my fiance's job, I was left out to dry. Left a bad taste in my mouth and I would not go back. I was sold a dream about how SW looks out for their employees and sadly this did not hold up to be true."
good,Had a poor leader as a manager. Not Honest and hardly worked. He took credit for everything but never did one thing.  Always late and never concentrated on work but outside activities.
good,"Sherwin still struggles to promote women, particularly over the age of 40."
good,"This has been the easiest work I've done the only downside is too much overtime, but if you're looking to make money this would be a good place for you"
good,"No overtime, but you will start as part time and will have to work long enough to move up to full time. If you work here watch your back because everyone will eat you out to get your position."
good,"Don‚Äôt work to hard. There is no reward and the pay is in between good and horrible your experience really depends on the store you work at. ...........................,.................................."
good,"Ultimately a good experience, but the 50 plus hours every week takes a toll, and eventually will burn you out. Advancement opportunities exist, but at the whim of fickle leadership that almost never seems to look for diversity and inclusion."
good,Job is easy but be prepared to work in hot conditions very very hot conditions. Don't know what else to say other than it is very hot in the buildings.
good,Very fast pace and a great group of people to work with every day. Some days the job is very stressful and other days it's fun to work with the guys on the floor.
good,"Sherwin is the epitome of the good ol boys club. If you're in the club it's great. It's not simply how good you at your job. It's how much is somebody higher up endorsing you. Sort of like a political campaign. Either you hate it, or you love it. No in between. For what it's worth I learned a ton about the industry and a lot about myself personally and professionally while working for SW."
good,"Under new management, questionable qualifications. Lack of room for advancement, only 17 employees. Typically 8 hour work days, minimal overtime. Occasional Saturdays."
good,Market rate compensation and benefits. Lots of problems to solve. Fast paced environment. There are some opportunities to do interesting work if you are proactive.
good,Good company with Solid Pay and good benefits.  Way To many initiatives and too much micromanagement. Adavancement very tough once you‚Äôve reached your ‚Äúceiling‚Äù or not willing to move.  They will give you reasons why you didn‚Äôt get promoted but do the exact opposite with people they do promote. Work load for managers as compared to most sales reps is not even close and is not compensated as such. District management will act like they care but no help will given when really needed. Long hours and very poor work life balance. But like I said decent pay and benefits so...
good,"This is a daily grind type of job. You'll do the same thing everyday. The work isn't challenging and there's little opportunity for advancement. It's a safe/stable job, but if you're looking for more, it's not for you."
good,nice job no advancement right away easy work been there 4yrs as a temp they hire who they want to full time skipping over people that have been there not fair
good,Was a very hot and dry place to work. You had to be fast paste they had a certain amount of boxes that had to be packed each day a different number. They were 7 days a week when I worked there 8 hours a day. You never had time for your family. Sherwin Williams was basically my 2nd home
good,Great paying job with great benfits. Rotating shifts with forced overtime 12 hour days plus weekends. Management is running the place horribly. Facility is covered in safety hazards.
good,good overall company but it has limited advancements in pay and position changes after you reach a certain position aka full time sales coordinator. stressful work environment as well. Great part time job for people that just want a paycheck. If you plan to advance and don‚Äôt have a degree then you‚Äôre going to plateau.
good,"Sherwin Williams was a great company to work with, and easy to move up with as long as you are willing to move. My work life balance was basically all work, if you are a manager. I would work from 7 to 7 on a daily basis. Turnover is high due to corporate managers not knowing how to manage there employees."
good,"Had a great job and good relationship with manager and then several upper management changes happened. After that the overall environment changed and it became more of a finger pointing, skapegoat game of chance..."
good,stay focous on your goals. keep in mind it a job and I wouldn't not try to become friends with co-workers. Stay focus on your goals/dreams. this place is a business not a club.
good,Empresa Multinacional padr√£o para se trabalhar com bons profissionais e oportunidades para aprendizado.
good,"If you are looking for job security, you can't beat this company.  If you're looking for a salary equal to the work you are actually doing, this isn't for you."
good,Sherwin is a solid company that provides job security.   The typical day at work was arrive and determine deliveries for the day.  Check in with supervisor for any orders that need special paint mixes.  Prepare orders and make deliveries.  Organize signed invoices and return to manager to file.  If deliveries end early than I would make sales calls to work on additional businesses.  I would also restock the paint room by ordering and putting away new inventory in the warehouse.  The hardest part of my job was Chicago traffic and the most enjoyable part of my job was working with customers.
good,"Tough Culture. Only the strong survive."
good,Decent job. Boring at times. Manager needs some training on managing employees and communication skills when talking to employees as well as pitching in more wit physical work in store and not procrastinating. Part time works more weekends than anyone and not enough hours to live on
good,Your asking me to rate a company that I worked for 28 years ago which is not fair to me or Sherwin Williams. They have been a vendor and competitor for many years. They have excellent products and service.
good,Sherwin Williams was fun at the start but with short staff and many deliveries needed to be taken it took a long time to learn about things inside the store.
good,"Depending on location you will have a variety of hard workers and those who do not. "
good,I liked working there. I enjoyed working with my co works.Everyone gets along. It's like family. I learned alot of things about paint.they treat temporary employees just like the full time employees.
good,"Ambiente conservador, com razo√°vel comunica√ß√£o, equipe bem din√¢mica e integrada, ger√™ncia com n√≠vel intermedi√°rio de atua√ß√£o com alto n√≠vel de exig√™ncia, a equipe faz a diferen√ßa nos resultados."
good,"Production Supervisors are stuck in the middle of management and the hourly union workforce. Supervisors get little support from management and are expected to to care of everything. Equipment is ran continuously until it malfunctions, and maintenance rarely has the parts needed to repair the equipment in a reasonable time frame. There is rarely enough money allocated to the plant budget to keep parts in stock. The pay is good, but you have to work long hard hours to get it."
good,"Busy work environment. Learned how to negotiate sales to increase revenue."
good,Would pick and pull orders to fill that would need to be shipped out to customers Also would work in there rework department reworking orders that did not get filled and picked correctly.
good,"Typical day is fast paced, you over worked. Management is not helpful. There is not really a helpful training program for new hires. Not very many opportunities for advancement if you did not go through the MT program."
good,Management tries to lead with fear and intimidation.  Many ideas such as lean and 6 sigma are partially utilized making it difficult to sustain improvements. Lots of management turnover creating a constant state of chaos.
good,"If you have ever read Yertle the Turtle, this book explains how the culture has become, pilling more on the little guys. Work more with less resources and staff. Still on DOS computer systems which are slow and outdated. Mostly male dominated upper management with favortism towards those who hit numbers.  Unfair and unethical Loss Provention policies force good employees out."
good,"Solid company, ethical, fair, leadership possesses good vision. Competitive  benefits, especially bonuses, 401k and pension. Though, in order to be promoted, employees are expected to relocate several times."
good,"Management is terrible on so many levels that I am not even going to get into it. There is favoritism and you deal with a lot of chemicals that will probably kill you after years of exposure (you should get paid more considering), but there aren't many jobs in the high desert that will pay up to 20 an hour without a degree.  The company doesn't care about the work life balance, as you are expected to be there every day, even in the summer time (peak season) where you are working crazy hours of overtime. You'll be making a bunch of money but you won't have any time to spend it."
good,The job can be stressful at times.  I enjoyed learning different positions within the facility.  Management had their favorite employees. Everyone was not treated equally. Employees would make suggestions on how to improve their areas and nothing would change. Facility manager cared more about his financial goals than the safety of his emplyees. Their was a lot of negative feedback from co-workers. The hardest part of the job was juggling customer service with the other job duties. The customer always comes first.  The most enjoyable part of my job was I was given the opportunity to do learn different positions within the facility.  I like to be challenged.
good,"great place to work. wish there was a better work life balance as a store manager. benefits are great, some of the people are awesome as well. Hours can be long some times"
good,"You will do more paint mixing than managing."
good,"A typical day would include working on users cases and problems that require attention. Administration of various servers and projects being worked by the group. Learning new processes, working with GitHub, Puppet, Linux were all interesting and exciting to me. I enjoyed working with the team and in an environment that allowed for brainstorming and exchange of ideas."
good,The company initiatives are very redundant and the days in the store seem to run into each other.  A typical day in the store will involve dealing with paint contractors and homeowners
good,go to work and mix paint  i would work 12-6 everyday after class to make extra money on the side because i needed to pay rent and pay for bills and diesel
good,"Fun job, good work environment.  Exposure to vocs without proper protection.  Heavy materials. "
good,"I had several managers during my time with Sherwin-Williams. My first was wonderful. He was laid back and trusting. Second was harsh and narrow-minded, but mostly fair. Third was short-tempered and occasionally destructive, but also fair. 4th was manipulative and cut-throat."
good,"Beyond the mentioned above, high expectations set by management with little resources to achieve. High management turn around means you need to able to easily adjust. Unless you're a woman or have a degree chances are you will not advance in the company, at least not for the foreseeable future."
good,"Having never had in depth education regarding paint myself, the company did well to properly train new employees in products sold. The limited number of employees allowed for better development of cooperation between colleagues and increased productivity."
good,I'm dedicated to staff and enjoy working around others although it seems like i have always dealt with competition for moving up the ladder seem to be held down by emotions I believe working with a team built organization would help me grow
good,Soy de empresa interna que trabaja hacia sherwin williams se obtiene mud√≥ mas beneficio x la empresa q un contratista
good,A typical day at Sherwin Williams is very fast paced. Always in and out or on your feet helping customers with products. Overall its a nice place to work.
good,"Most days required overtime, which can take a beating on you after 20+ hrs a week."
good,"Great pay!!"
good,The company really tries to take care of its employees but the hours are long and there isn't much help from upper management when things aren't going well.
good,Sherwin Williams started as a good place to work and said they respected family life but when it is all said and done they couldn't care less about employees family life.
good,Sherwin Williams is a great corporation.  The local DC management was demanding and less than professional in most cases.  The management structure is set up so that the site manager for the DC reports to the site manager of the manufacturing plants.  The plants will produce more paint than the distribution center can unload and then be angry when the DC can not get enough empty trailers back the plants.  Site manager of the DC has absolutely no control of what comes in so the number of employees needed in inconsistent so hourly workers are forced in to overtime situations too often.
good,"Great place or a person just graduating college and getting into the workforce. Opporunity for advancement and to learn about business. This is the closest yuo will get to owning your own business without the risk of investing your own funds. the company allows the individual stores to seemingly run independently however, they are under the coorporate umbrella. Definetly will teach you alot about business"
good,"No work/life balance, Good benefits, "
good,Sherwin Williams was a good place to work until recent continuous management changes.  Work environment change from being a team to every department and every shift looking out for theirselves.
good,Great place to work but advancement is very limited.  Very family oriented environment with almost monthly planned activities and events planned for the families of employees.  Mandatory overtime is also often given the day before without much notice at all.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of helping customers choose products that they need to complete a project."
good,I have worked for this company for two and a half years. I have served in a few different capacities during my time at S-W and have worked my way up to store management. I currently work for this organization.
good,"My co-workers in the warehouse for the most part were pretty good people, but there were those that would cheat the system just to get there production numbers. Operations manager does nothing to prevent this from happening because all they are concerned about is getting production numbers from their shift to make themselves look good to their manager. Constant heavy lifting of 50 to a 100 pounds. Got a chance to work in office and my co-workers there were very snooty, unhelpful, and if you aren't in their click you get black balled. Basically you better kiss butt very well or you wont fit in! Wouldn't recommend anyone to work for this company unless you need the money and benefits."
good,The things you learn in a business sense with SW are excellent. But the work/life balance is non-existent. You work entirety too hard for what you paid. Under appreciation from upper management is discouraging.
good,Driving for Sherwin Williams was a nice part-time job. I got to be out and about and learned my way around the greater Charlotte area.
good,Typical corporate structure. I've progressed fairly quickly but too much pushing the corporate agenda and not enough acknowledgment of accomplishments.
good,It was okay just not my forever company. The caliber of individuals you deal with on a daily basis can be very stressful. Just need to make it a better environment for women.
good,"Results based company.  very hard to fire someone so be careful with who you hire to work in your store.  Customer is always right, make your sales calls and follow up and do what you say you will do and you'll be fine.  Hit your numbers two years in a row and you will be promoted."
good,Sherwin was a good place to gain experience in customer service within a fast paced work environment. I would recommend it for more entry level positions and experience.
good,"Union and seniority biased job, 10+ years of employment before one truly see adequate benefits. Great job if your single with no children and willing to be moved to any given shift with little to no notice."
good,"Lots of lifting. It's a great transition job, but may not be a great job to stay in. I learned a lot about paint and stain, which was very fun. My managers were so great, and I loved working there because of that. A few of my coworkers were very delightful, and others were really hard to work with. Hardest part of the job is lifting a lot of weight. Most enjoyable part of the job was having fun with coworkers, getting to know contractors, and making stain matches"
good,"The company promotes that it promotes from within, however they were prefer to hire young and degreed. Typically the young and degreed come from outside the company. Once your in make friends in high placed and you will go fare. "
good,"Typical day at work:"
good,I learned good team work. Things around there ran smoothly and there was always room to grow.
good,Nice company that means well. Poor management. I was told multiple promises that were never seen all the way through on their part.
good,"This job wasn't that bad. I actually like working there, but when it came to winter time business was slow. I just couldn't get by with the hours I was getting. Unless you were full-time you couldn't get the hours."
good,"Working at Sherwin Williams is a balance of antiquated methods to gain sales with the ability to manage a warehouse, people, customer service and the needs of each individual account that vary on how they are serviced."
good,"Empresa que investe em treinamentos, por√©m as oportunidades s√£o sempre em outros estados, pois a ger√™ncia √© antiga aqui na Matriz Nordeste (Recife), pol√≠tica arcaica, gestor com mil pia de mercado e sem forma√ß√£o."
good,A typical day will start with our commercial customer who comes in for there morning coffee to start their day. While drinking there coffee we gain some conversation of what they have in store for there day. During the conversation there order is being prepared by me or one of my associates. Once there order is finished we help them if needed with there merchandise to there car. That is the beginning of our day. My position in-title more responsibility during a work day. The position as third key withheld responsibility of opening and closing during store hours. All associate also had to have forklift training and no how to handle hazardous materials which we took tests for. When we receive our weekly truck of merchandise we will have to be able to unload the truck with a forklift into inventory. Once our merchandise is received and counted for it's stocked in the warehouse and  showcased on the show room floor. That was the hardest part of the job. The easy part was to prepare the orders when there were customers in the store. What I enjoyed was interacting with different customers throughout the day. My co-workers was the reason why twelve years went by so fast working there. They made the work seem effortless by keeping a positive vibe at the workplace.
good,"I was a sales associate, my task consisted of mixing, selling and delivering the product."
good,I joined Sherwin-Williams knowing absolutely nothing about paints and primers. Over my days of training I've learned more than what I would have expected. With that being said I can now recommend paints and primers tailored to the customer's needs.
good,"learned how to match colors, good co-workers, nice manager"
good,"Basically I supply 6 to 8 lines with materials neeted to produce rollers daily, and return unused materials back to the warehouse by sxanning item in and out of locations.  Shrinkwrap finished product and scan pallets to shipping dock for shipping. keeping my work area clean, Bail cardboard, loading trucks. My co-workers are wonderfurl peaple to work with. Wery helpful, and great team players. The hardest part of this job is the driving distance and the shift.(2nd)"
good,"During my time at Sherwin Williams i had the opportunity to travel to different places in the southwestern ontario region which helped with my current job. Sherwin Williams was a good place to work, however my position there held no terms of advancement."
good,"The people in this company typically started in the warehouse and worked their way, so they love the company. However, if you are not willing to put work before family, don't apply. Everyone in power is single or has a work at home wife."
good,"Offers a good wage with better benefits.  I Learned much about the sales process and how to manage a business including building relationships, Profit and Loss reports and executing initiatives to reach budgeted goals."
good,worked long hours
good,"A typical day consists of helping painting contractors and retail customers choose color, product, sheen, and all sundry items needed to complete any painting project. I would answer phones to take orders, place and complete orders in point of sale system, help customers choose color and wallpaper, tint and shake paint, make drawdowns for contractors, put all stock away, and complete cycle counts. Depending on the manager, they can either be a team player and help our, or delegate work to others. Depending on the co-worker, they can either be a team player or work on his own. The hardest part of my job was dealing with rude and degrading customers and all of the manual labor. The best part of my job was learning more about paint."
good,"Sherwin Williams overall is a great company to work for with solid job security, great work hours, and paid vacation/holiday. A typical day at work includes helping customers, creating new job accounts, and assisting contractors in a timely manner. The hardest part of my job is working in hot warehouse conditions."
good,Nice company with pretty good benefits and some good people to work with. Would be nice if some flexibility in time and place is provided to employees. Secured job.
good,"Decent job, minimum wage for part time starting employees. The employees were very kind and welcoming. Management was okay definitely needs improvement. Clients and customers were fun to work with."
good,A typical day at work includes helping customers and mixing paints for contractors and customers. Making sure accounts are set up and charged properly as well.
good,A typical day at Sherwin consists of getting materials ready for production lines.  There is not a bad job in the facility.  The problem is the lack of growth potential within the Massillon plant.
good,"Sherwin helped teach a lot of good lessons. Team building, problem solving and customer service. Although for the pay they expected too much. Part timers are expected to know almost as much as the managers but with half the pay. Advancement within the company is readily available though and you can move up quite easily."
good,Working at Sherwin Williams was a rewarding and educational experience  for me during my time there as a sales associate during my summer prior to going to college.
good,"putting something here because i have to.  I have nothing good or bad to say about the company as a whole.  if you wish to work here, good luck.  If you don't thats fine too"
good,Job is not complicated but there is a lot of micromanagement. Turnover is extremely high but upper management doesn't seem to care too much. There is room for growth in the company but not a lot of personal professional growth. The tech used is very old and management does not encourage you learning new ways to improve the system. If you are OK with learning basics in excel and answering calls than this is a perfect job for you. If you really want to learn financial analysis than this is not the right work place.
good,"some co-workers are down to earth and give the sense of community, others run to management and play victim to get their way. Management does seem to have favorites but if you lay low everything is usually fine."
good,The training is very good and you are able to learn various jobs. Daily meetings were held before starting work.  This allowed any issues/concerns to be raised in a group setting.
good,pass over for jobs very political and kiss but company everyone forgets about the little guys or gals in the company. cant get ahead at all stupid raise system ttoo
good,"Overall it's  a good place to work, but some of the managers aren't good. It can be a tough job. Managers need better training so they can provide better training to all employees."
good,"Awesome placed to work, a lot to learn a normal day included a lot of tickets, related to my field of work."
good,It‚Äôs a job that pays the bills good money for being close to home  good people there to work with on the manufacturing floor  fun and enjoyable work atmosphere
good,Sherwin Williams was a decent starting job to learn sales and warehouse management. worked there for 9 years and enjoyed it very much until they changed management at my location.
good,"Great pay, management wasn't the greatest, and for someone that was more than qualified, it seemed not very promising to be able to move up in the company."
good,"Conservaci√≥n, control y expedici√≥n de mercanc√≠as y productos, recepci√≥n de mercanc√≠a, atenci√≥n al cliente, elaboraci√≥n de pedidos, apoyo en rutas de distribuci√≥n o reparto."
good,"It is a great working environment, always an opportunity to move up in the company. There is so much support especially from the women's resource group. You can learn so much from this company from business practices to how to build lasting customer relationships."
good,"It was alright at first, but the management there is clueless and the Human Resource people are the same everywhere...useless. A lot of the problems that we had were simple mistakes that could of been prevented if things were automated. Instead everything is done manually which leaves a lot of room for human error. But wonder why spills keep occurring . Also do not expect to be properly trained, because they do not take the time to train you; but expect you to go out and do the job after two days of training."
good,Precisione pagamenti discreta retribuzione servizio mensa e lavanderia
good,Company is over all good. Lots of work and lots of locations in Calgary . Very busy store without all the customers in and out! A little overwhelming at first but things work out good after that.
good,"When hired, I was trained in a store that was 30 minutes away with a promise to relocate closer once training was complete. The next store I was relocated to was one hour away. It wasn‚Äôt until after I trained at multiple locations, I was placed at a store still 45-60 mins away. However, despite my multiple requests to be set closer to home, the permanent store I was relocated to was 60-70 minutes away."
good,"Sherwin Williams offers a lot of movement and advancement. They advance people so quickly however, it is important to learn on your own when catapulted to a new position and needing to be successful very early on. Upper management does not get too involved unless necessary but the work load is very heavy and high expectations from those above. Relatively stressful job interacting with customers while trying to juggle the many jobs given and expected to complete on a daily basis."
good,"My experience while working at Sherwim-Williams overall, was a mostly positive experience. I can say that it was a pretty pleasant work environment and the position I held was interesting and engaging."
good,"Great benefits and they pay you well. Work-home balance is way off,  very hard work, Mental and physical. For some people, it is easy to move up and for others it's very hard."
good,"Boys club. Lots of hours, including a lot of weekends. Sales goals and cold calls are expected. CAn be fun to paint stuff and look at colours and design. hard to work with contractors ."
good,"Pretty good job just not enough work for me . Not enough pay to start . Easy work , a lot of friendly people , not enough supervision. A lot of people with out experiences."
good,"I loved my job here, but I had an awesome manager. The company is a little like a cult. But my only issue and why I ended up leaving was the location I was working at didn't need a full timer and I didn't want to relocate. Also, they prefer their managers and assistant managers to have degrees. So if you dont it's a lot more difficult to move up in the company."
good,"Hours are good, very flexible.  Pay was decent. Be prepared to be sexually harrassed by customers if you're a female.  Company isn't very female friendly."
good,"If you want to relocate, this is the job for you but it may not be in the places you would like to move. The pay is pretty good for a recent graduate but eventually you‚Äôll want to make more. The job is cool, it‚Äôs easy. If you want something challenging this may not be the job for you. I sat around most days, occasionally helping walk in customers and sorting orders for the accounts. "
good,You work with contractors by calling or seeing them face to face to build relationships. It could be a good environment however this depends on the management team. Constant lifting and on your feet for most of the time.They only care about the company and wont blink to replace if needed.
good,They take care of you well through benefits. The job itself is physically demanding and shouldn't be considered by everyone. There is plenty of opportunity to move up through the company if you're willing to relocate.
good,Paint business is a hard business to be in. Must rely on in store support to help train and learn. Must be able to work with contractors and painters also
good,Previous management was not very attentive to employee concerns and needs but from what i know of the new management those issues have been resolved..
good,"It's a good place for people to go work at, I just had a hard time working night time. The pay is good and the raises are even better it is a good workplace overall"
good,Just checking a block to progress to next menu. First sentence wasn't enough so I'm typing a second sentence. Looks like a third complex sentence was the ticket to meet minimum required characters to progress to next menu.
good,"Horrible upper management, and no real chance of advancement. Constantly doing tasks outside of what I should have had to (assistant manager and managers tasks)"
good,Added to the teams goals in terms of sales and store front operation. Spent several months employed while transitioning throughout my collegiate career.
good,"Lots of training provided by company, decent advancement opportunities are availabe. Benefits are top-notch, but basic pay is low in comparison to the amount of work/hours that must be put in."
good,"Long hours, low pay, no full time, and impossible to move up or get full time in the company. Worked as a DPS for a year and a half to end up being told I was not moving up nor would I be able to anytime soon. Fun company, but not worth the low pay."
good,"It was a good company to work for, the culture is a bit challenged but it pretty much is at all manufacturing plants and warehouses. The pay is fair, overtime is steady."
good,This company makes millions off the backs of part-time employees. They offer stingy compensation and raises for excellent work. They have inadequate training for such an involved process and product line.
good,My duties were to help customers and contractors with color and paint selection. Sometimes I had to Deliver to Contractor Sites. Sometimes Management did not care about how you did your job as long as it got done. Management sometimes handled situations unprofessionally.
good,SW was great. Give you great tools to learn. Not the best support from corporate. I believe the MIT program is not worth it. I could get high turnover for assistant managers because of this program which makes customer relationships hard to maintain.
good,Overall it was a good place of employment. Not much room to grow with the company unless you are willing to move around multiple times in multiple states.
good,Not very difficult but no work life balance. Your experience will be a reflection of management. Good management trainee program but  would not stay much longer than a year.
good,"No sense of the industry average. Demand 50 hours weeks, salary pay, and refuses to give additional staff in stores. There is outdated technology to work with as well."
good,It is a very fast paced work environment. Lots of tools and training. It requires you to be driven and willing to learn as you go. There are many opportunities to move up or switch locations if you move or have a desire to take on more responsibility.
good,Long hours.  No time outside with family. Heavy lifing 100lb plus . High volume which drains on you mental. Good thing is are great coworkers.  Everyday is a challenge you .ust over come
good,"Just needed to have a job for my newborn, the job wasn't amazing or anything. I dealth with a lot of people who barely spoke english and it was a struggle to get them exactly what they wanted."
good,Good opportunity to meet different people from all walks of life. Good environment to work in meeting co-workers with ambition and drive to succeed and move forward.
good,"Buena Empresa, pero con cambios internos que afectan el buen desempe√±o de los trabajadores, poca comunicaci√≥n con las jefaturas y poca cultura de crecimiento."
good,No room for advancement. After one of my co-workers quit I thought I would get full time employment. The only way you can work full time is if you have CDL drivers license.
good,"Ambiente cordiale sopratutto dovuto ai colleghi capaci e attenti, lavoro ripetitivo ed esposti quasi nella totalit√† delle 8 ore ad agenti chimici classificati."
good,"If you didn't go to college, I wouldn't waste your time. They will only promote people who have college degrees no matter your level of experience in the field or on the job. Very much a ""good ol boys club"" despite their initiative to include more women in their hiring. Great benefits with decent pay, work holidays, nights and weekends. Weekends usually have no manager present, so you gotta wing it most of the time."
good,Busy sales floor taking care of about 50% professional contractores and 50% homeowners. I was the assistant manager of a retail store and assisted in all areas of customer service and sales. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to meet people from all walks of life.
good,If you don‚Äôt have a college education it‚Äôs gonna be hard for you to make it in management as they usually have mtps everywhere other than that it‚Äôs a decent job
good,Long hours and unrealistic goals. They do have great benefits but no work life balance. You get worn out at the bonus structure and trying to achieve goals. You either move up or stay where you are. It all depends if you are chosen from the beginning.
good,Open and willing to learn new things daily. Product knowledge is key to succeeding as well as knowing colors. The hardest yet most rewarding part is matching colors that are years and years old.
good,"Learned about the various products and applications."
good,Environment was satisfactory. The equipment was outdated with multiple rigs to operate. Lack of training. It was difficult to learn the machines due to the fact that they had to be tampered with to operate at minimum QC level.
good,"it was quite a slow time sometimes, depending on the store that you worked at. Working at a commercial store has its ups and downs but it was always steady."
good,Sherwin-Williams is a solid company to work for. They pay very competitively for retail management as well as promote almost exclusively from within. Keep in mind that your experience is going to drastically very based on your manager and location.
good,"Worked in the automotive division.  My direct supervisor was awesome, but his supervisor just wanted to play the corporate advancement game by trying to look as good as possible.  Ridiculous rules and meetings were all put into place primarily for optics.  Nobody cared about the individual worker."
good,Most of the day was spent working on sales through relationship improvement or phone calls. Helping in-store customers at the beginning and end of the day when part-time employees were not there to assist yet. Routinely had to take overtime and forego personal life. Was told it's part of life until you get promoted enough to take days off and have a normal work/life balance.
good,"overall good company, had good coworkers about 98% of the customers were pretty cool. Only problem was I have a college degree and they just kept overlooking me for a management trainee position, I did everything they asked, good customer service good knowledge of the product, good connection with coworkers and sales reps, They just kept giving me excuses and I got tired of it."
good,Not a very high ceiling. The store hours are reasonable so it's not very stressful. It leaves time to find a second which I recommend if working here.
good,good company to work for.  Made sales calls to existing and potential new customers.  Aided in issues occurring during application process. Worked with contractor to help grow company.
good,"Very unstable job, one week is fine the other you're doing 60+hrs. No overtime for managers and promotions are hard to come by past the manager level."
good,"I don't remember."
good,Good place to work and develop a career.  Career path is strange as they want you to move for upper management positions.  I was not willing to relocate therefore decided to move my career in a different direction.
good,The company as a whole is a great learning opportunity for anyone looking for experience in the business world.  They teach you everything that you need to know about sales and business operations.  But expect to work long hours.
good,I thought the company was pretty good at first. The longer you stay unless you don't move can become stressful with all the sales criteria to meet and the number to hit. Good people can make a good work environment
good,"Long hours. Poor working conditions. Non-functioning work equipment, as well as lack of tools needed to properly do my job. Lack of support from management."
good,its a great work environment an theres room to grow within the company.. sadly the amount of responsibilities you are required to fill is very high.. but a low wage with not many incentives to want to do more for the company. little wage for what you are expected to do..
good,"Sherwin Williams is a good company for many individuals who work there, they are a diverse workforce who have helped move Cleveland forward in many areas.They are located in the downtown Cleveland area, and are accessible to many areas in Cleveland and surrounding area."
good,"Great position but constant traveling the state of Kentucky, Ohio and Illinois.  Very good people to work with but was newly married and couldn't be away from home so long."
good,The job is good for anyone that enjoys running between stores for whatever last minute changes to be made by the organizations involved. There is little consideration of individual situations of the locations as the firms use a cookie cutter approach to everyone. You are responsible no matter if in  your control or not.
good,"A typical day is running around changing programs because of last minute decisions. The decisions literally can change from day to day. The possibilities of changing to different career path is very difficult unless you know someone willing to focus time on developing your skills. A person who start is sales but choose to move to marketing, not very likely to happen despite educational development/completion. The most enjoyable part of the job was visiting other team members for group meetings/dinners."
good,You work way more hours and are not appreciated for. Worked 70 plus hours for months strait. And still got passed over to get an assistant manager. It was awful
good,Great place to get your feet wet.  Need to be willing to relocate after a few years.  Seems like store managers get to their location and then don't ever want to move.
good,"This job was more physical and you have to be in shape, because there was a lot of climbing ladders, movement, and fast pace. Safety was a huge role because it was exposed to many hazardous equipment. Overall it was ok."
good,This job can be stressful and will demand your best if you want to succeed on a daily basis. When you get set up with good district leadership they will set you up for success.
good,"Enjoyed most of my experiences throughout my 17 years. I was not able to get the promotion I believe I deserved. That was the reason I left the company. Customer interaction is pleasurable for the most part. Fast pace environment, especially from spring to fall months. Training on the go. Eventhough the managers of the stores and sales representatives are a close knit group, sales rules everything."
good,"this company is okay to work for as long as you can tolerate laziness and look the other way when someone is breaking the rules. this company tends to keep employees who are close to retirement who don't feel the need to work anymore. The management relies on others who are younger/new to get the job done, and do not give any type incentive for it. Also, there is a lot of nepotism going on. they also tend to promote from the outside instead of hiring someone already in the company who deserves it."
good,Upper management wants you to grow every year but gives you no staffing to prospect opportunities.  This results  in a high stress work environment and long hours each week.
good,"show up and there area customers in the store and orders to make"
good,"You work, work, work, work. They do not necessarily care about your life after work. You are expected to manage the rules and regulations and also make the customer as happy as possible without breaking the rules."
good,"Very tightly structured, But a very good place to work, A good place to move up the ladder fast if you are willing to relocate, They are very high on hiring college graduates and training them their way,"
good,They only follow safety polices when they are being inspected. When there‚Äôs a surprise in spection it becomes your fault that things aren‚Äôt in proper order. My direct supervisory told me one thing and the plant manager would say another. They also show favoritism. A lot of it. It‚Äôs not a horrible place to work but management could be a lot better.
good,"The company prides itself on customer service. The company needs to offer better incentives to part time employees. Depending on which location, working in- store is pleasant."
good,"Was responsible for many things and did not get the bonuses where should have, instead the manager did who was never there. Work hours were ok, but have to stay late if need be"
good,It‚Äôs a good place to work for someone looking to get into driving and doesn‚Äôt mind being in a fast pace environment. Great way to also learn about paints and other paint materials
good,Constante capacitaci√≥n a otras ciudades.crecimiento constante.
good,"If you're looking for a job where you develop relationships with regular and irregular customers and enjoy problem solving then this is the job for you. in larger cities with one only location, expect heavy traffic in warmer seasons and almost non existent customer traffic in colder seasons. Sherwin does an amazing job with employee education, bringing you up to date with it's products and their uses and selling points."
good,trabajo normal  con buena gente √°mbito muy sano y solidario
good,Fun place to work with people who make the worst days one of the best days. Customers have personal relationships with you and help to even tint paint or carry it out with large orders.
good,"Typical work day is long as you have limited staff.  Staff usually consists of a store manager, an assistant manager, a full time employee if store makes over a million a year and 3-4 part time employees.  One part time employee may be a key holder; so they can open or close the store.  One staff member spends most of the day making deliveries.  There is a great training program but after that the monthly training are not useful.  Your work experience depends on your manager.  During my full time and initial part time experience I had excellent managers who worked along side me and worked hard.  My managers helped with customers, physical labor and working weekends; this is not always the case.  There is significant turn over with part time employees and it takes a while to replace them meaning your staff will work long hours.  Pension, 401k and good benefits."
good,Get to the store at 6:30 start mixing paint and helping customers. I have learned to manage a 2.5 million dollar store and keep the workplace safe and enjoyable.
good,"It varies from slow to very busy.  Assignments are pretty heavy.  There is something different almost every day.  It's in a great location to either catch the train, bus or parking."
good,This is what you make of it. I enjoyed the retail environment at first but later enjoyed the contracting segment more. This gave me a great foundation for my work career.
good,I worked at SW as a college student. They are very good with accommodating student life/work balance. Hours are flexible but working with general public can be hard. 5/7
good,Great for keeping you engaged and goal driven. Good benefits and opportunities to get out of the store and complete outside sales calls. Difficulties are staffing and work life balance. Rewards are great if willing to put in the hours.
good,Very clean but hot and cold environment to work in.Very fast paced lots of bending twisting and heavy lifting . Offer good benefits. Very safety orientated company.
good,"Sherwin-Williams was a decent place to work.  Be prepared to have your work clothes covered in paint daily, and to be carrying a lot of weight worth of paint day to day.  Otherwise, it's fun to mix and match paint and sell it to the customers."
good,"Loved my manager and assistant manager. "
good,"Be prepared to lift hundreds of gallons of paint throughout the day. Dealt with some unfriendly contractors, retail side wasn't bad. District managers and corporate were very strict."
good,I worked here over 30 years ago.  Cleveland is a great place for the main offices and regional was in San Jose.  I am wasting time writing this as it was so long ago!
good,The overall job was great but after having many issues with the manager and his unwillingness to provide me with the desired days off due to my still being in high school as well as his inability to adhere to my availability from being a student I was forced to resign
good,"This job was temporary. I can't say anything bad regarding Sherwin Williams Graphic Arts division. To my knowledge, this division no longer exists. Easy job."
good,"it's an ok job, not the best in the world. Pay not the best either. Rather look for something better . You get weekends off and holidays but like I said the pay sucks for what the make you do."
good,Days were typically filled with actual work and meetings. There is a workplace culture. No part of the work is any more or less challenging than at any other company.
good,This was a good job. the only problem was that you only go as far as the supervisor wants to go. I picked orders and there was a specific number of hours we had to complete each night. The supervisors controlled the orders you received to get the required hours.
good,"Pallets are quite heavy off loading at stores 1800 lbs. Off loading with a pallet jack makes it somewhat challenging. "
good,Great place for someone that likes to mix paint at all times and help customers find they‚Äôre quality paint for they‚Äôre homes. But pay isn‚Äôt great. Sad to say
good,you have to be able to handle fast past environment. customers have to build a relationship with you before they trust you. trust is important. must be good with colors
good,"I was not given the opportunity to apply my degree. I was expected to stock shelves and check out customers during a sales management internship. I respect the company overall, but working for them was not what I expected."
good,Sherwin is what u make it ....... my training period was very brief and I was put at one of the largest and busiest stores in the course of a year I have had 3 managers none of which have really took the time to train or mentor me
good,Sherwin-Williams announced closure of plant and is more worried about keeping workers until the final closure than helping displaced workers.  No human resources on site.
good,"sherwin williams was a great place to learn about paint and paint products. "
good,Enjoyed my job and doing the work. Always had something to do. Only issue was with the way certain guests would speak to me and make me uncomfortable.
good,this is A EASY job with a lot of friendly faces. the place is a very relax job with some rushes. Don't be to out of shape though 5 gallon buckets can be pretty taxing on the body.
good,This was a great job but I was never able to move up.  Was told a lie about what I needed to do to get a promotion.  It was also hard to move around in the company if wanted to do something outside of the Stores Group.
good,Not much chance for a part time worker to advance to full time. They will not work with you if you need more hours because of financial reasons. Your hours get cut if you go over the average of 28 hours per week for a part time worker.
good,You would think If in the top places to want to work They would have a lot more to offer from what I learned it was Many years agoSelf here in the mid twenties or thirties I would recommend elsewhere But if you are Either retiring or just getting out of high schoolThis would be a great place to work
good,Worked for almost 15 years made it to assistant manager. Because I didn't have a degree the District manager would not advance me any further. Would put people in with 4 month of experience in the manager role and I would have to train them.
good,"Manage 10 employees, manage accounts receivable and accounts payable. match paint for contractors and customers. do weekly stock counts of the merchandise in the warehouse."
good,"It's a good place to work but doesn't give a lot of hours, only down side is they need to allow people to work full time and not just part time because that was my downfall"
good,Good company to work for overall.  Strong business ethics and overall a good work environment.  Training was not up to what I would expect from such a large company.
good,Very large company (#1 in paint sales) so are always looking to hire. Management opportunities right out of college so its a good starting point. You will learn after a year if it is truly for you or not.
good,"I enjoyed my time at two seperate Sherwin-Williams stores in two different cities. Both came with a very different management style, but I believe Sherwin provides an enjoyable and consistent customer experience."
good,"Enjoyed the people I worked with and the work that I did. I hope that the management gets better and the crew moral increases to what it use to be or better,"
good,Working for Sherwin Williams has allowed me to be exposed to different ways to sell paint and understand how it I for to be happy with the product they are buying.
good,I worked at a few different stores while at SW and they all have their pros and cons. It was an above average internship with great exposure to the industry but the job progressions to follow didn't entice me to stay.
good,"SW provides a great opportunity to develop a career in business with chances to move up quickly for those willing to move.  There is a good compensation package and bonus structure for those willing to put in the time to grow their store or sales territory.  They also provide a consistent training regiment to keep employees informed on new programs and products coming to market.  Typically SW employees are given far more tools and education to provide a competitive edge over any other paint company in my experience."
good,Great job to move up in. Great benefits when going into management. Good part time job for anyone in school or needing a second job. High turnover rate. Horrible hours. Horrible job culture. Managers tend to be incompetent. Great stepping stone but not a company to settle down in.
good,My daily job was to retrieve all sales tickets from the day before.  make a printout of the previous days sales.  match up all tickets with the print out.  Basic office jobs were also expected of me.
good,"First in class organization, employees are some of the best I have worked with. Benefits and perks are second to none. Locations and facilities all over the country. Growing organization with career advancement."
good,This is a good job for a college student. Not a lot of stress and  easy going. Great people to work with. Good benefits. They work with you to work around your schedule.
good,"Sherwin Williams' Management Trainee program offers valuable experience for those coming out of college to build a career. It allows them to again management experience early, creating a baseline for future management positions."
good,It all depends on the team around when working at Sherwin. A typical day would include assisting costumers with their needs. Every thursday you unload the truck. You keep track of inventory as well.
good,"Fast paced, customer service driven company.  High speed, with continuous improvements driving performance improvements.  Safety culture with root cause investigations resulting in corrective actions."
good,I found it hard when I worked there to be able advance within the company without having a college degree.  If you have your degree they will let you enter the management training program.
good,The job environment was nice.  It is in the middle of everything.  The work was steady but tedious and the day did not seem to go fast at all. Fun place overall.
good,The vibe in my particular store was super chill. Definitely not you regular retail job. You deal with a lot of contractors opposed to regular everyday shoppers. Need better training from management
good,"Aspectos positivos: bom clima organizacional, boa localiza√ß√£o, refei√ß√£o no local, plano de previd√™ncia privada."
good,It was a good experience working for Sherwin-Williams. I learned how to be organized at work and get things done fast and less difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job was delivering paint all through out north county.
good,This type of work is easy and fun. U meet new people every day never the same thing day after day.the guys I worked with where very smart when installing carpet
good,"Delivered paint to customers, picked up paint from another local Sherwin Williams store, straightened up the front and back of the store.  Unloaded freight.  Assisted customers with paint questions. Management was great."
good,"Worked for Sherwin Williams for a year and wasn't advanced for my pay. Was told on many occasions it was coming but my manager's never put time in to fill out the appraisal properly.should have been full time raise,3rd key raise, then appraisal. Had to open and close a store and take bank deposit even though I wasn't 3rd key but just a full time. I worked hard for Sherwin Williams and basically just got put to the back of the burner. Stayed at 9.50$ the whole year. Was told by my manager and others  I will get a raise of 10.80 which is the same pay a part time 3rd key makes. That is withholding my dollar raise because I was full time. Other than that and the occasional cranky contractor it was smooth.."
good,"Enjoyed many good years with the company. Great team atmosphere depending upon the district manager. Interesting and very demanding work, where you were paid more for your successful efforts."
good,"The company is very competitive, although I did acquire many applicable financial and IT-related skills.  Long hours were often required with a minimum 10-12 hour work day."
good,Good company to work for. The training was fine and the people were great to work with. Lifting 100 lbs was too much for me to do a hundred times a day
good,Daily responsibilities included: assisting customers with picking paint and paint colors. Stocking shelves. You learn a lot about paint coatings. You learn about coverage and figuring square footage.
good,good place to work with room for growth as long as you have a degree. The only negative thing is that they usually place you really far away from your home.
good,Sherwin Williams is a good company for part time employees as a stepping stone to better things.  I is nice dealing with all kinds of customers and contractors; you develop a good working attitude helping people accomplish their goals.
good,"Good company to get in with, good benifits and hard working people. Make sure you dont get placed in a rural store, no where near the revenue and management doesnt help you."
good,The customers that I work with on a daily basis are great.  I have developed relationships with many customers that have crossed over into life long friendships.  My co-workers are great and we work great as a sales team.  We are only as string as our weakest link and it is a pleasure working with my current stores.
good,If you enjoy working hard and being scheduled for 8-12 hours a day then it's great. My co-workers were great and we got along pretty well but the manager was hard to please. I never really got a break even when working over 8 hours.
good,"You begin as a management trainee and will be expected to train at a training store for 4- 6 weeks, but in reality will be promoted when the position becomes available to have an assistant manager at a store . This means you can be promoted right away or in my case it took up to 7 months. During this time you will be expected to help out any store that needs help. This can be good and bad for you. You do gain experience , but your schedule will be all over the place and you will have to drive all over the place. I drove to 11 different stores from Rancho Cucamonga, Woodland Hills and etc.. You do get compensated for gas.  Once you become an assistant manger you will be placed at whatever store you are needed regardless of your home location."
good,I did not mind my time at Sherwin Williams. I did not like sales and wanted to move to a different department. There seemed to be no opportunities that did not involve working retail.
good,"This is a good summer job only, there is little to no advancement and no real hours during the winter with no one painting. there is no more to tell i dont know why you people want a papragraph one nothing but i will keep putting nothing"
good,Its an ok paying job. A lot of labor but still fun to do. If working with a good group of people your job will go by quick. Very good benefits
good,"Typical days of working consist of helping customers, keeping the store and warehouse in order. Setting up orders to go out for delivery require excellent team work which is always provided."
good,"Working at Sherwin Williams is wonderful. Great company with lots of potential for advancement. Being a store manager, you're able to control everything."
good,"There is a lot to learn, certainly can be room for growth and fun outings with management trainings.  Day can be slow depending on the season"
good,Although they trained managers well they did not hire enough staffing to take care of retail and commercial customers. Which also led to difficulties in all duties of management
good,"-customer service, tinting paint for customers, handling projects for large contractors, handling cash"
good,Pretty good...hardest part is not having staff and be leary of bitter employees and company gossip. I feel like you get a lot of various real world experience that can be taken with you anywhere.
good,"This is a good job to get out of college as it pays well and will start up a great nest egg for you.  The hours are tough and long.  It's dirty and there is a lot of heavy lifting.  As a manager, you make the schedule, but you also end up holding the bag on a Sunday morning if your part timer calls out sick.  I loved my customers but struggled with the one size fits all management directives.  It was a very exciting job, but it became a terrible fit once I had kids."
good,"Very good place to start career, but as time goes on it seems the culture gets a little ridiculous.  Upper management / corporate seem to have no idea of what really goes on in the stores, nor do they seem to care.  Expectations are unrealistic!!!  But if you are willing to ""go for it"", employees have a chance for fast advancement!"
good,"you develop good relationships with people you work. its the people you work with who make it worthwhile being there."
good,"This company offers relocation globally, and many opportunities for growth. Requirements for salary position include a Bachelor degree in Business or related field. Minimum work hours of 48 and maxium sometimes exceeding 60+ hours per week. Sales positions require driving for extended periods of time and store positions require lifting and standing for extended periods of time in conjunction with the ability to run a store on your own. Offers incentives along with 401 (K) Plans and Health insurance for individuals or families."
good,Organized global internal sales conference with marketing team including five members. Created marketing collateral for several markets within Corporate division of company.
good,"Used company vehicle to deliver paints and equipment to customers in a safe and courteous manner"
good,"A typical day at work consists of making face-to-face sales calls to customers of commercial, residential, and property management segments. I take care of DIY and contractor customers that come into the store. I answer their questions and close the sale. I maintain a very high level of morale with my employees by maintaining an upbeat, positive, and energetic atmosphere. I communicate with other stores to get material I need and make customer deliveries as requested. "
good,"I like it. Different work that i am use to. I enjoyed my co workers, my boss was nice and understanding. It was a nice summer job for somebody like myself coming straight out of high school."
good,"I learned how to mix and match paint and stains"
good,"Typical day at work included loading material per customer order ticket and commuting to job site. Once arrived, floor and areas were prepped for work and cleaned. After prepping was complete the task of laying the floor would begin."
good,This company has a large product line. They service retail customers through their various locations. They also service paint contractors through their contractor outlets.
good,i would clock in load my truck go to various locations talk to customers it was a good job i enjoyed being on the road it would make time pass quickly
good,"Very thorough training covering credit, product knowledge, customer service, management.  A lot of time and effort put into trying out material and making sure the stores were inviting to customers"
good,The 1st company I worked for after college. Enjoyed job and felt I was treated fairly. Had aspirations of working for family business so left SW.
good,"-8-10 face to face calls per day"
good,"Has a lot of benefits but busy schedule. "
good,"Basically just delivered orders to customers buildings and job sites. Have to help build customer relations in order to boost sales along with helping customers with product information in order to make educated purchases. Top management was lacking in relations with employees, while lesser management seemed more approachable and hands on with employees. Co-workers were similar to me, working there to either move on or move up, and were basically good people, I enjoyed their company. Hardest part of the job for me, was some of the deliveries. 150-350 gallons of paint a day, up a 45 degree angled hill, and 2-3 flights of stairs with no air conditioning and/or elevator. It was a smaller store so I was the only driver/deliverer, so lack of extra hands made it a bit more difficult for me. Some of the better parts of the job included some of the people I got to know. I worked in two different stores and that was definitely a good part."
good,"This job was similar to Guerreros Construction, so I enjoyed it it a lot. We started houses from bottom to top. Many of the houses that were built are mobile homes, which I learned a lot."
good,"I work from 9am to 3pm from Monday to Friday. I sign into my device and go from store to store delivering and receiving paint and other products. Management is great except for the fact that they don't properly teach you everything. I have to use my best judgment and ask other co-workers who are more than willing to help out. The hardest part of my job is being on schedule for every delivery in a set amount of time or dealing with the weather, whether it is hot, cold or rainy. The most enjoyable part of my job is being alone without direct supervision hovering above you. I feel more freedom when given the trust to do my job on my own."
good,best job to have should have never moved to a new job. Everyone was fun to work with.
good,"Learned sales/customer service skills rather quickly because they throw you out there with no formal training."
good,acomodo de mercanc√≠a con relaci√≥n de marcas y tama√±os lo que aprend√≠ fue en la elaboracion de pintura a color  y sus propiedades la relaci√≥n con la gerencia y compa√±eros fue buena lo dif√≠cil era la igualaci√≥n de colores de muestra de los clientes
good,Good Company but be prepared to work long hard hours everyday.
good,"Qualidade de vida , acima do normal.."
good,"fill paint orders, drums, can, learned how to work in a hot atmosphere, and to work hard."
good,"Essentially I worked in the production department and I describe the entire process with the numbers 50-60-70.  The management style is most definitely from the 50s where communication was inefficient and one directional.  The building and most the infrastructure was from the 60s as well as the age of many employees.  And finally, most of the technology was impressive in the 70s.  The position paid well as well as the benefits were very competitive.  A production position with this company would fit someone who enjoys doing the same routine everyday and doesn't feel the need to actively contribute or change the status quo."
good,working as a sales associat. Co-workers where great love working with them. Managment was great always was there when needed.
good,"Sherwin Williams has taught me alot from a warehouse technician and management perspective. I hope to advance my career in top management one day, and Sherwin Williams has given me the foundation i need to succeed."
good,"This place was extremely busy, although it made the day go by quickly, there was barely any time to breath, and each day was stressful. The typical customer is a building contractor and usually are not of the very patient types. Company seems to take care of it's middle-tier to top-tier workers, however, they definitely cut the bare minimum with those who are part-timers or not formally educated with a college degree. The saving grace of this job was the positive attitude and compassionate qualities of the store manger and other staff members."
good,Learned how to run an efficient and high-profit retail store and the management decisions involved on a daily basis.
good,"It was ok, long hours, customers can be tough at times. Way too much paperwork. Depending on where your working it can make or break you"
good,Very male dominate company. Difficult for growth as a woman.
good,Management seemed inhumane to employee concerns.  Production is the only factor at this place
good,Learned many things about paints and stains.  Boring place to work.
good,to make a customers custom blended color and deliver it to thier jobsite in a timely manner . to relay any information to sales reps as needed and inform them of concerns.
good,"when the temperature is hot, working conditions will be hot and cold when weather is cold. Fast pace working environment. learn how to match colors operate tinting machines, using forklift, charging accounts, delivery driving, and much more, basic warehouse dutys. good friendship with workers. towards the end of the day, orders come in slow so no longer necessary to work in a fast pace so orders wont bunch up. enjoyed working here so far, but seeking for a better job."
good,"Empresa segura y solvente, grato ambiente laboral y con sus exigencias normales laborales. "
good,"come in step up display area. clean and restock inventory. make sure warehouse is clean and in order. make deliveries. help out customers"
good,"A lot of responsibility and autonomous work environment. Lots of middle aged white men. Very few women or minorities. Lack of opportunity to move up, one certain level is reached."
good,One of the most competitive 401k/pension packages in any industry. Lost of resources to grow your career at your finger tips.
good,Uma multinacional que visa a responsabilidade socio ambiental.
good,"Work place to work at, work hard for less money, good management and good people to work with"
good,"Abrir oficina y revisar pendientes, realizar inventario ciclico, revisar faltantes, atencion al publico directo, proveedores, distribuidores, manejo de personal, coordinacion y supervicion de los pedidos, realizar la cobranza correspondiente, reportarse con la gerencia, coordinacion con el area de ventas, citas, solicitudes diversar a mexico, pedidos a mexico. Mi gerente gralmente. De viaje trato poco, ambiente con mi personal cordial. La parte dificil los inventarios y el gusto de demostrar que puedes con los retos"
good,Working with the staff and costumers was satisfactory. I learned a lot about the job and the products we sold. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the costumers.
good,"great place to work, co-workers were awesome along with management, decent pay with good benifits"
good,A typical day at work is preparation of outbound and inbound calls from internal and external customer and obtaining solid committments of payment on delinquent accounts.
good,Early in the week my job consists most of receiving and putting new freight into stock. Remainder if the week is serving paint and wall covering needs of customers.
good,I cant get into details but just review the star ratings... all I can say.
good,"Every since I graduated from high school I've been helping my dad install flooring. I learned alot from this job, mostly I've learned that a job is not all about speed, but how well and neat the job is completed. The most enjoyable part of my job is, I get to help out and spend time with my dad."
good,If you like working with people it's a good job. If you don't like working with people look else where.
good,For the most part it was a fun place to work.I enjoyed the other employees and the mangement was not overly pushy. The customers were pleasant and easy to work with. The deliveries were fairly easy and got to be a little routine. I was allowed to work independantly most of the time which was refreshing.
good,good company but needs more stability with hours and employees
good,Sherwin Williams changed locations. I enjoyed this work more particularly interaction with customers.
good,"Productive work place , emphasis placed on the bottom line."
good,"Heavy lifting required. Great job, but part time employees are allowed 28 hours a week. The company is very strict on hours. Great job overall including good management and lenient on life situations"
good,I Refuse to give a review on the company or my experience. I believe everyone has their own opportunity to make their own experience. It was a positive experience.
good,Hot in the Summer and Cold in the Winter. Dirty Locker Room and Restroom. No house cleaning crew. Do your job and go home. Some good people there.Good pay
good,Trabajo bastante estresante con respecto al salario.
good,"El ambiente es bueno, los compa√±eros no tanto. Constantemente buscan capacitar al personal."
good,"Good pay for being home everyday. I was a slip seat driver. I'd drive during the day and deliver paint while another driver would pick up my paint during the night so I was ready to go. The plant was always behind so I rarely go my loads on time and what made me leave was on more than one occasion I found ""illegal substances"" left behind by my night driver. Management wouldn't do nothing about it."
good,Good place to work. Hot in the summer but you are well compensated. they will put you on second and third shift but mandate you to work on first or third. Overtime works in four hour segments either 4 hours before your shift or 4 hours after.
good,"It gave me a viable opportunity to grow great asset, it is perfect for some personally i was in search for something different in my personal development career."
good,It is a fine place to work. The compensation is not really competetive anymore compared to most jobs. Any opportunity for advancement is going to come through their management training program which you have to hold a bachelors degree for.
good,they easily offended and racist.I wouldnt work there again they are picky and no overtime. you will not have a life. everyone is very childish and playful.
good,"Very fast paced work, spend a lot of your time at work and dealing with work, can be very stressful but if your willing you can advance but be willing to work 48hrs and weekends."
good,"A typical day at work consists of fulfilling customer orders and deliveries. I have worked multiple locations, and each location has a different atmosphere. The first location was sadly, unpleasing. There was a lot of harassment by management discriminating against a female co-worker of mine. They told me that a woman should never work at a Sherwin Williams. I told her as a friend and she quit days later. "
good,"I was fortunate to have a great staff. The money was good, Bonuses were decent when you actually got one. Moving up with this company is all about relationships, and knowing the right people. There's a lot of politics, and favorites that are provided far better opportunities then others. Don't expect a pat on the back, or sincere appreciation. Make your money, and move up, or make your money and use the experience to work somewhere else where your value is appreciated, and compensated."
good,"Its like any job you have to go thru hoops to go anywhere.  i have learned alot, but working here is not the easiset thing to do, the hour are not easy to deal with when you have unrealiable people"
good,"Trata-se de uma multi nacional norte americana, bem estruturada"
good,I had a great relationship with my manager.  She was supportive and knowledgeable.  I was provided training and product knowledge that was necessary for my success.
good,I was given an opportunity to learn and grow in the paint industry which i was totally unfamiliar with. I was encouraged to educate myself on proper safety techniques in regards to painting. I also had opportunities to attend meetings in order to increase my knowledge of Sherwin-Williams products and learn how to offer customers knowledge in order to for them to get the best usage out of them.
good,"At first your complete overwhelmed, but the management tries to help and teach you through it. The pay isn't at all what you would expect and raise opportunity are very rare if ever. At times you can feel way over worked and definitely underpaid, but then there are the slow times of the year and the atmosphere changes a little."
good,"Good place to work, just the pressure to keep the store open is on the management, without any help from superiors. Good getting to know customers and the freedom."
good,Great company to work for if you get employed as a full time employee. Promoting is difficult if you are not a graduate of a credible college or university.
good,SW is a good company over all. However I question the reasoning behind a lot of  things. Management can be great. But actual product knowledge is lacking if you won‚Äôt are in the retail division. I‚Äôve asked for 2 years now for more training on products and it falls on deaf ears. More about profit than doing what is right for the customer sometimes. It‚Äôs a give and take.
good,Solid benefits. Annual salaries could meet market demands better. Budgets are getting hard to hit with corporate trying to pay off massive purchases of other companies.
good,"Can be very physical, and work outside in the elements. Depending on which store you are at, there are clicks, with nepotism, and management is too busy to improve some of the processes."
good,Worked for many years in different positions. About ten years ago the company direction changed to accelerated growth with main regard being acquisitions and raising stock price. Its a great job out of college to learn customer service and management skills. It is also a good place to work in a part time role of full time employee role. For certain  individuals promotions can be achieved very quickly especially if you are willing to relocate. It is NOT a team atmosphere in management or sales roles. Everything is a competition between employees to achieve inflated numbers. Stores are grossly under-staffed and filled with inexperienced people due to turnover. Benefits are standard for a corporation and pay is average with the opportunity for bonus in management and sales roles.
good,tp work here is cool you get decent discounts on paint... i do not like the catty work politics but you will meet life long fweends..............................
good,"Nice working environment, The only problem was to advance you had to move 60 miles away even though there were openings at our location.IN store management was a very good experience. The district manager was not in tune to the specific locations expectations and needs."
good,"Sherwin williams is the kind of place you come ready to work, no time for horse play, I would say they want you to get the job done, but most of the  time you can't get them to repair anything, it takes a act of congress."
good,Work hard and be on time. Some managers are not open to new ideas. I attempted to help coworkers learn Spanish to help communicating with customers and the manager was not pleased.
good,"Not a bad place to work at"
good,"My typical day basically revolves around servicing various customers of different skill levels in regards to their business or homes.  I manage a staff alongside the Manager to provide excellent customer service to our guests that walk in through the door.  I find products that would help these customers with their problems.  If I do not know an answer I find it for the customer.  When I am not helping out with customers, I have my paper work that needs to be done and my sales calls that need to be made, all of which drives the growth of my store. The hardest part about the job for me is that I do not feel like I am rewarded enough for the work that I put into the role.  In the area I work many of the people can be passive aggressive but the key is to realize that at the end of the day they may have been going through something rough and you're helping them and that means a lot to them.  I would say what I enjoy the most about my job is the staff I work with.  Superb bunch of people who I can call friends.  Aside from that, the ongoing training that is always available."
good,"Decent options for students fresh out of college. They will recruit you into the MTP Manager-training-program and start you out around 38k yearly for 45 hours weekly. If you're in a short-staffed store, as most are, since they attempt to be as efficient as possible with PT- you will be stressed. Arduous work though it is rewarding helping a DIY customer with finding the perfect color for their home."
good,"Pretty decent place to work. Unless you're an assistant manager or above you can only do part time work, but the beginning salary is pretty good with no experience."
good,was my first job i had it for four years it was a good place to work but alot of overtime. I learned the basics of a porduction plant plus alittle more
good,It has been different at each store I've worked for but the work is steady and consistent throughout the day. although i've been predominantly part-time while working there the only real way to move up is to move consistently
good,Very good place to work. Management is understanding and good to the employees. The work environment is very good and is a enjoyable place to work. Just wasn't my cup of tea.
good,"I worked as a management and sales intern for Sherwin Williams over the summer between my junior and senior year. I was based out of a store in Oregon. The typical work day involved both intern related projects and retail activities. I learned that being involved in paint retail, even though it offered opportunities for promotions, wasn't for me. The best part of the internship was the opportunity to engage and work with management. Most of the upper managers were helpful and supportive of the interns. The workplace culture was fine, nothing special, but generally a collaborative workplace. The hardest part of the job was having to rapidly learn the ins and outs of the paint industry. The most enjoyable part was the final project."
good,Wasn't a bad company to work for. Just wasn't something i wanted to retire from. It's more for high school students or someone that doesn't need a lot of money.
good,I enjoyed the times I had with the company. I Met some people that I will know for the rest of my life. This is a place I would recommend to a friend or anybody looking for a job.
good,"I enjoyed the job! At times I struggled with the layout of the schedule, but I only worked there as a part-time sales associate, so I wasn't able to have a very consistent schedule."
good,"Advancement is quick. Almost too quick. Very sales driven company. Have to be aggressive. You are only has good as your sales are right now. Many benefits though such as 401K, stock option, Pension, vacation time and bonus structure."
good,"Sherwin Williams is a good company to work for, but it is in no way an easy job. Different stores have different paces which can provide a completely different experience. The typical day includes working a typical retail sales job while also working a warehouse job at the same time. Management varies depending on the region and culture. The training process is poor for new employees. The hardest part of the job is the manual labor of moving hundreds of pounds of product each day. The easiest part of the job is the down time that can come between the rushes in a standard day. However, the size of the store with respect to their revenue greatly impacts the workload and pace of the work day."
good,The only complaint I had about Sherwin was the fact that they had a lot of contracts in some very shady and dangerous parts of town and I was required to enter into potentially dangerous situations.
good,"You have to keep track of your orders, and tint orders of 1gallon all the way to 100 gallons. After as the driver I would make the delivery to where the contractor asks. When doing the delivery you have to keep an eye out for safety hazards, as well making sure all the paint is in the right location and safe location."
good,"met customer needs in a variety of ways."
good,Its a great company but it seems they only pick certain people to advance also not enough pay for price of living now a days. I work really hard and exceed expectations and I don't get extra pay or bonus.
good,I enjoyed 80% of my time with this company and the benefits are amazing. My only regret is that I relocated to a district with terrible upper management and was eventually forced to leave by someone who I had just met that day despite being with the company in that area for nearly a year. Overall though the customers are great and the stores are competitive but in a fun way. I would always encourage people to start a career there.
good,Belle structure comme compagnie . Tr√®s organis√© . Beaucoup de pression aux niveaux des ventes ce qui peut √™tre motivant .
good,"Some what balanced working environment. Plenty of opportunity to move up in the company if you desire to do so. Pay could be better, particularly for drivers."
good,"Disorder and constant chaos are what you should expect.  ""If you aren't in sales you are supporting sales.""  Cheap, cheap, cheap.  Won't spend $1 if it isn't tied to sales some how.  No emphasis on improvement, ever.  Many people stay many years because it's easy to slack off and get paid well."
good,"This is my 1st job since graduating college and it appealed to me for a few reasons. There is a lot of room for growth, pay is very good and benefits are great. The company is located all over the US, Canada, South America and more so if you want to move and keep your career you can. On the other hand, the fact that it is retail is difficult. You work a lot of hours that are inconsistent. It can be a stressful enviroment and there is not much of a work/life balance. As a woman in this company, I face a lot of inappropriate harrassment from customers...such as contractors/painters. It can become very uncomfortable at times when you deal with it everyday. In addition, I work with mostly men which can be hard because there is no one to relate too and the environment is insensitive. This job can be great if you're the right person for it. There is a lot of turnover in management but it's due to advancement and people moving up.  Upper management is overall professional and helpful. There are plenty of training classes which are extremely helpful because of all the knowledge of products you need to know."
good,"job has good benefits, management depends on the store one works at, meet all kinds of people, i learned about various paint products and what to use and what not to use"
good,"It's a fun job for a year or two as a manager- however, after that one starts to get bored of the duties and the customers. The customers just expect the greatest service from you and it makes going the extra mile seem like its just the norm."
good,Management is able to work around schedules. People stay with the company for years. Plenty of networking opportunities. On job training is the majority of training.
good,"Extremely corporate culture, which may turn some people off. The location I worked at had a really awesome crew, but not all stores are built the same. "
good,"The Sherwin-Williams Company is a long-standing company with a rich history. I was proud to work there.  My most recent position, however, did not offer a fair or reasonable work/life balance.  This was not my experience during my entire time with the company.  Some departments/Divisions offer better training and support from management, as was the case with most of my time at Sherwin-Williams."
good,"its an alright place to work, except for the minimal days you work, and the 4 hours each time you go in. Some nice people work there others are very snobby."
good,"Empresa l√≠der, bom ambiente, desafiadora e com grande potencial para crescimento no pa√≠s"
good,Expect to put in long hours in the warm months. The company has excellent benefits with good advancement opportunities. Store roles are heavily retail based; don't expect a full sales role until you move out of the store.
good,Sherwin Williams pays their employees just enough not to quit. I spent thirteen years with them and put in a lot of long days and hours. The benefits are great. They provide a lot of things that a large corporation provides plus more. You typically have a good base salary and 5 potential bonuses each year. I enjoyed my time here but spent the thirteen years moving every year and a half to move up the ladder. Moving became an issue when I had a baby on the way and a wife that had a career commitment to stay in DFW.
good,"Sherwin Williams, is a great place to work if you like overtime. They offer great benefits, health insurance and 401 k matching when you are a fulltime worker."
good,"The pay is pretty good and the schedule has some flexibility during the rare times when you have a solid team of part-timers, but most of the time you're running the store by yourself, your social life is at the mercy of your part-timers' whims, and you're expected to do the jobs of 4 different people to an award winning level. Simply put, this company puts unrealistic expectations on you."
good,The job was great if you wanted to be micromanaged and have more non sales related work to do then generate sales. The opportunity for growth depended on the territory. Sr. reps who have been there longer have control over the top painters in the industry. Those top painters also affect the smaller guys who always get outbid.
good,"This company provides great benefits and has a lot of opportunity to advance. Great place to get your foot in the door with experience. However the district and city management are quite unorganized, and very inconsiderate. The pay is good but sometimes they work you more than your pay grade. . Many grumpy people work here for years and complain but won't leave."
good,"I have worked with Sherwin Williams for three months, the store manager and assistant store manager are nice, the most interesting things are tinting the gallons of paints to the customers. The hardest time is carrying all of the boxes and pills to the right place in every week's warehouse stock. But the salary and benefits of part time employees are very bad, only the minimum payment without any commissions."
good,Cada a√±o se realiza la evaluaci√≥n de desempe√±o logrando puntos altos por los cumplimientos de objetivos logrados tengo laboral como soscial logrando ser l√≠deres en el mercado
good,"Working here allowed me to grow in management and other responsibilities coming right out of college. The training classes were long but mainly beneficial on imperative information needed to work in your specific store. The typical day at work consisted of a lot of customer service oriented inquiries and the customer was always right regardless of what really transpired. A problem I had was that there was never enough coverage for staff when needed, because SW did not want to pay part time more and managers could not get overtime although they worked a bulk of hours. Managers had this thing where they refused to work weekends which put a strain on AM and Full Time Staff at times, Co-workers were either motivated, lazy and or made a ton of mistakes despite training. The hardest part was not being appreciated and respected as much as other workers and bad communication from the entire staff. The most enjoyable part were the expos, training and helping a family decide their best look for their homes. Management get in such a uptight tizzy when the big shots came to visit stores. Bottom line is I never feared the big shots because if you are doing what you need to do like budgeting and keeping your store clean and making sales then everything is fine. There is a lot of politics involved so because I won't kiss up to move up I had to move on to a better rewarding career path. The discount was awesome by the way."
good,Good solid foundation with the company  I have learned several aspects of the job related field especially dealing with internal and external people.  I conduct daily calls to existing an potential new customers.  I have a rural territory so drive time can be longer.  The hardest part of the job is managing time for sales and my involvement in other assigned duties or other time consuming items that distract me from my focus.  I like to win and for the most part the team members have been fair and good to deal with
good,"Is not for everybody, this place is NOT a meritocracy, upper management needs to improve, but there are worst places to work."
good,"Upper Management out of touch with how the store goes. A lot of the reps have an  ""old school"" mentality. Good starting place for career."
good,Great place to start after you graduate college if you're just getting started. You learn how to manage a small staff. Work hours can vary which isn't great. Nevertheless it is very easy to learn how and there is a great bonus structure and generous entry level salary.
good,"I would constantly answer phone calls from autobody shops needing automotive paint mixed up or other automotive supplies to complete their painting job. I would help get the drivers ready for their morning and afternoon deliveries, along with processing point of sale or return or nsf transactions. I would close the store every night Monday-Friday and take the daily deposits to the bank."
good,"It was a great learning experience. I enjoyed most of my coworkers, although the management was always very hard to please. The most enjoyable part of the job was making different colors of paint. The least enjoyable part of the job was making deliveries."
good,Was great company when I started changed philosophy after about 5 years became very number only company stopped caring about teams and employees.
good,"Although this company offers a lot of opportunity for advancement, more work could be done to make sure all company policies and protocols are clear. They allow you to do what you need to do to get the job done, even if it means violating policies. Hardest part of the job is product knowledge."
good,"A typical day of work involves answering the phone, writing down the paint and supplies order, finding the product on the shelf, coloring it if needed. As far as coloring the paint goes, most of the time for latex based paint, the computer puts in the appropriate amount of color. You just have to select which paint color you want. But for oil based paint, you have to manually add the color using a separate machine. You also have to put away inventory whenever a truck comes in. I didn't learn how to handle the forklift machine that lifts the palette of paint but if I stay much longer with this job, I'll eventually pick it up.  Inventory management is where the heavy lifting comes into play.  Some of the paint is stuffed in there on the shelves really tight. Sometimes you have to climb on top of buckets of paint in order to reach the paint or the box of masking tape or whatever on the top shelf.  There is some risk of falling and so the job is potentially dangerous.  One of the hardest parts of the job is when someone is placing an order over the phone but the jargon they're using doesn't make sense because they're giving you incomplete info.  The most enjoyable part of the job IMO (and this will vary depending on your taste) is preparing paint samples for customers. The samples are small and lightweight, therefore, they're easy to handle.  The management provided very little training and they are nice in the beginning but they will get crabby if you've been there for a few months and still haven't learned the basics yet. I've been told many times, ""You've been here for several"
good,Was a great company till I got in my accident. They continued to try and find ways to fire me. I was in my crash while on the job didn't get compensation for the 4 weeks I was out. They tried to rush me to return to work even without a doctors note stating I could return. Loved my coworkers Would not go back.
good,"Solid company to work for if you're just starting out. I worked here part time through college, graduated, then became an assistant manager. I was placed in one of the busiest stores in the country because of my 5 years of experience, however I was not compensated any additional amount over an assistant manager that does no where near the same volume of business. Budgets don't adjust even when new stores pop up about 3 miles from your current location, so getting promoted when the numbers aren't there because of that is something that left a sour taste in my mouth with upper management."
good,This is a on your feet type of job that requires a lot of hands on work as well as going above and beyond to be successful. The freedom provided to you to develop the business as you see fit provides for a different and fun work environment.
good,"Good management trainee program, requiring employees to grow their store business. Gained exposure to various aspects of retail business, sales, credit management, product management and inventory management"
good,"The store was busy but all the customers made our work fun and creative for all, the customers were friendly and very welcoming and cordial as well."
good,I worked part time at Sherwin and don't have many complaints other than that I moved from one store to another and things were very different because of the management style of my two managers. Other than that I have not complaints.
good,"They offer great benefit packages. The work environment can be stressful but rewarding, it all depends on what you want to take out of it. They have training programs at all levels and have meetings throughout the year to introduce new products and policies to keep you up to date. Management can be clicky, my best advice is to not get caught up in it and do your job."
good,good company to work for. They offer a great package for someone that just finished college.
good,"Hard work and wear and tear on your body. Took years for advancement, and was released after injury on job."
good,"The people that work for Sherwin Williams are all great people. But they are very strict with enforcing policy and the higher ups leave almost no room you to enjoy your time at the company. "
good,"In my 12 years with the Sherwin-Williams Company, I highly increased my knowledge of paint and sundries, not only of the company's materials, but of competitors as well.  I become very educated in what it means to manage a retail store, with my knowledge growing each and every day.  "
good,"Sherwin is dedicated to training their employees, encouraging them to grow, and giving them the tools to achieve those goals. It is not a Monday through Friday 9-5pm job. Weekends, holidays, and evenings are to be expected. As a manager, your work schedule tends to revolve around your assistants and part-time employees."
good,It was just a temporary assignment. It was an alright experience.
good,"Years ago this company gave management much more support and allowed us more freedom to build our customer base."
good,48 hour work week. Store open 7 days a week. Almost all lower age mangers.
good,"The company is great to work for and to begin your retail management career. In a typical day you will batch financial documents, process payroll time and attendance, develop management skills and how to lead your employees and get them excited about current company initiatives to drive sales. The hardest part of the job is the lack of support for employees that exists. There is a clear lack of developmental support once hired and placed into a position. The most enjoyable part of the job is all of the opportunity to experience many different aspects of the business world including sales."
good,Es una empresa en pleno desarrollo y crecimiento en el rubro del repintado automotor.
good,Sherwin Williams is stable company to work for that has remained successful and profitable throughout the recent stresses on the economy. I am proud to work for a company that markets such a quality product. I do feel that the company to do a better job of setting acheivable goals given the current state of the economy.
good,"If you want to work a lot, this is a good job for you. The day typically tends to be long, especially for management. The manager will generally work well over 50 hours a week, while assistants will generally work at least 44 hours a week. However, that number during the busy season can spike dramatically, with no increase in paid time to compensate. You can build great relationships with contractors, but you might also work with some people you might really dislike. It can be a good job, and the experience varies from store to store, but I just need a career change."
good,Attend JSA/Safety meeting with the crew. Monitor quality and safety of the crew and workers on the platform. Monitor the daily environmental conditions and record batch number of the coating being applied and the amount being applied each day. Report these findings and daily operations cost to company the work is being done for each day.
good,Great employment with oppurtunities to move up the corporate ladder. Benefits package is offered to part-time workers as well.
good,"Family is not a priority of this company. At times, you are just a number. If you‚Äôre making sales, you‚Äôre good. If not, you may need to start looking elsewhere."
good,Worked the morning shift so I opened the store and got everything ready for all of the painters and contractors coming in. Learned about colors and how they affect what a home can look like. Learned about the different types of paints and how to work with other companies that were also trying to expand. Mostly up on your feet ready to go and which was great but it also was one of the harder parts of working there. It was great to make connections with the customers that regularly came in for what they needed and it was awesome when they only wanted me to help out because they knew I wouldn't mess anything up.
good,Coworkers were great people and plenty of training to help you with your job. Very hard to advance in the company though if you not willing to put in several years of work between each advancement.
good,Not a career to begin while having a family. Perfect for single individuals with no other responsibilities other than their careers and themselves. Work hours are 45-50 hours a week.
good,"Working at Sherwin William's had pros and cons. I loved the people I helped and got to practice my Spanish since 75% of our clientele spoke it. However, I was frustrated when the assistant manager wouldn't work. Instead, he'd play his xbox in the office."
good,"Their store and Assistant managers work up to 50 hours a week, mostly alone. I'm not one but I would never be one and they're definitely not paid enough regardless for the amount of time sucked out of their life to be in the store. Other than that, no real red flags."
good,"Great place to work if interested in working way up to the top. Old school culture. Great for women. Lots of lifting, reaching, and stretching. Great company overall."
good,"I would work for 7-9 hours a day and would try to warm my lunch up and would be told to stop eating and help customers. This is not every location, but the one I worked for last was terrible."
good,If you are looking to advance from part time to full time it‚Äôs very hard bc full time doesn‚Äôt open up very often. Don‚Äôt even think about management unless you have a college degree bc it will not happen.
good,"The systems, people, and product is great. Management is scrambled and gossipped about far too often. Salary is not aligned as well with what people actually need in their lives. There are too many levels to make more money, and employees are valued more on time spent then skills, which creates frustration with the highly talented entrpenerial types."
good,"My management did not do their job professionally as it should be done. When I was there, people that weren‚Äôt management did a lot of the call and dealing with customers we shouldn‚Äôt have to deal with."
good,"I was lucky and had really good management. The work is steady, but not too much to handle. Some of the employees can be drift draft trash who are one step away from being in prison. The biggest problem I had was that the pay wasn't enough. I was overqualified and educated for the position I had. There are many people who make a career out this place and love it, but there are many people who also get trapped and can't move upward. Overall, I'd say it's an average place to work. Not horrible and not great."
good,Sherwin Williams is a good company to work for it has great benefits and work incentives....it's fast paced and steady but it makes the day go by alot faster.
good,"Stuck in the stores for more time than is ‚Äúrequired‚Äù. Company culture is poor. They reward time spent in positions rather than pure talent. Great opportunity if you want to work for a painting company for the rest of your life, but no skills developed for career advancement outside of Sherwin."
good,"Retail was not for me. Otherwise, the company wasn't terrible. The people I worked with were generally okay. It was difficult to keep quality staff as part-time employees were paid less for a more difficult job than they could find elsewhere."
good,"Laid back delivery/warehouse guy. Rain was slow days, no delivery.. Overall was a good company to work for, left due to needed something stable and didn't want to be a sales associate."
good,not a bad place to work money and benefits good no advancement for blacks in that plant.Most people are good and get along in the plant.Very strict attendance policy and tardy policy.you can have a decent living just being around dangerous chemicals is really what you watch out for.
good,Working at Sherwin Williams is a learning process not a typical job to where its easy to understand .you gotta learn the ropes then adapt honestly. on thing i dislike is that the work load you are giving is based off how much the last shift got done.
good,"I love working for Sherwin Williams, it was flexible with my classes and was extremely helpful. However opportunities are always fleeting and never within the stores control. Always moving positions where they feel it is necessary, and tend to have a very long time for promotions. Great Yearly Evaluations, and great to work for if you are going to school, need more flexibility or have another job on the side."
good,"I learned a lot at Sherwin Willams , about all the different types of people especially the culture and I also learned how to deal with difficult situations with customers, and tryng to resolve them. I enjoyed the fellow Sherwin Williams employees that I worked with.."
good,"As an assistant manager you are a utility knife. You are involved in almost all aspects of the store and if you are short staffed you will be working very long days. The job is not rocket science but, customers can be trying at times. There is room to grow mostly in sales but, you are compensated fairly as far as base salary."
good,"My experience working with Sherwin Williams was good. Staff was polite, management was fair. Clean and fun to work with clients on consulting colors for their projects."
good,"Overall I like my job very much and take great pride in my work. Although challenging at times, I am continuously learning new things. I love the hands on and creative aspect of my job."
good,Strong organization with solid strategic plans that drive the sales and store operations. Limited advancement opportunities for newer employees. Advance seems based on coming up through company vs. capabilities at times.
good,"Managers must work 48 hours per week, weekends, holidays included. Hours can we be flexible throughout the week. Mandatory Lead Generation calls per week"
good,"I was initially hired on as a full time associate before management rescinded that offer to part time. It took until the full time associate to quit before I could fill that position, and that isn't an uncommon story amongst coworkers. There is a lot of heavy lifting with this job and you will work in the worst weather conditions depending on what the contractor needs. Overall, it was a stable and easy job albeit tiring, but definitely not a good pick if lots of heavy lifting puts you off."
good,I was a new employee only of 2-3 weeks and was being left to run the store by myself for long periods of times. Never worked under such poor management. The manager would constantly take trips across the street to the gas station and not come back until I called and desperately needed his help or until a smooth 45min went by. And this happened 2-3 time a day during my shifts
good,"Sherwin is a very large, structured establishment, with a strong management team.  They silo there business units, making cross silo communication difficult.  The marketing groups offer strong sales programs designed to maximize opportunities, but the development of programs can be slow due to the size of the organization.  Overall, they are a good employer with a great salary and benefits package."
good,"Once you are placed at sherwin, you can work your way up the company but be prepared to work extremely hard and work for a long time before anything happens."
good,Great place to work if you have a good manager. Some managers there just want to do their time and not deal with problems that may come up in team enviroments.
good,"More with less is somewhat of a motto at least in the operations sector. This contributes to the high profitability of the company, but leads to a difficult work life balance. The company has good benefits and a great return on 401k."
good,Pleasant company to work for. Management ok and somewhat helpful. One hour for lunch. No early start time. Monday thru Friday daytime work schedule. Dealing with sub-contractors was difficult.
good,"I worked at SW for nearly 20 years. It has been going through some growing pains the past few years, and many longtime EE's have left the company.  Overall, positive place to start your career in Sales."
good,"The management do not really care about the employees. The job is easy but when it comes to racism, sexism and just disrespect from customers, the managers turn their heads. ""Customers are always  right"" is not accurate. being an minority and female, I deal with a lot of disrespect and I wish that management  would have our backs a little more. Also being short staff is a huge problem at this company, being an assistant manager, you already have to work 44 hours a week minimum, but since its short staffed its a lot of 12 hour shifts, working 7-9 days straight, and still having to try to have a life. overall this job is good for now while I am in Grad school."
good,As a manager you work consistently. Many weekends and many holidays. No balance at all. But the salary is competitive and their benefits are excellent. Also their stock purchase plan is unmatched.
good,"Not really much to say, I worked here part time while I was in school. I got paid enough to pay for gas and some food. My store was pretty slow so it wasn't a terrible gig."
good,sherwin williams is a company that provides security its a great place to work if your trying too get on your feet but it does need improvement in the advancement of there company drivers
good,"Sherwin Williams was really the stepping stone for launching my career, an amazing company and I learnt a number of great dynamics and quality work experience"
good,Shwerin Williams is good place to work for the people there are great worker the job get allways get done on time. The customers all ways satisfied. Its a good work place.
good,you will deal with alot of custmers at once when they com in for there paint you have to be fast to get them out of there because if not they will start getting mad
good,"Good and worth working in such environment."
good,The Management Training Program is excellent for someone who has just graduated or looking to change careers.  It is very challenging and you will learn a lot!
good,"Working in a paint store is never where I saw myself ending up. However, I will say that Sherwin Williams is a great company. You will work long hours and be on your feet, but it is very rewarding."
good,"Working here you will work with customers, while tinting paint and keeping store looking clean and tidy. Management is great with any questions. Culture is great, very family feeling. Hardest part of the job is learning products and getting through training days. Most enjoyable part is getting to know customers and working with the people in the stores."
good,"Working at Sherwin Williams was a lot like learning to ride a bicycle. It was fun and exciting until the training wheels came off and now I'm going full speed, crashing into everything."
good,"A lot of employees who work here don't have college degrees and are very defensive when you are hired as management in training. They try to prove themselves as someone who can do the job-do your job. Lots of head butts from senior workers that want to be a manager but aren't able to unless they get a 4 year degree. Instead they try to tarnish your reputation with slander or being really difficult employees. Might be easier to work for if you're not hired as a management in training, but then the pay is horrible. Very male dominant and most of the paint contractors are straightforward rude. Very very difficult to work there as a female paint manager in training."
good,"Sherwin Willams is an outstanding company to work for, but unfortunetley I feel like like the company doesn't treat the part-timers as well as the full-timers."
good,"I interned here and found there to be a lot of down time - not enough work to go around. However, was given great opportunities to meet with people and learn."
good,"Working at Sherwin Williams was always interesting, there was always something new to learn about. A typical work day would consist of filling orders, helping walk-in customers, coordinating deliveries, and making sure all reports were turned in and filed. "
good,"For the amount individuals get paid at this company and the things expected to do, something does not equate. I do however love the individuals within the company. They are all friendly."
good,Sherwin Williams hires recent college graduates for their MTP program. They offer a nice salary--but it is rough working by yourself much of the time. It can be scary at times because you will be opening and closing the store at night by yourself.
good,"Great product, but there are several products comparable.  Sales cycle is very long in the automotive paint industry, and also often carries multiple year contracts."
good,"A typical day would be stopping by a Sherwin Williams store to check in with the store manager first thing in the morning. Discuss any opportunities as far as sales, opening new accounts,  what I will be doing that day in that area. Seeing 7-10 accounts . "
good,"You get to travel all over the the country and get paid well. I liked it a lot and had lots of fun. Management bkjgktdf,jhv  nmjgvfkv rmfmyr kyjrrsdnnbfdmhnf g,jyfdjrdsxc ng;liyrdmhn"
good,"Sherwin-Williams has the best paint on the market hands down. It is on the costly side of paint, but you do get a high quality paint for a fair price.  Don't buy the bargain $20/gallon junk at your box store, it's just a waste of time."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job is the customer interaction that feel like more than family than customers.The hardest part of the job is learning all the various paint products.
good,"Me considero una persona con estas aptitudes y experiencia:"
good,"Co-workers were great to work with. I have much respect for the management and the daily, completely irrational, avoidable, and unnecessary frustrations created by customers. I learned a lot about customer service from this job, and how to communicate properly with people."
good,The company has changed.  It use to be  great place to work. Too many decisions pushing customers and work force away.  The company has taken the ability of the manager to run the store out of their hands.
good,Great starting positions and training programs for getting into the paint business. Great job for student. Opportunities for advancement are common. Politics plays a little too much of a role in promotions but that may exist anywhere.
good,"SW has many good things, huge company so job security is there, but most stores are under staffed and it leaves managers and assistants to work 10-13 hour work days 5 days a week. It is exhausting and although I enjoy getting a steady paycheck. I do not think it is worth becoming a work horse and missing out on other things in life. If you have an abundance of energy than this might just be for you. Also another thing to keep in my mind here a manager interacts with customers more than part time associates it is definitely a different set up very demanding. As a member of management we do a lot more than manage numbers and people. We are the go to for painting contractors, we negotiate prices, we clean, stock, replenish and often work for 4-5 hours alone. Stores are simply under staffed leaving us to do duties that we would not have to do at other retailers as members of management."
good,The training at Sherwin William is top notch.They invest a lot in there employees. There are long hours and it is hard work. I did everything from accounts payable to sales calls.
good,Sherwin Williams is a great company for people that don't mind the paint life. It was a very straight forward job in that I always knew how I was being measured. The manager at my location was a very nice lady who wanted to create a positive environment for her employees.
good,"You learn a lot and fast. First you have to learn about the products and there are thousands, then you have to learn to sell them."
good,The day to day operations are moderately challenging and often fun. The client base is always up for a good laugh and coworkers are very supportive. Unfortunately career growth extends to becoming the Store Manager in the middle of the country or an area manager if you are lucky.
good,"Customer service and sales all day long."
good,"Color matching"
good,SW is a great company. Management has some issues. Hard work is required.
good,"I usually make paint orders, and make answer our multi-line phone system. I'm more of a secretary than sales associate. I've learned a lot about paint that I never knew such as sheens and coverage. The hardest thing about the job would be unloading trucks while the most enjoyable is the clientele. "
good,Deal with a lot with No help. The company is going backward instead of moving forward in the work field while the higher ups are just getting their wallets fatter. 
good,blended paint and stains to custumer requestd color learned how to make custom stains with differnt solvent blends.
good,"A typical day at work starts very early. We are busiest in the mornings. Mainly deal with contractors and DIY as your customers, some are easy and fun to work with, others can drain you. Be prepared to lift paint all day, need to be in good physical shape for the demands required. It can be fun and enjoyable depending on the crew and store you have. Most stores are in good shape and fairly new, other stores are old and falling apart. For the old stores, be prepared to deal with constant issues with equipment and general maintenance. Hours are conducive to a normal life outside of work, but if you open you are there very early and if you close its a late evening. Most enjoyable part of my job was the experience and knowledge i gained about paint and other coatings. Very useful and i just like to learn new things."
good,"Working as the manager for Sherwin-Williams I have developed many profitable relationships in my 4+ years with the company. A typical day is filled with customer interactions varying from homeowners to county, state, and national account consultations. Delegation of my staff is vital to my success as this allows myself to dedicate the proper time to projects that require my personal attention and specialized knowledge. In my management role I have successfully converted my current store from a floor covering hybrid vendor to a specialized marine,industrial, chemical, and architectural coatings supplier. While the most difficult part of my job my be training employees that are completely new to this kind of market, it is exciting to see those same employees close a large sale unassisted. It is satisfying to gather intelligence on a potential customer as a team and collaborate to close a large sale contract. I have an extremely aggressive and competitive attitude when comes to obtaining new business and I find it personally rewarding to know that I serve a key role in my company's increased profitability."
good,go and work go home. not satisfied with human resources and management. problems are never handled and personal business is spread throughout the whole warehouse. good pay but makes you think is it really worth it.
good,"fast paced HR environment, great co-workers."
good,"Everyone at the job is fun and it feels like a little family. Only minus is the amount of work you do doesn't add up with the pay. If the pay added up to the amount of work that goes on there, then I'd be satisfied."
good,Management wasnt the best but i made the best out of it did my work and made sure customers were always happy when helping with their orders as well as mixing their paint
good,"I worked with the company for a little over 6 years, at 6 different stores, and with many different managers and staff. With the small team size at the stores, having the right type of people dictated the experience I was inclined to. I worked with some great managers that encouraged me and taught me how to grow in the company. The biggest issue I had with the company was staffing. I rarely felt that the stores had enough positions for the store."
good,Don't work in Smaller market regions. N0 support for Management team...no home life pretty much expected to tag team 7 days a week. You are lucky of you receive a part time employee.  Work a city store if possible. They get help.
good,"-Great place to focus on sales skills and learn to manage a business."
good,"While being a student at Minnesota State University, Mankato, I applied for a painter job in the "
good,Pay is great for management. Not great people with children who need work life balance. The store is also always understaffed  which makes the hours  difficult or too many hours. It a great starter career to push  your limits and see what you can do! But not a long term goal to be the the stores
good,In a manager role you will work 48 hours minimum which can be hard to balance work and life. You will meet some great people and build positive relationships with your contractors but you will also have contractors that are miserable and complain about every little thing. You have to let the miserable people you assist not ruin your day because they are everywhere you go.
good,"I'm currently a college student, so I work part time at SW. Its ok, but it can be very boring. I spend most of my time stocking shelves and unloading truck. The amount of customers that come in differs for every store. Management is good, and I think that's true everywhere. Going to be honest, I don't find much enjoyable about the job whatsoever. My coworkers are pretty cool, but that's about it."
good,Advancement is easy if you're willing to put in the time. The only problem is Assistant managers have to work 88 hours bi weekly and Managers have to work 96 hours bi weekly. It really cuts into your family time.
good,The job was alright the store was just dirty and sometimes people didn‚Äôt want to clean so I would be doing most of the work. I worked 4-5 days out the week as a part timer for 3 years while holding the ‚Äú3rd key position‚Äù.
good,Internship does not clearly explain what one will be doing but it is just a sales associate position. Hours vary and super management just goes with the flow as situations present themselves. Needs more structure and better communication
good,"Sherwin Williams is very old school when it comes to who they promote. The upward mobility is limited to who you know in the company, seniority with the company and usually male dominated. They have no clear career development programs for mid-level associates."
good,"Typical day at work is fast-paced in the mornings and sometimes quiet nights. I learned critical management and CRM skills working for SW. It's very important to get along with upper management. The hardest part of the job is the constant pressure to always meet sales goals, and the physical labor. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to see the regular customers every day and building professional relationships with small business owners and homeowners."
good,"While working for the paint store, I enjoyed working with a helpful and resourceful team and most importantly working with the customers. I especially enjoyed working for the customers on a regular basis. "
good,"Suited my needs at the time, not very high in company culture. The amount of training i received for the industrial paint was very minimal. Not enough training to be confident in all the different types of paint."
good,The store I was working at had amazing co-workers. Just a warms and friendly Environment. Was pretty organized with meeting the requirements of the day to day task and manager was very hands on and helpful.
good,"The Hub I was at was a pretty good mix. Being a Hub driver it was no room for advancement and the push for full time was like pulling teeth with the DM. Great Co. overall, solid benefits for full time."
good,"I had a good two years working for the Sherwin-Williams Company. Worked at two different stores, and enjoyed both teams I worked with. Hard work, fast-paced, long hours. Can feel rewarding at times. Would recommend, but not as a career if in-store."
good,"The 48 hour + weeks make having a life outside of work incredibly difficult. High stress work space with management pushing you for sales. But, you are in charge of your career path. Fantastic experience running your own business. If you are sales oriented, this is the job for you."
good,"Great company , kept all employee,s busy. Great team ."
good,Stores are kept understaffed. They pay management well but in the long run it is never work working your life away. Customers are aggressive and turnover amongst the sales force is high.
good,was alright very busy and hurt my back. fumes can get to your head. best part was the employess i worked with. some diy customers were  a drag some 500 gallon orders that take forever
good,It is a great company with great benefits. I absolutely love my job because I get to work in a fast paced environment with people. It's also a very rewarding job because customers let you know how much they appreciate your time and assistance.
good,"Just like all corporate cultures, they walk the fine line of maximizing employee productivity while attempting to maintain employee morale.  Work life balance varies wildly from job to job.  Good benefits, competitive pay, good people.  Listening to employee feedback and facilitating any kind of positive change is an opportunity for improvement."
good,"Open the Store at 6:30am."
good,"My only complaint is that management sticks way too closely to a hierarchical structure and refuses to listen to employees. Also, the salaries are flat rate with little room to negotiate. For my given experience and certifications, I believe I was underutilized and underpaid. It's a physical job, probably more than any other short of construction work. The pay is largely based around bonuses, which upper-management  works very hard to minimize. There's enough backstabbing and throat cutting in my area to make me want out; it's literally every manager for themselves. Lastly, there is extremely high turnover in the company as a whole and with the new MTP program, I can see why. Sherwin has a line of fresh guys trained up and ready to take your spot if there's any complaint. They really don't care about keeping employees or negotiating salary or performance. "
good,"The great thing about this job is that you can make your own schedule. You are able to start your day and end your day when you please as long as you work 8 hours. There's a lot of driving involved and your drive time is included in your 8 hour day. I usually started my day around 9 am and I would visit one Lowe's store, check in with management, fill and order new color chips, train employees, mix paint and help customers and then move on to the next store. I'd spend about 3 hours at each store, taking my lunch in between stops. "
good,A typical day at Sherwin Williams was unpredictable. You sometimes didn't know from what day to the next on how sales were going to be. Somedays we had 20 customers other days we would see 3 customers. I leaned a lot about paint and how to match paint colors. My DM was not understanding at all. He gave goals that were not realistic for the area I was in. I hired diversity at my store. The hardest part of the job was keeping management over me happy. The most enjoyable part of the job was flexibility. I was able to have a life outside of store hours.
good,Empresa multinacional com uma excelente equipe de trabalho e mentalidade.
good,"Pension and 401k. Good work life balance. Typical very big corporation culture, though. Failed agile transition, and overly political culture. Whether I would recomend it or not depends entirely on which division you work for."
good,Good Job with good benefits. Room for advancement through management program. Things would be more efficient if stores weren't always competing and working in each others territories.
good,Good part time job during school. If you are seeking opportunities for advancement they are there as long as you take them when available. Busy work day dealing with paint contractors and DIY customers. You get to learn about a lot of different paints and deal with a variety of customers.
good,Some great people to work with.  There is always a need for paint so job security.  They emphasize safety for employees and customers.
good,"Worked for Sherwin-Williams for 10 years. I started off as a part-time employee at 8.00 per hour and worked my way up to Full time to 10.00 per hour in just a few months. Then after 2 years I was promoted to assistant manager. It really depends on your store manager going to bat for you to get promotions in the company and a willingness to move to other stores in the district. After 5 years as an assistant I got my own store as a Store Manager. I loved the time I was an assistant manager. But as a store manager it became very stressful due to district expectations. But I still enjoyed it. As store Manager you are salary and expected to work 48 hours per week as a minimum. but ended up working on a good week working 50-54 hours per week with no overtime pay. and if your store is understaffed good luck moving quickly to replace them and be prepared to work 60-70 hours per week."
good,"√≥timo gerenciamento, boa rela√ß√£o com os colegas de trabalho, o desafio maior do trabalho √© em rela√ß√£o aos produtos, pois a venda desses √© necess√°rio o uso de termos t√©cnicos precisos para o bom atendimento do cliente, a parte mais agrad√°vel do trabalho √© a liberdade e transpar√™ncia entre os n√≠veis hier√°rquicos da empresa."
good,Overall my experience working at Sherwin Williams heeled me become a well rounded employee. Working for such a large corporation at one of their smaller stores left me with a lot of responsibilities.
good,Good place to work if you want to become part of a powerful team.
good,"I took on a job with Sherwin Williams after college because of the relationships I made with them while interning with College Works Painting. I did not find myself desiring to be promoted within the company, at the time it was just a stepping stone. "
good,worked for Sherwin Williams for many years.always made to feel I was lucky to have a job with such a great company.lip service given to employees thoughts and feelings.
good,"A typical day includes unloading stock shipments, merchandising, helping homeowners with paint selections and assisting experienced contractors determine what product is needed and how much they will be using."
good,Very fast paced environment where sales is the number one focus
good,Great company to work for if you are just starting out of college. Store placement can be far out of the way but movement throughout company isn‚Äôt impossible.
good,It was a great place to learn organization and make great connections within the paint world. I learned a great deal about the intricacies of paint and painting accessories.
good,Nice environment help others pick out the correct color cord Nation not only are you able to have customers but you're able to help people provide a new home
good,"At Sherwin-Williams DSC there was always work to do which meant job security. Working here I learned how to operate a forklift, high lift, and cherry picker. Typical work day was pretty busy. Hardest part of the job was working overnight. The most enjoyable part of work was reaching production and going above that. Management was cool, could have been better on how the handle situations."
good,"There are times when you have a lot of projects, but the people their will take their time out to help and teach. People will love working at Sherwin."
good,If you intern here you will get experience and they will often encourage you explore career paths in your field by rotating jobs within the company. Some days can be slow though.
good,This was a good place to get my foot in the door. I enjoyed working there and it was a good working culture. Management was always helpful and they cared
good,"Management was great and the schedules are pretty flexible. They have great advancement opportunities. A typical day at work would consist of dealing with customers, handling money and advising homeowners and contractor on products."
good,Overall a good place to work. They give you room to grow but might take longer than expected. Sherwin Williams gives you the tools to figure out the products and teach you to be better at your job.
good,Their benefits are very good. It is a great place for advancement. They do provide training for employees so they can try and have a better understanding of their job.
good,A typical day at work was fast paced. Which was great because the day ran smoother and it was always something to do. I leaned a lot which prepared me for being a store manager. My store manager was excellent. He was very knowledgeable.
good,Fun but messy job part timers are slaves  management  is OK overall a simple job  often alot of perks to working here and you get to learn about Paint
good,"The office is located nearby a newly built commercial center, only 10 mins walk from the tube station.  Thus the office is new and lots of nice restaurants within walking distance."
good,Sherwin Williams is a stressful company. They have really good products for all their paint but working for the company is not ideal. Management is not very reliable and it is very difficult to move up in the company even with a degree.
good,"Manager was unreal, was a student at the time allowed me to work around classes. Pay was subpar, not a big fan of paint. Some scandalous drama between companies was nice to be a part of."
good,I did like working for the company and getting to know and grow new customers. The only problem was if you do not have a 4 year bachrlors degree you are not moving up... I was there 15 years training fresh employees out of college to move up past me.
good,"Batching financial documents on a daily basis, train incoming new assistant managers, meet sales budgets, problem solving with customers, cash handling experience, vast product knowledge"
good,As a store manager you put in 48+ hour weeks. Usually more than 50 hrs a week. While managing a store and building customers you have to increase sales and preform every marketing promotion they have going on. With right management and support the you can advance and do well with the company.
good,"Relaxed culture"
good,"in a company full of advancement, they weren't very helpful in helping you advance."
good,"As title says, this was my first time in a retail job and it was an experience to say the least. I did not hate it but it was certainly not my cup of tea. The job itself was great. I did learn a lot everyday and could see myself working there. As an internship it was a little lacking but as my first example of an internship I felt it was a great introduction."
good,Overall good experience.  Management was great and very understanding or work/life balance.  Have nothing but good things to say about my time at Sherwin Williams.
good,"Taking issues to management is a joke, but I have networked with many amazing people throughout the company that I will remain friends with when and if I leave. Easy going environment just be prepared to learn product daily! The hardest part of the job is when your location does not work as a team."
good,"working at sherwin is great if you're going to school, or can only work part time. With education they are really willing to move you up. My location in general, had/has great management. They are flexible in most locations, and hours of operation are pretty good."
good,"Had the opportunity to sell to both DIY customers and contractors. By being able to sell to the different customers, I was able to tailer my selling skills to each individual customer effectively."
good,I had a lot of fun working with my partners and learning different of flooring I enjoyed the atmosphere as well as the management team. I just wanted room for advancement and a better opportunity
good,"Things move slowly inside the company. Sometimes it affects external vendors who work with them. But, it has a great workplace culture, and employee benefits."
good,"the culture is basically the same in most factory settings around the state,you have employees that come to work and do there jobs for the most part, and the few that want to skate on the shoulders of their co- workers over all the company and its employees are there to take care of their responsibilities, work safe and go home management could do a better job investing in equipment that would make the business more efficient the top companies in the world that are very successful invest in whatever they need as a result things run smoothly, you cannot make billions annually and put band aids on machinery or what ever your employees mention that they may need to do their job efficiently and effectively."
good,"Store management is usually good to their employees, but unless you are management, or a key holder, you are restricted to 28 hours weekly. Each store typically has 1 store manager, 1 assistant manager, and 1 ""third key"" as full time employees. Being full-time requires enough knowledge to run the store by yourself during ""off days"" (usually Sunday) or whenever management needs/wants personal time off. Manipulating 5 gallon buckets of paint can be strenuous, especially during peak times, and if working with older equipment, can lead to back problems. Store managers are take care of their employees (as far as I've seen) with flexible scheduling and will supply lunches (or breakfast) for their workers. The people are good, but the company wants profit first, which is the norm these days. Great stepping stone, but I wouldn't recommend making a career out it. At the end of the day, working in store is simply retail, next step out is either deliver driver (highly recommend) or sales rep with commission as pay."
good,Not a terrible company to work for. But the pay was garbage. The people that worked there were ok. The reason I left was I did not feel like I was progressing.
good,"Excelente trato, buen sindicato, aunque pocas posibilidades a nuevos contratos."
good,"i have no words or time for this right now, maybe at a later time i could review sw but not right now. its a good place to work if you dot have work life balance"
good,Company treats there employees very well and is easy to work for as a while.  There MTP program needs major improvement and work on there rules and guidelines then checking that District Managers are following those guidelines set in place by the company.
good,Great corporate culture in a laid back environment. There was a lot of room for advancement and is great for someone interested in the paint industry. Management is supportive and always available to help with any questions you may have.
good,"-    Discusses knowledgeable painting techniques"
good,"Trabalho r√°pido produ√ß√£o bem ativa, obtive agilidade tendo como responsabilidade na qualidade do produto, relacionamento agr√°davel com os pr√≥ximos respeitando.."
good,It was a summer internship. The hardest part of the job was learning all the different products and recommending products when I had very little product knowledge.
good,"Now that summer is coming to an end work is gradually slowing down but we are one of the busiest paint companies in Austin, TX. I've learned a lot over the past year that i have been there and i am appreciative that i have had the opportunity to learn this trade. Most of my coworkers are very helpful. It is like we are a family there always relying on each other throughout the day. The hardest part of my job is working among fairly newer people. The atmosphere is always busy and having to deal with customers and employees pulling me six different ways is difficult and at times overwhelming. I do hate that i have to leave because i'v been with the company so long but it's just not my thing anymore."
good,There is ALOT of info to learn when you come into the job and it can be very overwhelming. After a good amount of time you can start to feel comfortable with all of it
good,Meet some of the best people that offer so much help and knowledge when it comes to work and life choices. Learned a lot and improved my skills as a sales associate.
good,Lack of training in this retail environment can be very stressful with the staff and customers calling you out for every simple mistake. Management seems to lack any responsibility when it comes to their staff instead of taking responsibility for your mistakes or lack of product knowledge they seem to just push you out of the way instead of taking the opportunity to teach you but this does very store-to-store. If you don't put any effort to learn and make effort in seizing opportunities you will be left unnoticed and find career advancement nowhere in your future.
good,the location i was working at was nice. they had good people just bad managers. the pay was one of the best things with 18 a hour. and i was on the 12 hours shifts.
good,"I enjoy working at SW definitely a more professional retail job.  Salary and benefits are very competitive.  Occasionally have to work weekends, almost always get time off when asked for ahead of time."
good,"Creation of Test Plan and Test Strategy with assistance of DBRs, Technical design document and HLR"
good,"You have to be willing to learn a lot. And are expected to. If you are not one to catch on easily, this is not an easy job. But can be fun with great coworkers."
good,Its a great company. You'll learn a lot there about their business and how it operates. Its a family type work experience. you should try to learn the names of all the paint contractors. It helps with yours and  Sherwin-Williams reputation. If you're a college student this would be a great opprotunity to learn work ethics and business ethics. Like any job this job can get stressful at times but you can take a break to manage the high volumes of stress.
good,"Its a very laid back enviroment, its a great job for anyone who likes hands on work there is lots of heavy lifting and moving around."
good,Productive fast work paced good atmosphere family oriented safe environment great pay well managed great benefits alot of opportunities clean environment
good,"This internship is both marketing and retail, so you get to learn about both sides of operations. If you enjoy working with people and understand that you will have to move a lot in order to get promoted quickly then this is the job for you!"
good,The job s wonderful fun place to work and learn new things but the policies and goals conflict with each other. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customer and building business relationship with contractors.
good,dedicated to keeping the product moving training was ongoing through product knowledge
good,"climbing on roofs, masking windows, quick paced work painting houses outside and inside. painting the the facia on the top of the houses were the hardest part."
good,I worked here for a while. The job was decent the hours were good. Overtime was offered but not forced. Job was Monday - Friday. I was a temp employee so I am not sure about the benefits they prove or any other perks. It was a decent place to work while I was there.
good,"working with contractors is a plus, i like to hear what project they are work on from start to finish. Helping someone price a job when they are first start to get in the business."
good,My review for Sherwin is bad because we have worked for Sherwin Williams a long time and for them to start letting work slow down for us this year its hurt my pay generously. This year I didn't make no where what I usually make a year that is why I am searching for another job.
good,"Empresa boa para trabalhar, tem benef√≠cios bons e o melhor sal√°rio da categoria. Tem nome no mercado e lideran√ßa em vendas."
good,"hard job ...lifting 35-100 lbs every day, dusty dirty job...HOT in summer, FREEZING in winter"
good,"Paint Store"
good,"Through my time here I have learned many things about the company and the job. Its at times fast paced, relaxed, fun, stressful but its not really that bad it all boils down to who you work with/for that will determine how well you day goes. The customer base varies widely from easy going to determined on ruining the day. The company provides great career paths But not so great advancement opportunities or a good work-life balance. Management usually never works weekends unless they have no choice nor do they hardly ever hold themselves accountable for the rules they set forth for everyone else. They put business needs before life/personal needs especially childcare. Now don't get me wrong they have accommodated my schedule for a few months so that i may care for my infant but with daycare availability for more days not being an option they no longer want to accommodate my schedule"
good,"I worked at both locations, starting at the brand new store, only to transfer for a more fast paced work environment. Overall the job was interesting, and essential. I leaned alot , and met a lot of local businesses and even business owners. Made a good reputation, but outside of that the job was going nowhere."
good,I loved working at Sherwin Williams until the current manager took over. He does not like me as a person and he let his feelings interfere with my job evaluations and raises.
good,"I love Mondays, mostly because the day flies by in a flash. On a given day, during the early hours you will find me cleaning and       reorganizing my work area. Finding out proactively what their priorities are for the week, meeting with team Leader for fifteen minutes to communicate our Production goals from weeks shift. I do this on Monday so that the rest of the week is well organized and we can effectively meet our next target goals in production expectations and avoid Friday evening surprises. The rest of the week goes in delivering the product(s), My role involves extensive  responsibilities and staying organized is not an option."
good,the company was a good place to work but to keep returning as a temp when management telling you keep up the good work and it was stressing trying for find work during the time of lay off
good,"happy here but no home time come in Friday night leave out sunday evening. a lot physical labor no power jacks for unloading double stack pallets of paint not easy to move, must have a good back."
good,it is an ok place to work.....as long as you don't mind working by yourself. Also very long work hours on the weekend +12 hours and a few times a week more.
good,"It was a good place to work, learned a lot of different things from registry to maintaining stock and cleaning up the store, pricing. Good people to work with."
good,"Massively changed culture within the last 3 years with the recent acquisition.  Was very old school and family feeling, now is high pressure and little to no work life balance."
good,"Sherwin-Williams is a decent company to get your foot in the door with. if you've never had management experience, this is the place to start. However, the work-life balance is non existent."
good,I learned a lot working here about how to deal with management and time management. There was not many opportunities to advance my career with this company which disappointed me because I had just gotten a degree and wanted to stay with the company.
good,"Bien para trabajar aunque malos dirigentes, faltan muchas herramientas de ventas para poder realizar tu trabajo."
good,"A contractor and DIY customers store."
good,"Easy work, horrible pay, no benefits, monotonous, get to meet interesting people, hardest part is unloading trucks, fun to help casual customers and do-it-your-selfers"
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was  interacting with customers, I learn how to formulate colors, work at a fast phase, great coworkers that were  willing to help out when need it, hardest part was matching colors and stains, to the desired color for customer. And learn color codes and brands  by memory,"
good,"It's a great company to work for, but like any corporate job it has it's downfalls. There's the in-crowd and the misfits. There are the quick risers up the ladder and the ones left behind. Cut throat."
good,"Sherwin Williams is a good company, however, the District Manager has a plan to replace all of the current ""older"" employees with much younger people.  His plan does not take into account the ability and experience of ""older"" employees to perform the duties of management, he prefers to hire 20ish people with no management experience, particularly at this store.  This store is on it's 4th manager since January 2017 and 3rd assistant manager, making it very difficult to know what the policies and procedures are from day to day."
good,"Nice environment as far as coworkers, although, if you are looking for career advancement, I would not recommend this job. A typical day includes stocking in the warehouse, delivering orders to high end customers, taking care of customer needs, tinting paint orders, color coordination, and maintaining a positive work environment. Management is awesome besides the amount of work that they put into the store. Coworkers are respectable, professional, and fun to be around. The hardest part of the job is dealing with harsh/rude customers. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the daily interaction with my coworkers. Overall, I have learned how to maintain being a positive employee despite the situation and/or circumstance."
good,stores are under staffed at times large companies are known for this management considers Home Depot and Lowes as competitors but only for retail DIY business for professional contractors are the bread and butter for SW
good,It is a decent job however there is a lot of problems in management at the store level. Communication is a huge problem. A lot of product knowledge and work for a really low base pay. No compensation on sales however Assistant and store manager get it which is odd cause the associates are the ones that sell product to the customers
good,"Buen ambiente laboral"
good,"Por trabalhar em ambiente externo a Empresa, terceirizado, o contato com essa foi muito reduzido, gerando poucos conceitos a respeito de seu clima organizacional."
good,"Meu setor de trabalho √© muito bom e gosto muito, meu colega de trabalho sempre me ter√£o aten√ß√£o na minhas opini√µes assim meu servi√ßos acontecia ,mas tem vezes que tem dia que muito corrido ,as vezes as maquinas sai fora de programa√ß√£o ai n√≥s temos que correr pra produ√ß√£o n√£o atrasar, mas √© o dia - dia da manuten√ß√£o ,As vezes n√≥s temos o dia de fazer preventiva e corretivas nas maquinas assim √© tudo programado pra se acontecer de alguma pe√ßa desgastar nos j√° o identifica .E agente atende todos os setor da produ√ß√£o e isso √© muito bom .porque n√≥s aprendemos muito com o que n√≥s estamos fazendo."
good,"A typical day of work included opening the store at 6:45 in the morning, and being swamped from 7am until I got off at 3pm. I took paint orders over the phone, put them in the system for tinting, submitted them for delivery through our hub-system, and prepared the paperwork for delivery. Before I ended every shift, I was required to make atleast 5 sales calls to different painters, apartment complexes, and businesses that have accounts with us to follow up on jobs and inform them of any promotions that we have coming up. I was also in charge of completing the billings of the paint we had sent out that day and getting the paperwork in order for filing. I learned a great deal about multi-tasking in an extremely fast paced environment. Since we did not have an acting assistant manager, I was taught most of her responsibilities and performed them best I could to help my manager. I love my co-workers, we act as one productive team. The hardest part of my job is the repetetive lifting of 5-gallon buckets, the store being short staffed, and the inability to move up within the company without a Bachelors degree, and the inability to be promoted to full-time. The most enjoyable parts of my job are the customer relationships I've built since I've been there and helping families pick colors for their home."
good,"Once you're on salary it feels as though you don't really get time off, even on your days off. Compensation is good, benefits are a pretty fair package."
good,It's probably the best part-time job I've ever worked. But you need to work an average of 20 hours a week for a year to get vacation hours. Also you don't get any bonuses. So if you're in college than I recommend you work here.
good,"A typical work day-orders come in. Then have to be made up if going out then have to set up as a delivery/ load up onto truck, go to addressed location, contact customer and see where the delivery needs to be dropped of at location. Makes sure product is in good condition and that customer is happy with everything."
good,Great job just stressful and underpaid. Work with alot of chemicals. Detail is extremely important.  You can be terminated for not catching the mistakes of others. Under paid in the facility's I worked. Extremely stressful job.
good,"My manager was great about scheduling time off, but worked me 4-5 days a week for 6 or 10 hour days.  It's a physically demanding position with lots of heavy lifting.  Part-timers also do the cleaning and are mostly responsible for stocking shelves, taking in weekly deliveries and making deliveries to customers.  Although I was made a key carrier in my first 2 months, I was not given the appropriate pay increase until my annual review, and then a small increase the following year.  It was not enough to keep me working as hard when paperwork and more middle management type work was handed to me without compensation for said work.  I liked working there, loved the company, the product was easy to stand behind, and the customers were fantastic.  I only wish I had been offered management training when I was obviously management material and mentioned it to the boss many times."
good,I enjoyed my time with this company. It had great employees and customers. If I could do it all over again I would. Sadly there at the time I was with the company really no room for improvement to move up in the company.
good,The company itself is good with all of the benefits they offer. The lower management needs work. Good job if you love retail otherwise great job to gain experience and take it elsewhere.
good,"In my opinion, this company is a billion dollar company and does not pay employees enough. Benefits and 401k are awesome. You get paid vacation and sick time. Great company, not great management."
good,"No experience needed and can explain knowledge and network by being proficient in the company. Compensation isn't the greatest for what is expected when needed, but the down time at most stores compensates for the lack of."
good,"- Visitas prospectadas e planejadas ( Construtoras \ Arquitetos\ )"
good,"Pretty normally for a paint store, slow on certain time of the day and fast/busy at certain times. "
good,I actually loved working at this particular place in tupelo. I love the people I worked with and the enviroment. They made me fun very comfortable at peace.
good,"A typical day for me consisted of making 100+ gallon orders"
good,"My biggest issue with being a temp here, is that I was given the run around for about five months was not a temp to hire position but a straight contract."
good,Great company that provides excellent training to it's employees and managerial staff alike.  I liked the job because it gave the opportunity to develop my managerial skill even further. The hardest part of the job was learning all of its product lines and its purposes. I love the job but they need to provide better advancement opportunities for all employed  there.
good,"clock in, get the packing slips to give to the installers, cut any orders of carpet that wasnt done the day before. file the packing slips in the installer folders. get the installers loaded and have them sign the slip and send them on their way. when finished with the installers, continue cutting carpet for the next day, and getting orders together."
good,"Helping customers with all their painting needs. Learning about new products and the contractors job needs. My Co-workers are great to work with as we work as a team. The hardest part of the job is being called stupid, an idiot or a moron; to the customers; by the management. The best part about the job is working with the customers."
good,I enjoy going to work at Sherwin Williams as my co-workers are nice my supervisors are very helpful and the general atmosphere is excellent. I can see myself climbing the company ladder with this company
good,Sherwin Williams is a Great Company to work for. It is especially great for those individuals fresh out of college who want to build a career with a good company.

good,A divis√£o Sumar√© gera para min a oportunidade de estar em grandes industrias nos n√≠veis gerenciais.
good,Sherwin-Williams has been a great experience for me and it has given me the ability to learn something new.  Management is great and very helpful.  The hardest part of this job is being part time while trying to take care of a family.  I am looking for a full time job so that I don't have to worry about the well being of my wife and child. 
good,"Good company and friendly environment depending what store you end up in but not a lot of room to advance if you don‚Äôt have a degree, no matter how long your there"
good,came into this job not knowing anything paint related. learned very fast the different coating for different substrates to the fractions of a color to change lighten or darken.store management was great but was told by a dm taht if you didnt have a dagree your stuck where your at..mixing custom paint was definitely the hardest. great atmosphere great clientele
good,"Overall a great work environment, that teaches great customer service with some really tough clients. You'll learn the importance of a team and how to find to handle the everyday customer, learning not to say no but to work through their needs and determine what you can do for them."
good,"I enjoyed working at sherwin williams and learned alot, however the hours that were offered would not work for me. I also was not giving the pay that was talked about during the interview."
good,"I first started general worker, applied for sales rep position and. Sold myself by being prepared for interview.  After about year and half the enomony turned south and I was forced to go inside as asst mgr. Those experience was bad because of my boss(they didn't change my salary and I was making more that my boss) that wasn't helpful.  He and the main boss then conspired too get me out.  They did and I was bitter."
good,"Good customer service and well organized store, and good environment to work and well communication with each other and excellent product for painting for customers."
good,Typical day as a sales representative - I find it to be a zoo sometimes. I have had a successful career with SW. Management can be very pushy on a daily basis. A lot of you're experience will depend on your sales manager. I feel i wasn't set up for success and experienced a trial by fire. Tons of repetitive meetings throughout the year. Daily emails that can bring you to a low point before your day has started. Constant changes in Management and lack of team spirit. Inside competition which turns you against one another in certain seasons of the year. Culture is starting to change for the better but still far away. Women are receiving fast track to upper management positions. People of color are starting to receive fast track to upper management positions. With a higher percentage of diversity this company will thrive. Still in that transition.
good,While working for Sherwin Williams i started out in as a sales associate learning how many different kinds of paint there is and what they were used for and how many different colors we could make and any custom colors as well. When a Driving position became available it was a little stressful at times especially when new homes were being built because they didn't have an address just a lot number which could be difficult to find. You sometimes had help loading and unloading your company vehicle other times you had to do it on your own depending on what products and how much there was to load and unload. They try and work around your home life as much as they can especially when you have children in school.
good,"Sherwin-Williams is an overall good company to work for. They train you for almost everything newly implemented change. That is a wonderful thing.  There is always someone that knows the answers you need or they can show you how to get to them.  "
good,"Every day is different.  You need the be flexible and accommodating to need changes. Due to the size of the company, sometime employee serve is not that great.  The people were great to work with and genuinely cared about their jobs and teamwork"
good,I like the company every thing ok for me but it‚Äôs to far too me and company force people to work overtime to much of people not consent.and they are no come to work for overtime you supervision give you points.
good,"Sherwin can be a great place to work for those who are interested in the paint industry and want a steady and stable career. If you can put up with the sometimes stressful nature of retail combined with the taxing and laborious nature of tinting and moving paint, this company can be a great place to lay roots. For employees in management and above the benefits are good, and pay is competitive. For lower-end hires like drivers and in-store part-timers, the pay is not competitive relevant to the demands of the job, and benefits are non-existent. Career advancement is open to a wide spectrum of positions, however, without a college degree it is nigh impossible."
good,A very good place to work. Everyone was very friendly. Just not enough hours. I only worked like 18 hours a week. Other than that everyone was very friendly.
good,"Sherwin/Williams is a great company to work for, in any position, nevertheless, most positions are part-time ,and its very difficult to advance to full time positions in delivery and sales associate. salaries are sub-par for this area, and the delivery area, in my opinion,are below industry standards."
good,if you've got a good team its a very great job. if you dont its more heavy lifting and excess stress. this job attracts a ton of weird but mostly fun people
good,Sherwin-Williams is a good employer that offers opportunities for career development and advancement.  It is an ethical organization with an emphasis on delivery of business results.
good,"they don't really care about the employee or what they think is more of that ""will do whatever it takes customer service"" but they don't listen to the workers and I couldn't stand it. the work environment is also kind of fake."
good,"Sherwin-Williams is a good place to work as long as you understand your bosses aren't the best.  Work life balance also takes a back seat so unless you are prepared to work with little time off, you have been warned.  Pay is good though."
good,"I enjoyed working here, however, the hours and schedules were not negotiable, and there were often not enough employees at one time to share the load, and the workload often fell on the same 2 or 3 people. Also, because of these things, it was hard to keep new employees long enough for them to gain much helpful experience."
good,"Great people to work with, lots of experience to pull from. Very competitive company culture. Dealing with situations that there aren't processes in place for."
good,Only bad thing to say is lack of advancement because of seniority policy.  Overall a fun and quick paced environment.  Very clean facility.  They reward you for hard work
good,You can advance if you play the right game and not say much. If you have an opinion it is barely heard. Changes are decided way in advance and there isn't anything you can do. Although most managers don't have back bones and won't do what they need to do... Because anything can get done.
good,The atmosphere is ok. there is a lot to learn and a short amount of time to learn it before being thrust into tough situations. unless you have a degree don't even consider growing in the company.
good,"mix paint, help customers. I honed my efficiency, working faster with minimal amount of work. Good managers, 1 bad assistant, other assistant is good."
good,"Was taught about mixing paint for automobiles.Very fun process to know about. I would clock in,  grab my list of places to delivery to for that day.Made sure I was always on time or early,picked up returns to go back. Carried money for COD customers. Enjoyable job but got laid of due to the economy ruining the auto industry."
good,"At times stores would be so short staffed that you're left trying to juggle making orders that were called in, taking care of customers at the counter, unloading the 20 pallets off the semi truck out back so the driver can get on to the next store all while the phone is ringing with new orders to be made and delivered."
good,Fritt jobb men √§nd√• krav skift jobb  mycket utl√§ndska lastbilar omv√§xlande skjutstativ truck
good,The job environment is nice along with the customers but the manager is consistently inconsistent. Needs more managerial experience. Overall not bad the only quirk would be him.
good,"Mainly focusing on Projects Business, Directly have the access to talk to CEO , Work culture is fairly good. Product acceptance is good in the market."
good,Seemed like I learned something new everyday there.  Seems a bit overwhelming at first learning about all the different types of paint and the various usages each one has.  Takes a while to fully learn enough to assist the majority of customers that come in.
good,"The most enjoyable pat of this job was the learning of the products and the operational side of the business. This is where, I really polished my talent for managing a team. The co-workers were always fun to work with and ready to take on any tasks. In All, It was a great company to work at!"
good,Working in Sherwin-Williams will enable you to gain an extensive amount of knowledge. Very challenging workplace with a high turn over rate
good,"good place to work have plenty of chances to move up in positions, friendly managers, great team players. always willing to help. clean place to work"
good,I liked working with my team it was very fast paced work but I enjoyed it and learning new things everyday about the machines and the processes of keeping our work area up and running.
good,"A typical day at work consists of dealing with customers that are in high demand of paint for hospitality management/resorts and some DIY/contractors.  I learn how to manage day to day operations and needs of not only the customers, the company and other employees.  I have to know how to meet everyone's needs and have correct recommendations for each individuals painting needs.  One of the hardest parts of the job is explaining to customers they are not always able to purchase paint for less than the sticker price.  Some contractors/chief engineers think they should receive the lowest price on all products, which hurts budget requirements.  An enjoyable part of the job is co-workers and meeting new people through the public."
good,"waiting on customers, answering phone calls, making sure I was on time for my deliveries. I learned how to work with customers, mixed paints, I enjoyed working with my boss and my co workers. The hardest part of my day was driving to customers locations and unloading heavy gallons of paint."
good,I really enjoyed my experience at Sherwin Williams Canada. But found no oppurtunities for any advancement.
good,Loved going to work after school. Was a good learning process.
good,"A typical day at work would be helping customers with whatever they needed.  Also answer the phones, tint paint, help customers pick out paint colors, stock items, etc. I really enjoy my manager and assistant manager they are very helpful and are fun to be around.  My co-workers are very nice and super funny, I enjoy working with them.  The hardest part of my job would be not knowing enough information to really help someone out with a hard task, and lifting paint that is way to heavy.  The most enjoyable part of my job is helping home owners with paint colors, and making a customers day a whole lot better."
good,"Retail store management can be fun.  You run your own store and corporate gives you guidelines on what goals need to be achieved on a monthly/quarterly/annually basis.  The hardest part is when management pairs you in a difficult situation by not allowing you to select who you will be working with as well as cutting hours allotted to part timer helpers, pretty much the only downside.  Great place to work overall.  "
good,"As a manager, you will do, be, and perform everything to and for every one of your customers. It is challenging, time-consuming, and exhausting, but can be rewarding in many instances."
good,Working with a tight knit group of people. I drive 34 miles for a six to ten hour work day consisting mostly of helping customers decide what is the best product for their home improvement needs.
good,A typical day at work would be answering phone and taking customer orders. Placing those orders in our Customer Order Entry system and giving a job to an installer. Dealing with customer issues and problem solving.
good,Servicing contractors and maintaining the warehouse throughout daily orders
good,"The work stress flows greatly from season to season, and store to store. The manager of each store is allowed to run the store in their own way and that creates a very different condition from location to location."
good,"The work at sherwin Williams wasn‚Äôt too hard,"
good,the most enjoyable part of work was making long distance deliveries and building relationships with the customers. making diy paints and satisfying customers with the end result.
good,It was a nice experience. That all out me to upgrade my life. Everyone there was very respectful and knowledgeable about the things they were teaching me. I‚Äôd go back if I could.
good,The ops manager is fantastic and goes to great lengths to do his job well  the facility manager doesn‚Äôt actually know the work we do which is a problem. He‚Äôs very by the numbers but doesn‚Äôt have the basic real word production experience so he constantly over promises what we can do in an allotted time frame.
good,The time that I spent working at the sunrise facility. I encountered a manager that only cared about themselves and not their subordinates. And had a supervisor that stole from the company and tied to set me up. But beyond all this its a reasonable company to work for. They do need to increase the pay for the amount of work that needs to be done.
good,"Positive environment, good culture, work life balance can be an issue depending on department. Good development path and company supports internal promotion."
good,"Great company and good benefits for full time employees, but not great for part-time and cannot understand why they can't keep part-time employees when the pay is low for the area."
good,I enjoyed working here but it was up to 60 per week. We had trouble getting staff and key holders.Staff turn over was huge as they were all students .so lots of training was required
good,"empresa agradavel de trabalhar, beneficios bons, horarios adequados"
good,great place to work great staff great management everyone i ever worked with was knowledgeable and willing to help. great benefits and overall good atmosphere
good,"As a part timer, the pay could be higher then $10.50/hr I got and hours not cut from 28 to 20. Overall, I enjoyed the crew I worked with and I learned more about paint than I thought possible. No doubt they are the paint professionals."
good,"It was an enjoyable but, sometimes stressful job.  They had flexible hours but, maintained a short staff so customer service could be better since customers had longer wait times than necessary."
good,Contractors suck and think they are Gods amongst men and expect  a lot of attention over the home owners. besides that its pretty cool and you always get 40% off all paints and stains.
good,"Good staff and co-workers, not too good of a pay."
good,It's a nice experience at sherwin Garland plant. I love going to work first days are a bit of struggle since it's much to learn and low pay but it gets better after
good,"Aprend√≠ mucho sobre el tema de pinturas, productos ,aplicaciones,fichas t√©cnicas,campos de aplicaci√≥n,variedad de productos industriales y sus usos."
good,Must be able to multi task and work one on one with customers. Must be quick on your toes and be able to take in information and retain it well. Fun place but a lot of hard work.
good,"-Worked cooperatively with coworkers and managers"
good,I learned to manage more customers and even employees with working here. It was just difficult to move up into the company.  Most people were easy to work with and Im glad i just had the experience.
good,"I had a good internship experience. Interview process was pretty standard. First round phone screen with internal recruiter then an onsite interview. "
good,It was fun but i never got the promotion i was promised. Very fast paced the customers were cool very loyal never talked down to anyone. Always had a smile on their faces an
good,"Very interesting learning the technology associated with paint and application systems"
good,"Good pay, benefits, retirement and more. Quick pace environment and very social at times. Work culture is very strong. You will meet great people and from strong relationships."
good,"My previous manager was amazing and took care of his employees. Great role model, boss, and friend. But when he was replaced, the new management was nice, but would forget to communicate certain issues with her employees, which would result in us getting trouble by upper management."
good,"Corporate is incredibly focused on meeting goals such as lead generation calls, new accounts, sales, margins, etc., which makes the job stressful at times.  The company works hard to make sure employees are trained properly to do their respective jobs."
good,It was a great job.Got plenty of hands on experience.They give yearly bonuses up to 4500.00 for the hourly staff.They are unionized with pension plan.
good,"The work at Sherwin is good and the pay is better even still, but there is too much pressure to work saturdays, and the mandatory overtime becomes too much."
good,"Corporate experience, nothing more nothing less. Decent pay though not much opportunity for raises. Hires many managers fresh out of college, many not having had a real job before"
good,It taught me a great way to set a routine and be organized for my daily runs and checks up for my scheduled work shifts. I recommend being on time for so you can relieve the officer who is working prior to your shift.
good,"Good job and great people to work with put low pay, part time, and no benefits. All in all, a temporary type of job for most. If they allowed full time employment with benefits and room to grow, i nerver would have left."
good,"My particular office offered the opportunity to build your sales experience with not only homeowners but also with businesses in the area. Learning not only the newest products for homeowners, but also for industrial projects for contractors."
good,"I received 4 promotions while there eventually to scientist.  I saved the company ~$ 300,000 in developing Duration Home still sold.  I was also project leader for the development of Resilience, an outdoor paint that would not wash off 30 minutes after applying."
good,everything is good. team culture is good. team is good. team members are good. manager is good company provides medical expenses. work culture is good.
good,It was a good job I like working there I liked the 3 days a week and my coworkers was very helpful the team leaders Most of the time it was a friendly  Environment
good,The job can be fast paced and can be slow at times. You learn many things about products and people. Management is great depending where you  go and who you have.
good,I worked at sherwin williams for four years during high school and college. I was able to transfer to Oregon when I moved which was great. I learned alot about paint.
good,Sherwin Williams helped me deal with & hold conversations with people on a higher level. Also helped me learn more about construction as well as the paint industry & how much opportunity there is in those fields
good,This is a good company that rewards those who work hard. There is a lot of opportunity for growth. The only bad thing that I have to say is that it gets way too competitive at times.
good,Sherwin is a stressful place to work with not enough play. If I was paid more and didn't have to deal wth as much stress I wouldn't mind it as much. Maybe the paint business isnt for me.
good,"I started at Sherwin when the Decorative Product Specialist program was in it's very early stages. There were still kinks that had to be dealt with and the hours varied due to lack of customer base knowledge of the program. It was all mostly by referral. Though it was very educational, the experience was well worth it. Working with new people and getting to work on a schedule that worked for me was imperative since I was still in school. The training and flexibility were the key factors as to why I enjoyed the job. Lack of hours and pay was the reason why I had to leave."
good,"Bad work/life balance due to retail hours including most holidays and natural disasters such as hurricanes. Placed at stores without consent. Store 1 mile away, no. Store 45+ minutes, placed."
good,I would usually drive over 100 miles a day delivering paint and paint supplies. Also working with customers in store helping them decide what paints are best for the job. I learned how to properly load trucks and how to make people feel welcome and comfortable in what would be a stressful time for most.
good,I had basic functions of recruiting. they had little room for advancement and benefits were average. Hardest part of the job was doing the same thing with little opportunity to be creative.
good,Sherwin Williams is a pretty decent place to work. If you don't mind having to do a lot of closing or working extra hours if need be especially in management.
good,"It is a customer base work environment. If you have a good team you will really enjoy working there. A lot of work is hands on,  daily work load could vary from day to day."
good,"Work was well supported by management, but pay was low and life alone was not sustainable. I loved working with the customers and colors. Hardest part of the job was really just the heavy lifting. it wasn't really a very demanding job. workplace culture is very laid back for the mostpart."
good,Sherwin-Williams is a paint supply company with great support for management..... Not really sure what else to put......................................
good,"Sherwin-Williams has taught me how to manage time, activities, and fellow co-workers according to various situations. The hardest part of the job was the constant heavy lifting of gallons of paint as well as five gallon buckets of paint. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with. We all became very close in the years we worked together. I also very much enjoyed working with customers on a daily basis with their project needs. When the customer left the store happy due to the help I provided, I felt accomplished."
good,"Great career experience. Fast paced, global company that has grown tremendously over the past decade. It has been a pleasure meeting and working with people all over the world."
good,I learned a lot about customer service by interacting with different painters and their clients. The skills I learned there I am still using to this day.
good,"I was a part-timer, everyday we would stock shelves, help customers, get orders ready for contractors. Sales such as super sale were difficult at times because there was not enough staff scheduled during the sale and customers would get frustrated at how long it would take to get their order done. I learned a lot about paint/stain products, prepping, contractor grade paints, and paint supplies. Something that seemed unfair is the MTP program. As a part-timer, it was up to us to train these MTP's coming to us straight out of college. The most unfair part was that we knew more about the products than the MTP's themselves but they were the ones getting to go straight into an assistant managers position. It was frustrating having to teach someone things just for them to be paid more than they are qualified for. The most enjoyable part of the job was building relationships with customers and being able to help them make difficult decisions regarding their color choices in/on their homes. On the upper hand, if you do have a degree then this job would benefit you."
good,Smallish site that had a very family environment.  Boss was very knowledgable about job and pushed for everyone to improve and be able to get promoted.
good,"Overall a good experience, fast paced with a lot to learn and hone your skills on. I enjoyed the time there and learned quite a bit. The management was always helpful as well."
good,"working for this company was great. Pressure free and management was very flexible about schedules. Although working part time, I wass able to  take vacation as well."
good,Always enjoyed the team and majority of management. definite room for growth! Perfect for college grads. Company meetings and conferences were an honor to be a part of.
good,"It's very hard to get a permanent position at Sherwin williams. I was hired through MFG Resource and then hired by Sherwin to work as a flex employee. Once my time as a flex employee ran out i had the option to interview for a permanent position, along with about 10 others. Management gave everyone tips on how to excel during the interview process. They really do want their employees to succeed. Although it does get a little discouraging because if someone has a relative or some type of pull within rhe company, theu are more likely than not to be hired on permanent. Other than that, my time at Sherwin taught me a lot and i wouldn't trade my time at the company for anything."
good,Good opportunities to learn and be challenged.  Usual daily workload are often increased to achieve new goals. There are really good people there and I enjoyed it.
good,I liked working at Sherwin because it was a place where I knew I could move up in the company. The management at the store I worked at was great and I loved everyone I worked with. Most of the customers were awesome too.
good,I enjoyed my time with Sherwin Williams. Advancement opportunities are slim as they recruit management trainees from college campuses instead of within the company.
good,With Proper traing and a degree there was room for upward mobility if desired however a lot of it comes down to waitning for positions to open. The compensation as a full time employee could have been better.
good,"Maior empresa de tintas do mundo, com muitas dificuldades. Novos projetos em ascens√£o, mas muito perdida nos estudos, e estrategias a serem tra√ßadas, mega empresa, excelente cultura, mas com algumas dificuldades de gest√£o, aceitaria o desafio novamente, mas agora com novos conhecimentos e novas abordagens."
good,"Not a bad part time gig. There's a lot to learn, but the day goes fast. Pay is at the bottom of the average part-time pay scale. Worked with decent people but there was little consistency across stores. Your experience could vary greatly depending on your store management. Got no training since the store was seriously short-handed by the time they could hire me. So the manager and asst. manager had no time to show me things. Was just told..""you'll figure it out eventually"". This from two employees who'd been with the company for over 20 years. I am working there part-time as a retiree. Their point of sale system is ancient and not user friendly."
good,"customer are mostly good. management can get stupid at times. weekends are a must. low pay starting off but once you invest time and also if your management and store does great bonus can be worth it,"
good,"Tinting paint for customers and asking about what projects they are working on in order to give then the correct product they need for the job. Ringing people out, answering phone calls, and helping customers find colors."
good,"Customers depend on your more than any other job I have had. You needed to know things. You had to learn, but learning wasn't hard. You actually helped people instead of forcing things on them. The only problem is that if your area is saturated with Sherwin Williams stores, there is no opportunity to grow. My store had another Sherwin Williams 10 minutes in each direction. There wasn't enough painters to go around. You couldn't build business. We spoke to managers outside our district, and they all confirmed that getting new business in an area like ours was a very uphill battle. We were competing with other Sherwin Williams stores, not our business competitors."
good,"my days consisted of a lot of heavy lifting in a hot warehouse. the work atmosphere was nice though, the company did a good job of hiring hard and friendly workers."
good,They give you 38 hours so they dont have to give you insurance. Other than that it's an ok place to work at managment gives you the tools you need to get valuble sales experince.
good,Had the necessary requirements of a job. This job involved a lot of teamwork to tackle different tasks.  I organized the store and made it look inviting to customers and helped customers find what they needed for their projects.
good,"I like working at Sherwin Williams. There are some great people that come in the store and get to meet all kinds of new people every day. i really like it here. Its only part time i want one full time job,"
good,"I can honestly say EVERYTHING was fine with Sherwin Williams, when I was hired they treated me like family, I'm very thankful for this opportunity."
good,Great place to just do your job and leave. They pay well and provide many different career opportunities. I still receive stocks from them even though I have not worked there for years.
good,"An average day at work is hard, but if you have the right employees it could be fun. I learned a lot of managerial experience by working with company, however this company doesn't recognize their employees on merit."
good,I do some in-home consultations as well as work with residential home owners and commercial contractors.  The work place is friendly and very laid back.
good,They have good benefits. It was a great experince to travel the united states and im highly greatful for all that they have done for me so far its good pay.
good,"Work here is a fast paced environment. You are constantly on the move to meet the production standards which makes the days go by quicker, and there is also plenty of opportunity for working overtime hours."
good,"I would recommend Sherwin Williams as a company to work for if sales is in your career interests. It can be a stressful, fast paced environment. Usually the co worker atmosphere is relaxed."
good,It was a good place to work but it was part time and I needed fulltime hours and more pay. I enjoyed doing deliveries and working  with the public. Overall good place.
good,Sherwin Williams is an excellent company to grow with and those that take their job seriously and put in the effort are rewarded with great pay and benefits. Quick advancement opportunities
good,"If you don't mind working a minimum required 44 hours a week for an Assistant Manager, and 48 weekly required for a store manager this might be the place for you. If you can handle being the only person in the store for the majority of those hours."
good,Always good busy work and good management.  Good opportunity for in-company advancement. Relaxed fun atmosphere to work in. Good hard working co-workers working everyday towards the same objectives and goals.
good,"Solid work force and management. A typical day is full of phone calls, placing customer orders large as well as small, handling accounts receivable, handling collections, sales calls, merchandise management as well."
good,Long hours and manual work.  If you are fine with that it is a decent job.  Steady pace in most locations.  No steady schedule makes hard for a personal life.
good,great management and leadership at all levels. moderate pay. normal nuances working in retail. advancement can be challenging if not open to relocating
good,"I clock in at 7:30 and from there I look on the ""deliver"" bored to separate the paper work to see what goes first to last. After that I start to load the truck up starting what goes last to first that makes it easier for me when I unload the truck. Then I start my day driving and doing my delivers."
good,"I had the pleasure of sustaining various levels of management. Mentoring employees during their training periods was satisfying knowing my effective communication skills assisted in the growth towards their career goals."
good,"Es una excelente empresa, solo No llegamos a un acuerdo de contrato, ya que me encontraba con contratista"
good,Would definitely recommend working at this facility. Great focus on the people and their safety. Continuous improvement is a vital component of working for this company.
good,A typical day at Sherwin Williams requires a lot of lifting. You need to be attentive to the customers and fill their needs.
good,"it is a good place to work at, but the work we do and the pay we recieve does not add up in my opinion. managemenr cut corners, safety was the lasr thing to worry about."
good,"√ìtima empresa, sal√°rio competitivo, √≥timos benef√≠cios."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is that there is always something new to learn. You might not be doing the same thing every day. The hardest part of the job is when you are first hired, there is a lot of paperwork & boring testing. Co-workers can really help make for a fun environment. Sometimes management can have a favorite employee & show favoratism. That can be discouraging. I learned a lot with Sherwin Williams, I started out working part time & moved up to Assistant Manager."
good,"The mornings begin with rush hour until about 10 am until the contractors have the products they need to accomplish the project of the day. There is another rush hour in the middle of the day after lunch."

good,The company seems to be well run. The manager is very knowledgeable and know his customers. There is a broad range of projects and clients Sherwin Williams is able to provide assistance for. It is a professional and competent operation.
good,"If you like working with a tight-knit small team do achieve your own business goals, this is for you. The store is guided by the district manager and city manager but it is up to you and the manager to complete all the daily fuctions as well as build relationships with customers to promote repeat transactions."
good,"Opening the store, answering the phone, cashing customers out, finding the correct parts, calling customers back, mixing paint.  The hardest part about the job is being understaffed.  Most enjoyable part of the job is putting a smile on the customers face"
good,"Selling paint to either commercial operations or do-it-yourself project seekers. Learned to aid people in deciding on correct paint color, texture, and type. Management was knowledgable and helpful. Coworkers were available to help and to train. The job was difficult at times because of large orders and heavy lifting. The job had a good work/life balance."
good,The typical day is very stressful. You will learn patience and how to deal with problems. Customer service is the main point of the job.
good,Cool place to work. The work place and co workers are all nice. Some times there isn't any jobs for stores or customers so you kind of just sit around but if u like that it might be your cup of tea. The managers are really helpful and go out of their way to help you learn.
good,"The staff is pleasant, management is pleasant to work with."
good,"Working at Sherwin-Williams is great because you get to go on deliveries to get out of the office for a few hours, Learned a lot about mixing paint and other home tools products."

good,"Great place to work."
good,This place wasn't very fun while I worked there a lot of employee lawsuits and corporate driven sales drives from out of touch management.  When I left however I learned that it was actually a very good company.
good,Great company to work for but work life balance is horrible. Upper manangement does care about their employees but your peers make the job worth while.
good,"Co-workers are fine. A typical day is to to load up the previous days left-over runs . Then  go from there .I made delivery's in all kinds of weather , and learned the city very well. Driving was the enjoyable part of the job ,  loading  and  unloading  the  difficult  part ."
good,"going in with a positive attitude and helping others with orders as needed, greeting customers as they enter the store and offer assistance, check the literature and fill if necessary, I like with working with my co workers and working as a team, fill the shelves if needed"
good,"Like any retail position, the customers can be the worst part of the job. Especially contractors. If you do well, you can go far in the company."
good,Great overall company to work for. Can be stressful at times. Employees and store managers are great for the most part. Company prefers to promote from within.
good,"if you are competitive, introverted and like to do the exact same thing everyday with decent pay.  This is your job!"
good,It is a decent place to work and most of the people there are pleasant and OK to be around 8 hours a day. You can work somewhat independently but have to be able to fold into the team when needed. Management for the most part is fine and do not micro manage.
good,"Basically ran the store when the managers were away. From 3-7 every night I took care of all the closing duties, as well as handled customers orders. This usually means I was doing 3-4 things at once, while taking orders over the phone. I loved my co-workers when I saw them, but it was few and far in between."

good,Alot of room for advancement in company. Great benefits and flexibility. Awesome company
good,The best part of the job is the schedule. It is first shift M-F and two 15 min paid breaks. No overtime is offered and it should be sometimes.
good,Sherwin Williams is a good company to work for but I question the management.
good,made it easy to go to school full time and to work part time enjoyed it and gained some knowledge of coating also.
good,This job consisted of special color orders. and wallcovering orders.
good,"Working at Sherwin williams you can expect every day to have new types of customers. Lots of the work is second nature after a while but every day still has new challenges and your constantly learning. Here I have learned a lot about paint, how to sell product, how to tell a good product, and how best to work with the general public. The co-workers are great and we get along well. The hardest part of this job is the unexpected, never knowing when you will get a question that you have never heard before. But the most enjoyable part is being able to satisfy a customers needs with confidence."
good,"Sherwin Williams is a great company whom looks out for all its employees. Try out this company, they are great"
good,The days seemed to fly by with how busy we were. I liked the constant movement and the flexibility of my manager.

good,I enjoyed meeting new people and also see previous customers almost everyday.
good,"I thoroughly enjoy working for this company.  They expect a lot and accurately compensate for it.  I have learned a lot through local SW training and out of state SW training.  Work days can sometime be very fast paced hectic, while somedays move a little more slowly.  I have learned to adapt and use my time wisely given the current situation.  "
good,My experience with Sherwin-Williams has been very beneficial and has allowed me to build my customer service and warehousing skills. The management staff have allowed me the freedom to pursue my education. 
good,A typical day at work for me is to make sure everything is stock and filled.
good,Developed new and modified existing software applications for warehouse automatization
good,Great place to learn about business. The most enjoyable part is helping out customers. The co-workers and management are friendly and are always willing to help out.

good,Dealt with a variety of customers on helping them with paint. Put away stock and freight that have came into the store.

good,learned alot about retail sales and the paint industry sales and application

good,I work part time during the day and it is a variety of functions we do.
good,- Ensuring the satisfaction of both commercial and DIY customers and building positive long term relationships with them.
good,Every day is fun and challenge working at a busy paint store. We do not know how the day is going to turn out and what make it more fun and interesting is with the people I work with and our customers.
good,Was a very intense period of work-life.
good,I was given a huge responsibilities despite being an intern that gave me expansive knowledge and experience in the Marketing world including in-house and agency side and demonstrated key areas that I could explore once I finished uni.
good,See above. Over all good place to work but not for the fient of heart. High stress with not alot of reward. Constant haggle from customers every single day with little to show of gratitude.
good,"Sherwin-Williams is a fast-paced workplace. Sales and customer service are the focus here. Self-driven, independent learners will succeed here. A promote-from-within work culture guarantees advancement for those who put in the effort."
good,"I learned a lot about management and their products. As an intern, you were given a notebook with all the things you would need to know about the company and its products. It also served as a guide for if they offered you a full-time position."
good,Interact with a lot of people and problem solving along with color consulting. Depending on what store location you are you will also have paint deliveries to complete as well
good,"Although I would not recommend staying there as a full time associate, my position provided a fairly good overview of sales and a hard work environment. The management was just ok at times, and the intense labor was demanding. However, opportunities to advance were readily available."
good,Great company to work for. High paced with many challenges throughout  each work day. Very good benifits and good opportunities for further advancement
good,"I've learned a lot about the way a business is run and opperated by being an assistant manager, with this company.  Opperations is oneofmybiggest focuses and I am relied on to make sure everything runs smoothly and that store stock is maintained each week."
good,"Good Company to work for, great benifits and insurance in you can get into a postion that offers them. Highly recomment for for highschool job must be 17. Opprotunity to promote. Needs to pay part time employees more for requirements asked to learn and tasks that are requested to be performed"
good,"Considero uma excelente empresa, por mais que eu tenha sido demitido sem saber qual o real motivo."
good,A fun place to work.. where I got to use my organizational skills.  And Re-organized a lot of the warehouse and relabeled all of the shelving for easy reading and accessibility.  The managers were very happy with my input!
good,"Go to work everyday. Be on time. Sometimes you have to work long hours but it's easy money. Oh, and pay attention to what you are doing. Sherwin-Williams"
good,"The whole company is great to work for , but they need to look at who ior how some managers run there offices , look at other ways of doing sales instead of all the corporate things"
good,"Great part time job to have when your in college or taking classes. I worked there during my last semester in college before I graduated. It allowed me to earn money, while going to classes, and studying for exams."
good,"I enjoyed working with customers & employees.  Benefits are great.  As a manager you are paid salary .  You work a lot of hours and are on your feet all day long. You must be able to multi task and lift frequently.  You also work by yourself a lot , Not enough staff"
good,"I was a Third Key at the biggest store in Denver.  I have other things in life that are important to me other than work, personal obligations and things that I need to do.  My manager did not understand that and when I did not bend on a particular schedule (even though I was getting all my work done without being asked), it all came crumbling down and I quit.  However, my  previous positions at Sherwin were the best thing that ever happened to me."
good,I would help customers select paint types and colors that best suited their painting needs. I would also help mix and tint paint for customers whether they were citizens or contractors.
good,"The job is overall simple, it‚Äôs just about learning your products and how to execute the job perfectly for the customers. You meet a wide range of people from big contractors to simple, at home fixers. definitely an interesting environment to be in."
good,I enjoyed this job and the people who came and gone. This job is easy once you learn the products and the system. The hardest part of this job is  putting truck away or learning the product knowledge. The contractors that come in are pretty funny and chill and the home owners are easy to get along with.
good,I enjoyed my time with Sherwin Williams would have loved to stay but due to needing a full time job and being overlooked 3 times i needed something new.
good,its okay to work there. Management needs to be better at being aware of the needs of their employees. Too much emphasis on meeting goals that are almost impossible to meet.
good,Only part-time experience. Similar daily tasks. Regular customers. tedious work. Pay is comparatively good. Cannot speak to long-term career experience.
good,"Perfect for part-time work. I love that no day is the same and it can be a fast paced environment. Management changes often, so that can trickle in a good or bad way down the chain."
good,"I enjoyed working at Sherwin Williams very much.  It was my first real job, and having only two other coworkers, I felt welcome right away. I made a lifetime friend with the assistant manager. "
good,"Not the worst place I have ever worked, it really depends on the branch and team you work with."
good,"Sell and mix paint for customers and contract. I learned about different types of paint, what products need to be used for certain jobs. The most enjoyable part was being around my coworkers."
good,"I worked here a summer in between college semesters. I learned an incredible amount about paint and related products. Not necessarily interesting for an outsider, but they gave you the tools to be an expert in the day-to-day field. "
good,Great place to work with good benefits.  The management team was good for the most part.  Was a very team-oriented environment and fast-paced.  There will be lots of overtime.
good,A typical work day starts by helping several customers followed by a slow period where deliveries are done. Business picks up after lunch and slowing down again as closing time approaches.
good,"Sherwin Williams provides on the job training and advancement. This is a good entry level position, Sherwin Williams is all about educating their employees regarding the products. Sales associates interested in becoming an Assistant manager have good opportunities for advancement within the company."
good,Good company for recent college graduates. I was relocated and was not sure if I wanted to continue doing that to advance. The salary was decent for recent college graduates
good,Es una compa√±√≠a que tiene buena oportunidades de crecer uno como empleador. La compa√±√≠a es una que tiene muy buenas vendas y su calidad de producto es muy eficiente.
good,"A typical day at work included selling anything paint related, and providing guest with the best shopping experience possible. I learned how to work with guests on multiple levels. Management was always there to help. The hardest part of the job was trying to match paint colors when they become difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job was working and conversating with our guests."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Sherwin Williams. I learned a lot about color, design, and efficiency. However, the promotion process was impossible. I had to leave because i could no longer survive on the pay and hours i was given."
good,"Some managers are great at their job and pretty funto work with, some are strictly business but the work environment changes with the manager. Overall it is a good company to work for."
good,"Work isn't very hard, people are really nice First and Third shift supervisors are awesome.  the turnover is high bc of so much OT.  training isn't sufficient injuries are frequent.  Management doesn't always listen they kind of brush you off.  I don't really want to leave bc I love my work crews"
good,Reasonably easy sales/service position that required regular heavy lifting. Management was responsive schedule requests. Enjoyable environment for work although lacking in actual upward movement opportunities.
good,es una empresa donde el caracter del due√±o no ayuda mucho y no trata de hacer que el personal se sienta agusto al contrario entre mas la pisetee mejor
good,"I did enjoy working for Sherwin. I felt that I was actually helping people. I had issues with management and their part-time employee policies. While I was working there I got two raises over 15 months. Once for becoming a key holder and then again for transfering to a new store. Even though I was making an entire $1.50 more, I wasn't getting enough hours for it to make a difference in my pay. On average I was making less money with a raise than I was before I got the raise. This is because Sherwin changed the maximum hours part-timers could have per week to 28 hrs or less. I had no opportunity to advance to full-time at my store, I would have had to wait 6 months to see a position in another department and I was 7 months pregnant. After my maternity leave paperwork got messed up, I decided to leave because I couldn't see myself providing for my daughter while being there."
good,"Typical company, competitive benefits for full timers etc. Problem is that just like every other major american corporation, they pay the guys on the floor like dirt, over work them,  under staff every store, and in general just make it insanely difficult for anyone to actually do all the things that are required of them in a day. With billions in profit a year you shouldnt be paying your laborers minimum wage, you shouldnt be forcing your managers to pull 12 hours days 5 days a week, you shouldnt be poaching employees from one store to another without proper coverage. Number one customer complaint is that there is too much turnover, and nobody cares, why do you think that is?"
good,"Statesville was originally Valspar. Really thought things will change for the better, it really has gotten worst since being an addition to SW. We were a much much smaller warehouse and staffing group than most original SW sites. We work our tails off 7 days a week 10-12 hrs every day for 3 months straight before getting caught up. Money is great, but personal and family time is hardly ever there. Work here in Statesville for over 6 years now, it almost repeats itself every year. Work your tail off the first 1-9 months, then almost jobless for the rest of the year. Just a paint nature I suppose."
good,"good systems to develop sales people.  They train well, so someone without sales experience can move from a store environment to an outside sales position."
good,√ìtima empresa para trabalhar. Conviv√™ncia com todos foi sempre como uma fam√≠lia.
good,It has been a pleasure to work for this company.  I have met great coworkers and have grown within the company quickly. You are able to take on new responsibilities and tasks with each new position.
good,"The hardest part of working at sherwin williams is lifting Five gallon buckets of paint, sometimes you have to pick multiples of 2-3 for a customer."
good,"I would recommend this job to anyone looking for a different but rewarding career in the paint industry. Company rewards its employees based on how good your store sales are quarterly. Job can be stressful due to deadlines and upper management demands for perfection. Overall this job might be perfect for some, but not for others."
good,"Sherwin Williams overall is a great company.  My boss is great but upper management can be hard, it is hard to advance in Sherwin Williams without working there for over 5 years."
good,"Great company to work for. It is tough to have a work life balance being that you work 48 hrs a week as a manager, and you have to work at least one weekend a month, sometimes more when you don't have enough staff or key-holders in your location. The pay is decent for what we do, more than a lot of other places. The actual benefits and stock options are awesome though."
good,"Was passed over for advancement because of MAT leave, now stuck with an assistant manager who is lazy, overbearing and incompetent. This is a store issue, not a company issue though. Great benefits and work atmosphere, if it suits you. Also I was recently shorted a days pay and my overtime for working Canada day. Still waiting for a resolution a month later."
good,Overall great company but often under staffed whoch causes strain on work/family life balance. Overall company puts alot of money into training the MTP in comparison  to other companies
good,Fast paced workplace.  High value on  customer service and introducing new products for customer  loyalty  and  taking  market share from the  competition.  Bantering  between  employees and  customers  is everyday occurrence.
good,"Very good company. Great training. Hard work and training will prepare you for other opportunities. Very good benefits and good people. However, some upper level management only considers employees as numbers and expendable."
good,My current role is an every changing exciting role.  There are specific goals and responsibilities each day.  I am also challenge to find solutions and innovations to new technology and customers each day.  I work a lot of hours; but I relish in the fact because I am a winner and want to ensure that I am in charge of every capacity of my facility.
good,"My store was awesome, the people were really cool and laid back, and my boss was a good dude, but a lot of other management seemed clueless and corrupt"
good,meh the managers were petty and cheap. the hours were treated like the company would go under if anyone got even close to 20 hours a week. the work was easy though
good,There was always something to earn while working at this job. It is a place where there is a lot of opportunity for growth. It was aa fast paced working environment.
good,This work environment actually made me want to come into work. It was not too strenuous but good for the employee to come in and work and work well. I found that it was a good place to learn and actually work with customers well.
good,"If one wants to advance within the company they must be willing to relocate. They must also be willing to work in the field and work as a sales representative. Mandatory 44 hours a week, no more or no less as an assistant."
good,"Nice people and good place to work, many things to learn in all aspects or work. Manager could use more training. ...................................."
good,i loved my boss he was a hard working person who would also pitch in and help if we needed it. my day to day activities included taking stock of product making outbound sales calla managing customer accounts and also dealing with and trying to fix any complaints we had .
good,You must be willing to adapt to changes quickly. Lots of information is handed down to you and you have to implement and understand it all while achieving your sales targets. Extremely high paced. Be willing to relocate in order to advance career quicker
good,"Apoyo al empleado y mejor ambiente de trabajo, aceptar las vacaciones cuando el empleado las solicita ya que muchas veces no las permiten por cuestiones de los jefes mismos por no perjudicarce"
good,Just know your manager and coworkers because sometimes they will have there favorite workers who will let them get away with stuff so I can say is if it's not about paint don't talk about it
good,Bom ambiente de trabalho. Bons benef√≠cios e equipe.
good,"It is a fortune 500 company with great advancement if your used to the enterprise rental template.  If you are over 23yo they will not consider you for the mtp training program, also need to be enrooled full time or part time in college."
good,"Schedule appointments with current contractors to discuss plans to help with their business and discuss our products and service's."
good,The company overall is great but the management in the plants leaves a lot to be desired. The managers at each individual plant do not necessarily align with the culture Sherwin hopes to have: family atmosphere.
good,"My overall experience with Sherwin-Williams was great! However, my Job Work/Life Balance suffered a bit. They provide great Compensation/Benefits. I used to think that Job Security was a thing at SW, until I saw senior managers and myself let go due to a company acquisition. Sherwin is definitely sub-par when it comes to Career Advancements. Although, the Job Culture of the department I was with was amazing."
good,bon environnement de travail mais peu d'avancement dans les salaires et autres .
good,"Overall, this is a wonderful company for entry- level college grads to get into; the benefits offered with the position, along with the level of Managerial Experience that will be gained because of this endeavor is Awesome! Networking is extremely important and career advancement seems to rest heavily in the hands of ""who you know"", so as soon as you start the company, I recommend joining one of the external SW resource groups to market yourself better. "
good,"handling payroll, maintaining stores appearance ,lifting heavy objects, performing office duties, billing, mixing paints, educating customers about our products and services, helping customers with picking out paint colors and some assistance on interior designing."
good,"Day in day out not a bad place to work. Benefits are pretty good ( 401k, health etc.) Advancement opportunity not there and the management is lacking in relating to employees."
good,Great company but tough time due to big acquisitions. Its old company with excellent product line. Working here is challenge due to very senior management. Its hard to mold their thoughts. Most often you  are going to loose your voice for your say.
good,"I really enjoyed the building relationships with my customers. Getting them into the store, selling them products and growing their business."
good,"I worked doe Sherwin Williams for a brief time while I was going to school, It was agreat sales and business learning experience and Im glad I had the chance to be a part of the team I can always go back to that company just got tired of Paint Industry"
good,"Super busy store that requires multi tasking. Non stop phone calls for a busy store, but its nice to get to know contractors. The management depends on what store you work at."
good,Solid company that has had many management changes in recent years.  The company owns many well known consumer brands and most recently have acquired Valspar.
good,"Nice place to work. No medical benefits for part timers, rare to move up without a degree. Not a long-term career unless you have a degree most likely."
good,"Good place to work. Friendly Staff. Decent pay. Decent hours. Management took some getting used to, but were easy to work with and take directions from."
good,"I was only there for the summer so take the review with a grain of salt. The management seemed like good people, I was kept busy, and they were very considerate about my schedule for classes."
good,"Depending on your city manager or District Manager, the job can be very frustrating and may be hard. Do not allow managers above you tell you what to do when they do not really know your market or store."
good,"The company itself is great. There is constant turn over in Management. This particular location is filled with primarily seasoned individuals. At times they thrust inexperienced individuals in a management position, overlooking qualified experienced individuals. Basically, it's not ""what you know, but who you know"". Doesn't motivate a person to concept of ""reaching for the stars"". Not a lot of room for advancement unless you move out of state. Very stringent in some cases."
good,"This is an excellent company to work for with career advancement opportunity. If you do not have a college degree, your career advancement chances are very low. At the store level, all job positions are labor intensive. At the store level, the job is basically retail."
good,Has a great work atmosphere. Nice People and a great place to get your feet wet in the production field. Awesome management and supervisors.
good,"Empresa √≥tima de se trabalhar com √≥timos benef√≠cios por√©m, ano aberta a oportunidade e crescimento do profissional"
good,"Delivered Paint and Paint supplies to contractors."
good,"The work environment is great, all the staff is really friendly and helpful with any information. always working together, there is no competition. at times it gets overwhelming because not enough staff, but overall manageable.also Flexible schedule, manager is really understanding."
good,"I just help customers everyday, I learn about products everyday, on tuesdays we get trucks that have our product in them and it usually takes a few day to put up. My coworkers are pretty good, very nice. The hardest part would probably have to be when a customer calls in like 50 or 60 gallon order over the phone and then 4 customers come in and you have to help them first."
good,"Learned a lot about paint. Customer service nonstop with contractors and paint businesses. The coworkers I worked with really made it a fun environment, however my main manager wasn't always fun to be around."
good,"I've worked for Sherwin for a brief time now ,but unfortunately I cant afford to stay here. The people are great and friendly but after now having my hours cut for the third time in three months I can't afford to stay. Working 25 hrs/wk for $9.67/hr is probably ok for a high school or college student but not for a 31 yr old man trying to raise a 9 yr old by himself."
good,Good company with good benefits. The first manager I had was a good man. My coworkers and I got along well. The last manager I had was so different than the first. I could not reason with him.
good,"Sherwin Williams is a good place to work if you enjoy the paint business. It is an easy company to advance in, and full time has good benefits. I enjoy the people I work with, they are what make the day fun. One of the hardest parts of the job is trying to memorize all the products and know what can be used for what. Once you get that down it's not as bad. It is a retail job, which means there are those crazy customers who go ballistic even over paint."
good,"Works accurately at a rapid pace and follows correct procedures,ensures that quality of work conforms to specifications."
good,"They provide payed courses."
good,"Great Management program, promotion from within opportunities. However, very demanding hours. Relocation an option if one is willing to move across the United States"
good,"Good employment, hard to advance, not many opportunities, fast paced environment, management was always good and reasonable, not much opportunity for coporate advancement without degree"
good,"Company its self is phenomenal, overall not a bad experience."
good,Sherwin Williams is a great company to work for and has many opportunities for advancement once you work there for at least three to four years.
good,"Empresa com grande potencial de crescer dentro do mercado, equipe totalmente unida e excelente produto melhor at√© do uqe os seus concorrentes."
good,"It is a good company to work for. It is doing very well financially and respects its employees. Management does not push too hard. Coworkers are friendly and wish to help you and advance company. Hardest part of the job is to get used to its size, but on other hand it has nice, professional culture and attitude."
good,Dia-a-dia ganho novas experi√™ncias no meu trabalho em equipe e fazendo sempre para que haja a satisfa√ß√£o em ambos os lados.
good,"I am currently an Assistant Manager. I was a Management Trainee for 8 months so do not believe that BS about ONLY ""training"" for 6 weeks. You will float to different stores, especially if you are unfortunate enough to start training in Houston. If you want to remain in your district DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT let them send you away to be placed outside your district because it will be extremely hard if you try to get back. Overall SW is like any other retail job. The hours suck but as an Assistant Manager you do not work more than 44 hours a week. Pay is very decent for someone just out of college and your benefits start immediately."
good,"Easy days usually. its retail with mainly contractors as customers. Good hands on training and education on paints and what they do, and what to recommend. Easy parts were helping customers. toughest part was doing weekly stock by yourself. Had fun with co workers and team. nice location, near everything."
good,"Due to the nature of the business, people with higher education will often feel unchallenged and over managed. Although the job does teach you fundamental management skills, it is not meant for University Business graduates."
good,Sherwin-Williams is a great company to work for.  A combination of co-workers and a positive work environment make this a good place to work at.
good,Empresa que sempre esta mudando a forma de pensar e buscando a melhoria continua dos processos. √ìtimos benef√≠cios e proporciona estabilidade para os funcion√°rios desenvolver seus trabalhos da melhor forma poss√≠vel.
good,"‚Ä¢	In charge of weekly purchases for the branch (External/Internal)"
good,"Work load various upon position but is not limited to job description. Job advancement various upon location, compenstation is competitive with room for advancement within bonsus structure."
good,I learned a lot about the process of painting and customer service. I was educated on the process of residential repainting and commercial painting. On a day to day basis I would constantly fill out paint orders that would be delivered.
good,Enjoyed my position at work. Enjoyed most of the people I worked with. Was able to manage my time at work with personal life very consistently.
good,"Need strong customer service to help customer to grow there business and I am able to grow in my career since I start as  a MTP assistant in Edmonton, I learn how to answer help customer on phone, Learn management style to get best our of staff."
good,"A typical day of work involves primarily helping customers and unloading the truck.  Other acitivities involve cleaning the store and doing some lead generation phone calls.  I've learned a lot about the paint industry and contractors over the past two years.  I'm fairly proud of the product and troubleshooting knowledge I've gained.  The people I've been working with have been great, especially management, and that has really helped me enjoy the job and gain the knowledge I have.  The hardest part of the job is resigning myself to working all day both weekend days.  The most enjoyable part of the job is building relationships with both co-workers and contractors."
good,"Financial powerhouse, unbeatable products, top service, incredibly educated employees. At times it can be frustrating as the countless departments and levels of management get in the way of performing basic functions more effectively."
good,"A 04 anos √† frente da loja da Sherwin Williams tenho aprendido dia a dia com os desafios, pelo fato de me reportar a uma pessoa que esta alocado em Recife, aprendi a conviver diariamente com Feedback atrav√©s de relat√≥rios. No meu cargo fa√ßo tudo, desde faturamento,parte fiscal, solicita√ß√£o de produtos, abertura, fechamento de loja,controle de funcion√°rios e Administra√ß√£o em geral.Um dos pontos que a empresa deixa a desejar √© um quadro de colaboradores muito enxuto por loja, em per√≠odos de muito movimento ficamos sobrecarregado,prejudicando as vezes a qualidade do trabalho(Atendimento); outro √© a faixa salarial para o cargo,abaixo do mercado.Como compensa√ß√£o temos √≥timos benef√≠cios e um ambiente super agrad√°vel."

good,"Good company to start with as an intern, you will learn alot of customer service goals. Unless you are outgoing, there is no room for store managers, because they have to lift 50-100 buckets of paint all day. Instead of having qualified store managers, that are older, they use your youth to lift the heavy loads. If you love sales, then you can move easily through the ranks, and get promoted just by knowing the right people, instead of store managers who are the real technical resource."
good,"UNIX Analyst was being responsible for issues on UNIX based servers & trouble shooting network issues. I was originally a contractor & within 3 months they hired me full time. I became responsible for servers coming in & out of computer room, ensuring that the proper power, networking, & space availability."
good,You normally work 50-60 hours a week. It can we stressful if you micro-manage or your employees don't care as much as you do. They have descent benefits and employee plans.
good,The nature of this business attributes to a high percentage of males in all areas of the profession.
good,"Typical day consists of tinting lots of paint, which in turn can be the hardest part at times. Lots of orders. Learned how to manipulate color."
good,"I went to work for Sherwin Williams with no former knowledge or paints, stains, or sundries. Throughout my time with Sherwin Williams I received great opportunities and raises. I learned the ins and outs of all the products that Sherwin Williams carries along with the product knowledge of their competitors. The hardest part of my job was realizing that I would never move past where I was without a formal education. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with DIY customers and contractors, and providing them with the knowledge and products they needed to complete their task at hand."
good,"a typical day at work , have an start up shift meeting , get your batch ticket and pull over your raw material and get started on your batch ,once batch is finish pump the batch over to your thindown tank and finish adding rest of the raw material ."
good,"I lot a very hard work and dedication to work at Sherwin. The job offers a lot in good solid information if house renovations,‚Äôpainting, salesmanship and An overall learning experience is your thing"
good,Good working environment. Customers vary. Solid company. Managers vary. Opportunities for job advancement but very competitive. Lots of heavy lifting.
good,A very fast paced work environment and very team oriented. An overall great place to work if you don't mind extreme noise and getting dirty. Great schedule.
good,"Managing all aspects of paint business, including managing staff and operational tasks. Multi-tasking through numerous tasks in a fast paced environment."
good,"Hay personas que no permiten crecer por miedo a pwrder puesto, metodologias que aplican poco para el mercado nacional"
good,"From what I've gathered, Sherwain Williams, as a painter's assistant, is an excellent job choice for those who are not afraid of getting their hands dirty and don't like working in a restaurant or office environment. The employees are very friendly and provide the best customer service and quality materials."
good,You can get overworked sometimes. Very few employees. Great management team that works well together...they just have built up a lot of vacation time that leaves you making up the hrs. The store is open everyday.
good,"The benefits are decent, especially for part time employees, the pay is okay, but job security is high and it's reliable work with some opportunities to advance or move around the nation of that's what you want to do."
good,Working at sherwin-williams was not incredibly difficult and anyone with a work ethic should be fine here. That being said you are going to be expected to lift things some people consider ‚Äúheavy‚Äù. As far as product knowledge goes you are expected to know more than your pay grade wich makes things a bit frustrating at times. The manager of my store was great and my experience probably would not have been so great if not for her.
good,"It was a good job, great training, overall just a normal retail job. They really want to promote their employees, but areas for growth are limited. Mostly only way to grow is to go into sales."
good,"Great start out sales job. Very competitive, and are well compensated for achieving sales goals. Depending on your customer base you can have a easy and full-filling occupation."
good,Fast-paced environment with high expectations.  Management was very supportive and it was great working with customers to help grow their business.  Often short-staffed though.
good,Buen ambiente.laboral y.buen compa√±erismo en zona operarios
good,Great Pay but No room for advancement. I loved the people I worked with. The hours were great and plenty of vacation time after a few years. Hard to move on to better positions if your not buddies with someone in Management.
good,"Sherwin-Williams provides training courses as you progress with the company.  Depending on your standing within your district and the district that you work for, training can be good or bad.  Promotional opportunities can vary, generally promoting based on metrics and not necessarily job fit."
good,Very well structured fortune 500 company. The managers are professional and treat you with respect. There's a lot more to this company than just paint. You can learn a lot and there's room to advance. I enjoyed working there and the people were friendly.
good,"Turned into Cluster. Too many stores, too many Reps, advancing people way to fast. Wrong candidates advance to upper management. Should've stayed focused on the Contractor & not the Homeowner."
good,"great place to work if you like a LOT of  overtime.a good management team that has your safety at top of the list. you clock in everyday on time ,put in a good days work,management will notice and that could lead to advancement."
good,"Good people. Met one of my best friends while working there. Good opportunity to advance if you're motivated. Not a high pressure sales job, but sales are important. Heavy lifting required."
good,"Good strong company, lots of opportunity. At times not sure what job duties were and sort of flying by the seat of your pants.  A lot of freedom and perks came with the job."
good,I enjoyed 80% of my time with this company and the benefits are amazing. My only regret is that I relocated to a district with terrible upper management and was eventually forced to leave by someone who I had just met that day despite being with the company in that area for nearly a year. Overall though the customers are great and the stores are competitive but in a fun way. I would always encourage people to start a career there.
good,"a dynamic environment with opportunity for advancement. I always was able to balance my work life with my at home life. learning about different paints, stains and apoxys also helped me with on site jobs as well."
good,"release loads to be shipped in staging lanes. release orders in order of pickup and delivery times. will go out and pick, replenish, or load and unload as need when production is high, or an area is short handed."
good,"I loved SW, region leadership was awesome, loved my job but all roads lead to Cleveland. If you want to get promoted you‚Äôll prob need to relocate to Cleveland."
good,There is a lot of manual labor involved in the job. They didn't really train me much so you have to ask a lot of questions. Also there is no breaks. Its a great job to get some work experience.
good,"The Winona Management was the best supportive team to be on!"
good,Strong company and have enjoyed my time there.  They typically work to help you advance and improve through training and development.  A leader in it's industry.
good,"Structured environment, very repetitive. My experience at Sherwin-Williams was pretty cool. My manager was laid back and very flexible with scheduling."
good,All goals must be hit in order to drive growth.  Can be rewarding once goals are hit.  Good team culture driven by strong management.  Always new products on the horizon.
good,The Company's principles center around safety and family. Production is more of course since that's why the company exists. You can retire for the company with a decent pension.
good,"I enjoyed working here and would clean, organize, unload pallets, tint paint and answer phones on a regular basis.  I learned how to tint paint.  Management was good...they taught me well and I learned everything well, I just did not feel completely suited for the job.  I enjoyed some of it, but it was stressful in some ways because I felt responsible for a lot of things at once, most likely because I felt I needed to. The hardest part was learning to multi-task in a very difficult situation, where I had to work in the back and the front at the same time.  I did well, but it was harder than some other jobs I've had where I just stayed in one place.  The most enjoyable part of the job was learning how to tint paint and taking orders, because I like talking to others on the phone about orders I can take for their benefit and liking."
good,Overall a good company. Sometimes the days can become very long and hard but for the most part majority of the days are pretty laxed. I would recommend this company for someone look for a job which allows you to basically run the business as you see fit without the business actually being yours.
good,Great place to work with a positive atmosphere. Very busy during some season and very slow during others. The management team is fair and understanding. The hardest part of my job id lifting the 5 gallons Pails and the occasioning splatter of paint. The best part of the job is the consistent hours.
good,"Sherwin Williams is a phenomenal company to work for.  I had many great experiences while employed with them, none so great as working full time and attending school to earn my Bachelor's degree."
good,"Painting houses every day is a hard days work, but at the end of the day its rewarding and fulfilling. The only problem I had working here was the long days, 11-13 hours, 7 days a week. It's a great place, with lots of fun people, and the job keeps you entertained instead of sitting around bored all day."
good,I worked at this job for four years and proven my skill and dedication. They got my hopes up for a fulltime then retracted last minutes. The policy was not followed at the surrounding areas making customer service difficult to deal with. Long and short of it more hours would have been great. My lack of hours was not on my manager but on the upper levels in the district.
good,S√≥lo recomendar√≠a este puesto si quiere trabajar aqu√≠ por una cierta cantidad de tiempo nom√°s.
good,"This company had all the opportunities for advancement however, moving up in the company was difficult unless you have a college degree. Even then, it's difficult to find a position."
good,"A typical day at work includes attending to customer needs, stocking out the truck and shelves, mixing paint, and doing deliveries. "
good,"Starting with the internship which wasn't aware of, with struggle but finally placed to a part time job after internship, and upon graduation a position was offered immediately."
good,Great management training program to build skills in managing retail location. Can be difficult to advance or transition to corporate from the retail setting. Some retail locations are slightly different with some having more advanced equipment and resources.
good,"I enjoyed the company but there wasn't that much room for improvement or advancement. It can get exhausting and the contractors can be rude, but some are nice."
good,"Great place for young adults to start out in the work field. Great practice with one on one customer readiness and support. Great practice with cash registers, math skills, inventory and stocking of."
good,"Left a few years ago was in maitance,we had a top notch manager but he was replaced. Things went down hill from their, I'm sure things have changed since then."
good,"Sherwin Williams does a great job at providing a structures training program. It is a very fast paced work environment and requires patience, perseverance, and hard work. There is a lot of room for potential earnings based on store performance but nothing is guaranteed. Advancement is very political and directly linked to efforts. This company will definitely teach you to stand out from your competition and to go above and beyond in order to achieve success."
good,"Lovely company with great benefits. If you can handle being in retail, the management side of your job won't be bad at all. There are plenty of opportunities to move up in the company but you will be working 50 hours a week for a good few years before you jump up higher. It's worth it if you want that type of a career."
good,"I have not been there is 7 years, so i dont remember much about benefits and such because I was part time back then going to school full-time. Management was great, everyone got along. I had to leave for personal reasons other wise i would still probably be there."
good,"Good people great history. Provided many tools to help conduct business. Leadship was good.  Corporate culture awarded those willing to relocate.  If your not working near HQ, ad advancement opportunities are few and far between."
good,Sherwin-Williams is a great company to work for with excellent benefits.  Typically work long hours as store manager (50-60 hours/wk) can make work-life balance difficult.  Great career advancement opportunities and chance to move anywhere in the country with over 4000 stores.
good,I enjoyed my time with the company. My managers were effective at communicating their needs and expectations whole remaining friendly and relaxed. Would recommend.
good,"Great company with tremendous opportunities for career advancement.  Desire to be closer to ""home"" was the only reason I left.  I'd love to go back.  Great benefits."
good,"Very fast paced.  "
good,"As a driver: It's a fine job, not too difficult once you get used to lifting the paint buckets, but you have to deal with so many managerial shortcomings and during the summer time you have to expect to almost always go over your scheduled hours because such and such delivery ""has to go today""."
good,"I love working for Sherwin Williams it just with me getting an apartments, having all my bills I have to pay, and taking car of my new puppy. I just cant stay with the company because all I get is a max of 28 hours a week while getting paid 10.50 an hour I just cant afford it. I love  the work environment and staff. The hardest part of the job is just getting to know the products because we get so many new products every year and have so many already, so that is one of the harder parts of the job."
good,"they are a good company to work for a lot of lifting climbing up ladders, Keeping up with customer orders and job requests, colors,"
good,"Typical retail job, company stingy with staffing hours, a do more with less mentality. Compensation is great, very poor work/life balance in the store"
good,Es una buena empresa pero las pol√≠ticas personales de las jerarqu√≠as medias y altas  interrumpen el crecimiento de la organizaci√≥n
good,"Was a good part time job but for students, its hard to get promoted if you do not have a degree. For part time employees you are only given so many hours at the end of the year when the stores have hit their allowed hours they cut you down to less hours maybe only 15 a week."
good,"Only need to say this, if you can make it in SW you can make it anywhere. The crews working in each store is usually a good mix of all cultures. The ticket for advancement is within you ."
good,It is a good company to work for but the physical workload and customer base is quite unpleasant. The amount of hours managers are required to work is overwhelming.
good,"Tns of potential for advancement within the company, sales driven quarterly bonus opportunity, no glass ceiling but long days and dirty finger nails covered in paint and stain, make more calls!"
good,"I was promoted to a full time position at a different store, and the manager was much worse. Would not have accepted the job had I known the style this manager would employ."
good,"I was initially hired as  a design consultant and delivery driver for paint and other store products I delivered product to other stores that were low in inventory for which we had excess product in our store.I also delivered product to commercial painting contractors at job sites.  I eventually also was trained in mixing paint colors.   I worked at Sherwin Williams for two consecutive years leaving in December of each calendar year and returning in the spring of each year.  I eventually gave my notice as the delivery of multiple five galons of paint to job sites was causing me physical issues (previously had had rotator cuff surgery and the lifting of heavy buckets of product on to the truck was becoming too strenuoud.."
good,"In store paint sales to retail customers and professional painting contractors. Paint business is a ""time is money"" business. The ability to problem solve is a huge plus, as well as attention to detail."
good,"Enjoyed position as Pilot chemist. Like to travel to the plant sites for trials. Benefits are average as was the middle management. Liked working with the team in the lab. Also, liked the interaction with the plant team members for their insights on the product."
good,I would definitely recommend working here. The atmosphere is great and it is family oriented. I worked here for a 2 years and enjoyed everyone i had the pleasure of working with
good,Financially solid company.  Good job but be prepared for a lot working hours.  Typical week for me was about 65 hours.  Most staffing is part time work with a very low number of employees working to support the operation of a typical location.  Good bonus program.  Good medical/dental program.  Great 401k/stock investment program. Be prepared to relocate if looking for advancement within the company.
good,"provided vacation time and holiday hours, was very flexible with my schedule while I was going to school. fast paced and the days go by fairly quickly if you work at a busy location"
good,"Good place to work, they have great benefits. You learn a lot about sales, retail, and management. There is a lot of physical requirements that make the job a little difficult."
good,"Turnover is terrible but the benefits and fellow employees are amazing. Corporate office doesn't work well with other locations, needs better training for supervisors and those in management roles."
good,Boring Tedious work important to have patience and attention to detail. Must also be able to lift heavy payloads. Good pay and some opportunity for advancement.
good,"It was part time in college, so I dont have a good feel for a career but my time there was satisfactory and I dont regret working there. I would recommend them to my friends and family."
good,Was a great place to work before the ACA was implemented then hours went from 40 plus to 28.  They provide you with all of the training that you need to succeed.
good,"Sherwin Williams has a wonderful learning program to teach you about their products. Unfortunately they do not have the same level of training to work in the store. Learning the proprietary tinting and point-of-sale systems that seem like they are old DOS systems does take a lot of time. Management is relaxed and doesn't panic when you make a mistake, they understand that it can be a little crazy. The hardest part of the job is fielding questions on what products to use on the various projects people have. The best part is the people, both other staff members (this includes managers) and regular customers (many are painting contractors)."
good,"Sherwin Williams is an ever-ready company that is not shy about jumping into the twenty-first century and being a leader in its industry. It cares about its employees by way of flexible schedules, honest pay and benefits, and an active human resources department.  It's culture is primarily sales and marketing-related, but even that is in of itself flexible to those interested in other fields.  It is an honest learning experience for all."
good,"I've been with the company now for nearly 25 years."
good,SW has some really good pay. They take care of their employees and the work is fairly easy. SW will teach you everything you need to know. The painting industry is pretty competitive so this job gives you a feel for sales and management. The sky is the limit in this company and they will support your moves.
good,"A professional grroup to work with. Good benefits. Getting a project completed takes a lot of cooperation from other groups, and that was fairly easy to accomplish with the groups I worked with at Sherwin-Williams."
good,Great place to work with room for growth within the company.  Friendly customers who appreciate our help with their day to day needs.  Management and coworkers are helpful and knowledgeable.
good,"Like every retail environment you may land with young employees who shouldn't be managing. The company over works the managers and it causes them to leave the stores unstaffed and not complete tasks while at work. However, there is a great amount of training, lots of opportunity to promote and move. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers decide what they need to work on their project. The hardest part is the inconsistent work schedule and lack of district discipline. Very numbers driven so they push you out before helping you meet your goals.."
good,"Empresa s√©ria que respeita seus funcion√°rios, muito organizada e com um bom reconhecimento no mercado."
good,"A very typical huge US based manufacturing employer. "
good,"Sherwin Williams is a great company for management and positions above. As I worked for the company I realized I wanted to pursue other revenues outside of retail. If you're okay working long days and most weekends you'll enjoy Sherwin. There are many challenges and new things to learn which is enjoyable, but stressful as well. The company pays well for management and above. Additionally, they provide decent benefits with a stock fund that has the potential to grow exponentially. I would recommend this company to anyone who wants to be in management."
good,"I found it fun, mostly because of the people and the environment. But I wouldn't make it a full-time job. There was plenty of room for advancement and for a temporary job it pays well, but I just wasn't interested in working for a paint company."
good,"managed my own work day, I was a color matcher and that's what I enjoyed, managers where easy going and employees were good to work with. multitasking is a plus in my job."
good,Its not a bad place to work you get yearly raises and some benefits plus a nice discount. But you have to have a bachelor's degree in order to advance and full time positions are hard to come by.
good,"a lot of the job is focused on mixing paint orders, culture is typical corporate culture, very old school, it is great if you decide to stick with the company for a long term, Sherwin Williams does reward loyalty."
good,"Ok place to work, good management at the local level. Greater autonomy Upper management is terrible and there is too many of them. Sales and marketing people don't know anything about the product"
good,It is a great college student job as this carried me through college. They are very flexible with work hours as long as you too are flexible with working. Learn lots about paint and get a pretty good discount.
good,There's not another job that is easy and interesting with great pay but if you have a family hours may not be the greatest if you're seeking full time.
good,"you get to drive everywhere, contractors are mostly cool, little no girls though(that sucks) occasionally run into know it all's that have no clue, some slow days, some fast days, depends on your store"
good,I worked in the commercial store of Sherwin-Williams. The daily variety of work was great. Everything was something new. I also learned a great deal from my managers who taught me many things in my short time there.
good,good job worked there on and off at a couple different locations.  i wish i could have done more with the company. good management. good people could have paid better
good,big buff company with corporate culture.  work harder and longer with less people and resources to get the job done.  Working to make someone else rich.  be a worker bee and go after it.
good,"emprsea agrad√°vel de se trabalhar, pr√≥ximo a minha casa, com pessoas alegres e profissionais"
good,Great Start. Really enjoyed the people I worked with. Upper level management is kind of slow on executing certain plans and things that really need to be handled.
good,"I would wake up every morning at 7 am to be there to open the store at 9, I would start with early morning delivery then i would finish by noon. I would mix paint and organize the store wile my co workers helped the costumers. closed the store around 5 pm."
good,Great company. Great people. Great sales . One of the oldest companies in the United States. Over 150 years old. All over the country & in 130 countries.
good,"Excellent company to work for that is located in the heart of downtown Cleveland, Ohio that provides ample opportunities for growth & training to employees that seek them."
good,"It all depends on what store you get. If people have a good work environment and good ethics, its great. If not, not so fun. Overall good place to work."
good,Good pay the training is very good. Loud and dirty but if you don't mind good place to work.The company gives you uniforms with a cleaning serves so not to get your own clothes full of paint.
good,"Es una empresa en constante crecimiento, siempre a la vanguardia y con muchas oportunidades."
good,If you are 100% driven and guided by wanting to be promoted then this may not be your best option. You can rise fast on the first couple levels but after that the politics of who you know will dampen your fire!
good,"Great Company to work for! Competitive Salary and compensation package, Great work environment, Manageable territories, and Great Team Environment."
good,"If your self efficient, and work independently and as a team then this is a perfect job for you. Everyday is different and depending on what store you work at management is always there for you. The hardest part of the job is dealing with upset customers"
good,It can sometimes be a very fast paced environment with a lot of challenges after you are first hired. The mamagement is normally very good(at least in my experience) and they will work with you most of the time when you need a day of or something of the sort. The only problem i have encountered is that if you want to move up from part time at all you pretty much have to have some kind of degree or you will never get to the assisstant manager position.
good,"Responsibilities included unloading of trucks, restocking of retail products and working with customers to ensure a smooth sales process with transactions. Ability to lift 25 to 50 pounds was preferred."
good,"I love my job and my work crew we have a lot of fun! A typical summer day is fast-paced always slammed. You rarely have a minute to use the restroom or grab a drink of water. This view point is working at a commercial location, not at a residential location. You have to learn how to take orders, work the out-dated computer system, tint and match paint colors, place calls, proper customer service care, unloading a truck with 16+ pallets four days a week, and establish rapport with the customer base. I do enjoy working there and it does pay okay. We are all normally in a good mood for the day, the fast paced work environment makes for a quick day. I have never woken up with the attitude of dreading going into work, so that's a plus. I have been there for over a year. The only downside to the company is they only let you work a maximum of 28 hours a week in the winter time, which this winter we have still been slammed because of all the nice weather. In the summer time we are allowed to work a little more. I think they should allow more Full time employees at a store, and so do the people I work with. I do not see that happening. There is advancement opportunities with Sherwin if you have a degree....it doesn't matter what your degree is in if you have it, chances are you'll be hired. They also hire a lot of college students as part-time. Overall I do like working for them, your work crew is family."
good,Mi trabajo consist√≠a en abrir mercado en el sector de constructoras y cuentas corporativas. La empresa en Colombia tiene una sucursal muy peque√±a.
good,"I loved the people working for this company! I ended up having should surgery and wasn't able to see myself do this position long term. "
good,"Working at sherwin williams is what I imagine working at most retail stores would be like. It did seem to have a bit more of a laid back environment. Management was very helpful in working around my school schedule and with any problems I might have had. The hardest part of the job was having to stop helping a customer to answer the phone, especially when it got busy. Once the rushes calmed down though, there was normally enough time to catch up on everything else I had to do and take care of other duties throughout the store and warehouse."
good,"On the day when we have a truck is when we are at our busiest times. I unload trucks and stocking the products away. Also at the same time help in the sales floor with the customer. I learned all how how to do inventory, managing the work place, working with the customers and what he/she needs. It is a very physical job which I think it is the hardest part of it. But I do enjoy a physical demanding job."
good,"Great place to learn about running your own business and how to deal with retail customers. Very demanding and long hours per week. Overall, a good company to work for so long as you are willing to work hard and go the extra mile to be successful."
good,"Retail environment, they will train and teach you how to successfully run a million dollar business. It is hard to find good people so if you are smart, and can work hard you will be promoted fast."
good,"Like I said in the last review overall its a ok job, good if you are a part- timer trying to make thorough school, but not for a career."
good,Sherwin offers a competitive salary with excellent benefits.  A great opportunity for a person entering the supervisory field.  Long shift hours on off-shift hours can be difficult to balance family life.
good,Assistant managers work 44 hours a week answering the same questions everyday and dealing with disgruntled customers most of the time. Job is like a glorified cashier.
good,Fast-paced environment where you have a lot of room to decide how you will run your store (as long as it is within company standards). Great tools and resources to go out and get business with.
good,"There is a lot of heavy lifting and working with contractors can be difficult sometimes. Most of the work is done by the afternoon as paint contractors need their supplies by then. Work was not divided evenly, as some people would just sit around."
good,"Working for Sherwin-Williams helped open my eyes to importance of paint. Its much more complex than what people may think. In addition to learning about the products, the sales aspect is also crucial and good skill to learn."
good,Warehouse and paint store with retail and wholesale customers. Daily deliveries and ship outs. Matching and mixing paint for customers. Management and employees worked well together as a team. The hardest part of this job was working in a warehouse that was not climate controlled.
good,"Uma empresa excelente, me acolheu abriu as portas para o mercado de trabalho, me propiciou um norte em minha carreira profissional."
good,"Overall Sherwin Williams is a great company to work for with many possibilities to grow within the company. You learn about color and color corrections, which is helpful not only here at Sherwin Williams, but also as a graphic designer. A typical day at Sherwin is usually face to face interactions with both contractors and homeowners."
good,"I worked at a very busy store. We were constantly on the move, making orders, doing color matches and/or stain matches. Phones constantly ringing off the hook. Was an exciting place to work. Sometimes had to deal with difficult customers. There is alot to learn and takes a while to catch on. Computer system is not the easiest to work with. Other than that it is a good place to work."
good,"¬ß	Responsible for the management and growth development of employees."
good,"Great Job for those fresh out of college. Company takes care of you and pays decent. Fast advancement, the work can be hard and stressful just like any other job. A real get down and dirty kind of job. I like it but I want something more corporate so I wont be here too long."
good,"Ensuring the satisfaction of both wholesale and do-it-yourself customers and building positive long-term relationships with them"
good,"Mostly sales oriented with strong customer service and promoting sales of new products. I would open the store at 7:30 am preparing the office for the work day and organizing delivery schedules, inventory adjustments and ordering of new merchandise. We would work until the last customer left the office and that could be well after 5 pm which is our closing hour. I enjoyed engaging in sales with customers and especially bringing in new customers providing excellent customer service and top of line products for their business or personal use. I learned how to efficiently manage time constraints, multi-task efficiently, manage personnel, negotiation skills and product knowledge. My co-workers were very knowledgeable on product knowledge and customers service. Hardest part was probably dealing with understaffing which became a time constraint I would later efficiently learn to manage and overcome. Most enjoyable was the face to face interaction with customers and especially seeing them return because of our outstanding customer service and products."
good,Sherwin Williams is a great company to work for if you don't mind hard labor. The company has a lot of great benefits. Summer time it is very busy and long hours are needed.
good,"should offer benefits to part-time employees."
good,"Answer phones"
good,"Great company to work for! Longevity for sure! You definitely earn your pay but company invests in you! You get to travel for trainings and network with other managers from across the country! Most often, promotion is definitely within!"
good,Empresa que me forneceu todas as oportunidades poss√≠veis para o meu crescimento profissional.
good,"It's a fast productive job,but your learning how to work as a team with other co-workers. Management is ok but are always willing to help find a solution. The hardest part about the job is that during the summer months it can get hot within the building due to high temperatures."
good,"A empresa possui uma cobran√ßa saud√°vel sobre os funcion√°rios. As pessoas s√£o bem receptivas e dispostas a ajudar. "
good,"Great company to work for, customer service oriented with fantastic products for DIY or for contractors. Hours are good and the pay is acceptable for a secondary income."
good,"Work life balance is difficult. We are required to see 8-12 customers face to face each day,make 20 additional sales calls each day, coach and assist all 98 store locations, drive 70% of all business, develop and implement an effective business plan, achieve budgeted sales and profit goals (increase 15% over previous year ), log each face to face and sales call into system with required qualification data, continue to capture additional market-share in one of the most competitive coating environments in the world."
good,This was a good job just not enough pay to take care of a family.
good,"Great company to work for with few overall issues. The company has a great history of working with employees to ensure all needs are met for job completion and rewards those who work hard with advancement opportunities."
good,"There is a lot of opportunity of advancement with this company. Unfortunately the position i wanted was not available when I graduated college, so i ended up taking another opportunity. "
good,"Good experience in managing a business and sales. A typical day involves many things like: mixing paint, growing business by making sales calls, human resources, customer interaction, inventory management, retail and commercial transactions etc... Hardest part of the job is to maintain work/life balance with working 55-65 hours per week with many days of not getting to eat lunch. The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers."
good,"Un empresa con cultura norteamericana, donde se enfatiza el trabajo eficiente y no la p√©rdida de tiempo. Se crean espacios donde aportar y la comunicaci√≥n es abierta y directa. Lo dif√≠cil del trabajo es seguir el ritmo que a veces demanda tiempo personal (d√≠as feriados, fines de semana). Lo que m√°s me gust√≥ fue poder hablar en ingl√©s. Lo que menos me gust√≥ fue que se mantiene el estilo de trabajo de empresa peque√±a en algunas √°reas. Empresa de puertas abiertas a todo nivel. Colegas comprometidos y jefaturas disponibles a escuchar."
good,"A Sherwin Williams como a antiga Sumar√© Industria Qu√≠mica foi e atualmente √© uma grande empresa. A minha experi√™ncia profissional se deve praticamente toda a estas duas empresas. "
good,Great company to work for and the training was top notch. I loved traveling and teaching stores about the products. I was also able to teach paint techniques and merchandise. I worked independently unless it we had a trade show or a work shop. I met with my boss once a month but was able to touch base by telephone daily.
good,"Bom lugar para se trabalhar, apesar da equipe, na √©poca em que trabalhei, n√£o ser muito unida."
good,"The typical day at work starts out with a meeting to delicate assignments to co-workers, inform crew on the status of the business, and talk about safety related topics that pertain to the business. I have learned that meaning of teamwork and safety starts with me. These two words have become my culture not only at the job but at home as well. My co-workers are all on the same page. We look out for each other and encourage each other to perform with excellence."
good,"Great company with family values. Good training seminar. A lot of information to ingest. Pay was fair, but payment system was good."
good,Its a good place to work management is really nice and is very knowledgeable of the products. Co workers are fun to be around. My day at work consist of my driving and interacting with all different types of people which is fun. The hardest part of my job would be the long days when its just driving all day with out a break but every day is different some days  are really busier then other days.
good,A typical day at work includes making sure that all loads are shipped out at the proper time. Also creating bills for each load. Dealing with truck drivers to coordinate loads.
good,"work hand in hand with the public."
good,"Ilearned alot about management, forklift safety,loading and unloading trucks"
good,"There are a list of duties that need to be done by the end of the day while still expected to give the best to the customers that walked in. Most of the time, I was by myself. I enjoyed everything about my job but the hours were starting to effect my school. When managing my time correctly nothing on the list was too difficult to complete. My co-workers were good people who were understanding and friendly."
good,"Each day was typically the same - paperwork from previous days, making sure scheduling was on par with the demands of business, finding new leads, and of course following up on existing leads. Since I was typically working with teammates, either directly or indirectly involved with a sale, methodology was always changing, mainly based on the needs of the particular customer. Having a person or two to bounce ideas off of always helped in securing a sale. This diversity of thought was always one of my greatest teachers on-the-job."
good,"Company genuinely cares about well-being of employees, layoffs are almost non-existent. Pay is above average for work performed, but there is not much room for advancement. Company hosts events and parties for employees and supplies a lot of discounts and non-cash incentives. Company is very supportive of women's success. Promotions are more who you know than what you know."
good,"Good Place to work with good benefits, The company just does not pay you enough for what is expected and no overtime."
good,Management was very easing going type of organization in which i learned a great deal about the difference in quality of paint that i did not realize existed.My co-workers were very friendly and helpful and the most enjoable part of the job was getting to know the contracters and visiting the job site to deliver paint and see the different types of places bieng built.
good,multinacional excelente para se trabalhar mais com um plano de carreira escacio mais aprendi muitas coisas com essa organiza√ß√£o.GRATO
good,"I was a manager for their Westmont, IL location. As a company, they do a great job of turning fresh college grads into a managerial position. They have a great training program and are very patient."
good,"Manage employees, customer service, multi phone lines, inventory, data entry, audits, business plans, accounts payables, accounts receivables, etc."
good,"A typical day at work is from 7am to 5pm. Everyday is different. I do a wide array of tasks from keeping the store clean to outside sales calls. I will mix paint for customers, make product recommendations, build a relationship with them and their employees, and try to get business from competitors. I am also responsible for store employees: hiring, supervising, training etc. I also deal with inventory management daily: ordering, receiving, inventory levels, shrink etc. My management is tough yet supportive. I really enjoy the majority of my co-workers. We get along well. The hardest part of my job is the hours. I'm expected to work a minimum of 48 hours per week, but that usually ends up being around 60 hours. The work/life balance is not there. The most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers."
good,"i was hired at SW to be the Decorative Product Specialist, and quickly found that SW seemed to be unintentionally phasing out the position. (No training, very few hours to work on required tasks each day, literally no access to computer systems due to part-time status.) A shame because my coworkers were amazing and the store was GREAT!"
good,I love working at Sherwin Williams. I have made a lot of professional friends who were always willing to help and give great advice. The managers are very friendly and helpful. They also worked around my school schedule a lot!
good,People were fun and respectful. Only issue was dispatch was based out of Ohio and has no idea what LA traffic is like. Other than that it was a nice place to work.
good,You will have to work under pressure depending on the size of city and type of store you're in. The small DIY stores are chill but can get busy quick as painting never stops especially for contractors. The bigger commercial stores you will have to deal with orders up to or more than 500 gallons which one pallet holds 16-5 gallon buckets. But rally good benefits and 401k
good,I enjoyed my time   Ran into a few VPs that caused problems but all in all a great place for a career    They have multiple sites and multiple disciplines so can really do just about anything
good,Attention to detail is huge. you are dealing with anyone from a DIY to a contractor who knows exactly what he wants and knows what amount he needs and when he needs it.
good,"work was hard, fast, and sometimes very tedious. It involved lots of manual labor, lifting, and doing the same things over and over. It did provide a lot of autonomy and you manage your own time."
good,Needed better trained management. need more training for employees as well. weekly meetings to ensure we are doing our best for the customers and the company
good,"Sherwin Williams is a good company to work for. The work/life balance is decent, better than most corporate retail companies, and the pay is good. District management is fair but inclined toward micro-management. There is a physical component since management is heavily involved in receiving, stocking, tinting, shaking and delivering the  paint. I enjoyed it, it kept me in decent shape and made the job interesting. It is a fast-paced setting in most stores."
good,"Well run, fiscally responsible company.  The demand for excellence comes from every group within the organization and the top down management approach is the way the company is managed on the manufacturing side."
good,"Sherwin-Williams is a great company to work for. They've provided me with ample opportunity to advance and progress, as well as learn each day. If you're looking for an employer with opportunities in a fast paced, retail environment, give Sherwin a shot."
good,"deliver paint to jobs site either new homes, offices or repaint property, and apartment buildings. You meet different painters for many paint companies. The management are most helpful when you have a problem. The hardest part of the job is the traffic at some job sites."
good,Start off as hard but gets easier as you learn more of the business. Plus easy to get promoted if you put hard work out their. Make sure you have a good manager that‚Äôs welling to help you.
good,Nice company to work for pay rate should of been a lil bit higher long hours of work in summer time but at the end of the year the work load slow down
good,"Good group of coworkers kept the work enjoyable and the day going by fast. Was a good part time job during college, but I'd preferably not be in retail in the near future."
good,I worked for them for 4 years at their product finished facility in Seattle.  The company delivered good benefits and management was understanding and helpful.  However it was rather consistently underfunded and understaffed which could make work difficult and stressful at times.
good,"At the location i was stationed at, we as a team worked great together. It was fun and a great experience. "
good,"The store managers are supportive of growth and share when there are opportunities for development and advancement.  Some turn over, but in retail who doesnt.  They try to keep it more of a team mentality instead of a boss ""Do This"". Wishing that the company offered more full time positions for sales associates.  Fair hours though, not 5 one week and 30 the next."
good,"Possibility of career advancement only if you're willing to ""network"" knowing the right people and sucking up to them helps you climb the ladder a lot faster."
good,"A typical day at work would include running several small sample batches of paint, or forming strips of paint and logging data online. Typically there are meetings to discuss how research is going, what the data means and how to proceed. The people are very enjoyable, at least at EPS."
good,La chose la plus agr√©able de mon emploi est de ressoude des probl√®me pour les client. Servir la client√®le est mon point fort.
good,"A regular day included testing paint samples as required, computing raw material adds for paint to be approved and putting all information in the computer. The difficult part was understaffing and poor inventory that created a long delay for continued productivity."
good,"Weekends working alone were long, but the week was usually well staffed. Helpful managers and assistant managers. Managers at other stores were also there to help if needed"
good,"If you need some extra money and want to learn more about paint and coatings, it's great.  If you don't work well with overbearing corporate policy, ridiculous operating procedure, and endless micro-management you may want to look elsewhere."
good,"This place was a ball to work at, mixing paint, talking to the contractors promoting new products, demonstration days make everything entertaining. In store management was always very helpful and resourceful when learning new things about the industry."
good,It is hard work but they provide the trsining you need to succeed and progress within the comapny! They are a company that develop people skills and build relationships with customers and co workers.
good,Overall very good place to work. Had a good time working and growing with this company. I would recommend anyone to work there that wants to know the industry.
good,A typically day includes consistent face to face and over the phone communication with customers and sales representatives taking and then processing orders. The culture and staff depends on the store that you are working at as they can vary greatly. There are some physical requirments for the job and the hardest part is probably the retail schdulde as it can include nights and weekends. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know your customers and helping grow their business.
good,Management program is a great way to learn about the company and gain experience. They are always looking to bring people on board. Working hard allows for the opportunity to grow within the company.
good,Excellent place to work in general. Fast paced and over all fun. I recommend working there. Disagreements with management is the reason for my leaving the company.
good,"My opinion of the typical day working at Sherwin Williams is good.This job i would wake up and actually want to go to work. I learnt something new pretty much every day maybe from learning how to get a better colour match or how the fork lift works. Sherwin Williams wasnt an easy job id say colour matches definitely takes a special eye and endless knowledge about the different products. I did like working with the colour and paints, helping people design their home. My coworkers were cool so that made work a bit easier to come to also(:"
good,"Part & Full Time Available great working around school schedule. benefits include 401k laid back environment, management was nice. Pay could've been better"
good,"For a part time job, it pays decently.  There was a plethora of information to absorb but the training was on par most of the time if you asked questions and were willing to learn and study.  My store manager was an excellent teacher and leader.  I wasn't a fan of the MTP for college kids who could just waltz into the company and slide into the assistant manager position, and in the 2 years I worked there it was nearly impossible to get promoted to full time, though it was promised to me a few times and was also one of the reasons I stuck it out so long.  Like most retail jobs the customers could either be pleasant or an absolute pain to deal with.  Paint/stain/tool education and information is very valuable and you learn a lot about that stuff working for this company.  Overall, despite my subjective gripes, I don't regret having worked here."
good,Good Place to start career. Long hours and Good Pay Build Character. Advancement is contigent on ability to relocate. Job is very stress free at most locations
good,"Nothing negative to say about this company. Good culture, management is capable. They treat most employees fairly. Decent work life balance. Good opportunity for advancement with the right skillset."
good,"Great company to work for.  Management is patient and very helpful."
good,Not enough home time for me. But the pay and benefits can't be beat! Northeast region delivery driver from Virginia to Maine. Store parking lots are very tight and will challenge even the best of drivers.
good,"My manager was amazing. He took care of all the employees. At other stores within the company, the turnover of employees was very high due to burning out with the company. My manager made sure we we working reasonable schedules and not being overworked. He made sure that if we needed to take some time off, we could. Often the customers were rude and would yell at us. Each time, he had our backs and would defend us. The manager at my store was exceptional. Overall, the company needs to work harder to keep current employees. My biggest gripe with the company is that when I started, I was payed competitively and then I was promoted to a keyholder. This got me a raise, but now having worked for the company for several years, new part time hires are being paid more than I am even though I have additional responsibilities and I am the one training them."
good,I would work Monday through Friday starting from 8am - 2pm. they are able and willing to work around your school schedule and life. job is great if your a college student
good,Good place to work and would recommend to anyone. I have been given the opportunity to try multiple roles and was provided the adequate training to perform well. Management style and talent recognition could improve.
good,"Great work environment! Definitely ask many questions during training and throughout your career. Asking questions (manager, upper management, HR, etc) and being sure of what you're doing is key in your success with the company! Never assume!"
good,"Overall a decent job if your'e looking for a steady paycheck. The benefits offered to part timers are very fair, but the pay for part and full time is unfair. The amount of knowledge and research needed to perform this job is vast compared to a retail worker at Target who makes the same amount if not more per hour."
good,"im very open to new experience"
good,"The experience you have with the company depends greatly on your location. I was lucky I worked in two locations where I got along with everyone. I entered the company while in school and I discovered the MT program a management training program that takes recent graduates and turns them into managers."
good,"Loved the fast paced work environment, but I wasn't fond of being overlooked without the chance to apply for higher employment opportunities. The customers are wonderful, most are understanding. Learning about the formulas took a while, but management really understood and taught proper techniques."
good,"Good management and employees, fun atmosphere, good experience, room for advancement if you stay, overall was a good experience and gave me skills and knowledge to bring further in the workplace."
good,"A typical work day-orders come in. Then have to be made up if going out then have to set up as a delivery/ load up onto truck, go to addressed location, contact customer and see where the delivery needs to be dropped of at location. Makes sure product is in good condition and that customer is happy with everything.Great company to work for. Lots of oppourtunity for promotion. Must be willing to relocate for upper management positions. Historically been a male dominated field but the company is making it a priority to hire and promote more females. Opportunity for significant bonuses along with competetive base salaries."
good,It is a fast paced environment and one is able to learn a lot in the paint industry.  What I have learned while working in the paint industry is the ability to recommend the right type of paint.
good,"Need to be fully invested in your job knowing customers orders, various paints, and functions and hard labor all for just above minimum wage. Workplace culture is very similar to working in a warehouse culture but needs to be on point with customer service."
good,"I had a fun experience working here. I definitely learned some valuable management techniques. The most difficult part is dealing with resentful staff that may have way more experience and time with the company than you do; having a college degree gets you right into assistant manager position. Also no breaks/lunch breaks is tough sometimes. Once you become a manager you may end up working 7 days a week, open to close, and not get paid overtime because you are salaried. Of course if you can find a good staff that is very unlikely to occur, but there's always that chance. I really enjoyed the customers, joking around with them and having friendly relationships. Good pay, good bonuses. All in all I liked it, just dealing with other staff made job very difficult at times."
good,A typical day @ work was pretty simplistic. Its paint not bio physics. The culture has been devalued chasing the stock price. Most enjoyable part of the job was training someone else and watching them flourish throughout the company.
good,Pessoal muito agrad√°vel e atencioso. Desde que iniciei minha carreira na empresa considerei como a parte mais agrad√°vel do trabalho a troca de informa√ß√µes com meus colegas.
good,It is a good company with good benefits and job security. But poor career opportunities and caring for the little man in the company that works hard..
good,"sherwin williams was indeed a positive enovironment, the customers and employers make u wanna get up each day and present your self to work without a doubt."
good,"As a production operator, you will be in charge of dealing with different responsibilities that your supervisor will assign for you on a daily basis such as: line operator, batch maker, batch mixer or others."
good,"As with any other job you will have many assigned tasks at once, but with a work environment like this you will never feel over worked and stressed. Everyone is friendly and willing to help you in anyway if you need it."
good,The 401K performance was unmatched by anyone that I have worked for. The compensation was not the best but the benefits were great from healthcare to retirement.
good,"Although I was only there on a short term contract, the people we're keen to help and very friendly. I even stay in touch with a couple of them now. The office was busy yet casual, and we worked hard but balanced it with a fun atmosphere."
good,Good place to work long term. I planned on staying with the company and becoming a rep but I‚Äôve recently had a change of plans and would like to expand my opportunities.
good,not a bad place to work.  don't expect it to be a career unless you're willing to be in management.  Manager is a good guy and you get to talk to a lot of interesting people.
good,"Was a great 5 years, but it was time to go. Have some really great friends and managers there.  Take advantage of all the opportunities given to you. It is worth it."
good,Many opportunities for advancement depending on your willingness to relocate. Great benefits and management is excellent. Not a very good work life balance when it comes to maintaining both due to heavy long hour shifts.
good,Busy but not overwhelming.  I learned about paint and other home improvement aspects.  Management was qualified and helpful.  The most difficult aspect was probably when large contractors would have massive orders to fill.  The job overall was enjoyable
good,"buen hambiente de trabajo, solo le falta mejorar la administracion, ya que se hacen buenas ventas pero no tenemos los recursos a tiempo forma."
good,The job was fine. I did not make enough money to cover bills so I moved on. They do not advance those without a degree where I was so I was stuck as a third manager at $12 an hour. I was good at my job and worked the hours I was supposed to and helped the customers appropriately. Just cannot afford child care and every day expenses with so little pay.
good,"Hard to retain employees, low pay, would prefer better uniforms, hard dealing with contractors, takes FOREVER to get promoted and you have to kiss tail to do it"
good,"Hours are fine, managment is good, routes are good could have a little on slow days But manageable. Paid Holidays off, vacation hours could be tricky, personal days."
good,Worked there for 5 years. I learned a lot about the industry. What I did not like was the people I worked with. Manager was lazy and expected one person to do everything. Not all stores are like that.
good,"Great experience. Lots of time must be invested in order to be successful. If you‚Äôre looking for a place to grow your own skills and take pride in seeing your efforts pay off, sherwin Williams is a good fit for you."
good,"Working at Sherwin-Williams is not a bad job. The only hard part of the job is putting up stock. Depending on the store, a person could lift a lot of 5 gallon buckets per day. An employee could learn a lot about paint and how to apply it."
good,"Love this job. Part time is really flexible but full time is a little difficult to acquire. Locations are every where in the U.S.A."
good,"The hours were decent, management was extremely helpful and open to questions and concerns. My coworkers were both friendly and knowledgeable. Mornings were busy, afternoons and weekends were quiet."
good,Great company to work for with great benefits. Learned a lot about the company and the products. Learned how to run a business and handle customer related issues.
good,Good company and takes care of employees. Advancement gets tough after 5 years. Often have to move a lot in order to move up fast. Benefits very good as well as retirement plan.
good,"Working here and how it is really depends on your responsibility level. As a part time associate the job is fine, physically it's tough at first and you have a lot to learn very quickly. But if you decide to progress, because of sales goals and demands, the stress level grows exponentially."
good,"Love working here and if I could get enough hours for a bigger paycheck, I would stay. It looked promising for quite sometime but unfortunately the hours decreased."
good,la selecci√≥n del personal ayuda a mantener un ambiente de trabajo amigable
good,"la selecci√≥n del personal es buena, ya que las relaciones laborales y ambiente de trabajo es muy amigable"
good,Ind√∫stria com amplo portif√≥lio e solu√ß√µes pr√°ticas para o nosso dia a dia. Excel√™ncia em tintas no mundo.
good,"Great pay- lousy work life balance. Pay made up for most people staying there long term. Most managers care, others show up when need be. Retail really gets old after a while. -"
good,$13 per hour is great as a college student. The job involves lifting 5 gallon buckets all day and processing orders on an outdated system resembling windows DOS. That being said the company culture is great. You receive a significant amount of autonomy at work and it is very difficult to be fired.
good,Great team of people! Management is knowledgeable and experienced. Team is willing to help you learn things you may no know how to do. Customers are great!
good,"You learn how to run a million dollar business and deal with all types of people. Long hours, short staffed, management always backs the customer. I recommend their management training program to friends that I think can handle it."
good,Work was the same everyday. Nothing exciting. Work was easy but stressful due to having to deal with traffic everyday in Houston. It's nothing to loath over.
good,I worked there for a long time.  I learned a lot. Things change and being able to adapt is important for all involved. Sherwin Williams had a strong responsibility to their customers.
good,"Good company to learn good business practices.  Most upper management roles are based in Cleveland, OH.  Very limiting if you do not wish to live in the North and not necessary for most jobs.  Base pay is lower than industry, but great benefits."
good,"Decent place to work, but management will micro manage every aspect of your day.  Outside of that, I enjoyed the 7 years that I spent with Sherwin-Williams."
good,"The only review you will need(drivers): "
good,"PM maintenance, all aspects including the building, equipment, systems. Maintain electronic maintenance programs, parts procurement, create work orders, oversee other maintenance workers, work with operations, contractors, ect"
good,its a challenging environment and each day brings or comes with a different challenge.You don't get to interact with multitude of people but its nice.
good,"As a research chemist a sherwin williams it was quite unique as you had an access card to get into the building. It was a playground (me as an impressionable young chemistry major) with all the tools at your arsenal to make an incredible coating. There is a coating for everything however, there is still some order as you report to a supervisor and keep track of progress for funding. It is a great position if you plan on making the best coatings for a career. However, for me it was one of my most fond internship experiences."
good,"Good opportunities, fast paced often hectic, often labor intensive, excellent benefits, sales training, paint industry training, relocation expenses will sometimes be covered by SW if you transfer to another  location. Store managers may collaborate but are nearly always in competition in order to meet sales goals. Just like anywhere, SW has its good people and places and bad. If you are in a strong market with a decent team you can make some good money, although you will work for it."
good,"Sherwin Williams is a great choice for those just entering the workforce, and can be made into a career for those who are willing to work at it."
good,Working with sherwin can be rewarding yet taxing. Much is asked of you but you will be compensated. There may be season where long hours are put in but the culture and the people i have worked with have become the best of friends.
good,"i like sherwin williams a lot, the job itself is a lot of fun. however, paint is not a passion of mine so i don't intend to stay for an extended period of time. from what i've experienced, they treat their employees pretty well. management varies."
good,"You'll be mixing matching and tinting colors all day. You'll learn a thing or two about interior design, and you'll be lifting heavy buckets of paint all day."
good,"As a Tech Service Rep, I was required to travel at least Monday through Friday, which was challenging, but rewarding for all the different scenarios and people I worked with. You don't get a lot of support from management when on the road, but no one is looking over your shoulder either; you are trusted to do the work and be self-reliant. For the right personality this is an excellent situation."
good,"Enjoyable job meeting with customers and contractors to sell paints, stains, and many other products. I enjoyed going to work everyday and talking with everyone."
good,Fun place to work if you are paired with the right people. They have programs for your advancement and if you are a good employee they will move you up after some time.
good,"This is a great place to gain some management experience right out of college. The benefits and pay is hard to beat. Not too much corporate advancement opportunity outside of Cleveland, OH. A typical day depends on the size of the store but it can be a bit exhausting. Be prepared to lift a lot, stand all the time on concrete floors, and deal with the public."
good,The MTP (management training program) provided everything I needed to move up quick. Pay was great for a full time job out of college. A lot of opportunities to more up if you don‚Äôt mind relocating.
good,"Enjoy the people and the hours i work as it allows me to spend time with my family. However, advancement is minimal within the company. Employees are very friendly."
good,"I enjoyed working here. It got me to where I needed to go next."
good,"Sherwin Williams was a great part time job while I was attending college. I learned how to work with heavy machinery, work as part of a team, and how to keep up with the fast paced environment!"
good,"Working here has been a wonderful experience. The management knows their employees and each store has a unique set of customers. The customers, for the most part, are warm and friendly and it's easy to build up relationships."
good,"A typical day at work would start with many painters, contractors, and home owners entering the store getting paint and materials to begin their day. My colleagues and I would prepare every order that walked in the door."
good,"If you're looking to stick with a company until retirement, this is one of the best ones to consider. The benefits are quite healthy as they match your 401k plus provide a pension on the side. If you dedicate your life to them you will have a very comfortable retirement."
good,"Working as a temporary / contracted employee, I was assigned my own high-quality laptop computer, my own work space / desk, and had the ability / availability to work from home or out of the office at least 1 day per week, which was a great way to take a break from the office and gives you more time to relax and work in a more comfortable environment once in a while."
good,Days are long and fast-paced. Must multi-task to complete daily assignments. Work with both contractors and DIY customers on a daily basis. Great benefits and advancement opportunities.
good,"Great place to work, part timers get a consistent 28 hrs a week, starting at $10 and hour, after three months you can become a 3rd key and make 11 an hour. management isnt great but i think managers never are. you don't get benefits as part time, but you do earn some PTO hours, and its pretty easy to transfer stores and ear full time positions. you are however expected to learn A LOT about the products, you get a lot of contractors coming in who expect you to know what they want. and of course, DIY people also expect you to have all the answers to there problems, so be ready to take some product knowledge tests."
good,Great company that is financially sound and growth is key.  Good people that are good to work with and for.  They are proud to promote from within and everyone gets a chance
good,Decent place to work. Got along with most of the co-workers. No real hard work. Not to many rules to follow and the atmosphere is friendly. Local management very understanding.
good,"Sherwin-Williams is a great company for nice pay, benefits and security. I just had a unorganized manager, but he was a good person and not a mean boss."
good,I really do like working for Sherwin-Williams. The job is challenging to master but very satisfying to perform well. Personally I would stay here much longer but there are almost no opportunities to advance without being willing to relocate. It is also frustrating that management fast tracks new employees with degrees even if they know nothing about the job.
good,"The hours of work are responsibly flexible am allocated one rostered day off every fortnight. Picking and packing paint tins for regional, interstate and local customers and warehouses."
good,"Sherwin-Williams is a great first career opportunity. Everyone starts out working in a store. Employees are treated well with fun perks. Although my first love isn't selling paint, I feel fortunate to work here. I've learned a lot about myself and about this industry. I am able to work with a diverse group of clients which has helped me develop skills that I will take with me to my next adventure."
good,"Making paint brushes was fun, Cafeteria had great food.  The time when working there, a lot of overtime. its a very clean company, Safety is on point."
good,"As a sales associate at Sherwin Williams, I assist customers with finding all their paint project product needs, cashier, receive shipment, stock products, Tint and mix paint, lifting and pushing up to 20 gallons of paint, assist customers with loading products in their vehicle and maintain a well organized and clean work place."
good,"Strong Future "
good,"Over all it is a good job. A typical day for me would be mixing paint, helping customers pick colors, ringing people out for their items, cleaning, unloading freight, and answering the phone. It is very information based, and there is definitely a lot to learn. Management is understanding about a lot of things, but have proven to not be able to keep a consistent schedule.  I find it hard to try and schedule school time or family time, because every week looks different. Also, you are almost guaranteed to be part-time until you become an assistant manager or store manager, so for some people that can be years. The hardest part of the job is dealing with multiple customers at once, and functioning financially with inconstant part-time. The best part of the job would be the slow-paced moments and the customer base is mostly enjoyable."
good,"I enjoyed working for Sherwin Williams, however for myself the compensation was not enough, so to compensate I often times tried to work more hours during the days. Also there were no benefits offered to part time workers like myself. The work in and of itself was very physically demanding work. Some days were easier than others but overall it was really laid back. I didnt spend much time in the stores as I was a driver, but the environment in the locations was nice."
good,"I like working at Sherwin-Williams, the work was hard. I learned alot, the benifits were good and the work environment was very good. I wish I could have stayed but I got hurton the job"
good,Okay place to work.... Multifaceted opportunities to advance if willing to relocate.  Store work can be demanding. Outside sales possibilities.  Insurance and vacation options very good.
good,I get to work with some good people as far as the staff goes. I have very flexible hours which helps with the home life. I have some customer that I enjoy seeing on a daily basis and have great conversations and learn a lot about their craft from them.
good,I couldn't have asked for a better position out of college.  It offered me structure and their training program was amazing.  The on the job training was second to none.
good,"Great company to work for. I Learned a lot from my management training program. Some of the most important skills I learned are time management, organization and leadership."
good,"All good until no compensation for previous years business, drove and visited customers, introduced new products, trained customer employees, trouble shot customer problems"
good,"Sherwin Williams was a good place to work, very fast paced, could be some very stressful days as well.  Overall the facility I worked at had a very family type feel.  Only negative was in dealing with Corporate folks who did not understand the powder business."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of assisting customers in the store, over the phone, and via fax. Having to complete orders for deliveries and for will call kept the day pretty busy. Since the store was one of the busiest ones in our area, I exercised my time-management skills. I learned more about what constitutes as good customer service and about how important it was to develop relationships with our honorary customers. My manager was extremely patient. He was the type of manager that lead by example and was always working diligently because that's what he expected from us. He was also very understanding about working around my class schedule. My coworkers and I were like family, so we got along great."
good,I have been an employee for S-W for over three  years. I enjoyed working there. It was very laid back and easy work. it is by far the easiest money I ever made. the hardest part of the job was lifting the five gallon buckets. if you don't lift them will correct form your back will let you know!! during peak season you will be extremely busy but during the winter months you will be slow as a turtle.
good,"Good place to learn a trade, not much room for advancement unless you have a degree. Will learn the specific area and sales tactics. Won't grow much in the positions however."
good,el ambiente de trabajo es bueno pero no se puede seguir surjiendo y cualquier persona puede ser jefe y si le caes mal te quedas estancado
good,"."
good,"worked here for only 2 months due to the branch closing down. while i was there, i had a good experience. manager was very nice and approchable, trained well and was not a stressful job"
good,"A typical day at work includes advising customers and contractors, mixing and matching paint colors, deliveries, taking orders, answering phones, stocking shelves, and other things that would be included in a retail store."
good,"Empresa com muito tempo de existencia desde 1866, boa de trabalhar."
good,"This company works well for custmoers, contractors and others.  Its a good place to work, provides great products and great services to its clients.  Contractors like it."
good,"The company has great product lines that are superb in quality and have a worldwide presence.  Work life balance is exhibited. In three years I had three different bosses with three different philosophies so, I had to adjust to change.  That was not the hardest part of the job.  The hardest part of the job was coming in to the office knowing you wanted more of a career based on your prior experience and there was no where to go besides being a store manager or moving.  I had set personal goals when I hired to grow myself in the third year."
good,"Great place to start my career, specifically the Product Finishes division which allowed for more well rounded management experience.  Opportunities are there for you if you want to relocate and work hard."
good,good place to work but if you didnt go to college its very difficult to move up in the company. i completed all my tasks and grew sales yet was never given the assistant position.
good,"Sherwin - Williams is a great place to work for the most part. My truck is normally loaded when I come in in the morning. I just have to do my pre-trip inspection and secure the load. "
good,I enjoyed working with my customers and my servicing stores and staffs.   I traveled and covered a wide area of central Missouri that included 5 servicing stores.
good,"This company was an awesome place to work. Although very quiet and not a lot of people, I really enjoyed the environment. I was in my third trimester when hired for this position. They saw my potential and my work ethic instead of just my baby bump. They saved my life and I am forever grateful!"
good,This is a really good company to work for. There is a lot of room for growth if you are interested in retail management positions. The employees are all really great people and making working there a lot of fun.
good,"I enjoy the company but I wish they would offer benefits to part time employees. This is why I am looking for a different opportunity."
good,Good place to work at and start your career but kinda slow when it come to advancing your career. I would not mind working there until I finish my masters.
good,"aprendi a manejar inventarios"
good,it can get better updates with new jobs just keep getting the same jobs but its a very helpful tool for getting your resume out in the job world i use the site dailey
good,Average work day at Sherwin Williams includes helping customers as well as contractors decide what they need based on what kind of project they are dealing with. However if no one is in the store we are to keep the front looking nice as well as make sure we have enough product on hand. I've learned how to deal with different types of customers as well as different types of paints for certain jobs. The hardest part of the job is when no one is in the store and trying to find things to do. Not a fan of office jobs
good,"Sherwin Williams is a great place to work, they have great products and overall a great philosophy of doing business. If you are an exempt employee, they expect you to work a lot. you always get out what you put in though, Good company!"
good,Sherwin Williams is a great company with a core management structure. A typical work day for a Sales Rep consist of gaining leads and closing deals. Company culture is also family base in many ways. The hardest part of the job is using your own vehicle for company use. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you build business in a entrepreneur setting.
good,Sherwin has a awesome program for any graduate. The MTP program has given me a great start today. I truly enjoyed my job and the people I worked with.
good,I absolutely love working for Sherwin Williams. The customers that come in are amazing and I easily created new relationships with them. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers pick different color combinations for their homes. My coworkers are amazing to me. The direct store management definitely needed some work but Sherwin Williams Corporate office listens to their workers and tries their best to make everyones experience a wonderful one.
good,Me gusto mucho trabajar para sherwin williams es un ambiente muy sano con muy buenos valores y en general una empresa muy humana
good,"- High pace working environment"
good,People are friendly and safety is a high priority. I learned to how to work industrial machines.Management tried their best to find solutions to your problems. The hardest part was trying to make your rate when team is not keeping up. The most enjoyable part was experiences  working with a great group of people.
good,"I enjoyed working at sherwin. I learned a lot about paint, learned about inventory and stock. My manager wasn't the best, she tended to schedule me on days I asked for off but she was very nice and did go the extra mile for all her employees. Learned how to deal with some fairly irate customers."
good,"The company takes good care of management. However, their business model is to pay managers very, very well, but not pay part time employees a living wage. They would rather hire 4 part timers than 1 full timer to save the cost of benefits for employees. Managers and assistants have excellent comp plans, stock purchase options, 401k, outstanding health benefits. But very little work-life balance if you're not an exceptionally high-energy individual. As a store manager of a newer store, you're expected to spend 25-50% of your time outside of your store, acting as both store manager and outside sales rep."
good,"Great environment, help a lot of issues with customers who appreciate your advice. Had a lot of broken promises though. Promised promotions and raises, never got either. I've been working for Sherwin for almost 3 years, not one raise, i have my bachelor's now and was promised a promotion when i would obtain it, never got it, worked very hard and got lied to."
good,What I have learned was that if hard work was put forward they would reward you for those things. I really enjoyed working for this company. The training was great for future jobs. The way I handle everyday situations with breaking down a problem is also another added benefit to working for Sherwin Williams.
good,"As a sales associate for Sherwin Williams, I would mix and match stains and paint, merchandise products, organize back stock, delivery and customer service."
good,"Always learning something new every day and always busy with something to do in the warehouse or sales floor, positive and fun environment."
good,"overall good interaction between management and hourly employees. focus on equally important goals; people, cost, safety,productivity. employees work side by side with management for continuous improvement.hazardous chemicals and high presser production with strict safety rules and work instructions."
good,Great place to work. The work is not very hard and the training you receive helps you along the way. The only issue is that if you dont know the right people or brown nose enough than the advancement opportunities are limited.
good,This was a part-time paint sales job which was a stepping stone into management. I left Sherwin Williams in 2010 because of the lack of available advancement.
good,Alto grau de risco. A execu√ß√£o das fun√ß√µes devem ser realizadas com muita aten√ß√£o.
good,A typical day at work was to take care of the members and make sure everything is in order in the credit union. There was a lot to learn there and I enjoyed the time working there
good,Un dia tipico de trabajo: uno llegaba y hab√≠an compa√±eros de trabajo que alegraban el d√≠a con su buen humor. Aprend√≠ a obtener lo mejor de las dem√°s personas para ponerlas en pr√°ctica. La direcci√≥n de la empresa enfocada en los intereses de los accionistas. La parte mas dif√≠cil fue viajar solo para asumir los roles asignados cumpliendo con los objetivos. Lo que mas me gust√≥ fue el ambiente de trabajo con los compa√±eros de otros departamento.
good,"Overall, the company is a great company to work for. Customer service is difficult no matter what retail store you work in but sometimes upper management make it more difficult. There is a lot of micromanaging and a lot of confrontation between other SW locations due to pressure on employees for sales/ high budget goals."
good,"Good starting pay and benefits, good training program, good people working at the company. Great business experience, lots of hours and inconsistent scheduling for assistant managers though."
good,"Salaried at 48/hours per week, but average working 55-60 hours per week.  work nights, and lots of weekends.  "
good,"Good and fun place to work. Especially right out of college. I learned a lot about the everyday aspects of running a high volume, profitable business that they just dont teach you in school."
good,"The people in the company are all very friendly and nice. The job itself is very demanding physically, mentally, and emotionally. Although the benefits and pay are good, there is a lack of management and connection between you and the higher-ups. Often times, store is understaffed. You have to learn most things on the job. Other than that, there's freedom and always something to do. Days go by quick which is nice."
good,Testing paint at lab.Enjoying my work and trying to be productive all the time.
good,"As an intern there was not a lot of work for me to do on a daily basis.  Due to some staffing issues I was able to experience a broader view of the department.  My original manager was very hands-off, giving little training and guidance. The other managers were more hands on.   My co-workers were friendly and very helpful.  The hardest part of the job was not having enough to do, I enjoyed learning about the systems and processes that run Human Resources."
good,"Inom de ramar som s√§tts upp ifr√•n huvudkontoret i Cleveland, USA, finns stort utrymme f√∂r att ta egna initiativ, bidra till f√∂retagets l√∂nsamhet och sin egen utveckling. Min chef var en italienare placerad i Pianoro utanf√∂r Bologna. En mycket bra chef som l√§t mig ta stort eget ansvar och tillsammans √•stadkom vi v√§ldigt mycket under kort tid. Sherwin-Williams h√•ller h√∂g standard och l√§gger bra resurser p√• att utbilda folk i Europa d√§r det beh√∂vs, senast inom S√§lj och Marknad."
good,"Stead work daily all day, not a hard job but you work in high gear."
good,"160 Face to Face calls with customers per month, 2 servicing stores, the most enjoyable part of the day is finding new customers and getting sales. Too much micromanaging and meetings that take you out of the field too often."
good,"Company was a great place to work, and even paid me the difference between my military base pay and their wages while I was deployed."
good,"i have had a decent experience, it is an okay place to work and they provide good benefits. However there is not a lot of room to move up in the company. also the manager focuses more on sales and the amount per sale."
good,as a part timer i dont get benefits but quick place for advancement
good,"lugar amig√°vel , bem organizado e te dar uma boa experiencia profissional e √©tico."
good,Go to work. Do job. Good environment. Have a certain amount of accounts to contact and collect from.
good,"Assist customers with product selection; determine proper tools to use with project, aid in color selection, tint & mix paint, provide superior customer service"
good,One of my first jobs I learned alot about working from this place
good,Sherwin-Williams is a great company to work for. They definitely take care of their employees with benefits but as far as scheduling goes it's a little rough. Most stores are under staffed and over worked. There is also little advancement options for part time employees.
good,"Field Auditor		Aug 2011‚ÄìNov 2011"
good,Maintaining teamwork and equipment however no teamwork with management.
good,I would look forward to the next day of work thanks to my coworkers that made working there very enjoyable. I learned a lot from them and they have become good friends.
good,"Overall this is a great company.  "
good,"Good company, reorganized the companies inventory also where i learned about wall paper decorations"
good,Not much comments because it is not related to job search.  It is a good place to work.
good,Sherwin Williams is great company to work for with lots of room for advancement if you are flexible and willing to relocate.
good,"‚Ä¢ Supports store‚Äôs sales growth plan. Uses appropriate interpersonal, communication and organizational skills to help execute the sales plan and to grow market share."
good,Interacting with commercial and retail customers. Solving difficult problems on a daily basis and managing staff in an effective manner.
good,"The work environment if fun, make friends with customers on a daily basis."
good,I enjoyed working at Sherwin Williams and would return.
good,"Bad experience with management, with low compensation for the work I was doing. Although I was on the bottom of the ""totem pole"", I was pushed to do work for lazy management."
good,"Calming atmosphere that allows you to work at your own pace. I assist contractors, designers, architects, business owners etc... with technical support on a mangagerial level for the Sherwin Williams Company. My co-workers work as a team and I am one of the many liasions for Sherwin Williams paints and coatings. The hardest part of my job is location, given that its far away from my family. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I am involved with satisfying customers with the needed service to make their life easier."
good,"I enjoyed the friendships that I made while working at SWP. Employees and customers helped get me excited about going to work. I learned about inventory control, the P&L statement and various other reports, management skills, and countless products. Could not advance very far within the company without a degree. Hardest part of the job was sales calls when I knew most every company's paint is basically the same as SWP."
good,"Working for Sherwin Williams was an absolute joy, I was tasked with often opening and closing the store and often felt good about the amount of responsibility I had been intrusted with, I would have stayed with Sherwin Williams if it had not been for hours being cut and always being promised I will get into the management program, after a few years of having that dangled over my head I said goodbye to Sherwin Williams."
good,"Overall, this is a great company to work for- if you fit the culture. This is a sales-driven culture. With the exception of some specialty job in product development and operations / IT support, the entirety of the drive for this company is sales. If you dislike sales, do not apply. Whether in a front-line retail store position, store management position, or sales rep position, you are expected to generate leads and sell. There are no non-selling career tracks other than the specialties listed above."
good,"Worked at the commercial location. John was wonderful at getting me hours around my classes. I didn't hate my coworkers, the customers were fun. Would be easy to move up in the company."
good,"The position I acquired was responsible for servicing wholesale and retail customers. Maintaining accurate work order files and formulas with paint (as in pulling the correct product from sales floor, tinting and mixing them to customers specifications."
good,If u work hard this company u learn a lot on the fly and it really a good place to grow great retirement pension must be able to left 50 at all times and everyone is willing to help
good,"This company does pay their employees well, and the family work balance is great. However Management changes as caused some tension with new processes and it does not seem like a family environment any longer"
good,Met many contractors and locals in the area. Was a great job to really learn in a professional atmosphere. The work place culture represented the city very well.
good,Job assignments were not too difficult. I was very well trained by the supervisors. The store was well supplied. The hardest part was staying in store. I enjoyed delivering to the car dealerships and body shops. I enjoyed the workplace culture.  The supervisors were profession but personable.  I learned a lot with the automotive side of the paint industry.
good,Office is quite busy so there is always something to do. Office team is very supportive and helps one another. Managers are approachable and will answer questions. Advancement is possible if you ask about what you can do.
good,I loved the manager I worked with she encouraged me to go above and beyond with my work tasks. A really good job all around I can‚Äôt really complain about anything.
good,"The specific store I work at might be a special case... My manager and assistant manager are two of the best bosses I've ever had! But aside from that, I actually enjoy going to work. I learn something new everyday. It's not stressful (,most of the time) and it's a pleasant work environment as long as you know products and how to make recommendations properly. But definitely a job I would recommend"
good,"To work at Sherwin Williams you need to be able to deal with painters and contractors who are not always articulate about what they want (and they want it immediately!). But if you have people skills you will do well."
good,"Lots of running around, you start at a retail store, some weekends are needed, especially when short staffed. Huge bonus structure. sales heavy job. company is growing fast and job advancement is fast"
good,I worked here via a Temp Agency. Environment was profession and my co workers were very helpful to me! I would have loved to have been a permanent employee for them!
good,"Overall good experience with the company.  Great management and coworkers, but little opportunity for no college graduates. Can be very hectic at times, but overall good company."
good,Sales and management skills learned have been beneficial since my departure with the company. Store culture was fun but tiresome during rush hours and special sales events.
good,Good place to make a living. Working there is a great experience to advance your own personal experience with a great variety of talents so you can apply what you learn in other areas.
good,"Good people and work environment overall. Management was not bad, but upper management didn't recognize the testing lab's value. As such, moving to another group was effectively a promotion as it allowed you to potentially get promoted in the future."
good,Working for Sherwin has been a great experiences. I have learned a lot about business practices and now recognize the importance of setting personal goals. Teamwork is the key to this business. We work in small groups so every persons role is key to having a productive work day. Advancement depends solely on you. Your work ethic determines how far you get. The work days take up a lot of free time but the benefits are worth the sacrifice. I enjoy assisting people and helping them transform their homes into new exciting and tranquil environments.
good,"SW is a young person's game working through college and for 5-10 years thereafter.  If you are willing to relocate, you can climb and prosper there."
good,"Sherwin-Williams is a great company to work for, the boss is really kool and is very understanding, Very fast paced job at times. Also, the only thing that isn't koo is there is no overtime given at all. You work on day past your time, they'll make you take off the next day early to make sure you don't pass your hours."
good,"Sherwin Williams has been a great company to work for. The Managers that I have worked under have been great! The benefits are good and the pay is competitive. The only negative is that it is hard to move up in the company if you have no degree, which is my case. I've worked with the company for 12 years and people with no experience right out of college (that I train) go straight into the management program. It seems that they value a degree more than years of loyal service."
good,"Ambiente corporativo tranquilo, gest√£o firme e presente. Uma empresa que respeita o colaborador e o cliente."
good,"This is a really great place to work. It's very diverse and theres usually lots of opportunity for progression and development is different areas. Theres opportunities for cleaners, warehouse workers, factory workers, office work and chemists at all levels."
good,this is fast paced job where u can drive from anywhere between  Miami to  jupiter routes are timed zoned so you have to keep a stead pace to make the the delivery on time
good,Great job for an artist! I get to work with color and design elements daily. The hardest part of the job is dealing with grumpy customers and giving them what they want. Also the endless complaints about price.
good,"worked here while completing my undergrad. consistent scheduling even for part timers, works with your schedule. Management is lax, workload varies by day and location. typical warehouse work."
good,"The job itself was great. Competitive pay and flexible hours. They seem to care about their employees. Benefits are very nice. PTO and insurance available for full time employees. The problem is unorganized local management. The corporate level was always great to deal with, but the district management was a nightmare. Could not advance due to multiple cases of nepotism and ended up leaving the company because of it."
good,Good company to work for if you're in high school or college and want part-time work. The pay is pretty good and some benefits are offered to part-time staff.
good,"The work culture is good, great compensation for a start into the working world. Great benefits and quarterly bonuses. More of a male dominated industry."
good,"I have worked there for two years and have had the best work expiereince here at sherwin williams. It has gotten to the point that all my co workers are friends that i have recommeneded, i even got my brother a job at sherwin and he loves the job. Moving on the Managers are very understanding and are always in touch and wanting to help you improve. You do work closley with the manager and assistant doing most of the same work in the store, just that managers are expected to do more sales than anything. You do have alot of customer interactions, there is alot of learning with the job and alot of questions that go with selling paint product , but no matter what you will always be with someone that will be there to help and answer questions , you will never be left hanging. They are flexible with the schedule and will always ask in advance if you could take an extra shift or not. You do put away stock every sunday or saturday but its always divided with the shift on sunday and monday.  The only con i would have is that becoming a full time employee is rate and that there isnt a commission plan within the company. Other than that , its a great place to work , just be weary of working at a commercial store ,  they handle a heavier work load with the same amount of team members of a residential store."
good,"Working at Sherwin has taught me a lot about business, from the small contractors to the big commercial companies. It has also taught me a lot about myself in what I‚Äôm capable of doing and how much I need to push myself."
good,"Conta com excelentes profissionais, avalia√ß√£o e acompanhamento de pesquisa de mercado √© diferenciada √© acompanhada de perto pelos profissionais."
good,"Sherwin Wiliams is a nice company to work at. Work is fast paced and with lots of learning opportunities.   The hardest part of the job was to keep up with constant change and expectations from management.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to learn new things, travel and network with other managers.  There is a sense of community and team environment."
good,"Growing company with supportive management."
good,"The management is awesome and willing to work around your schedule, if need be. The customers are wonderful to deal with. The work environment is extremely fast paced during the warmer months but does slow down during the winter. Overall it‚Äôs a good place to work."
good,"I enjoyed my experience working for Sherwin-Williams Co. Good people, good culture, good incentives, and room for growth. Many of my peers would agree with this statement."
good,"Good job to have, if you have patience for the seasonal part time, usually you work jan- oct., occasionally working overtime, but no benefits during this period, but you get paid weekly"
good,The environment as a Fortune 500 company is great.  A vibrant workplace in downtown Cleveland; plenty of different potential tasks.  The IT department is large and there is a variety of potential jobs and tasks available.  There are many opportunities to learn and make friends.
good,I‚Äôve worked for the company for 9 years.  It‚Äôs a good company for any young person who wants to work a fast paced and labor intensive job.   The only reason I‚Äôm looking elsewhere is the desire for advancement.  The 401k is good and they have stock plans along with health care benefits for full time and up.
good,The general manager of the store was very respectable. You could obviously tell he worked very hard to keep his store running and the business flowing. The other employees are great to work with as well. There were issues with the hours I was given due to issues with the schedule. Other than that I enjoyed my time there.
good,"The learning curves in the company are pretty steep, but once you got it, you got it. Upper management lights fires under your butts to increase sales and decrease costs, like I imagine a lot of large publicly owned companies do. Decent company to work for. If you drink the koolaid you're sure to succeed."
good,"Great management and coworker environment, however the pay could be better for those at the bottom of the totem pole. Advancement within the company is pretty common so hard work will eventually pay off in the long run."
good,Great company to work for. Lots of oppourtunity for promotion. Must be willing to relocate for upper management positions. Historically been a male dominated field but the company is making it a priority to hire and promote more females.  Opportunity for significant bonuses along with competetive base salaries.
good,"Greta place to work only problem was there was not enough hours in my department, so I had to move on. Wish I would have stuck it out a little longer, but needed more hours."
good,SW has job security but very hard to advance. People stay in the same job forever and it is extremely competitive when time to go up for promotion. The most enjoyable part of this company is the company culture. It is like one big family.
good,A typical day at work would be picking up paint from a number of stores and delivering the paint to our costumers. The hardest part of the job is unloading hundreds of gallons of paint. The best part of the job was I was on the road and not in the office.
good,"Had a good boss. Coworkers were cool. Typical workday is alright. pick up deliveries all around the metro and deliver them to houses, new buildings, and in store transfers. Not a hard job. I'd advise you not to apply if you have a bad back. You are constantly lifting and moving pails that are 50 lbs."
good,"The hours are flexible, and can work with students in college. Also, benefits for full timers and above are very good. Part-time is not as good. Too little pay with no benefits, however as stated can completely work with college classes and hectic schedules. However, the job field as we all know is tough. Retail in general is tough because you never know whats going to walk through the door. It is a great workout physically, and the coworkers can make the job amazing. However if you get a lazy manager, it can make the job much harder than it needs to be."
good,Fortune 500 retail business that offered great benefits for its full time employees and managers. Business offered great perks for its customers and goes above and beyond for them.
good,"Learned a lot about paint industry, different types of jobs. Great job culture, always had good team. Great management within store. Always taking orders from painters/contractors, tinting paint, organizing back of warehouse."
good,"Sherwin Williams, is a progressive company, and has been around for 150 years. A leader in the paint and coating industry, with over 250 locations, and more being added every year. The company is fair, offers opportunities, and everyone is friendly. Sherwin Williams, does have out side sales roles, for almost every sub-industry, and the store locations, are retail based."
good,"Sherwin provides a great opportunity for those entering the workforce looking for good starting pay and a home/work life balance. Positions rarely keep workers on site past daylight hours, with comparable compensation and benefits to other competitors within the industry."
good,"Small work force, friendly coworkers, friendly competent boss. Doesn't pay very well but what job does these days. Taught me a lot about paint though."
good,Long established company with very good opportunities for advancement within multiple divisions and opportunities to move around the country and world.
good,I was motivated by the fact that the manager and I were a team. We had meetings to plan the ahead of time and did our best to stay on top of customer satisfaction and increase sales.
good,A great part time job with flexible hours. Must be able to lift heavy objects and can't mind getting your hands dirty daily. Great community and good place to make connections.
good,"Empresa boa com benef√≠cios , perto da minha casa e mi sinto bem estando l√° , lugar agrad√°vel , muito bom de trabalhar . Mais est√° ocorrendo uma mudan√ßa de setor , inclusive o meu , est√° mudando de cidade , por isso estou vendo outros empregos ."
good,Is an very good first job to have they teach u that we make the and create the houses that people are now living in today so a lot of hard work goes with that and dedication that you have when ur working this job
good,"Can be very fast paced and stressful.  Often understaffed with part time help that is not paid well enough causing insufficient workers.  Manager is usually required to work several different positions.  As the company grew,  weekly and daily requirements grew.  Can be a lot to take on and very exhausting, both physically and mentally.  Has very good pay and benefits."
good,"A typical day at work involved many, many tasks. HR duties, administrative duties, secretarial, newsletter, sale flyers, anniversary planning, shipping and receiving, collecting and preparing reports, and much more. I learned a lot, both on the job and from my managers, who were excellent, supportive and encouraging. The workplace culture was a little lonely, because I was alone much of the time, but I experienced no antagonism. The hardest part of the job was time management, which was not generally very difficult. I enjoyed taking complex tasks and breaking them down into manageable parts and coming up with an excellent product."
good,"a typical day of work at Sherwin-Williams normally consists of assisting customers with finding the correct products and supplies needed for their projects, mixing pre-existing colors or matching new colors should the customer need; restocking shelves in the display areas along with the warehouse shelves with inventory that comes in on a weekly basis. Sherwin-Williams also has each store do sales calls and emails to check and needs and projects our customer may have."
good,"The opportunities for advancement are clear and concise and most of all completely attainable, provided that those in higher management have not recently been shuffled about as they so commonly are, which arouses confusion in the district and breaks of communication regarding monthly sales goals, as some are unrealistic and insensible of the situations surrounding a stores sales status."
good,"Overall, the company is good to work for. The hours are flexible, and their is support on every level. There is room for for growth, and the company does a lot of promotion from within."
good,This was one of my favorite jobs and companies to work for. They were even willing to bring me back on staff later in life when I was in need of a secondary income. Very well managed. Learned everyday.
good,"It's rather simple to get to know customers as a majority are regulars. Make no mistake, this is a selling job, but co-workers and customers alike are kind and patient. They can recognize a new face. "
good,"Great place to start a career. There is opportunity to advance, travel can be required with advancement. You must be flexible and willing to work nights weekends and even some holidays."
good,"Helping customers get their order complete for their paint project and would help them carry their items to their vehicles. When business was slow, I would usually go through each isle and see what we were low on and go in the warehouse to get the items I need to stock the items up. After that, I'd go into the warehouse and work on the shipment we got for the week and stocked it in the back where it needed to go if it couldn't go on the sales floor. I never realized how many different kind of paints there were and the grades for each one. The cheap inside paint is good for rooms not used often like a guest room or closet. The higher Quilty paints are better for high traffic rooms like the living room because people will constantly be going through it and rubbing against the walls and the paint won't peel as easily or fade as quickly. My favorite and also hardest part was learning the different types of paint and what each one of them can go on and how good they are. Getting to become friends with most of the contractors was pretty great also."
good,"Hard to move to new location, spend time ordering products, make recommendations to customers, sometimes working long hours, hard to progress. Company hired within."
good,"Over my more than 15 years at Sherwin Williams, I learned something new every day in terms of product, approach to sales, marketing and customer service. Though sometimes frustrated by the corporate culture that goes with an international company, I enjoyed the challenge of finding innovative ways to meet the local community's needs within that culture. As a result, I developed a great relationship with DYIers and professional contractors and my interactions with them became the most enjoyable part of my day and grew my store's sales, ensuring it was always one of the top in the district."
good,The pay was good and the company respects their employees. A lot of opportunity for upward mobility or lateral mobility if you so choose. Only problem is the customers in the stores really.
good,"Working at Sherwin Williams was quite fun, but it could be frustrating at times. This is either due to not being trained on certain subjects or that you'd have to 'bend' the rules in order to ensure both the customer and the company were satisfied."
good,"Sherwin Williams has great benefits, and great opportunity for advancement within the company. My only issue is the way they handle pay checks. If you are not direct deposit they mail you the check and they are never on time. They will not pay what they officially owe in back pay, and don't seem to care if you are not currently getting paid."
good,"A typical day for me, well normally had the morning shift so clock in then help anyone who walked thru that door. We would help with paint colors, paint matches and ect. We also did wood stains and wood stain matches.  I have always worked with really fun people so its always been super relaxed. Lunch time was always a big deal there . Somebody would run and get food for everyone . Also was just a friendly coworkers cracking jokes and enjoying the day together. I would say that was the most enjoyable part of the day. Hardest part of that job would be dealing with big contractors who come in with big orders and expect you to know exactly what needs to be done . You can run into some very rude contractors who think they can cheat our system and talk us into given them better prices then we already have given.  I would say just learning to deal with the public. I learned alot about painting and staining and other products that will help me in the future of my home and the people around me."
good,Overall experience I had was great. I worked with good employees Nice costumers and very rewarding job. This job is family oriented and care about their employees.
good,Above average work life. Great job to gain sales and customer service experience. You really get the opportunity to learn how to promote and push certain products
good,Sherwin Williams is a great place to work for. You learn a lot in a very little time. Employees are very helpful and you can be trained fast and move up fast.
good,I was the supervisor over the store beside the assistant manager and the store manager. i helped contractors figure out there problems and help get product to them in a quick and friendly matter. i was in charge of sales calls( reaching out to contractors checking in with them). and was in charge of the store on Sundays (working by myself). making sure freight got put up in a timely fashion and doing problem solving.
good,"I truly enjoy speaking with the customers that enter Sherwin. They are either extremely knowledgable about their craft, or eager to learn how to do something new. This makes meeting people so interesting because I never know what type of person I'm going to meet. It does take some natural hard work to work here, but there no aspects of the job that I find too difficult or anything that I feel is impossible to learn."
good,Fun workplace and management was flexible. I had a great team that would go their way into helping me. When I was left alone I felt I always had the resources to do well at my job.
good,"As the title describes, a good and for most part fair company. Well organized and structured but very little room for creativity or ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù thinking."
good,When I started I had a helpful group of companies workers o help me though my firs 2 weeks . Now I'm in their shoes helping out people from other stores.
good,"As a part time employee, I worked between 20 and 30 hours per week with a starting wage of $14.73 an hour. This is much higher than most other part time entry level jobs in my area (Los Angeles). The job itself can either be very face paced or very slow, depending on the time of day. Lifting and tinting large paint buckets is the most difficult part of the job, causing blisters and a bit of back soreness. However, overall the job is not all that difficult. Helps to be bilingual since the majority of the location's customers speak Spanish. Tend to work more with contractors that DIY customers."
good,"Fast pace, good place to work.  Must be able to open and close the store on week days and week ends.  Good people to work with.  You will get paint on your clothing.Store is open from 7am to 7pm weekdays."
good,Great potential for learning Process Improvement and the manufacturing process along with all machines used in the process. A lot of travel with little potential of moving up unless someone retires. Very small corporate engineering department most engineers work in plants.
good,A Typical Day a Sales Representative is Planning Face-to-Face Calls with my existing accounts. Hardest part of my job is crossing customers over to Sherwin-Williams from an Competitor product. I learn how to take customers through the sale process and not be a sales man but a consultant to their business. Most enjoyable part of being a rep is getting products to my customers when they need it most.
good,"Atypical day at Sherwin Williams is helping homeowners, contractors, and painters find the merchandise they need for their painting experience. Ive learned alot about interior and exterior paint and different paint products working at Sherwin Williams. You meet alot of people from different walks of life and ethnicities and I am able to hold dialogue with them about specific products and jobs that they are working on. At Sherwin we always have to greet the customer at the door no matter what which is a big part of our interaction with them. I enjoy delivering paint to different job sites and getting to experience what it is like to be on a painter or contractors job site."
good,"A typical day at work was fast pace. I learn a lot about colors and how to be able to help someone."
good,"I was a part time driver for one the hubs. Everything with job was actually good, just being a husband and father, part time wasn't enough.  Full-time employees get all the benefits. Hub drivers have no full time opportunities nor advancement unless he or she opt to switch position. Outside of that great organization top to bottom, some store operates better than others but everything about the company was good."
good,"They didn't know what they wanted to do half the time, no communication between departments, need better mangers,not enough people on given shift worked with small crew"
good,"Most of the employees were chill. Good culture and room for advancement and to move around within the company.  Some bad apples and high turnover rate, but that is to be expected at an entry level position."
good,MTP candidates have a good shot at success if they find the right situation. Excellent training programs. Lots of chances to advance in metro areas versus smaller communities.
good,"Great Benefits and work environment, most of the employees have been at this location for years.  Its a manufacturing environment and things break down but there are slow periods to catch up."
good,"This company offers young individuals fresh out of college a great opportunity to get into the work force and make great advancements, whether it‚Äôs within the company or outside of it, my only complaint is the hiring and promotion of individuals, in my experience with Sherwin Williams especially in the Metro NY district I have come to see that individuals that get promoted are those who throw other co workers under the bus, management sees no other option but to promote these individuals because there is no one else to fill certain positions and the wrong people are put into certain positions resulting in a conflicting work place, management needs to step away from their P&L reports and look at how promoting certain toxic employees to certain positions can result in real problems."
good,"Started working at SWP as a Part time employee and quickly learned the ropes.  Learned about assist customers, spending my time wisely, and communicating with co workers to make for a good work environment."
good,"Very good company , a place that you can go and learn , safety job and , you can make a great carrer in that company, the co-workers are helpful and they are allways growing"
good,"Working at this branch taught me a lot of things. This was my first job and I am glad I got it. This job taught me organizational, planning and customer relation skills. I worked closely with customers and dealt with their problems. At the time I was also attending community college. So I had to balance school and work."
good,"work is fun here, great team work from colleagues. working here groom me to become one of the highest rating automotive paint mixer in the parish. the hardest part of my job is color matching challenges and the most enjoyable is accomplishing them"
good,There is a lot of room for advancement and great benefits with the company. The work can be a grind though. It‚Äôs a great job out of college and if it‚Äôs a good fit for you I would recommend it.
good,"Great company to work for, SW does a great job taking care of its employees. Good turnover and promotions within the company. Work/ Life balance can be hard due to store hours."
good,"This was a marketing internship and I learned that often industries have products that are very comparable in quality and the differentiation factor comes with value added services.  There are a lot of paints that all do the same job, but at Sherwin Williams we go the extra mile with service so we can paint the world."
good,"Great work experience for a part time job. Introduced me to sales and customer relations with end users and contractors. Opportunity to advance as assistant store manager, manager, and outside sales."
good,Sherwin Williams was a great place to work very well run and just to much overlap when Valspar and Sherwin Williams merged. The customers that i had while working at Valspar and Sherwin Williams were top professionals and I will miss those relationships.
good,Busy most of the time. Like the people i worked with and the customers. Did not have a problem most of the time. Schedule is random and not well put together
good,"Best part of the job is that you are continuously doing some type of work. "
good,How to organize and manage. Sherwin Williams gave me the tools to needed to succeed in the work world. I was able to understand supply and demand. Great culture
good,Fast paced meritocracy that allows you to progress rapidly. The typical work days consists of tinting orders for home owners and contractors. Calling contractors to help their business along with managing direct reports
good,"This is a great company.  They are very successful and well managed.  With that being said, most processes and departments are driven by two things. "
good,"The greatest part of this job was the opportunity to advance. I started off as an intern. It was a great internship because I had the opportunity to do a project and learn the different kinds of paints, and also the competitor's products. A typical day at work would be I would help a customer pick out a paint color and then the right kind of paint or stain for their particular project. Everyday was a different day, and it was fun helping people pick out everything for their DIY (Do It Yourself) and contractor projects. A great perk of the internship was I got to go on sales calls, in which I would ride along with the stores sales rep and get to see the various contractor projects going on. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help a customer out with his/her project to help improve their house."
good,"I loved the time I was there. My first manager was awesome and taught me a lot, I just wish there was an easier was to advance in the company. The pay wasn't that great, but it was good enough to get by on the job for a temporary thing. I would highly recommend it to anybody. The experience you get out of doing it is great and with the right co-workers, it can be a really fun experience"
good,"Sherwin Williams is an entire culture in itself. The company can seem like an entire world considering there are 150 countries with Sherwin Williams stores and company activity taking place. The hardest part about being a store associate is learning all of the products, their differences, being able to guide conversation with guests to provide them with the service they are seeking, and developing a good grasp on different market segments and which products apply to each segment."
good,"Very stressful work environment with a heavy emphasis on cost, productivity, and stock price.  Work / family life can suffer, but very profitable company."
good,"A empresa cumpre com suas obriga√ß√µes conforme a legisla√ß√£o vigente, paga os sal√°rios em dia, n√£o faz negocia√ß√µes excusas, n√£o negocia hor√°rio de trabalho, per√≠odo de f√©rias, cumpre as conven√ß√µes, nada a menos e nem a mais."
good,Stores in the area are all tightly knit. Employees from other stores know other employees on first name basis. Advancement is relatively easy if you are interested in pursuing further into management at Sherwin you just have to show you are competent.
good,"The overall job was nice and eventually very easy to do after the long work curve was learned. You would help customers, recommend them on the type of paint they'd be needing for their job and on top of that do other duties as requested by management. At one point the job gets too repetitive though. Even with a fast paced environment."
good,"-as an intern you learn day to day operations of the store and how to handle contractors and DIY customers and their needs with the company."
good,"As a part timer, your experience depends solely on the type of manager you have. You may work in a toxic environment or an encouraging one. I worked in both. The job itself is easy, the only difficult part is the large learning curve for the mass amount of paint knowledge you need to know."
good,I mixed paint and helped customers find the right products that fit their needs.  There's a sales component to the job which can sometimes be draining.  Delivery is involved.  Lots of lifting.
good,Good company to work for if you can get hired full-time. Company currently in transition with recent merger with Valspar. Scheduled closing of their Beltsville plant is creating a lot of competition for job openings.
good,"A great job and company that genuinely cares about the employees. Can be slow one minute and then very busy the next. Overall, a fun work environment that pays well."
good,conoci buenos compa√±eros de los cuales aun sigo en contacto
good,"In my every day work experience, I interact with many different departments from Sales to Marketing to Pricing to Finance.  It is a pleasure as the people are always positive and willing to work as a team to get what needs to be done for a certain request.  My current position also allows for independent working to create and suggest new reports and or ideas."
good,"I loved working here. took a bit of learning but aside from that, it is an easy company to stay with. The staff at my store was a lot of fun and willing to teach me."
good,"As an assistant manger this company is not bad to start off with fresh from school. but unless you plan on becoming a store manager or a sales rep theres not too many more options, so you be the judge. Pay is decent, and 401k is great but you must be willing to relocate to whichever store they place you at when you first start. could be longer than an hour drive easy if your not lucky! (this is not uncommon) Work weekends, and on feet all day."
good,Very great experience. If you want to advance with the company great place to go. They promote from within the company. Very big on customer service. Great benefits as well and bonus opportunities.
good,Do your job and put in your prescribed hours and you will be adequately compensated.  IT Management has widely varying degrees of expertise.  IT Security is poorly organized and very political
good,"Empresa id√¥nea e muito correta em rela√ß√£o aos seus funcion√°rios, mas que mant√©m um crit√©rio muito rigoroso para avalia√ß√£o de seus funcion√°rios."
good,"If you want to be in management, this is the company for you!!! Opportunity for advancement anywhere in the country. Great stock prices and health benefits."
good,You have to be confident and ready to work everyday. The customer is always right and we make sure to send them happier than when they came in. Need to have a thick skin and not to crack under pressure with customers and fast paced shifts. The shifts are somewhat flexible but you will have to work a lot of holidays and weekends.
good,It was a fun-friendly work environment. The managers really worked with their employees and made schedules where they saw fit. They were very understanding.
good,Sherwin Williams in Coffeyville is small and not a whole lot of traffic comes through. It is a relaxed environment to work in and lots of learning time.
good,Good company to work for with good chances for advancement.  You will put in long hours; especially in summer and fall seasons.  Managers perform many different duties.
good,It's a good place to work for just need some much needed improvements. We do have five S meetings every month a safety program barbecues and a Christmas party every year.
good,"A typical work day includes dealing with hundreds of customers with different necessities. While working with Sherwin Williams I have learned to be more involved into a team, as well as improvements in communication skills. Management has gone through important changes including a change in store managers and management skills. At my home store, we have a diverse staff. Definitely the most enjoyable part of the job is to see your customers leave the store satisfied and happy."
good,"Outstanding company, however management decisions in the last 7 years effected promotions and bonuses. 401k, pension, health, dental, vision and vacation benefits are among the best"
good,Overall strong but cut-throat atmosphere to work in. Annual budgets get higher each year and harder to hit. If willing to work hard - you can make good money and work for a company that has been around 150+ years and makes the best products out there.
good,I enjoyed my time with sherwin Williams. The people in my particular district were good people to work with. The day to day can be a little hectic on busy days.
good,"Sherwin William Paint Co was a very good company to work for. The work environment was excellent and the management team was helpful, courteous and friendly.  In my years there I learned a great deal regarding painting and paint blending. I enjoyed working there very much.  The hardest part of my job was the commute, since I was transferred to NJ, it took me up to 2 hrs and sometime 3 hrs in the winter to get there."
good,"I enjoy working for this company, and I love my job.  I have a lot of autonomy with what I do, and I'm faced with a new challenge every day. Great benefits package (401, pension)."
good,The store I work in is very well managed. Both my bosses are very friendly and care about your general well-being. In downtime when there isn't much to do they like you to clean and organize the store. When the store gets busy with customers the staff helps each other out the best they can.
good,"Tough work depending on what store you are at.  Customers can be difficult at times, but aren't they all.  Great company to work for.  cooperate company for sure."
good,Fast paced work environment.  There are opportunities to succeed and advance but they are mainly on the paint side of the business.  Typical corporate company changes are slow to happen.
good,"If you're willing to put in the hours and work hard, you can easily make 150k a year as a sales rep within 2-3 years. In Sherwin, the cream rises to the top; management will take you under their wing and groom you to become district management."
good,"Sherwin Williams offers an opportunity for high school graduates, college students, and college graduates to enter a company with little to no experience and learn everything they could ever need to know about the industry.

good,Very labor intense job with great pay and benefits. Many people are unable to keep up with the demands of the job. One interacts with very demanding customers.

good,"promotions to fulltime or assistant manager are nearly impossible if you don't have some kind of degree. other than that,its a very good company to work for"
good,"This is a good place to learn and start a career. Not much is expected of you and the work is easy. Don't look for a challenging position, they only promote from within. When the economy is good, it's a good place to work. But when times are tough, it is a terrible place to work for."
good,"This compan paid well and had a great 401K, I just didn't want to be in retail management forever. Job could be very stressful and I wanted to put my focus on starting a family instead."

good,"A typical workday consisted of the following activities:"
good,"A typical work day, for a sales associate, includes restocking the shelves, keeping track of store stock, assisting customers, being patient with customers or individuals that have little knowledge of paint and associated products. I've learned that patience is key when assisting customers, as everyone has different tastes and preferences. Management is great, one of the best working environments I've worked in. You have to be willing to learn from coworkers as well as teaching coworkers, its a team effort. The hardest part of the job is assisting customers that require a greater level of patience. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with and learning from management that is more knowledgeable about the company and trains well in order to encourage your progression."
good,"Good job. Great co-workers, and a lot of opportunity to work up within the company. They tend to no have enough people on staff at times though."

With constant customer interaction it becomes tough and can sometimes be overwhelming.

good,Help customers with painting needs and/or application process. Determining product or product to best help customer complete there projects.
good,A typical day at work was to cut the carpets for the customers. I had to work with the computer more of excel and word. I met the needs of customers on what they wanted. Then I would find the carpet and have an installer pick it up and they would install it. What I learned there was how to deal with customers if they were not happy with what they got. The management was good they also kept everything organized so it was easy for me to cut the carpet and put it in the computer. The hardest part of the job was doing it by yourself everyday. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I got the weekends off.
good,"They will basically teach you how to run your own business but you must be willing to relocate it you want to advance."

good,"Working at Sherwin Williams has been a great experience for me. Sherwin Williams is on the top 100 corporations to work for. I've gain excellent customer service since what you deal the most is helping customers pick the right colors for their projects and educating them on our SW products.

good,Sherwin offers a lot of oppurtunities and is a great company to work for
good,"Excelente empresa, √≥timos ganhos e que cumpre com as suas fun√ß√µes de empregador."
good,"You're typical day at work start at 6:15AM, some times earlier.  You start out as an assistant manager  in a small volume store and work your way up to bigger volume stores; eventually, becoming store manager.  There are times you learn as you go, but the company does a great job with in-store and out of store sales support to help make your job easier.  The best part working at Sherwin Williams is the relationships you build between your B2B customers and your local outside sales rep.  The hardest part of the job would be double digit budget goals- but with hard work and utilizing your resources, it's not that bad."
good,"If you don't mind the hours, the reward is great. They have a no return policy even if you turn in a 2 week notice and worked well. I left to take a daytime position, and when I tried to return they wouldn't do it."
good,The management team is great and inspires confidence makes you feel appreciated. I have enjoyed my time with the company. Many opportunities to further my skills and grow within a great company. My skillset is constantly growing and evolving. My bosses push me to look at things differently and present things in an analytical way that is aesthetically pleasing.
good,"Enjoy my job everyday, but looking to move on to something else."
good,"Overall, it is a great place to work.  There is always something to learn, which keeps you focused and engaged in what you are doing.  Typically, depending on the location, you are specializing in different markets (painters, furniture finishers, etc.).  Co-workers are generically pretty easy to get along with, and everyone is readily available to help you with anything you may need.  The hardest part I would say is the customers that you sometimes deal with, but that is  to be expected with any customer service position.  Overall, some of the people you work with and deal with are the best part."
good,Fortune 500 Company that pays very well.Great Leadership at the top of the organization.
good,"A typical day would be selling, tinting, and stocking paint.  I learned good computer skills and a good work ethic.  One of the best parts of my job was getting to work with some friends I know.  The hardest part of the job was working long hours sometimes and dealing with rude customers."
good,"-	Interacted with customers in a personable and knowledgeable manner to provide quality customer service "
good,Good company for job advancement as long as you work hard and can relocate.
good,"Day to day duties include mixing paint and filling orders. Management is like any other in sales, a lot of pressure to grow and make sales calls. Co-workers are the best part of the job, and the hardest part is the long hours and mediocre pay."
good,"good job picking orders fast pace a little bit, but not bad job once you get use to it."
good,"Awesome. It's a great experience, and anyone looking to be a boss should get involved with them."
good,Worked  with good people and learned most of my warehousing knowledge with this company. Fast paced work environment and the hardest part was unloading trailers in the summer and smelling the paint fumes.
good,"help customers, stock shelves, mix paint, more customers, more shelves. "
good,"This is a great company to be apart of. Offers outstanding benefits, great aura of people to work with, and flexible scheduling. This also a very secure opportunity as well."
good,"A great place to work starting out in the financial industry. Everyone is very helpful and supportive if you have any questions or need help with anything. Very good company for advancement if you are willing to relocate, possibly to another state."
good,An excellent company to work for. Management is committed to helping you learn and advance yourself if you are motivated. The hardest part of the job is dealing with dissatisfied customers and the best part of the job is helping customers.
good,"Oportunidade a cada dia para crescer e trazer resultados. Aprendemos dia a dia a lhe dar com as dificuldades fazendo delas uma oportunidade para melhorarmos nosso trabalho. Hoje um funcionario motivado e com o suporte necessario e capaz de realizar um grande trabalho com grandes resultados. Somos como uma familia, passamos a maior parte do tempo juntos e √© necessario um ambiente de trabalho positvo para que bons resultados possam acontecer, sozinhos n√£o chegamos a lugar nenhum. A parte mas dificil do trabalho e quando n√£o atingimos nossas metas. E a parte mais agradavel e quando chegamos ao final do mes com todas nossas metas batidas, nossos objetivos alcan√ßados nos mostrando que quando nos entregamos ao nosso trabalho com dedica√ß√£o e compromisso os resultados acontecem naturalmente."
good,"My job included helping customers, both DIY (do it yourself'ers) and Contractors. In addition to helping them decide what they'd need for their project, I would tint the paint they needed with our machine. Once all was said and done, I would then ring out their purchase with the cash register. When I was not helping customers, I would be stocking the shelves and putting away inventory."
good,Sherwin-Williams has been great so far. Assistant Managers ork 44hrs per week and the job could be very rewarding
good,"The Sherwin-Williams Company, 150 years old in 2016, has a strong company culture embedded in its employees. The compensation and benefits are fair, and the opportunities for advancement are plentiful. I am very proud to work for The Sherwin-William Company."
good,"When I show up in the morning my delivery orders are usually ready to go. I deliver my orders and come back to the store and help out around the back warehouse and deliver more orders as they come in. All of the co-workers were great to work with all were very friendly and task oriented. The hardest part about working here is the pay, I need a full time job to support myself and they just don't have a lot of full time work available with their company. The most enjoyable part of this job is the customers and contractors. Those people make my day I feel like most of them are my friends more than customers."
good,"This was definitely a fun and exciting place to work. I learned a great deal from my managers and work was very hands on so I was able to be very involved in operating the facility. Unfortunately, there were a lot of internal issues that needed to be addressed."
good,"entrar a las 8:30 am llegar registrar mi hora de entrada, luego tenia que llevar la camioneta a cargar gasolina, regresar despues limpiar la sucursal, acomodo de mercancia barrer trapiar, etc, despues me davan la ruta de entrega, y a entregar el material o a entregar facturas o a cobro de las mismas , a visitar las fabricas esto era por la ma√±ana y ya en la mediodia , era llegar y tenia media hora de comida, y en lo que salian las otras rutas de entrega atendia clientes, mas acomodo de mercancia, y me davan el la otra ruta y hacer lo mismo mas entregas etc."

good,Was a very good company to work for. Opportunities for advancement are available. Benefits package is spectacular.
good,"Although starting at the bottom may seem a little rough in any line of work, upward movement in this company is a great possiblity! As long as you're willing to put in the long hours and keep up a possitive attitude against constant customer critism, (not always that bad) there are constant growth opportunities within this company."
good,"For anyone looking into finding a work place feeling like a 2nd home, this is it. The company pays for training its employees, always finding ways to motivate them."
good,"My only problem was I wish I stayed picking orders, because batch making messed with my health. Overall if I could go back I would. The company itself was an great company"
good,shift workers work as a team and support one another.  management has a lot of outside activities for employees including summer family picnic at area amusement park and holiday dinner.
good,"I miss working at my job, wish I was back at work ..I like helping the customers in the types of paint that were needed. I like the hours for P/T, pay was okay, management was fair."
good,"Sherwin Williams has a fast-paced environment, full of something different every day.  My job consisted of procuring supply, service and raw material orders for the campus.  Management are very supportive of their employees.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with."
good,"It was a good place to work great benefits ,need better pay for what we did. There a lot complaining about customer and other things. I was treated unfairly on the incident that took place,and i was set up to get me from there,there was know hard part about the job,the most enjoyable part  of the job was coming to work.these is all I want to put down. thinks for letting me work there. It was a good place to work with job secret,have no bad thinks to say about these company. The fun things about these was going to work and delivering product to other company and meeting other people."
good,"Its very hard to get fired without a real good reason, I know this cause I've worked with some horribly underqualified people. "
good,"Good company to work and start up a good caster. "
good,had to learn quickly and not make mistakes. a typical work day started at 7am with customers waiting at the door. took large orders over the phone and at the register. we would challenge each other to see who could do the most sales in a day.
good,"There was never an unbelievable amount of work that needed to be done, but there was always something to do. This was nice because you could come in any day you work and be ready to do something, rather than dread walking in because the workload is overwhelming or there is nothing to do."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Sherwin Williams. As a job right out of college, it was great to get some management experience. They also match on 401K which was great."
good,"Very fast pace and hands on. Multitasking throughout working in a commercial location is a must. knowing how to communicate properly to cater to customers needs. Also picking up languages taking a couple of classes could also benefit. The workload can be a lot from, opening credits accounts, Ordering truck shipments, Setting up delivery orders, and Locating the right product for a customer to use. Product knowledge is a must learn, preferably at a quick pace. Knowing product sales numbers also benefits greatly with customer fluctuation. I've learned plenty of skills of a future contractor, or even the business side of things with pricing and making sure customers satisfactory is met, and fair. Overall the company is great, but I feel my time with it is to departure."
good,"If you like to work quickly, and deal with contractors, paint products, and home owners, this place is for you!  They are great working with your schedule and there is plenty of areas for growth and movement."
good,it‚Äôs good if your really into learning about different paint textures of paint from basic to top of the line paint you also learn how to mix paint sos it‚Äôs a fun experience
good,"good place to work, lots of room to grow."
good,I had to fix mistakes of management when it should not have been my problem however I understand that they were very short staffed at the moment and the manager was fairly new at his position. I would have probably really enjoyed it had it not been for that.
good,"A typical day includes tinting paints and stains to customers needs and laying out color palettes or picking out colors for residential or industrial jobs. "
good,I would recommend this company to anyone applying in the retail industry. The hardest part of the job was learning product data sheets on the numerous products they sold.
good,"Good place to work in IT. Not so much on the ""cutting edge"" of technology, but general use of widely-accepted, mature development tools and technologies."
good,If you don‚Äôt have a degree it‚Äôs almost impossible to advance. Two years with the company and only made it to full time. Great place though. Great for students.
good,My problem was that I did not have enough computer skills. I have 33 years working in the Gambling and did not use a computer very much.Also sold cars and worked as a porter and driver. Also bartended and worked at many licquor stores.
good,"Offered excellent customer service, handling customers inquiries about paint products, complaints and billing questions."
good,"I love working here due to the atmosphere, at first it is difficult to get accustomed because the regular contractors don't know you yet. Once you have product knowledge and the regular customers trust you, working here is nice because you feel comfortable. In my experience, I felt appreciated by the regular customers who call or come in to look for me, we built a relationship and they understood that I had experience. Walk in customers who appreciate your work are also a plus, sometimes they need a little guidance with colors or products and they seem to to be happy to receive advice. I understand that the reason I am successful at this place of work is because I have previous paint experience and am bilingual, I truly think that if I didn't have this then I would find this job difficult."
good,"Good company to work for."
good,"Interview has not difficult, drug test and background check [they use AI so don't lie] took about two weeks from Drug Test, however we had a hurricane in between.  Trucks are new clean and well maintained; as a driver you deliver - Sales makes up the order, you load the truck and go"
good,"Lifting of five-gallon pails and cartons of four single gallons in a cardboard container can be challenging if not in good shape, at first.  Managers are fair and treat people well at all stores."
good,"Great place to work people wise and decent opportunities for advancement, but will take a lot of heavy lifting and involvement mixing/tinting paint. 50%-60% will be spent cold calling existing and opportunity accounts."
good,"Easy place to work and great place to work. Management was great to work with for any problem you might have. If you work hard there are tons of room for growth with in the company,"
good,Good place to work and learn how to stay productive. Good place to learn to use a Point of Sale system and how to interact with customers. Much of my customer service skills were developed here.
good,The typical work day was going from the store to multiple locations to drop off or pick paint from other stores.  I had a great experience and good atitude there.
good,I was in a place where my financial situation was not getting any better so I chose to branch off &  looking into information and then speaking to resources that can help me start my own LLC
good,Meeting customers and helping people find exactly what they need. Learned a lot and added so much experience with customer service. Manager was awesome and you can be sure to make a career.
good,"would recommend "
good,Great benefits & lots of opportunities for advancement. Upper management is willing to help mentor employees who seek promotions. Sherwin Williams invest into training and advancing their employees.
good,"I‚Äôm retired and started working at Sherwin-Williams part-time.  This SW store goes from slow to very busy.  It‚Äôs hard to learn the computer system & that‚Äôs frustrating, but the managers have been patient and helpful.  They know it takes more than a few weeks to get competent entering paint orders.  So far so good..."
good,"There is a reason that they provide you with a uniform. The powder gets everywhere. It was by far the dirtiest job I have ever had. It stained your shirt, your socks, you hair, everything."
good,"At Sherwin Williams the environment is what you make it. There is a lot of opportunity for growth and each individual store is operated a little differently, tending to their employees and customers."
good,Retail location with good advancement opportunities. They help you move up in the company really quickly. Great pay and benefits as long as you're you're a hard worker
good,"Decent company. Very relaxed, pay is decent. My problem is over 40hrs doesnt pay overtime. So I demand 50+hrs a week. Hardly more then 51-52hrs for hourly drivers you would think summer would be busier. Well it is. Problem is that the bigger orders the stores place the less stops you have on your trailer due to weight. The less stops you have a day the less hours you work.. winter is when they can get 6-8 stops on your truck and u can easily get a 11-13hr day. Summer is more like 3-5 stops a day. (7-9) hours a day if u milk it.. benefits are awesome, pension is nice, 401k is awesome. You can pretty much start anytime u want along as stores get there stuff before closing at 7-730 as I said I'd rate them a solid 3.5/5 stars. If overtime played into effect they'd be a 5/5 stars hands down"
good,Sherwin-WIlliams was a great opportunity to pursue a career in management and retail. They provided good benefits and opportunities to advance. They provided opportunities for professional growth and job advancements.
good,I love the company but i need career advancement; they offer this but i need a degree which I‚Äôm about to obtain in order to advance from even the simplest of jobs.
good,My typical day as a delivery driver was to make sure all our customers and contractors got their paint and supplies to their job site. The work culture was laid back but the hardest part of the job was sometimes you have to lift pallets of paint buckets onto the deliver van. The most enjoyable part of the job was how nice the managers and co workers treated each other but all the stores managers and employees knew how to work as a team. If I had a chance in going back I would. I loved my job at Sherwin William.
good,Sherwin-Williams is a fantastic company to work for. This is a company that will provide you with whatever kind of growth you desire.  I started as a young man in need of a job and it was not long into it that I realized I was fortunate enough to have created a career not just a job. That speaks volumes about the people and customer base you get to work around.
good,"Being the largest paint company in the world meant something to be proud of working with Sherwin-Williams. A typical day at work is more of the same from my previous work employment in that everyone has the responsibility to come to work on-time and as-scheduled because coverage in this kind business is very important inorder to meet customers demand, their expectations and the consistency of the quality of work that one should produce and deliver including the products to be sold to customers."
good,Working at Sherwin-Williams let me experience working with both homeowners and contractors so the pace felt fast but was fun speaking to everyone.  It was frustrating at times to deal with some holier-than-thou contractor owners and if I had proficiency with Spanish it would have helped a bunch but nothing was too unworkable.  Management was easy to get along with since there were few employees at my location.  Other stores would sometimes ask for help with a shift or two so I was able to work at a few different locations than just mine.
good,"great workplace, amazing environment to work in, co-workers were great, alot of overtime to be had, loved the free lunches we would get for working the weekends."
good,"I was heavily involved with DOT and steel fabricators also large industrial projects in a number of markets such as Pulp and Paper , wastewater, military , power generation ."
good,"I‚Äôve enjoyed my time with Sherwin-Williams. However, it‚Äôs not the life for weak people. In-store positions are physically demanding. One must be assertive and personable with customers."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Sherwin-Williams. A restructuring left me 'homeless,' otherwise I would still be working for them. There is a little bit of a boys' club, but that's in pretty much any workplace. I would go back to work for Sherwin in a heartbeat."
good,I loved the job just when they started working 7 day a week it was exhausting but great fast past work I loved that hopefully I can get back in there.
good,Tive a oportunidade de aprender e crescer profissionalmente e aprendi com todos que fizeram parte dessa grande empresa.
good,"Excelente empresa, con beneficios en todos los √°mbitos"
good,"A good place to learn the fundamentals of management. This includes inventory, personnel management, and sales management. Lots of opportunities to move up in the company."
good,Feliz de haber trabajado en una empresa de ese nivel
good,"I worked for Sherwin Williams for about four months and within that time I did not feel like working with paints was the right fit for me. I learned how to mix paint, I was usually assigned to unloading supplies pallets, rearranging paints according to their brands, I learned a lot about paint products (what to use them for depending on the project, helping customers pick out paint colors, cleaned the store (bathroom etc.), entered paint orders manually in the computer to then process and mix the paint, would deliver the paint, and would assist customers with their purchases to their vehicles."
good,"The job is fast-paced and very detailed oriented. You must give great customer service and keep the store clean and stocked. Unload two weekly trucks for store stock and special orders. The skills that I learned were: customer service, matching paint colors, different paint products, how to apply paint for different jobs and tasks. Management is very helpful for leaning the job and how products are used for different jobs and they also get their hands dirty just like the rest of the staff. The hardest part of the job is when the store is under staffed and the store is filled with customers and you want to give great customer service but there is a contractor who needs five or more matches that backs up the process. The best part is seeing a customer leave with  a smile and a compliment about their service."
good,Working here definitely has a little bit of a learning curve. You have to be quick on your feet mentally and physically. There is a random array of situations thrown at you all day everyday and if you‚Äôre not practiced in product knowledge you‚Äôll have a difficult time making sure a customer leaves happy and ready to paint. Luckily SW has you train and read through products to learn; but most managers have you learn everything on the spot and when it is thrown at you. You learn as you go basically.
good,The job can be physically demanding at times. You have to be able to lift heavy items by yourself. But I learned a lot about management and construction.
good,"I have learned so much from my time at this company, the people are great, and very helpful. I love coming into my job everyday. The hardest part is upset people but you get them everywhere."
good,"Una muy buena y linda carrera, aunque una estructura muy rijida, no permitia muchos cambios"
good,"good stability, good benefits, ability to advance in company pretty quickly, steady income, learn good skills that can transfer, are starting to diversify, wanting to include more women"
good,"I do not want to leave a review. however this screen won't go away till I put something down"
good,"Um bom lugar, boas pessoas, mostre servi√ßo e se dedique"
good,I worked at Sherwin Williams as a part time employee for about a year and a half. The store I worked at was very fast paced and all products I had to learn on the job. My managers were very helpful as I constantly was asking questions about product until I was comfortable helping customers independently.
good,good place to work if your looking for a steady fast pace job. Management wasn't really that good between 1st and 3rd shift due to lack of communication.
good,"So fun and productive, very fun very productive I loved working there and going to work was so fun I also had fun working there and enjoyed going to work."
good,Expect to work when you arrive as it is a productive place of employment but there are expectations of all personnel. Yes there is down time but don't come in expecting it. Summer is the busiest roughly May through October. Customer Service is key and taking care of our customers is how we get ahead. We are a huge team but at times can be competitive with other stores. Paid well for your position but once you move higher up the more that is expected to go with that pay and while that is expected sometimes it does not feel equal. The most enjoyable part by far is that everyday is new and exciting and that there is always something to learn.
good,Sherwin-Williams was a good college job and a fun place to work. It involved a lot of hard work and drive. My mentors were very encouraging. They could teach you a little more about the product you are selling.
good,"As a sales associate, working the storefront is the primary concern. General appearance, sales, and customer assistance is fairly standard. Becoming a keyholder means working on weekends, but Sundays can be slow in some areas (especially on football weekends)."
good,A typical work day would consist of showing up taking and placing orders for companies/ individuals. stocking shelves and unloading the shipments that came.
good,Boa cultura organizacional com clima agradavel para atividades
good,"I am just a sales associate, but it has really helped me grow my own voice.  I feel way more confident in my ability to sell a product since I began working there."
good,I enjoyed but let me leave and go find employment else where.   I had an over all work experience and to this day understand and have knowledge of vast coating knowledge.
good,"Nesta empresa cresci muito profissionalmente, tive orienta√ß√£o sempre que necess√°rio, empresa dinamica e comprometida."
good,"Though the higher-ups in corporate were unsympathetic, the store manager was always willing to work around my schedule, attempt to get me more hours when I needed them, and was very accommodating to my wants and needs (i.e. I have asthma, and was allowed breaks when the physical work was affecting it)."
good,"Fun and fast paced, usually always working. Need to make a minimum of 30 sales calls weekly, heavy lifting is required. Pretty independent when it comes to tinting paint and assisting customers."
good,"We typically worked on projects related to implementation and maintenance of ERP systems for the plant, which offered me the opportunity to learn manufacturing and supply chain processes."
good,"There are only two real problems at Sherwin Williams; they don't pay nearly enough for cost of living, and currently new hire drivers are paid roughly 20% less than new hire inside employees. Drivers are tasked with the same duties as an inside employee when not driving, so in essence you are doing the same work but getting paid significantly less money to do so."
good,was a good place to work always something to do. had the opportunity to meet quite a few people in my short time there. I just needed a full time job.
good,Typically you are mixing paint and making sure that the sales floor looks up to par. You are also workong on stock. I learned about customer service and my work ethic. The workplace was good and allowed for you to grow and understand the company/ paint industry more in depth. It is a fantastic place to work at.
good,"Very physically demanding, training is thorough. Most individuals have been with the company for years and are willing to assist you in learning. Not for everyone."
good,"Always had a huge rush of customers in the morning. Helped me to build some multitasking skills, as well as sense of selling skills. I would always try to up-sell the customers and help them with any questions they may of had. Made several sales calls and worked with the Sherwin Representatives with working out pricing for contractors."
good,"Each line competes with each other against other shifts."
good,"This review will be short because there isn't really anything to complain about working at Sherwin Williams.  This is one of the better companies I have ever worked for.  Management listens to the employees concerns about making the workplace better."
good,"Everyone‚Äôs experience is different, depends on the manager and your coworkers and customer base. The company itself is the best I have ever worked for. 401k is matched at 6%, company stock, tuition reimbursement are great."
good,"Excellent place to work for, nice management, and nice co workers"
good,"Typical work day: I set my own schedule, customers are booked in my calendar and I go assist them with color pallets for their project: whether it is a home or business property."
good,not many fun days just came to work and did my job wasn't very hard and didn't take a lot to work here. it was slow most days and boring. didnt have new customers.
good,Sherwin Williams promotes the majority of management team from within . It is a great place to understand the culture of excellence. Inclusion and Diversity have been the drivers in the past years.
good,"Management was great, gets super busy in the mornings, you have to be able to lift and move heavy stuff a lot. Not enough hours or team members. Pay not that great for all the things you have to do..."
good,"This was a nice place to work, but extremely difficult for a woman in management. Contractors would rather work with a male salesperson. "
good,"I was a part time sales associate. I loved my job, my manager and the work. He allowed me to be creative with my Interior Design degree and I worked hand in hand locally with contractors. However they wouldn‚Äôt give me more hours when I was going to school to get my BA to go through the management program and had to quit, I had just had a second child and couldn‚Äôt afford being only part time. Shortly after someone else got a management position with no education which I was told never happened. That was upsetting. But it is a great company to work for!"
good,"typical day at work - something new arises everyday."
good,"S-W was an exciting place to work. Had a lot of fun, made hundreds of connections, and a few friends for life. I'd recommend it to anyone whose looking to move up in a company. Especially if your willing and able to relocate across state, country, even continent."
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in to about 30 customers and mixing different paints for certain customers , knowing them by name getting everybody in and out as soon as possible. My managers would help when i didn't know or didnt understand or just wanted to know how it worked. Hardest part of the job was just loading and unloading the paint."
good,"Empresa multinacional, organizada de grande  porte"
good,It was a good time and good pay with easy work. It was a good place to work and good people. The training was easy and fast. For the most part everyone was a decent person  to work with.
good,"I didn't like that they wouldn't give more hours at times but overall, it was a fun place to work. I learned a lot working there. It's a good place to start working if you're in school like I was."
good,"They use the latest technologies and agile methodologies."
good,"Good place to work, just be prepared to work A LOT for a fixed salary. I enjoyed my staff, and I enjoyed the customers, but it becomes mentally taxing when you put in 60-70 hours with resulting pay staying exactly the same"
good,The manager was hardly ever in the store and would blame his mistakes on others. Co-workers were good to work with it made the work a lot more enjoyable.
good,"Was a good experience, just wish the upper management would have been easier to work with and not play favorites. Had planned on working there for 30 yrs."
good,Sherwin-Williams was a great place to work. Very competitive atmosphere. Could be stressful at times but management cared and had your back. Unfortunately I lost my job from a buyout. Job security is best within the stores group. If a buyout occurs and you are in another branch you could be cut.
good,"Empresa Multinacional de grande porte no ramo de tintas, focada no crescimento no mercado imobili√°rio e industrial."
good,I worked for SW for 16 years but saw some Corp changes I didn't like. Got an offer from another company and left. Still miss much of what SW had to offer but some of the corporate stuff began to weigh on me and many others.
good,Manager was great and position was fairly good. Lots of physical work if you're a driver. Enjoyed the closeness of the coworkers and the teamwork that is used.
good,Sherwin Williams has great leadership from the executive level down to the store level. The benefits are some of the best in the industry and the company is still striving to improve.
good,I would have stayed but the heavy lifting was crazy and my subordinate males were always gone for delivery.  Seems they had been there so long that's all they wanted to do.
good,Working for Sherwin Williams is a great opportunity to work with amazing crews while still being able to balance work and life at the same time. Also Sherwin  Williams has a family oriented atmosphere.
good,Working there at Sherwin William`s made me better at life. Everyday i met new people (business People) I enjoyed of finding my self at 19 years old...
good,TRuuuuueeeee it was good enough for me. worked three days off four days worked four days off three days. Pay was good. Lay off season was probably the only thing I didn't like
good,"its hard work, long hours and pay is not competitive but the company takes care of its staff, creates a fun workplace with helpful senior management. Very sales focused company, you must meet quotas and budgets."
good,If direct management wasn't as great to me as they were I would not have stayed as long as I did. Overall it's not a bad job but it doesn't pay as well as they should and upper management is horrible
good,I was lucky to work for the manager of the yr in our district. He really helped me learn about the company and pushed me to get better at the job. Even though we work our butts off he made it fun.
good,"Great Company! I loved working there. You learn how to Sale, product knowledge and simple aspects of Supply Chain. The culture is to work really hard and then there is a time to relax."
good,"Sherwin is a great place to work, a very friendly environment from the co workers and regular customers are easy to get along with. Its an adjustment learning all of the products but its not impossible."
good,"Great company to work for, learned communication skills and customer service skills. Built customer rapport. Excellent service provided at an acceptable price"
good,It was 80 percent of the time .I had to retrain an entire team of associates every other week. They grew and became better was given the opportunity to do it my way.
good,Great job truly miss it. Should of never left.  Worked 44 hours a week had Sunday and Mondays off. Culture was great working with customers was fun. Nothing to hard maybe not being able to get the match correct. Working with the customers was the most enjoyable to me.
good,"A typical day at work was productive and fun. I had an excellent management team that helped me learn my responsibilities, improve my abilities, and groomed me for management within the company. The workplace culture was overall very good and I would consider working for this company again."
good,I set my own hours each week as an in-home color consultant and only need to work 2 weekend days per month. My manager is proactive and great at setting expectations.
good,I like the place. has its own gym. a cafeteria. people were nice and i love the paycheck. it was an easy job. I didnt want to let it go. Just something happen that i had to.
good,"easy to get along with other employees, not very stressful, days were short because i was part time employee so the day was over before you knew it. overall enjoyable"
good,"A typical day at SW would start from 8-6, I have learned a lot about myself working there, the management wasn't great but given my knowledge on how to get the job done I got through the day and helped my coworkers. It was a very busy work place and fast paced so made the day go by fairly fast, the hardest part about the job was costumer complaint on paint products but was able to handle the situation with giving them a few tips on what to do. The most enjoyable part about the job was some of the coworkers I have known growing up with."
good,"Sherwin-Williams/Valspar is a fun job.  I call on Lowe's Home Improvement stores. "
good,Poner ojo con los supervisores no todos son buenos y responsables y los encargados de tienda externos tampoco son buenos
good,"I worked here as one of my first jobs , had a greet team to work with and had a lot to learn about the company . This is a job I would recommend for someone who loves doing paint jobs"
good,"Every day is pretty much the same, every now and then you get thrown a curve ball but it's a retail job, you pretty much have to go through the motions and deal with customers like any other place. I learned alot about paint and stains. The hardest part was my manager, he had seniority so they made him a manager after 18 years with the company but was a very bad manager. The most enjoyable part of the job is that we don't stay open past 7pm on most days so you can still go home and be able to do stuff."
good,Good company to work for.  Sometimes can be a bit hectic and not organized well but company is always eager to promote within the company and help people.
good,Great place to work. Fun and productive atmosphere with great coworkers and management. It was overall one of my best work experiences. I enjoyed every department that I worked in.
good,Strong management that were good at coaching. They have many classes to improve a persons skills. Great retirement and other benefits. More travel then they indicated.
good,SW is a great company with strong ethical practices.  Moving up outside of the department can be a struggle.  Each department is very compartmentalized so not much cross training.  SW treats their employees very well and is sensitive to family lives.  They promote volunteer work and charity and back it up solidly.
good,plenty of employees and really good people working in this company through the whole world nice experience I will definitely come back if I have the chance

good,I enjoyed working here .good culture . Jon is close to home. are flexible hours. would love to continue working. Good boss .Good Benefits . love to work.
good,"Looking back on the internship, I am very fortunate to have had the opportunity to work there. Great experience with great people. The culture is close-knit family like mentality."
good,Typical job that required me to provide customers with the best and most welcoming service I could. Most stressful part of the job is handling a rush of customers while operating the store by yourself. I learned various management skills and even trained many employees due to my 3.5 years there. Overall it is a great work experience.
good,I enjoyed working at Sherwin-Williams and I also had great people that were employed along side of me. I left my part-time job at Sherwin to pursue my academic/athletic career.

good,Analyzing daily sale reports and managing employees work hours. This job is requiring physical work and heavy lifting and  most of the people work here are under the pressure to meet monthly sales goal.
good,"Tinting paint, tending to customers and fulfilling their needs and wants. Trying to decide what colors they need. There is a machine that does it for you you just enter the numbers. Some of the buckets are heavy."
good,"My managers really cared about their employees. As long as you work hard and are willing to learn, they have your back. The stores I worked at had only around 5-6 employees total, so it kind of felt like a family. Honestly, if I had had a way of becoming full time to help with bills I probably wouldn't have ever left."
good,"Friendly environment , alot of angry customers. I learned how to mix paint , hardest part is unloading the big trucks. The manager is a good guy , i enjoyed the meetings and free food."
good,"great company, benefits & salary. Culuture between stores and store management are great. Its a physical and mental job so get ready to work. If you do good you will be rewarded. Upper management is very disconnected from the regular day to day paint sales."
good,Extremely fast paced work environment. Pays well for those looking to succeed and work hard. Corporate environment is in Cleveland so be prepared for a bad location in HQ.

good,There is never a slow day here because there is always something to do. Your either taking care of customers or restocking and even calling customers to rekindle relationships with them to get them in the store buying.
good,"Its a great company to work for just because of the benefit package ie; 401k, pension, health,vision, dental, but as far as salary, pay sucks unless you are a manager or sale rep and above. the people who literally break their backs for the company are taken for granted and get moderate pay for it...."
good,not a bad place to work rode around in the ac all day and had it pretty easy bosses were ok never had a problem with other employs just didn't like driving the box truck
good,I enjoyed working for Sherwin Williams Automotive Training Center as the facility coordinator. My co-workers were all friendly and easy to work with. This is a great company to work for.
good,"i enjoyed the commercial aspect of the paint industry, making huge paint orders and not having to ring up orders or worry anything about the end of the sale was a plus"
good,"Its a good place to work, there are days that you have to manage the store by your self. Management is not that great , but everything depends on your manager."
good,Get a batch ticket and perform the duties on the batch ticket. You mainly mix different liquids with different pigments while following the instructions provided.
good,"During the day, I worked hard. I was about to learn fast and maintain a consistent work pace. This was a job that I really liked being at and wouldn't mind to go back to."
good,Fast paced and sales oriented. Competitive salary compared to other retail jobs. Advancement is easy if you are willing to relocate. Good people who seem to genuinely care about you.
good,"One of the best companies i worked for high advancement appertunities, great trining, very good work environment good pay very good career company, endless advancement choices."
good,"Help fill customer orders"
good,"Fast-paced, hard-working environment. Without proper compensation, I would encourage one to work at a slower store. Managers can find their time revolving around making sales rather than customer satisfaction (or worker satisfaction) but speak your mind and show what you are capable of and you will be recognized."
good,I enjoyed it here because it understood my schedule as a student as well as having another job. All my coworkers were very nice and understanding.The compensation was good as well.

good,"The manager was new once I started working there, and this was towards the end of peak season for the company. So there were some growing pains however she handled it like a professional and made every day the best that she could."
good,The company seeks and recognizes potential in people. They love to promote from within and are anxious to give their employees every opportunity for advancement.
good,"The retail side is difficult because often times your stores are understaffed.  The corporate side is better but unfortunately the headquarters are in Cleveland, Ohio."
good,"gosto de trabalhar com objetivos pois sou focado, nos crescimentos nos pdv e sempre trabalhei com publico e em grupo"
good,Great place to start out with. Much growth in the company. The relocation can and will happen so it can be an inconvenience to some. Lots of hours and responsibilities.
good,"Great experience for learning business and retail management.  Excellent pay and benefits.  "
good,"It was a good job for a while. I was getting tired and my back was hurting from lifting the mop bucket and bending down to empty the trashes. Overall, it was a good job."
good,"Had my internship over the summer, very beneficial as you get exposed to building relationships with contractors.  Its a structured internship that lasts 10 weeks.  Majority of that is in store buy you are exposed to outside sales as well."
good,"This role is very challenging and can be very stressful/depressing. The biggest complaint is the office setting. It has very little natural light. It is your typical cubicle-style office. Management was very awful in the beginning. That changed drastically and the team dynamic has improved greatly since. The company is great and there are many perks to working for SW. I work in their world HQ in downtown Cleveland, OH and it is very neat to see all the different individuals from all departments on a daily basis. Unfortunately, I am trying to propose and must relocate as a result. Otherwise, I would stay with the company for at least another year or two before reevaluating my career progression."
good,This was a good place to work but the pay was not enough for the work performed on a daily basis. The hours were long and you have to be ok with working weekends and holidays.

good,Enjoyed working with numerous departments and people which made the job experience diverse.  There was always something that I was learning that helped in my advancement to sales analyst.
good,Everyone at Sherwin Williams is nice and the clients who come in are always up for a chat.  Warm and friendly atmosphere and great community.  Would most likely think this is the right job for most people who want one.
good,"Running a Sherwin Williams is very strenuous and requires a lot of your time. They set high expectation and and expect them to be met. They pay well. As a manager you never have enough help around the store and are incapable of keeping up with the demand, Because Sherwin tries to reduce payroll by such a high amount."
good,a great place to work at if your going to school and need a part time job. would like to have worked full time if given the opportunity. the management is great and really flexible with hours.
good,"Great company to work for, loyal to the brand , always focus on training employees , also they were always looking to introduct more products to the end user"
good,"Great company, great co-workers, great locations, many locations opening rapidly, great benefits, great discounts, community involvement, advancements, profit share"
good,"Order picking, loading and unloading trucks, putting away product for storage. People I worked with was most enjoyable part of the job. Had a high production rate for each employee to keep your job."
good,"Its a good place to work, because its not that stressful. The paint buckets are heavy though. There is a lot of room for advancement and management trains you to advance beyond that of a sales associate."
good,Great Place to work. People are friendly and always willing to help. Great choices for lunch. Change happens often. Only negative is you have to find your own parking.
good,"Otima em empresa , oferece otimas oportunidades para seus funcionarios"
good,I started in these company a few months after getting a honerable discharge from the navy. I was hired full time and worked a few hours more if needed. My weekly schedule was not a bother.  I was able to learn more into the company and its goals.
good,"Very good work place! Just sometimes they like to over load your van and work shechules!"
good,Sherwin is a well run company that gets very hectic at times. When I worked for them there had been some pretty rough weather and lots of people needed paint for their homes. Throughout the day you are making orders and helping customers. At times it can be overwhelming but at the end of the day its pretty rewarding. I loved my coworkers and management and I was always treated fairly.
good,With the help of my manager and field representatives I leaned how to organize myself. I also learned how to prioritize what's important from what I could do later.
good,"My knowledge in paints was not too great, but the management staff made sure you learned about all the product fast and easy. Great Sales Associate experienced was gained."
good,Sell more and everything else works itself out. Tough to change the culture or identity of a poorly managed store.  Figure out your good accounts and grow their business
good,"Balanced between Meetings and Management."
good,"A good company with good benefits. They are so big that unfortunately with further growth and buying of other companies comes staff reductions. When this happens it would have been nice to protect the SW employees first and foremost. These are the people that know the SW culture that have helped build the brands, that are loyal, and that want to be part of the team."
good,Sherwin Williams has sustained well over a century of strong sales growth driven by a dedication to being an industry leader in product development and a keen sense of what is expected by the end consumer.
good,"Great team to work for . Business culture. Has a great 401k and an awesome work, life balance company . Sherwin Williams has great training and offers promotions within ."

good,"good job for part time work. typical day consists of mixing paint, taking orders over the phone, and maybe delivering paint to certain contractors in the area."
good,"Worked through college before getting my internship. Loved the culture and the environment, I would recommend the company to any one who is looking for a job and or a career"
good,A lot is asked of the managers at a typical SW store. The hours are long and the doing more with less is a common theme. It is a great way to get your feet wet in the business world right out of college since there are so many aspects of business that you are subjected to.
good,"Great work place with chances to advance. There is some room to move up, however everyone will eventually be stuck.  With out a 4 year degree it was impossible to become a manager or advance past the position I held.  This was frustrating because watching new college graduates, be hired into a position directly above your own and be your boss was not great.  No matter how much you knew and how good you were with the company if you do not have a 4 year degree, you better get use to no as experienced workers being hired in to be your boss and at the same time not know anything about the company."
good,"checking the sales floor, restocking shelves in front and back warehouse. mixing paint orders, via e-comers, over the phone or in store. custom matching, inventory counting. Assisting guests with paint color selection, providing product and paint information. Advertise sales, cleaning, processing payments, setting up accounts and cash handing. I learned a lot about the paint world I had been with the company I could be a painter myself. I had a very diverse group of crew members. The hardest part of my job was the consist ant lifting of products"

good,SWP&M is a market leader in protective/marine coatings. It is increasing turnover by penetrating EMEA markets with great success. The company is the largest paint manufacturer in the world.
good,"It was not that bad if you were trained to deal with customers and get them the product they needed. However, this was sometimes difficult because there are so many product (paint), etc. that it was often difficult to keep up with the amount of customers that came into the store on a daily basis."
good,"Great company, awesome benefits, work culture was 100% rating. Great communication among employees and training is provided to help you manage your job efficiently."
good,"Mixing different chemicals to make paint"
good,"daily learning new products, applying what you learn, supportive team, great leadership. putting away heavy products was tough, worked with great team"
good,Some days are long and difficult. While some are easy and enjoyable. When a customer comes into the store. They are looking for someone to fulfill their needs. You have to not only know the different products but to also sell it to them. You have to build a relationship with the customer and do what you can.
good,Great company to work for in long term as a full time employee. Good work life balance. Most people in management are considerate and helpful. They provide support and guidance.
good,My typical day at work I start with walk in customer helping them with questions and product suggestion. Constantly stocking making sure product is filled. As the day progress more contractors come in with paint matches and buying more product to complete big jobs.

good,"You work with a lot of people during the day. Winter is slow but in the summer, days are very fast paced. You get to meet a wide range of people from contractors to homeowners. The jobs is a lot of fun because there is a variety of things to do throughout the day. It's a satisfying feeling when a customer lets you help pick the colors for their house and when you see paint you mixed used on local businesses."
good,a typical day at work can be very busy. I learned about how different types of paint work for different situations. Management was nice. Co-workers were nice as well. Hardest part of the job is learning about all the different products and their uses. The most enjoyable part of the job is tinting paint.
good,"This is a good job if you don't mind getting your hands dirty and a little heavy lifting. "
good,the work was ok. room to move up in the company if the work is put in. corporate was always to deal with ad reasonable. no complaints.
good,Not a bad company . Good management just becomes repetitive after a whie.possibly a good place to work if you need a part time job or are in college. At least from my experience.

good,"Hours are great if you are willing to work weekends. If you are trying to move up within the company, expect it to take a long time. They are very slow with this process. Great management that doesn't micromanage. Work environment is great. It can get slow at times, it's retail, but overall, I have been satisfied working here."
good,"The day starts with freight, usually takes about 2 hours to complete. Our customer service skills are constantly tested with difficult questions and hard to reach customers, somehow we manage to prevail."
good,Buen Grupo Humano de trabajo.Se trabaja con buena camaderia entre pares.
good,"Aqui se trabaja con un agenda semanal, no tenemos oficina los representantes de ventas, tu organizas tus visitas a los clientes, tu jefe inmediato te habla todos los dias,para ver si necesitas o en que te puede apoyar, todo lo resuelven por medio de correos, casi no hay relacion con los demas representantes de los otros territorios , solamente cuando un cliente de afuera viene a trabajar a tu territorio si el representante te avisa o tu contactas al cliente se comparte las comisiones al final del a√±o al 50%, la mayor parte de la relacion es con el gerente de la tienda, con el hay mas comunicacion para programar los pedidos de los productos en base a las necesidades de los clientes, si hay apoyo por parte de tu gerente y mucha confianza, pero en al area industrial en general si esta mas complicado su proceso de pedidos o productos ya que no se tiene todos los productos que cumplan con las normas de pemex y c.f.e. la parte dificil hay mucha burocracia en resolver y tomar desiciones ,las areas de apoyo tardan mucho en dartes respuestas es, mas el desgaste interno que con los clientes."

You work one-on-one with contractors whose job depends on your ability to provide them with what they need.  Whether it be for a small job, or a large scale job that takes hundreds of gallons to complete.  Quite honestly, the hardest part of the job isn't really that hard.

good,As a lead driver my route is never the same two days in a row so my job is not boring.  My job allows me the freedom in which as long as I get my route done in an efficient order with exceptional customer service then I am allowed the freedom to be my own boss.  My hours of work fit almost perfectly with my life outside of Sherwin-Williams.
good,"Excelente ambiente laboral, buenos beneficios de empresa, y buena comunicaci√≥n entre √°reas."
good,"Sherwin Williams is really a great company to work with, especially if one enjoys working with or selling paint. I learned more about paint and stains this past Summer than I ever have! From upper management to store employees, the work environment was always enjoyable but fast paced. Dirty work is included like loading and unloading inventory, cleaning paint spills, and even mixing colorants into our products on a daily basis. This company promotes almost entirely from within which I thought was very interesting. I enjoyed the experience I got this past Summer with a fortune 500 company."
good,"I honestly enjoyed the job, and the people there.  Unfortunately, all stores in our district were under terrible management."
good,"I would say, when you get a task and you complete the task on time and get a huge round of appreciation. Compliments from your Boss is always a good thing to happen and it wont happen so often"
good,"great work life balance, advancement opportunities, very physical job. meet a lot of great people. they want you to succeed"
good,"Maintain store budgeting, Tend to customer's needs (Paint, Paint Machines, Supplies...etc.), Develop and maintain strong relationships with employees and customers, Run the store when manager is absent."

good,"Paint is not a sexy product, but you can make a very healthy living for yourself a a company that is at the forefront of it's industry."
good,"Good place to work if you don't mind getting dirty and working hard. You have to work both the front of the store, (handling customers), as well as the warehouse. Fast paced, good pay, I was able to put in extra hours because we were short staffed, but each store is different. They carry a lot of products, so there is lots to learn. The managers I've had actually did work around my school schedule as well as with things that came up, such as doctors."
good,"it is a high demanding, fast pace job. Friendly environment. Co-workers make you feel welcomed and make you feel like a family."
good,Its a lot to learn but its worth it. Managers I worked for were very good.  Stay dedicated in this company and you will go far.

good,"Good place to work. Good staff to work for. It gave a person there own responsible job. which you had to do."
good,Good company to work for. great pay.  there are advancement opportunities but get different answers from different people.
good,"As an Assistant Manager, my day typically consists of mixing and matching paint, assisting customers both retail and commercial, speaking with customers over the phone, answering questions and taking orders, and paperwork.  90% of your day will be spent on your feet, but the days are usually busy and move quickly.  Management is completely dependent on the store, but most of the managers I have worked with/come into contact with are professional and courteous.  Co-workers are almost always part time, and often high school and college aged individuals.  This is one of the downfalls of the job, as these individuals are more prone to mistakes, poor customer service, and usually have time restrictions.  The best part of the job is the customer interaction and the relationships you build with co-workers and customers.  These can be lasting, especially with customers, as a large percentage of them are men and women you will see every week, sometimes every day.  This is a job I have enjoyed, and is a company that for the most part takes good care of its employees."
good,"The Sherwin-Williams Company is an American Fortune 500 company in the general building materials industry. The company primarily engages in the manufacture, distribution, and sale of paints, coatings and related products to professional, industrial, commercial, and retail customers primarily in North and South America and Europe. The company is mostly known through its Sherwin-Williams Paints line"
good,Kirkland Sherwin- Williams was always very busy. As soon as you clocked in until you clocked out the store was very busy. I didn't know much about paint at first but in less then two weeks I was on the roll. I had great co-workers that would help me if I was unsure of something. Over all Kirkland Sherwin-Williams is a great place to work.
good,"I enjoyed my two year plus time period with Sherwin Williams."
good,"Had a very good work experience at Sherwin Williams Automotive, would recommend this company to friends in the industry."
good,"Great place to work, starting off the first couple weeks is difficult because of the product(s) learning curve. Overall, great place to learn about paint products and it was a fun place to have an internship and work during college"
good,Working for Sherwin Williams was a great opportunity to learn and demonstrate many of the skills I have learned and acquired.
good,"The Comercial-Industrial Professional Coatings Divisions of the company the is growth area of the company and better area to develop a career for oneself, which equates to a higher income,"
good,"Great work environment, down to earth nice people, blue collar hard working employees. Great employee discounts, good communication between management. Overall a great place to work for a lifetime."
good,Working for this company is wonderful. There is more of an emphasis on sales then anything else when you are in the management role.
good,"During my 9 years, I was mainly responsible for development and growth of the international sales, joint ventures and licensing operations. I lead highly professional teams both Cleveland-based and international-based. For past 9 years, I worked and reported to highly professional executives (Global President and Senior Vice President). I also interacted directly with top executives (CEO, COO, and CFO) of Sherwin-Williams organization, during the annual operating plans. "

good,I learned most of my equipment operating from this job. The bonuses were the highlight of this job
good,"All areas of retail sales, multiple areas for advancement. Classes available for training in all areas. Great benefits."
good,"I've worked for Sherwin Williams for three years. I love the people I work with, I have the best manager and assistant manager. However, the clientele is less than desirable. The hours are also hard to live with (6:45-6 shifts 4 days a week and weekends). They do offer a lot of advancement opportunities, but it's very hard to get out of a store. The hardest part about the job is being a woman in a man's world. I get no respect from the customers that come in, especially the ones that have been in the business for ten plus years. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with a great staff. We all get along and hang out outside of work. I've made best friends at Sherwin Williams."
good,Functioned as a team even on the worst of days. Fun atmosphere that customers enjoyed.
good,Good job out of college for sales experience and face to face customer service
good,great company to work for. great compensation for employees.

good,"After interning in the field of interior design, I fell in love with the working with people with the same creative edge that I have. It allowed me to bounce ideas off one another and create a masterpiece to present to the clients."
good,"The daily requirements of this job were mixing paint, color matching custom paints, unloading stock from trucks, and dealing with contractors."
good,"Pulling orders, answering, phones. Mixing paint, driving/delivering products to customers. Unloading and loading of freight carriers."
good,Challenging environment with problem solving for Customers and Contractors and support from the co workers. Most enjoyment is when a customer needs are met.
good,"Very physical days. Moving, mixing, shaking paint containers up to 80lbs in weight. You need good oral and written skills as well as being a good listener. You deal with both wholesale and retail customers, some who know what they need, but most who do not. Company has good advancement opportunities and excellent health retirement benefits. Open seven days a week so the hours can be difficult at times."
good,"Nice place to work and good pay. As management , make sure you have time to work extended hours and travel frequently."
good,"The job is professional, but at the same time much more laid back then other places I know of. The people here are more than co-workers, we are like a family. We all have fun together outside of work and since each store does not have too many employees, you know everyone on a personal level."
good,"- Retail atmoshpere"
good,"typically at work I help customers as they come in and place orders, I have learned manager  production, my co-workers are great to work with."
good,"There are a lot of pros and cons to the company. A typical work day consist of giving great customer service to paint contractors and DIY's. As an assistant manager I also helped manage a team of great people that work together to accomplish the goals of the store. I learned how to be a great manager and lots of leadership. I would say that the hardest part of the job would be that you must manage your time wisely in order to run the operations of the store properly. On the other hand, the most enjoyable part of the job is helping  customers, learning about their projects and listening to the final appearance."
good,A typical day would start off by handling day to day activities that you learn through the training that is provided for you. You will also have your regular customers that come in on a weekly basis and you also have DIY customers to deal with.
good,"You answer phones and take orders over the pone and in person, make 100 gallons of paint a day. Learn new things everyday paint knowledge and how different products work. Certain stores have different types of managers, majority are well trained, clean cut, very knowledgeable. My co-workers are a great group of people, get along well with each other, hard workers. The hardest par of the job is staying a head of all the orders so they are all done in a timely manner and not getting backed up. The most enjoyable par of the day is knowing you are caught up and can joke around and have a good time while working."
good,"A typical office day as a Recruiter involves sourcing, interviewing and hiring candidates to run million dollar business units for Sherwin-Williams. Out on the road, I build relationships with colleges, hiring organizations, and our employees."
good,I would go to the store and order merchandise and when to visit customer and prospect customer's to star buying form S.W.
good,"It was a good job, you had room for growth within the company if I were interested. The co workers were good, work environment was fine. I just wanted a better job with a future and creativity."
good,"Every day is different, learn the ability to multi-task and stay positive, but must like retail environment."
good,A typical day at Sherwin Williams consist of driving and delivering paint to various clients on a daily basis and providing the best customer service possible. The management and co-workers are friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was lifting and carrying various items up stairs in the heat. Most enjoyable was meeting new people.
good,No tempo em que trabalhei l√° era maravilhoso s√≥ sai devido a oportunidades de crescimento que n√£o tinha na minha area
good,Good company to join if you have a mind for business. Lots of opportunity for growth and advancement all over the company and the country.
good,"‚Ä¢	Oversee and managed daily store operations, provide a clean and organized environment"
good,I was able to satisfy customers needs by estimating and recommending paint quantities and products for specific project needs. The customers are always put first and you are educated in and encouraged to increase product knowledge with continual testing and certification. Also to satisfy customers bringing paint to job locations was a frequent task entailed in my job. I learned various sales techniques while working at Sherwin-Williams and enjoyed learning how to deal with both individual customers and various companies. The management team was very helpful and encouraging.
good,"Visitaba arquitectos,parques industriales,maquiladoras.Aprendi a diferenciar las pinturas industriales de las arquitectonicas.Mis colegas me apoyaban mucho para realizar la venta de las pinturas.La parte mas dificil fue la crisis  mundial del 2008.Lo que mas me gusto las relaciones y el trato hacia los clientes"
good,I would spenf my mornings getting contractor paint orders put together and in the afternoond i would go out and make sales calls on exhisting and new contractors
good,"Worked as an intern at a store. Great structured summer program focusing on learning the company, their products, and the career path that they offer. Lots of hand-on work. Enjoyed the dynamic environment and fun atmosphere with the management team and the co-workers."
good,"I am a hard-working driven individual gaining comprehensive experience in budget analysis, sales growth, selling skills, time management, and leadership. I am known for my high performance level, excellent customer service, utilizing available resources, reliability, and positive attitude!"
good,"God atmosphere, very fitting to my needs in a workplace. Hardest part is understanding some foreign customers."
good,"I like my present job but I am now training my third manager. I have run the store for four months at different times. I enjoy doing paperwork, matching up purchase orders, doing schedules, training part time employees."
good,This was a great place to work. The management was great as well as the work/life balance. The job advancement is not great. You are unlikely to get promoted to an asst. manager or manager if you do not come in through the college work program.
good,"During my time at Sherwin-Williams I was able to acquire problem resolution, and project management skills that are applicable in both the office setting as well as manufacturing."
good,"A great learning experience, growth within the company, excellent benefits and oppurinity"
good,"everybody is laid back and fun to be around with. Management is awesome, most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know different people at the different store locations."
good,Credit Manager-Collection (numerous awards)
good,"I was a coordinator in the flooring division. I enjoyed my job.Great hours, pay was fair, days off I enjoyed, the reason I am no longer employed with Sherwin Williams is due to the slow down of new construction, forced the company to conduct a staff reduction."
good,"I was at Sherwin for four years and liked it very much, only thing was pay, eventually i would have to leave for more money but overall good company to be with"
good,"eh aprendido a manejar inventarios, calidad en el servicio, objetivos de ventas cubiertos, etc."

good,"I trained, motivated, and evaluated personnel to assure adherence to quality service, product specifications, and customer satisfaction."
good,This is a very large company to work for and they offer many opportunities for advancement. They also have a vast amount of resources for each level of employment to utilize while on the job.
good,They have a good manager trainee program that helps you grow within the company. I was promoted to assistant store manager within 2 years. The pay is good and the retirement benefits are decent.
good,"Une entreprise ou il fait bon travailler. Le professionnel ne d√©borde pas sur le priv√© et les avantages horaires sont tr√®s int√©ressant."
good,"Good management and good support from my team mates during some particular hectic situations, I recommend for everyone that will have a good experience working over there and it improves your career life."
good,Es muy buen trabajo y ademas son muy preocupados por sus empleados en capacitaci√≥n y horarios
good,"Easy job to hold. Do the work, go home. They pay fairly and it‚Äôs easy to be there. I never had any complaints with the jobs, but it‚Äôs hard to feel like it matters for someone looking foreword career wise. There‚Äôs nothing glamorous about the job, but it‚Äôs a good job and incredibly stable."
good,"The Sherwin-Williams Company is definitely not an easy company to work for. The work is hard, the hours are long, and the business is tough. But overall is a very rewarding company to work for, and the benefits/compensation is great. If you are who they WANT you to be, you can go very far."
good,Hardest part is the heavy lifting you do here. Youll be lifting 5 gal buckets of paint all day. Work can get tedious at times but fairly easy. Management is cool. The good thing is I never seen anyone upset at this location everyone seems to be pretty cool with each other for the most part. You get a lot of the same customers so you'll get the same orders most of the time. Point of Sales system takes some time to learn especially Product sku and delivery order process.
good,"Empresa muito boa de trabalhar. Se eu tivesse oportunidade , voltaria trabalhar l√°  com certeza."
good,"The managers are smart and know what they are doing, very flexible in terms of getting the hours/ time off that you want, and help provide a good working environment."
good,You can always stay busy. Not an easy job but you are compensated.  Always overtime for those looking. Advancement possibilities and long-term employment.
good,"The job can be frustrating at times, of course that's any job in retail especially. The company offers lots of great benefits. Fairly easy to learn even if you know nothing about paint."
good,I like that there isn't much favoritism and gossiping like in a previous job that I had. The company does not go out of it's way to get you in trouble and leaves you alone with your contact being your manager. The downside that most hourly workers have is the lack of full time positions.
good,"Sherwin Williams has been a great company to work for. If there were more hours to receive and a chance for me to move up easier then I would love to stay with the company, but as it is, hours have been drastically cut back and my income unfortunately doesn't exceed my bills. For that very reason, I am left no choice but to turn to other companies for employment."
good,"Great company, coworkers were fantastic and the team I worked for were also a phenomenal. there were small hick ups here and there but at the end of the day it got fix. My first job and left with a great experience."
good,Very nice people to work..good benefits and bonuses.We are small team but mighty.Unfortunately the company closed and missing all the people that i worked with.
good,"a great place to grow, and work, but quite hard to work unless devoting all time to it -- provides a safe, and challenging place to grow in a company."
good,"Great coworkers, people from all over the world work for this company, but its a very friendly and respectful environment."
good,Great Benifits hard to find any where else competitive pay. Can get busy and stressful but in the end everything works out. Employees are happy good environment for students.
good,"advanced within the first 6 months of employment, friendly co workers, lots of training to get to know everyone in the company/district, overall very amazing company to work for."
good,Sherwin Williams is a good first job out of college. Teaches you a lot about yourself and customer service. Requires a lot of hard work and team work to make overall goals.
good,"I worked with sherwin for 2 years. I advanced quickly from an assistant manager to a store manager (6 months). It can be easy to get bogged down by the day to day operations. As a manager you work salary and contracted for 48 hours a week. Sometimes I miss 40 hour weeks, but if your store does well the bonuses are well worth the extra time put in. There is room for advancement but you have to check meet all the goals management throws at you. New accounts are a big deal but sometimes unrealistic"
good,"Working on your feet all day, working in the warehouse often (possibly with a fork lift), lifting 45 lbs-55 lbs of paint constantly everyday. Take orders over the phone often. Occasionally picking up paints from different store locations."
good,15 years ago I walked into a Sherwin Williams store as a temporary employee through a third party agency.  At the end of that first day I was offered a full time job.  The rest is history.  I have worked my way all the way to sales.  You can too!
good,Great place to work family like atmosphere. Key holders and part timers are not paid nearly enough considering we share all of the exact same responsibilities as assistant managers. Opportunity for advancement is rare; full time sales opportunities are highly unlikely.
good,Lots of advancement at the company. There are many branches and many opportunities to work around the country. Good customer base. Helpful managerial staff.
good,"Working at Sherwin was very exciting and filled with opportunities to learn. Some of the things i learned at sherwin would come with me for the rest of my life. Meeting with builders, contractors and first time home owners give you a change of pace every single day."
good,Good place to meet new people and expand your contacts and learn about products. The job offers advancements from within and let employees have first picks
good,Great Company w/ opportunity if you want it.  Be aware of politics.  HR teams need to once again care about the employee vs. supp. bad apples in mgmt.
good,"Great place, great management. Better for college students, too much driving for too little pay for me personally. Otherwise i gladly would've stayed there."
good,Great place to work temporarily for a summer job. I was able to work 40 hours a week for the summer Monday through Friday. Labor intensive job that has very little time to rest.
good,The only reason why I had to quite was because I moved. Other than that it was very good job. People were all very friendly. everyone wanted to help and that was new and refreshing
good,Work hard and you can create your own destiny. Sherwin Williams has great career advancement opportunities. Great benefits and 401k options. Over 4200 stores in the US to choose from.
good,"I enjoyed working for Sherwin-Williams and got along with my managers and team. I liked how the opportunity for advancement was there. I could have definitely advanced and gone into the management training program with my degree if I wanted to. The hardest part of the job was unloading shipments of paint, especially at a high-volume store. My favorite part of the job was the feeling I got when I helped a customer and gave them solid advice and recommendations."
good,"It was a great place to work with plenty of caring and compassionate managers, however the labor aspect of it does get intense, especially when it comes to filling orders of 100+ gallons of paint on big jobs. It does all take a toll on your back and more if you're not careful about proper lifting procedures"
good,"The flexible work days allow you to have a great work life balance. If something comes up last minute, management is great to respond and allow you to work around your schedule."
good,Employee feedback should be implemented and be revised by middle managers to individual stores to help structure a better more Sophisticated personal as the company grows. Sherwin is such a great company as a whole but can greatly benefit from regular surveys on lower level managers and below
good,"Was not for me, had to match color and keep work space clean and to make sure that the floor was stocked. I also worked on creating a potential sales tool which was a apart of my intership"
good,"My manager became my best friend. good place to work. Super relaxed environment and bosses  work with you when making the schedule."
good,"- Focado em vendas, todos os colaboradores tem que facilitar para o depto de vendas."
good,Sherwin is a great place to work that really encourages its employees to grow with in the company especially if your willing to move. East texas especially is great with its employees
good,"It can be a very active workplace, which is nice. It's not sitting at a desk all day and you are able to build relationships with customers. Schedule can be rough due to it being retail, working later than most careers. While it is similar to the same thing everyday, it is not. You do something different most days, talk to new people everyday, and have the opportunity to really learn about products."
good,"A typical work day at Sherwin Wiliams involves interaction with some of the same valued customers on a daily basis, helping them find answers to their questions related to our paint products. I've learned a lot in terms of how to find the core needs of a customer and how to provide a valuable customer experience. Management does well in a hands off approach in allowing it's employees to do well for their customers."
good,I am grateful for my experience with this company. I gained invaluable information for myself and customers. I was able to take my experience and help others. There were many things I was able to excel at. I received an overall coverage of retail and customer service.
good,"A typical day at Sherwin-Williams was pretty fast and busy. At Sherwin-Williams I learned how to interact with customers and help provide them with the materials to complete their day to day task in a timely manner. I have also learned through training and on the job task the differences in products, colors, paint and hazardous material. The management was great, responsive and reliable. They gave us clear rules and regulations to follow for our own safety. The workplace culture was cooperative. All employees helped each other complete tasks. The hardest part of the job was trying to help customers who come in with no knowledge of the material they need to complete their desired task . The most enjoyable part was the painters, customers and contractors who you form bonds with."
good,"Great experience if you're good with moving heavy pails. Store managers were all very kind and cheerful. Learned all about different applications of paint, resins, stains and many other industrial and commercial paint products and their uses. As a delivery driver I was hauling flammable and hazardous substances occasionally, strapping them down and loading/unloading pails or skids to major contractors, construction sites, and even other Sherwin williams locations."
good,"Sherwin Williams does not require you to know anything about paint when applying for a Sales Associate position or when going into the Manager Training program, that said, there is a large amount to learn about.  Associates learn everything from applications of paint, to preparation, and specifications.  Initially this is very overwhelming when considering that there are at least 20 different lines of paint including the industrial products.  Exposure to these and work load will vary greatly depending on what store you work at.  Some stores are placed and leaning towards simple DIY, others can be more Contractor oriented.  Some stores fill 200 gallon orders regularly throughout the day, other stores may see a 30 gallon order only once a day.  It can be hard but once you overcome this hurdle it can also be rewarding.  You will get to know other stores very well since inter-store communication is common,  it can be from confirming inventory or requesting for a product to be sent over.  You will also learn about and recognize local contractors, many of them come several times a day.  The enjoyment can come from recognizing a regular, knowing what job they're working on, making what they need and knowing that it is the right paint for the job."
good,"Company does very well for itself and sells a high quality product. Enjoyed working there a lot until the ""economy issue"" of 2008 when hours and benefits proceeded to change and there was less help around which created a stressful work environment. Otherwise it was a good job."
good,"Pros:  Competitive salary in low cost of living region.  Good job security for most positions (sales is the exception).  High ethical standards. Team-focused results"
good,Great first job. You gain a great of deal of knowledge and experience. Management okay but like every corporate job they have you a string. All in all its a Good first job.
good,"when you open the store up it gets busy right away. Sometimes it may seem like it was crazy, but the managers had everything put together and it was organized. When I worked at Sherwin-Williams i learned how to manage time."
good,"Very customer service based job, where you know almost every customer that comes in. "
good,"Great company and products but I wish full-time positions were available. Management at the Jersey Village location needs improvement but other than that, I enjoyed working there."
good,"As a Sherwin Williams employee, I learned very quickly, basically being able to do everything that my assistant manager could do, except for hiring other employees. Great company."
good,Empresa otima para trabalhar. muitos beneficios e muitas oportunidades ofertada.
good,"I worked in a very busy store and I loved how it was very fast paced. The company believes in promoting from within and training their associates. Had I not landed a job in the teaching profession which I was going to college for, I would have never left. Definitely a fun and challenging job."
good,I worked for the company for three years. The job was busy and most of the employees were happy with management. The management worked with me for raises and promotion.
good,"Good company to work for -- room for advancement/growth. Good benefits for full-time employees with flexible scheduling. Product knowledge of materials and techniques a must, but can be learned easily. Must be comfortable talking with both homeowners and contractors."
good,"Sherwin Williams can be a very good place to work. The people have all been awesome, the job pays well for what you do, and you have good job security."
good,"No matter what position you end up getting in the stores, you will be lifting heavy 5 gallon buckets of paint. Also, if you would like to move up in the company you have to start at the very bottom."
good,Working at Sherwin was a good place for me for a while. I did want more hours and pay but I could not achieve that cause of my managers boss. My Manger was an incredible boss and when he left I followed him to my new current spot at my new job.
good,"Without a certificate from a four year institution, the company will not allow its existing experienced, competent, and loyal employees to advance their career by entering the managerial level. I struggle to understand the requirement and emphasis of a diploma and not the experience necessary to perform the duties associated with the managerial level. The skills required to be a successful facilitator do not come from a school and a short training program, however supplementary secondary education is, it comes from experience in the field and the knowledge that grows when an individual becomes invested in the processes, opportunities, and goals of the company and the individual store. Because the company does not want full time positions that include benefits for the uneducated, they rely on part time employees who do not have the option for benefits. These are not just college students. These are adults navigating a convoluted market that values manufacturing efficiency over employee well being. "
good,Sherwin Williams is a great company to work for as a whole.  Painters can be difficult at time cause of pricing and customer service.  Sherwin Williams needs to hire more full time employees with the amount of business they produce.
good,Good job in sales/customer service.  Was able to learn a lot from people within the company.  Offers many opportunities to move up in the company and  provides many benefits
good,"A typical day at work consists of assisting contractors and DIY (do it yourself) customers with their needs for paint and related supplies and sorting through paperwork. I learned how to accurately tint paint and match colors in addition to sales skills in order to effectively sell the right product to meet the customer's needs. I also leaned how to effectively establish relationships with contractors through the use of sales calls in order to retain their business as much as possible. Management is very knowledgeable and has taught me a lot about how the store runs, including how to check inventory levels and how to request product when inventory is low. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unsatisfied/upset customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to effectively help people with their painting needs because they are counting on you to give them correct information and product and it is my job to ensure that they leave satisfied and feeling sure of themselves."
good,This is a great place to work if you are currently studying or are in need of a part time job on the side. I was able to go to school and work here thanks to their flexible schedules.
good,"Our store had one of the highest DIY customer bases. Constantly dealing with customers who didnt know what they wanted while attempting to fulfill contractor orders was frustrating but always kept you busy. Time tended to go by quickly because of the ""always feeling behind"" element of the job. I wouldnt consider myself a great salesman but rarely had a customer walk out without product in hand. I think this is because the people who shop at sherwin williams were already intending to buy your product."
good,"With promotion within the company, there are plenty of chances for advancement. You have to be a self-starter and able to guide a team. Likewise, how to learn on the spot."
good,SHERWIN Williams is a great place to work you can really make a career out of it if you try your best it‚Äôs not the easiest job but it does have its perks.
good,I enjoyed helping contractors as well as DIY customers choose the right products to get the best possible fish on their projects. The management was solid and I worked with great people.
good,"When people get hired at SW they don‚Äôt realize how hands on it is. If you do your job properly the company will acknowledge that. Get retirement plans, stock options, and vacation time that is given. Overall good company to work for."
good,bueno aprendi mucho de lo que es pintura para que los colores convinaciones manejo de maquinas y atencion al cliente
good,"When I first started at Sherwin I had no idea what I was walking into, I knew nothing about paint but I was lucky enough to have a great manager who worked through everything with me. I have grown a lot within my years here at Sherwin, and have learning many things that I will carry with me, such as the importance of cold-calling, building and maintaining relationships with clients."
good,"Overall I loved my time at Sherwin Williams. The managers are very helpful, the products are interesting and apply to most people, and some of the repeat customers were great. Only thing I didn't like were some of the contractors that were awful to deal with."
good,Great place to work part time and great opportunity to advance in the company. Not a lot of benefits but that is expected at a part time job like this.
good,"The tasks for outside sales were very monotonous, but it was very interactive. A lot to do in a workday kept the job relatively fun. There was a lot of autonomy with the work."
good,"Great  experience, I've learned a lot with Sherwin-Williams. I have great co workers. also a lot of opportunities to grow, and move up the ladder. Professional company."
good,"SW is a great place to work. The work is fairly easy once you learn about the products. The outbound calls required of management is my least favorite part, but you're only expected to do 50 per store per week. Good benefits, decent pay, good chance for advancement."
good,This job teaches a lot to an individual. Good cutomer interaction and customer service experience. Very diverse work place culture. It is easy to move your way up in the company. good connections and communications within the neighbouring stores
good,Learned all there is about paint
good,I enjoyed being on the team at Sherwin Williams. I worked at the Bellevue Location and the Shoreline as a delivery driver. The management was very supportive and professional.
good,Very understaffed and stressful at times but the work is easy and customer interaction is great. Good culture here and very supportive. Managers want you to succeed and are willing to teach.
good,"Overall, Sherwin Williams is one of the best companies I've ever worked for. I just prefer not to work 70-80 hour weeks, which can easily happen in smaller stores as the manager. They provide GREAT training and excellent benefits and they do what they can to accommodate you despite the long hours."
good,Opportunity for multiple levels of advancement. You are only limited by yourself.  Excellent benefit package. Company has opportunities worldwide. There's a multitude of positions available for many different skill levels.
good,"Empresa agrad√°vel para se trabalhar, pessoal disposto a compartilhar conhecimento e colaborar com outros setores."
good,"I never expected to enjoy my work in my store, but I have found aspects of the job I truly love. Even though my degree is in a scientific field, the pay opportunities if I were to continue on in the company are so tempting that I have accepted that I could make my work at Sherwin a career. For those interested in management and sales, this company is the perfect place to work. I am always amazed how sales-driven the industry is and how the company is willing to pay those who are good at achieving high sales."
good,El trabajo esta muy bien proporcionado para cada empleado y cada quien esta en su area de trabajo.
good,everyday was challenging working together making new product  we work as a team to accomplish what needed to be done in right time frame and had time to clean up for a fresh tomorrow
good,"Some times busy, other times a little slow. Managers can become over whelmed but everyone is very nice for the most part. Must be able to lift and not be afraid of getting your hands dirty."
good,"Lots of on-the-job training, fellow employees were accountable and helpful. Room for growth, but there's somewhat of a hierarchy. Competitive pay and plenty of good customer and employee relationships."
good,SW is a great company to start & build your career. The benefits are great and they have a competitive pay structure for management. It is truly a first class company to work for.
good,a typical day for me was delivering paint and supplies to job sites and houses or businesses. I learned how to communicate with businesses and search through new builder layouts. The managers were very laid back and easy to work for. as were the other employees. the hardest part of the job would be if you had to carry a lot of paint across a very far distance which does happen from time to time. The most enjoyable part is working by yourself and driving from place to place.
good,Great for people who have recently graduated from a 4-year university. There is a lot of opportunity for advancement within the company. Upper management is very helpful. it is a very fast-paced environment in store.
good,Overall not a bad experience but managers can really make or break the store. They are always pushing you to sale even though you don't make any commission of the sales. Work can be demanding sometimes depending on your store. I would say the hardest part is dealing with customer's that try to get free stuff and when you have to make a 300 gallon order by yourself. Most enjoyable would be the people that work there can really make it fun and worth the while.
good,"Great company with great benefits. If I didn't need to be home daily, I wouldn't be looking for a new job.Very driver oriented as well as a true safety first environment."
good,Great place to work and learn all aspects of business. You are able to make a ton of money if you put the work in. Work-life balance is compromised when you are going after big bonuses.
good,"It is a great company to work for, the problem is that since there are so many new stores opening up there is a lack of employment at many of the stores. Due to there begin a lack of employees it puts a toll on management in the store, meaning management has to do more hours then advertised. Being an assistant manager is a great opportunity and you undergo the needed training to become a competent Assistant manager. The hardest part of the job can be the demanding customers that come to the store(this will vary from store to store). The people that I have worked with have taught me a lot and are always willing to take a call if I have any questions."
good,I worked in a high volume store so we were constantly making and sending out orders. It wasn't always easy to get other things done and I really had to prioritize what was important and what wasn't.
good,I worked at a few different stores and drove for a while. Of course each store had its faults and problems but more were better than worse. Great benefits and stock options.
good,"My manager was professional but fun. We all loved working there. He was dismissed on a false accusation by the assistant manager at the time, caused some store drama. Everyone quit afterwards, store basically re-set itself. The Paint training and online training from Sherwin about home care and paint actually helps me figure out what's best for me and my future home. Good resources to know and have, good advice for friends and customers. Great job to have while I was in college, flexible but fixed during the summer so you could count on your hours with the occasional opportunity to take over an empty shift."
good,"The best thing about Sherwin Williams is that they promote 95% from within. The room to grow is immense. Also, if you're willing to relocate you can essentially work in any state you wanted to w/ relocation help. The Management Trainee Program taught me how to run a successful business from learning the operations of a store, financial management, & human resource management. The culture feels like a family because the store staff is small. So essentially, you have to get to know your team members and customer base. You will have good and bad days, but if you can create a positive work environment and the customer's trust you, you'll succeed. Work life balance can be a challenge if you go down a staff member, but other than that you're only required 44 hours a week w/ a flexible schedule (only open 7AM-7PM). Most of the District Management teams worked in the stores at one point or another, so they are pretty understanding of the struggles in a store. Network yourself and be a positive role model in the District and you'll get promoted!!"
good,I had nothing against SW as much as I did working with the home center staff.  Most were not prepared and I had the opportunity to move to a better position.
good,"Working for SW for a few short years since they bought out the company I was originally working for. Allowed over time, made 40 plus hours as an assistant manager. Sales oriented."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Sherwin-Williams.  I loved the recruiting position, but because of poor sales performances by the stores, the position was eliminated.  I was the first person in the position."
good,Job itself is fun and rewarding if you like a hands on job. Culture of the company is very good. Everybody gets a long real well in my district. but hours are a bit long
good,"Enjoyed working with all levels of personnel. Supervisory, middle management, management and VP levels all accessible for questions and concerns by all employees. Visibility of all department accomplishments and concerns."
good,"I conduct outside sales, so I create my own schedule. I have learned a tremendous amount about industrial coatings and the markets we serve in the last two years. One typically wouldn't receive this type of exposure in a role inside the store.  I am used to a culture grounded in teamwork, so being alone and unafraid has been a challenge. Furthermore, all of your sales counterparts have their own budgets to obtain, and do not stay in their lane in regards to selling to your customers. They and their direct leadership can be very selfish at times. All and all, it is a great company to work for. Strong brand, longevity, good benefits, etc; however, sales, I have learned, is just not for me. It doesn't fit my personality type or align with my values."
good,me gusta esta capacitando gente yo ago lo mas dificil
good,"I work with wonderful people.  It takes a little bit of adjustment at first, but the Sidney Sherwin Williams is a great place to work.  There is a lot to remember, but it is so relaxed in the off months that it is not a big issue learning the ropes."
good,The company is filled with great people and offers many opportunities for growth. The pay is great and the benefits make this business stand out from other work places.
good,"Sherwin Williams have many locations to choose from as a work location.  When I was living in southern NJ, the company was very amenable to my request to be transferred to the Edison location.  Although working at the small stores was enjoyable and walking in homeowners were interesting to assist, the workday went by very quickly working at the large Edison location."
good,"Every day includes a new challenge and a new customer with their own set of demands. This job definitely needs someone who is quick on their feet and can take on many jobs at once. The pay is great and the management is better. This was my first real job and it really prepares you for any job, because if you can survive this job you can survive anywhere."
good,"A empresa  √© √≥tima  de se trabalhar . Tem uma √≥tma estrutura , otimo refeitorio  os beneficios  s√£o muito bons ."
good,Like any other job it has its ups and downs but for the most part it's a Great company. They  cares about you and your well-being. A fun environment. With great people
good,"A fun job working with a wide array of customers from homeowners to professional contractors. Every day is a new day with a huge array of products to learn about, it keeps you engaged and hungry for learning new things."
good,Workplace environment is rather young therefore great employer for recent graduates and emerging leaders. Lots of advancement especially for participants in the Management Training Program! Fantastic way to fast-track a career for anyone. Welcoming of individuals redefining their careers in a new industry. Knowledge acquired can easily transfer to another industry or even one's personal life.
good,My typical day at work was greeting customers making sure they were well taken care of most importantly and scheduling appointments and taking phone calls for the manager. I learned that always satisfy the customer to the best of your ability and that's all you can do.
good,"This is a good company, management is also supportive, this is world's 2nd number company in paint industries i have learned so many things from here which are i never seen my oldest companies."
good,This is a great company to work for that allows a person the opportunity grow and travel throughout their career. I highly suggest this job.
good,"Dealing with multiple customers in a fast-paced environment. Answering a multi-line telephone and documenting customer orders and transactions. Processing multiple payments and handling cash. There is an extensive amount of knowledge to gain from this job. There are multiple tiers of management and that an entry-level employee has access to with proper requirements met. The job is incredibly labor-intensive, but the job security and full-time benefits are above average."
good,"You will learn a lot working for this company, usually great managers and room to grow. The hours are pretty flexible and the pay is also great. As a warehouse & in store worker I can say that I liked the warehouse a lot more."
good,Great company!!! I loved the freedom of being a driver. Dont have a manger breathing down your back the whole time. Pay is pretty good. Got pretty good hours as well. The company and sometimes contractors sometimes through like pizza parties or holiday parties for the employees.
good,"Fun and challenging work place. Great customers, good pace and great experiences in management. I would recommend this as a place for anyone who wants both a physical and mental challenge daily."
good,It can be slow on some days. My co-workers are pretty cool even the manager. the hardest part is lifting all the heavy things. Most enjoyable part is being able to just chill. Training is a bit fast. Only way to learn is to either teach yourself and repetition.
good,"Safety is extremely important at Sherwin-Williams. They give employee trainings on the importance of safety at work, as well as at home, which really shows that they do care about their employees. They have instilled such a great work ethic with me. I take what I learned there and adapt it to my jobs since leaving the company."
good,"I love where I work because its a great place to work at and the people are nice and friendly,Everyday you learn something new about where hear. The customers are is going and my co-workers are friendly"
good,"Sherwin Williams was a great place to work, loved all coworkers, loved the work I did,  we worked for 8 weeks on a data entry project in the color lab.  Several activities were invovled in using my problem solving skills. The hours were great, However, $9.50 per/hr was not enough income to pay my bills.  In addition, as a Temp. I was unable to receive any benefits.  Had to move on"
good,"challenging and fast pace working environment. this company was conducive to my skill set. the most enjoyable part of the job was learning the products and how they were applied in industry. management and work staff executed their duties in a highly efficient manner. the hardest part of the job is when we  were short staffed. this wasn't an issue, however, because of the professional approach of management and staff. at Sherwin Williams we wore many hats so this contributed to our ability to work through shortage of personnel."
good,Overall great experience and training to help in any future position. Sherwin Williams has a great culture and cares about their employees.
good,"La mia giornata lavorativa quotidiana consta nella ricezione di ordini e relative bolle vettore, preparazione del materiale, uso dell' AS0400 per inserire gli ordini nel sistema, gestione resi e richieste ritiro, gestione trasferimenti vs depositi."
good,A typical day consisted of preparing paint for contractors as well as interacting with customers.  I learned how to mix and shake paint as well as how to make sales calls in order to keep in touch with our frequent buyers.  The management style was laid back and it really allowed for us to get things done quicker without the pressure of rushing and making mistakes.  My co-workers were very knowledgeable and insightful.  The hardest part of my job was just being able to learn about all of the products in the store to a point where I was comfortable being able to sale the products to customers with no knowledge of them.  The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I played a big part in satisfying customers' wants and needs.
good,"Working with Sherwin-Williams the past three years, I have acquired more people skills than at any other point in my life up to this point. This has been very valuable in developing my problem-solving/communication skills. Dealing with many different types of people each and every day has given me the ability to adapt to many different types of situations that may arise."
good,Management is very supportive and the company provides great yearly training. It is a great work environment with great people.
good,"Good company, great pay, long hours."
good,A typical day was going in and helping as many customers as possible with any questions they had about anything we offered. I learned a lot about being able to help customers as well as patience. The hardest part of the job was learning everything I needed to to be able to ensure I could help customers as they needed.
good,"I began as a production Worker. SW training was hands-on. Expectation was that daily/hourly rate would be met or exceeded. Essential to understand all operations and be proficient at same. Always be alert to how the process could be streamlined to either provide for increased productivity or improved safety."
good,Sales and Management. Always learning and fast-paced environment.
good,"Take orders over the phone or email, pull the order and box it up for delivery. Check over all store reports and make sure the showroom is clean and neat. Great benefits and even better people."
good,"Beautiful, secure environment, but only worked on a part-time basis, therefore not enough income to make a living."
good,While working at Sherwin Williams the typical day can be pretty fast paced. Assistant managers have to learn everything from product knowledge to marketing and different business functions. The hardest part of the job is to deal with the problems from the different customers daily. The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships mad from different people on a daily basis.
good,"Sherwin-Williams was a great job where you made the best paint in the world.The management team stressed safety first and do your job  right the first time. I made alot of friends at Sherwin-Williams that were like family...The hardest part working  in powder coatings you can get real dirty and from time to ime the particles could bother your sinus.I enjoyed the people,the family-like working atmosphere where we helped  each other out to get the job  done,,also the healthcare and benefits..."
good,Sherwin Williams is a fast paced production service. I enjoy all of my coworkers as well as the relationships I have built with the customers. It is more like talking to family instead of consumers.

good,I learned a lot about the company and I was given a lot of tasks that strengthen a lot of my professional and personal skills

good,very good people and good workmanship good hours and good brakes not stressful at all and very good tool to work with
good,"This job was perfect for someone needing a flexible schedule and a little extra cash. The job is not stressful and everyone was very nice.

good,"Imoved up fairly quickly in the organization. I enjoyed who I met, worked with on a daily bases and there constant involvement with their staff."
good,Lay back busy and slow. Everyday learn something new about paint.
good,"If you love retail and people management, it is a great company to work for. They take good care of their employees."
good,"Working at SWP, you are obliged to learn about the products you sell if you are going to do your job well. When I first started, I would spend the slow time that inevitably comes studying up on well-organized data pages and reading the paint cans for application specs. After learning the products, selling them is easy because SWP makes a majoral share of the best products on the market, making touchup, replication of previously bought paint, and customer service easy tasks to accomplish."
good,Great company with nothing really bad to say. A lot of my fundamentals around how to sell to a prospective client came from here. Look to listen to the customer and are very pro customer.
good,"Sherwin Williams offers flexible hours, with knowledgeable and friendly staff. There is a major emphasis on customer service and store cleanliness. Veteran employees provide information on products and instructions/recommendations for correct product use."
good,"You get to learn lots of different skills and every day presents a new challenge. During the summer it can get pretty fast-paced, but it makes the day go by fast! Management was great where I worked, and they allowed me to try different things like forklift, deliveries, developing custom-stains, and accounts payable/receivable. All in all, a great job during high school/college."
good,It's a wonderful company to work for. I gain many wonderful memories and experiences. They handle all complaints very professionally. And they set you up with a 401k to help you with your future.
good,Networking is important to advance in your career here at Sherwin. Culture depends upon your division and your respective office. Great benefits and work-life balance

good,"Online classes Monthly,abt products and procedures. Asso&stores rewards, special achievements. Scale 1-10, 8.The Cons:FT may not be available  most stores."
good,"If you don‚Äôt have a college degree it will take a long time to make a career out of Sherwin-Williams. Some stores are a lot busier than others, some deal with primarily paint contractors, and some deal primarily D.I.Y. Customers."
good,"Sherwin-Williams is a very good company to work for. Management is strong from the top to bottom. There are advancement possibilities, especially if you are able to relocate."
good,"Overall, it is a straightforward job, especially for a college student like myself. The pay is low in comparison to competitors. My coworkers were great, but I know that doesn't hold for every location."
good,Learned a lot of sales experience. Fast paced work environment and upfront customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job was hitting your budget numbers every quarter.
good,Enjoyed working there. Meet a lot of new ppl especially the contractors and create a bond and friendship with them. Helping DIY customers is always rewarding when they came back excited about suggestions or the project went well!
good,"As an employee for 10 years at Sherwin-Williams I made many accomplishments. Gained very knowledgeable experience associated with paints, stains & wall coverings, as well as profit sharing & 401K opportunities. It is a company that will advance you quiet rapidly if you choose. I never applied for management as I was home & family oriented. The positions come with long hours (nights, weekends, & some holidays). They start employees out with competitive salaries, above minimum wage & offer raises once to twice a year based on your annual employee review & goals you have accomplished. Overall I would recommend applying for this business if you are looking for a job with longevity. All positions require heavy lifting. I chose to leave for several factors, and this was one of them. At this point the company has been a big part of my career choices."
good,"I love the people that I worked with at the time. "
good,"Sherwin-Williams is an amazing job to work with, however; due to not having an efficient number of drivers. Drivers get put under a lot of stress and it can be very taxing somedays. Though I have learned how efficiently work my routes and the time it takes to get to my next drop off and/or pick up. However, a driver's 'work flow' can be thrown off if a store does not have the product ready to be picked up. Besides that everything else is good and I would recommend others to work with Sherwin-Williams."
good,"Great company, amazing benefits, long term growth available. If you are will g to move around the con try you can accelerate you career quickly. 401k and stock plan is amazing"
good,"It‚Äôs a great place to work! They give you alot of opportunity to move up and get promoted. It‚Äôs fast paced, good money & great benefits! They are always hiring."
good,"Corp seemed to always make life for management living difficult to be quite honest. Environment is completely dependent on your management."
good,This is a GREAT company to work for. Flexible with schedule as well as taking care of their employees. It was fun meeting new people everyday and learning the culture of this company.
good,"Sherwin Williams is a great company to work for. As an assistant manager I work in a very fast past environment while prioritizing and efficiently managing multiple tasks at once. In my daily / weekly tasks, I supported all aspects of store operations, including customer service, marketing, merchandising, inventory and store safety. I also grew wholesale business by conducting effective sales calls. As well as managed the stores financial reports, credit and accounts receivable performance, scheduling and inventory control."
good,It‚Äôs a very good company. The people you work with can be difficult at times. Hard to fire bad employees. It‚Äôs a good company though. I learned a lot about sales.
good,I wnjoyed working at Sherwin Williams. It was a great working environment.i had plenty of room for advancement with in the company. I would definitely recommend working there and being a customer of theirs.
good,Having contact with upper level management is very accessible within the company. They always want to see their employees succeed by giving extensive training.
good,It's a good company to work for if you're a full time employee. I was part time so I didn't reap all the benefits the company offered. My manager and assistant manager were very cool!
good,"The people I worked around at Sherwin Williams were amazing, flexible schedules and I loved the job. If I was getting better pay I would of stayed, great company."
good,"The work was not difficult, my coworkers were nice and easy to work with, the company as a whole cares for its employees and there is plenty of room for advancement from within"

good,"I love working at Sherwin-Williams. There are tasks to do, but everyone does them well. We all enjoy each other's company. The pay could be better, but the environment overall is a healthy one."
good,"While it is selling paint, people need it, and always will."
good,I enjoyed how everyday was different and the relations you build with customers and staff. The company culture is noticeable from the top all the way down to the lowest levels.
good,Over all excellent company with excellent benefits and training.  I just didn't prefer the retail environment.  Not accustomed to working holiday hours.
good,"I learned so much about customer service, shrink control, importance of promotion etc..... I reccomend anyone starting out to check with sherwin williams. The job teaches the importance of competition. So many positive things i can say.  sherwin williams believes in volunteering! I was able to paint a local day care during my time. Im so proud to call sherwin williams my first job."
good,"My time at Sherwin Williams paints was a special time in my life and one I will always reflect positively on. It was my first job while in high school and I ended up spending seven years with the company. I had the luxury of receiving thorough training from experienced managers, who went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable during the training process."
good,When you are picking orders you have to pick over 26000 or 27000 pounds per day depending on the place you are working in. You need to be in pretty good shape to do that.
good,"Comfortable workspace and flexible schedules, open and diverse workplace, I'm happy working for Sherwin-Williams they are an educational company to grow and learn new things."
good,"Its a great place to work, environment and all. Do your best in everything you do, and make sure you do your job thoroughly and do everything you are asked to do, and you'll do just fine"
good,Sherwin Willams wants people to grow from the inside up. They rather give opportunities to people who have been in the store then elsewhere. The company has a lot of money and benefits are top-notch. The retirement plan is amazing; they match your 401k shares.

good,Easy to collaborate with fellow employees on projects.  Everyone strives for the same goals and works together to achieve success.  It is easy to get the assistance you need from management to co-worker.
good,"I loved working for Sherwin-Williams! Within the year, I was moved to key holder with a decent pay raise! Usually 4-5 employees per store, and once there is open communication between employee and manager, you'll find scheduling to be very flexible as well."
good,"In my time at SW I always felt I could advance if I chose to put the effort in. Hard work, but I enjoyed my time there.  Your knowledge of the products and applications grows immensely due to the training you constantly go through."
good,This is an excellent company in theory.  There are very good leaders. It tries to assure that it is diverse. They show their employees that they care as a company.
good,"A typical day at work consists of selling paint to customers.  This includes small orders, such as selling someone a quart of paint, as well as large orders, such as filling a several hundred gallon order.  This job has really taught me the fundamentals of what it takes to be an excellent employee.  It has taught me how to work both effectively and efficiently.  This job has allowed me to sharpen important skills, such as time management, communication skills, and learning how to diffuse difficult situations between customers and employees. "
good,"Great company to work for, needs to improve the way opportunity is given to all employee meaning to be more diversify in giving promotion and advancement."
good,"This company has a major lack of compensation for entry and the next 2 levels of store personnel.  This would be a great place from most all respects of culture, products and benefits if they would be more competitive in the hourly wage provided."
good,I have learned a substantial amount in customer service through working here. Management provides us with a fun work environment and always are fair to their employees.
good,Working here was very interesting. You had always have to be on your toes and ready for what's coming next. Everyday is different. You never know what is going to happen.
good,"A good place to work: quick advancement and compensates employees well.  Jobs can be stressful, but you are rewarded directly/ immediately for your hard work."
good,"The Sherwin-Williams Company recently went through an acquisition phase. I do enjoy working with the company but things have been chaotic for a time (as expected). I would recommend this company to others as I enjoy the culture and the management. It is a very hierarchal corporation, top-down."
good,"Started out after I graduated high school. I didn't get full time when I first joined, but it was a great experience for me. I overall enjoyed the company and staff."
good,"This job had many pros and little cons, therefore I enjoyed my stay. Sherwin Williams company completes requirements for safety work and procedures, and it ensured the employees always were up top with their knowledge and skills."
good,My co-workers taught me a lot of Spanish because 90% of the customer base was Hispanic. It was a very rewarding experience because management was very humble and compassionate. They ensured that everyone did their part. Sherwin- Williams is a great starting position as an undergrad coming out of college.
good,"I was very happy with Sherwin-Williams unfortunately I just was not getting the hours that's why I had to leave. They do not promote outside of the company, it gives a sense of loyalty and a commitment to there employees and customers."
good,"Each day I sequence batches based on customer demand, which tells manufacturing which batches to prioritize. Due to regular forecast changes, the schedule is constantly reviewed and changed and there is consistent communication in regards to changes or updates made. It starts with the initial schedule, followed by manufacturing, approval from the quality lab, filling, and ends with the shipping of the finished goods. Team work is essential to ensure daily success."
good,"Great company fast pace."
good,Management program is very organized.  Compensation and pay is very fair.  Life balance is a struggle working weekends in management and was not consistent throughout the stores.
good,"The company is great. As a part-time employee you are giving stock options, 401K and paid holiday time. The work is physically demanding but it will keep you in shape"
good,Sherwin Williams is a fun place to work not to fast paced relatively easy work they normal get us lunch on fridays pay is good only issue I've had is the distance I work 33 miles from home each way so that's the only con
good,"Better pay or full time hours for drivers. The actual company is great,  from the work environment to co-workers in each store. The salary and full time workers have it great. Love the stock system.The only advancement for drivers is to convert over the store or corporate side."
good,"Non commission wholesale and retail sales. District managers are involved, but extreme upper management is no longer in touch with the stores. A fun work place depending on your contractors and employees"
good,"Great culture."
good,You have the opportunity to learn various areas of manufacturing because you're allowed to bid on different positions as they become available. The managers are not too overbearing and treat everyone respectfully.
good,"My management team is probably one of my favorite things about this job, second to the pay. I have been fortunate enough to be able to balance my school and my work life with my personal life with the help of my coworkers. I would definitely recommend this job to anyone searching if they are looking to be in a construction or remodeling environment!"
good,"Great  opportunity,    work well with coworkers  everyday is a different  task learned the does  and don't"
good,"Sherwin Williams was a fun warehouse experience ware i got to learn how to drive the forklift i got to learn how to use to scanner for taking items off of trucks, i was learning about inventory at the time when i was working there."
good,A great company to get one's feet wet with everyday business operations. If you're lucky enough to be employed under a good manager your time with this company will be fantastic.
good,"A typical day includes daily store operations, mixing paint for DIY customers and contractors. Assist in determining staffing needs, recruit store employees accordingly with proper approval and establish work schedule as appreciate. You have to remain knowledgeable on products offered and discuss available optionsIt's very sales driven! You have to make sales calls and accomplish sales goals."
good,Very good job right out of college and lots of areas for advancement. You get to learn a lot of different things from the business standpoint and you have the freedom to make the job your own.
good,I started working here right after I graduated from college. From the very beginning I was welcomed by all the employees in my district and learned a lot about what all the job included. The job includes a lot of heaving lifting and learning about the large world of paint. I enjoyed learning about management while also making a good amount of money. There is also a great opportunity for advancement here.
good,"I used to work for 9 hours per day. My work start daily at 8am and ends at 5pm, which learnt me how to be on time and how to be punctual. Most of my co-workers are very good in nature and we used to go out for team lunch on every Fridays. As a PLSQL developer i learnt the key programming logic and dealing with jasper reports etc. Some times I worked on UNIX Shell scripting which used to help automation of several programs. The hardest part is generating business logic, which can helps to implement several procedures and packages. The most enjoying moment in comes on every Friday, where we have meeting at afternoon times which used to share the status of work."
good,"Every day at Sherwin I sell paint to customers, restock inventory, unload shipment truck, and make about 5 sales calls a day. I sometimes work open to close on weekends, and I usually close every night on the weekdays that include banks drops. Work environment is great, and my manager's do a very good job at keeping the store in shape."
good,"great job all around, great sales, very busy store at that with all the big contractors buying paint from us, to selling paint to home owners and more. always talking to the sales rep for the contractors was always a good gamble i always had the upper hand and always made a very good deal."
good,A good job that is stable and very flexible. This can be a very good job for college students to grow and build character. Also the company closes for the holidays which is a plus for people to have a day off for their families.
good,"Great company to work for, wouldn't mind to be still working there. Knew what they were doing and very much hands on ,that's the managers with the employees."
good,"Great company to work for if you are single. A lot of opportunity for advancement, if goals are met and exceeded. Very close knit and somewhat family oriented."
good,"Great Company with lots of opportunity. Hard work and organization will be recognized. Expect alot to be put on your plate. Customer base is very demanding and unprofessional. Although, it is nice to help small businesses and there are some great customers out there."
good,Typical day at work as an assistant manager is fulfilling orders and manage the operations at the store. I have learned that building relationship is key on growing business. Upper management could be a little unresponsive because they are always busy. The hardest part of the job is having to finish all the tasks with little help from a small crew. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you have a lot of control as a member of management because upper management isn't micro-managing.
good,Sherwin is a great company to work for if your looking for part time work but once yo need a full time job their hands are tied and there's no opportunities to get full time unless you apply for a management position.
good,"Work is very steady and fast pace, with a lot of clients needing help and advice with paint related projects. Co-workers are very helpful and the most enjoyable part of the job ,with our conversations which makes work fun."
good,"Sherwin Williams is a great foundation to anyone aspiring to not only learn the world of business, but to build a knowledge base to prepare you for many types of career paths."

good,I liked working at Sherwin Williams. Because I learned a lot about painting whatever is on the inside of an house. it gave me skills that I can use on a daily basics.
good,"Very good company to work for. Lots of advancement opportunities, great pay and benefits, and looks good on your resume. The hours of operation is not the best. Closes at 7pm everyday including SUNDAY!"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of; helping customers decide on the right products for their job at hand, maintaing the store appearance, stock, and generating B2B leads. Managers at each store have extensive knowledge on running a business from dealing with customers to products, as well as the co-workers. The hardest pear of the job would be, generating quality, sustainable leads. The most enjoyable part is when you first walk-in and your co-qorkers give you a warm welcome, and as well the customers so you appreciation."
good,Pretty good place to work decent benefits and pay even for part time.   Co-workers were good and job wasn't hard or dreadful.
good,"As a Design Consultant at Sherwin Williams I work with Clients to design their homes and/or place of employment. I work with contractors on a daily basis, that includes consults, stain/paint matches, making orders and great customer service. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with clients and making their vision come to life."
good,"The company gives you plenty of resources to learn and challenge yourself to advance if you want to move up in the company.  It is an extremely fast environment."
good,"Work started off with morning deliveries to customers in the area. I learned to work as a team to get the job accomplished in an efficient and safe manner. the management is very helpful, encourages and rewards the employees for hard work. Co- workers were helpful and a pleasure to be around. the hardest part of the job is lifting and moving items. The most enjoyable part is making deliveries and working around fun and positive people"
good,"Empresa onde eu aprendi e continuo aprendendo muitas coisas, o ambiente de trabalho √© bom, a seguran√ßa de trabalho ainda √© razo√°vel, nunca tive problemas pessoais no ambiente de trabalho."
good,"Really good place to complete an internship if you're interested in Retail Management. Managers at the store level are usually younger, which is nice. Hourly employees are not paid well, and work as well as they are paid in some cases, which can be frustrating. Best part of the job is dealing with the big money commercial clients, worst part is dealing with retail customers."
good,"At the distribution center, safety was the highest priority."
good,"I learned much of what I know about sales, marketing, merchandising, business, etc through The Sherwin-Williams Co. I thoroughly enjoyed most of my time with the company, until I encountered my legal issues. I then became complacent and wondered ""why work my tail off when I know I will be going to prison?"" I get along well with co-workers throughout the company, not jus at my facility, as well as higher management. I met many wonderful people while with Sherwin-Williams."
good,work was less than 50yrds away
good,"overall great compnay to work for with a lot of room for advancement especially if you are interested in moving outside of memphis, tn area."
good,It was good to be a driver and meet customers mixing paint was fun and you never got bored there is a lot to learn there.
good,"Management is top notch! Job is very fast paced and requires a lot of learning, but all material learned is very helpful and useful long-term. The skills and principles learned from working with Sherwin Williams are unforgettable and the overall experience was awesome!"
good,"A typical day at work will be fill with plenty of laughing, hardwork, and learning something new everyday. This company helps make all its employees better people"
good,I worked at a sherwin location that experiences a lot of turnover in management. I only experienced one manager change and both were incredible individuals to work for. It was a great place to work during my undergrad experience and they were always very flexible based on my class schedule.
good,"The job was nice for a college student however with the store housing being so short it was almost mandatory to take night classes only, and due to the store closing around 7pm, any morning classes would not give long enough shift to work full time hours"
good,"A company with plenty room to advance. A typical work day involves customer interaction and directing them towards the right product to complete their project. The more you advance, the more administrative it becomes."
good,"It was great place to work. No much work pressure. very well balanced work life. Very high technical instruments, people and tech events which enhanced my technical knowledge. Being intern they never treated me like intern. I was given the full responsibility like an employer and they involved all the interns in all type of discussions like strategic projects etc. They give more exposure compared to my previous work experience as an intern."
good,"The management was awesome, worked with you schedule, awesome customers. The only down fall is how much physical labor you have to do. It really puts a toll on your body."
good,"The employees all get along quite well and make it a fun place to work. The hours aren‚Äôt bad. If you want the weekends off, this is the place to work. You‚Äôll gain experience and get to deal with so many people from different body shops. It never gets boring."
good,I enjoyed working there. I only left due to pay. I respect the district managers a lot and would love to one day maybe become and outside sales rep for them.
good,"The company only promotes from within, unless the need takes them outside the company. They are fairly flexible with work arrangements and have decent benefits to offer."
good,day starts by discussing current project or jobs with management. What needs to be completed before the end of my shifts\. as well as reviewing my productivity and areas of improvement from previous shifts.
good,"There was never any down time while at work, I was always busy. "
good,"When it comes to workplace attitude, Sherwin feels familiar and homey; almost like a local business, and less like a corporate entity. I am so grateful that they gave someone like me with no work experience a chance and built upon my work skills from the ground up. They really do take care of you here and give you plenty of opportunities to expand your abilities."
good,"I‚Äôve been with the company for 2 years. I‚Äôm also a college student so of course I need a flexible schedule. Which they had no problem with. The pay is fair its  better than minimum wage considering here it‚Äôs $8.25. Down in south Florida we have plenty of opportunity to move up within he company. In 2 years I‚Äôve went from PT to FT key and on my way to Trraining Assistant Store Manager. It‚Äôs all about moving paint. Hitting margins, customer satisfaction and team work. Each district has a city manager who manages these stores as a whole. They do recognize your hard work. (Ex:) My store was 1st place to win a friendly premium gallon sale challenge this year and because of it they gifted the entire staff Apple 4 watches. Not to mention we get free food sometimes. Overall the benefits are great, they match 401k which should be taken advantage of. Of course everything takes time you won‚Äôt get it on the first rodeo but it‚Äôs definitely a great company to work for."
good,"Muy buen trabajo, la verdad es una empresa muy desarrollada"
good,I enjoyed working at Sherwin Williams. The hours and compensation were very fair.  I enjoyed helping customers figure out solutions to finishing projects most.  I enjoyed the challenge of helping customers pick the best product possible for completing their projects.
good,"Work days at Sherwin-Williams are not without their stressful moments, but the dependable management works tirelessly to keep productivity and efficiency up to industry standards. The workplace culture has the best components of friendliness and professionalism while presenting opportunity for advancement in the workplace."
good,"Sherwin William was a great job. The day would begin at 5:30 and depending on the workload we could work up to 14 hour shifts. Opening procedures at the store consisted of 2 main parts. After the store was unlocked and the alarms shut down, the software system and tint machine had to be calibrated. Once calibrated and purged, we were able to unlock the safe and begin to open the point of sale and begin our cash count. 	"
good,"I was a part-timer at SW. I enjoyed my coworkers, everyone was laid back as long as the goals are being met. I don't have anything negative to say about working there, overall it was a positive experience. The pay was not great, but I think if I would have stayed longer then I would have been promoted. "
good,I have enjoyed the work I have done for Sherwin Williams. I have learned many beneficial skills that have positively developed me as an employee and will help with in the future
good,"I worked at the Freeport, Il store. My manager, Amanda was an excellent person to work for. She was very understanding, and approachable. She knows the ins and outs of Sherwin Williams and cares very much about the business.  I really enjoyed working with people and helping them to choose new colors for their homes and businesses. Customers were usually excited to come in and look at the colors we had. My only disappointment about the job was there was I did not get to use my title at color coordinator very much. I was more of a sales associate. I did a lot of stocking and cleaning and not a lot of helping people with colors.  I have recommended many people to apply at Sherwin Williams as well as shop at Sherwin Williams. I left only because I had found a full time position else where."
good,As an intern I performed basic tasks in the finance and accounting department. The managers and co-workers working with me were very patient and helpful.
good,"Review industry data for the commodities ready for meetings with suppliers. Vendor meeting and negotiations for my own categories as well as attending other purchasers meetings when required especially if expected difficulties. The culture is very much a case of leaving you to run your department without excess intervention."
good,"> Worked front counter, helping customers."
good,"I enjoyed working for Sherwin Williams mainly because of the staff I worked with. Everyone would help each other out, and the customers who came in to the store were all friendly, and looked forward to striking up conversations."
good,"A typical day at work was laid back usually.  I learned a lot!!!!  My mangaers were kind of mean, but my assistant managers were very nice and patient!  The hardest part of the job was remebering a lot of things you didnt know.  The most enjoyable part was gettingt to learn new things and be around the sherwin williams crew.  we were like family."
good,"Excellent Benefits and incentives, great fun environment, high paced and requires great multitasking skills. Challenging, sales oriented, secure and stable"
good,"It's a great company to work for if you don't mind relocating to another area. Assistant Managers are often placed wherever a position becomes available in the district but corporate does not want them to stay an assistant for longer than two years. If you wan to move up, you will have to relocate usually wherever a place becomes open and it's typically out of state."
good,Great place to work and company may want to review the laws of Washington state before forcing a good employee to quite the job. Other than that no real complaints.
good,Sherwin cares about their employees and strive to ensure satisfaction for both employees and customers. Many different career opportunities and supports your choice in career.
good,You never get bored working at Sherwin Williams.  Everyone gets cross-trained in all of the DSC departments and that helps to understand the whole flow from dept to dept.
good,"Store was horribly understaffed the majority of the time I worked there. Very fast paced year round, always work to do, developing good relations with customers is a plus."
good,"I worked for Sherwin Williams for 5 yrs. Started in the warehouse making $9hr and when I left I was making incredible money.. Salary, benefits, and bonuses. The guys you work with are great and days go by fast having that much fun. There are some down sides to this though. The toxins in the air from thinners, lacquer, and solvent base products have destroyed my kidneys and liver. After 5 yrs of breathing the toxins and getting it on my skin, only 20% of my kidneys are functioning. When I got hired no one told me about wearing mask and gloves. Consider this for your health. Money isn't everything."
good,Great entry level company that prepares you for advancement within or for outside prospective employers.  Supplies you with the necessary training and skills that applies to many fields.
good,"Pude aprender a trabajar en equipo, el ambiente en el trabajo era tranquilo y amigable; la parte mas dificil era cuando me acomodaban en areas que no tenia conocimiento previo alguno."
good,"It is a great company to work for, the hours are flexible. The company is like a close nit family, you ended up knowing mostly everyone in your district or network fast. The customers can be a little bit overwhelming sometimes, they seem to always get there way with the company."
good,"Within the Loss Prevention Department, I conducted internal investigations and interviews. Worked with local law enforcement, conducted safety training classes, etc. I covered six states, and helped support the operations department, built relationships, and ensured stores were properly secured."
good,"The sales training at Sherwin-Williams is top of the line. However, I would benefit more from employee/professional development training in addition to the sales training we receive. For the most part, upper management is very engaged and supportive of employees in the retail stores. Amazing company to work for. Their support and training gives employees confidence, and teaches them transferable skills that will make them an asset to any company."
good,Goals were well articulated.  Rewards were hones for accomplishments.  Advanement wa available for talent and effort.
good,"Sherwin Williams is a great company to work for. The employees are competitive, hard-working, and passionate as well as laid back and fun. It was an overall enjoyable environment to work in."
good,"Great place to work and friendly people who are always willing to help each others.  A typical day is getting the shop ready for business by making sure tinters are filled, registers are filled, and the store has a welcoming appearance.  Homeowners and Contractors would come in one-by-one asking for a paint in the color they selected or they would come in and pick up the paint ordered ahead of time.  Everything would be smooth as long as everyone worked as a team and made sure all tasks were completed in an efficient amount of time.  While my time was short I learned that working as a team is very helpful and customers who have a history of a certain product purchased can make things easier."
good,"Customer service includes assisting in color selections and product selection. Tint paint to colors and complete sale at register. Maintaining colorant levels in the tinter and clean daily. Everyday I am learning about a product we carry. "
good,"My position was  not what I expected"
good,Sherwin Williams is one of the best jobs i have had in my work history. Fun fast up beatwork with fantastic coworkers and excellent customer base.
good,I would mainly deliver paint to construction sites and contractors.  I also delivered floor tile to the School District of Philadelphia.  The rest of my deliveries were to the Philadelphia Housing Authority.
good,"I worked for Sherwin-Williams Distribution Center for 17 years. It was like going to college for that long. S-W wanted everyone to cross-train, and I loved learning all the office jobs. I even learned the warehouse jobs by working with the ISO 9000 team."
good,"Great company. If you want to succeed , they notice that and will give you the tools to move up the ladder. The rest is up to you. Outstanding network of colleagues who at anytime are able to help you with a question or help you get a product to a customer."
good,I was an intern for the company and they foster a great culture of fantastic company service. They really care about every person that walks through the doors which is incredible. There is also a very high rate of internal advancement which is always good.
good,Was a good job just looking for more hours and a full time job it‚Äôs nice the people are friendly the customers are friendly they keep the trucks in good maintenance
good,This was absolutely my best job. I enjoyed every minute I worked with Sherwin-Williams and would gladly go back if an opportunity arises with a higher paying position. The management was wonderful. The hours and pay were reasonable and the work environment was great. The only reason I left was to persue a job in the field I went to college for but I'd gladly go back.
good,Team work and fair management with great pay and benefits. Sherwin Williams also gave me the opportunity to grow and and show my capabilities and I was able to utilize all my skills.
good,"Great first-job I can ask for. Company has excellent culture, good management, generally all managers in stores are nice-hard working people. Systems are hella outdated, from the early 90s.  They can slave drive you if you let them :P"
good,It's a great company to work at. The training is in depth and easy to learn and there are great opportunities to grow! The benefits package is the best part
good,"It is a lot of work during busy days with all the lifting and moving, but that comes with most warehouse jobs.The day would go by pretty fast depending on how many orders the managers put in the system."
good,Everyone in the company loves the company. Everywhere you go people tend to be happy that they work for the company. A very happy place that not only challenges you physically but also mentally because of the amount of information that you will learn in such a short period of time.
good,"The hours are good because they are willing to work with you if you have school or a second job. You also get holiday pay and everyone is pretty cool to work with. It's also a great company because you can become a manager without a degree, as long as you work hard."
good,"Usually a pretty busy job helping and assisting customers including contractors. There's always something new to learn, even for the management because of the wide variety of products and their uses. The management team at my store is very knowledgeable and willing to work with you on scheduling hours and just great to work with all around.  Hardest part of the job is remembering everything because there is so much to learn and memorize. The best thing about it is that it's usually fast paced and shifts go by pretty quickly."
good,you are basically managing your own business and are responsible to drive your business while working for the company. You have to hit number in order for your business to grow. People dealing is the most fun part of the job as Managers in the store.
good,A typical day involves moving and tinting paint as well as taking and writing order over the phone and in person. i learned a lot about sales and direct customer facing and how a customers attitude must not affect mine. The management was great and polite and i enjoyed working with them and with the contractors that bought paint from us on a regular bases. the only negative i can say about my time was it was part time and not full time. but that was nothing they could control.
good,"Trabalho din√¢mico, atualizado diariamente, onde aprende-se t√©cnicas de trabalho e aplica√ß√µes de produtos. Ger√™ncia pr√≥-ativa dando o suporte e acompanhamento. Trabalho com retorno √† m√©dio e longo prazo, raramente com retorno r√°pido, mas agrad√°vel ao seu desempenho."
good,If you are willing to do all the things required of you and excel at the minimal amount of time you are given Sherwin can be a great opportunity for you.  they offer great pay and great benefits.  if you are willing to relocate you can advance quickly as well.
good,"Sherwin is a great company to work with.  I grew up on a farm so the amount of physical work (compared to most) was perfect!  I enjoyed the personalities that did business with Sherwin-Williams (they remind me of other farmers, neighbors growing up).  "
good,"Not for those wanting a desk job environment.  Fast paced from day one, with excellent career advancement opportunities.  Team is the name of the game every day."
good,Learning more about paint and its quality. Great management and hard working co-workers.
good,"Typical day at work includes building customer relationships with contractors and retail customers. Determining customer needs and filling those needs. Working with at least one employee at a time. Typically the Manager and Assistant manager work side by side. Answering phones to either take orders or answer product or situational questions. Lead generation, inventory management, and customer service are basis of daily tasks. Managers expect you to work on the same level as them. Being able to lift up to 50 pounds is a requirement."
good,"Fantastic internship, I was exposed to much of the warehouse and supply chain. I was able to work on real life projects that effect the warehouse operations and present my ideas."
good,"Best job I‚Äôve ever had! Wish they had more full time positions, but I absolutely LOVE my job! The company really cares about their workers! Might just be my district but either way im happy! Great part time job! Great opportunity for growth! Get in young, and grow in the company!"
good,"As a summer intern, I felt that the work load was easy to manage. Additionally, several employee functions were held which was nice."
good,"At my day at work at Sherwin-Williams, our tasks were to give customer service to the Painters and DIY (Do It Yourself) customers. Customers would look at the Color Chart to see which color they liked best for their home or business and tell us the color. They they would pick their product choice of paint that they would like their color to be mixed into. Our job was to type in the Color's name and the Formula and add the colors into the paint of their choice. We then would shake the paint in a shaker for about 3 minutes and the exact color of their choice would be inside of the paint can. We also did shipment every Monday and we cleaned throughout the store on our down time."
good,you will learn something new everyday. great place to start a long lasting career
good,The company was very disorganized and not good for benefits and not follow good rules for the workers not paid good salary and not breaks given for thw workers....
good,"Work hard, edcated yourself., be an team player. Achieve your goals and stick to it. Always be open minded and be willing ro always learn everything u can about the trade"
good,"I learned a lot about paint and stains and applications. I learned about accessories. I learned a lot about their customers and contractors. A typical day was a lot of heavy lifting, lots of communicating with customers and other stores. Selling and mixing paint, stocking shelves, office paperwork, lots of cleaning, planograming, and ordering products. The culture felt to me like a good ol' boys type of environment, where if you weren't in the click your weren't moving up or getting opportunities. I felt like the small man that all the work got dumped on yet I only worked part time and had no health insurance or extra perks. Always had the worst schedule, working every holiday and every sunday open to close. Meanwhile I have a family and can barely afford day care. The hardest part of the job was putting the whole entire truck away by myself 1-2 times a week."
good,"I was a temp worker It's a great place to work all employees are very helpful   only problem I had was the assessment test it's a bunch of bull does not make sense when I didn't pass the vibe turn a 360the h.r sucks"
good,not enough pay for the hard work the employees do.  Spilling paint can ruin your clothes
good,"just wanted to sweep floor then made to answer phone , unload supply truck , stock shelves , mix paint , mix and color paint,  clean restroom , stock and clean warehouse , rotate stock , made deliveries to job sites"
good,Working at Sherwin was fun and fulfilling for the most part. What was a well-paying and fun job was ruined by strict pressure from management to open up a certain number of accounts and unrealistic expectations at times.

good,"I learned a tremendous amount while at Sherwin-Williams, but it's now my time to go.  As a marketer, it's important for me to be at a marketing-driven organization.  This is not that.  This  a sales and channel-driven organization that does not believe in research or true consumer insights.  Throw marketing at the wall, drag it through the mud with multiple rounds of review and approval, and ultimately end up with very little, poor creative in market."

good,"Trabalhei em um centro de distribui√ß√£o, poucos funcion√°rios, ent√£o executava v√°rias fun√ß√µes, isso me proporcionou muito conhecimento e experi√™ncia nos setores de vendas e log√≠stico, fazia todo o processo de vendas desde o contato com o cliente at√© o p√≥s venda, passando por or√ßamento e inser√ß√£o de pedido no sistema. Na parte log√≠stica fazia o recebimento, movimenta√ß√£o, separa√ß√£o e expedi√ß√£o dos materiais, fazia invent√°rios semanais e mensais, controlava lotes e datas de validade dos materiais e controle de quarentena, manuseava paleteiras mec√¢nica e el√©trica, m√°quinas de pigmenta√ß√£o de tintas industriais e imobili√°rias (manual e eletr√¥nica)."
good,I could not ask for a better company to work for. My supervisors are the best. Outstanding work environment and support from this company. SW truly supports their staff with up to date training and interaction.
good,"Ok, place to work and have a career. Sherwin William's has a nice and relaxed workplace with good benefits; but low compensation (30k). The employees are typical some good some bad. Overall Sherwin William's is a great place too work."
good,Sherwin williams was a wonderful place to work. Some days stressful some days relaxed. my management were great guys.  We all got along well. Full time benefits were great. insurance and 401 profit sharing were def a plus. i would recommend anyone young wanting to move up in a company.. this would be a place to start. You will be fascinated on how much you learn.
good,"Good place to work, they claim lots of room for advancement but only if you are willing to relocate. Every day is pretty much the same, different customers but same thing day in and day out. Good company overall and great benefits and stock options"
good,"Continuously helping customers, from taking an order to ringing out the customer. In my experience, I have not had better management anywhere else! Hardest part of the job was helping customers determine colors for their home or business as you would not want to become liable if it ends up looking different than expected."
good,This is only a part-time job for me but it is a very enjoyable job. Just like any job you have your moments where you are slammed for what felt like hours (Usually during the summer months) and then you have days when hours feel like years (usually during the winter month)
good,"Great place to work , positive customer interactions . Driving distance  for me was a bit far . Store is an older company facility but well maintained."
good,I loved working at Sherwin - William I managed accounts for contractors. Neogtiated sales along with data entry. Mixed paint and matched colors from eye.
good,"Great company to work for and will again grow once the new management refocus on service and customer priorities."
good,"My time at Sherwin-Williams was enjoyable at the beginning of my time working there but soon after my hiring, I received a cut back on my hours from 30 a week to 16 then my manager gave most of my remaining hour to my coworker claiming "" they needed more hours leaving me with a remainder of 9 hours a week on 10 an hour."
good,I was busy from the time I came in until the minute I went home. I enjoy challenges and this kept me from getting bored. The hardest part of the job was not being able to finish one project when given another. This kept the job interesting and thought-provoking to say the least.
good,"Report internal control issues to management and supply comprehensive recommendations to mitigate the associated risks."
good,"Sherwin Williams is a good place to learn about paint and about working on homes. A typical day consists of mixing paints and stains with a computer and by hand after getting some experience. Good place to build relationships with businesses, contractors and home builders."
good,Great place to work out of college. Very structured. Great customers. Great customer service based. Would definitely work there again. Good starting salary.
good,I only worked there for a year but I enjoyed it. I met a lot of great people. The company gave out pats on the back and rewards for excellence. Some supervisors created an us vs them attitudes but if you treated them right they would move the world for you.
good,Great company to work for depending upon the division you work in. Overall the organization offer great benefits and are big on giving back to the community.
good,El equipo de trabajo es bueno y se tiene varias facilidades por ser un lugar con poco personal.
good,very nice place to work. very good people willing to teach you anything you need to know about the business and culture around the business.
good,"Iniciaba el dia, llegando media hora antes desayunaba con mis compa√±eros de trabajo y a las 8 en punto todos comenzabamos nuestras labores, iniciaba con una revision a las areas de proceso, supervision de trabajos de alto riesgo los mas comunes eran de espacios confinados, despues elaboraba programas de capacitacion para los empleados, tenia junta con mi jefe y programabamos las capacitaciones, entrenaba a las brigadas y remplazaba material contra incendio en malas condiciones, lo mas dificil era llevarse bien con el gerenete de produccion y pues hacerme a la idea de que yo no estaba en la nomina de la compa√±ia, sino por outsourcing y lo que mas me gusto es todo lo demas! Me encantaba trabajar para Sherwin."
good,"Conducted face-to-face sales calls and seminars at customer locations across North Denver area to build relationships, generate sales, and prospect new leads in commercial contractor field. Performed cold calling, pre-call planning, marketing, and account management."
good,"Receptionist"
good,A typical day at work would include helping general contractors and homeowners with color selections and matches. I also have to speak face to face with sales reps and go over new and changed prices for customers and their accounts. My co workers and manager are wonderful and make working at Sherwin Williams fun and
good,"Great company to work for, offered alot of extras for their employees, offered alot of overtime and great pay."
good,"This was my first job, the main reason I liked my job was because of my co-workers it was a lot of fun & it was a team effort 100% of the time."
good,"bom de se trabalhar pois depende de trabalho em grupo tem que ter aten√ß√£o e agilidade. "
good,"I absolutely loved the people I worked with at this job. It had to be one of my favorite jobs. The pay was low, but the people made it worthwhile. As a part time employee I was able to have 401 K, and paid vacation time. I was in college full time and wass able to make my schedule at work around my school schedule. There is not nearly even close to enough minority's in management, and the computer system is seriously outdated. The most enjoyable part was my co workers, and the customers. You get to know a lot of the contractors that come in some good some bad but overall a very pleasant place to work."
good,"√â uma grande empresa, uma pot√™ncia, n√£o sei hoje, mas na minha √©poca, o profissional n√£o era devidamente valorizado, perdemos muitos bons profissionais..."
good,Sherwin Williams is one of the best companies I have ever worked for. It‚Äôs not too many people on my shift and everyone kind of knows everyone which makes work fun. Everyone relates well and for the most part are very professional.
good,"Learned how to make paint. "
good,"One thing I really find myself being happy about is when a customer comes in with a project and asks me to help them find a color and a product that is specially for what they are doing. To go with that, being able to help a customer and seeing a sense of relief in that they don‚Äôt have to stress about this one thing anymore gives me a sense of me being a helpful person."
good,"They work with your schedule, the earliest you're in is 630am and the latest you stay is 7/715pm. But if your in a management position that can differ!"
good,"Good place to work at, flexible hours at times  but you have to put on some much work to get an raise, the management isn't bad just needs a little work."
good,"Buen trabajo de buen ambiente laboral, muy buena administraci√≥n."
good,"I enjoyed working for SW. Good benefits, good pay opportunity to travel when needed. Also had a good team to work with. I wish I would have bought more stock."
good,"If you love being in an environment where given an opportunity to really get in touch with your customer base, this is the place to work as a great starting position. Upward mobility is very possible in this company but will require hard work. I will say this though, I worked at a smaller location and heard that the larger locations is where all the action is at. Please do keep that in mind. "
good,Sherwin Williams has been the best company I've worked for but they are starting to only promote you if you've got a college degree. I had two different managers in the time I worked there. The first one was about to retire so he didn't help much and the second one was an A**. The customers were great 80% of the time and were the main reason I liked the place. Hours are great for part time employees and flexible with college hours.
good,First thing in the morning after getting the store ready is making sure the customers coming in are taken care of. Rest of the day is tinting paint and making sure that all current jobs are finished and to make sure your calls for the day are done. Hardest part is it can be overwhelming at times especially when working alone for a while. But I have for the most part always felt at home with a lot of the people working for Sherwin. The opportunities are great and I love the company. Moving up can be hard at times but are always offered if worked hard.
good,Good place to work during college because they are flexible. Includes stock options and 401K even if you are part time and you can easily transfer between stores to obtain more hours if needed.
good,"Sherwin Is an awesome and flexible job for a student such as myself and I enjoy working there. However, I aspire to hold a position for more opportunity for self advancement. This could mean a means of commission to document and prove my sales numbers, or simply a clear cut pathway for employees seeking promotion to follow. Sherwin brings you along slower than my personal liking. But I love it here."
good,"The expectations for Sherwin Williams are too high. They expect you to eat, breathe, and sleep SW. In order to advance you have to follow your career in places you may not want to go."
good,"-You run your own business"
good,Sherwin-Williams is a great place to work for customer oriented individuals. Low stress and lax workplace culture paired with great full-time benefits make Sherwin a good employer. There are a few cons including long hours and little upward mobility for those unwilling to move.
good,The first store I worked in was very motivated and was friendly and dedicated. The second location was very different. Required open and close by myself every weekend with management not being supportive of needing time off. Overall positive experience but poor management at some locations can hurt overall outlook on company.
good,"Good people, good management! I like working for this company. Need better pay though. They hire good employees. Team atmosphere. All the management is flexible with your schedule."
good,"Spent 13 mostly positive years, Until miscommunication during the birth of my son ultimately derailed my career. Finance organization could do a better job of truly developing talent rather than the shinny guys that immediately stand out."
good,Otima empresa s√≥ peca pela gerencia atual pois deveria melhorar.
good,"Had a great time until a new district manager, at that time it went down hill.  Not pushed to full potential and was not offered a chance to move up with the company."
good,"Empresa √©tica, profissionais capacitada e humanos, oferece ferramentas para realizar o trabalho."
good,"Enjoyable work environment. Co workers were team workers, supportive, friendly. Fast paced office constantly filling paint orders for government contracts."
good,Company as a whole is on the up and up and always looking to advance their sale. Company though is very micromanagement. They want more out of their employees but dont want to give more with compensation and salaires. stores are not staffed as they should be for safety reasons. It is not the best work environment for Females as contractors and painters aren't the most polite.
good,"A typical day starts early at SW with stores and rep on the pavement at 700a or earlier.  Job duties vary daily but you are basically running a small business or territory.  Financial report management, territory management etc.  "
good,"Ability to move up in the company. Management and co-workers are great. Pay could be a lot better for Full-Time employees. A lot of product knowledge needed, and customers usually don't like to deal with new employees."
good,"There is room for advancement, tons of training in painting, mixing, selling paint and stains, stocking merchandise, also you make your own schedule for work"
good,Love working for Sherwin. The knowledge I ga8ned about paint working here is outstanding. Friendly and helpful staff. Fast paced and fun. Seem to care out the emplyees
good,"empresa muito boa de se trabalhar, cultura organizacional leve, espa√ßo para criatividade e respeito com o funcionario"
good,"Sherwin Williams is a great company to work for. The work environment is great, management is great. Its an easy fast paste job. It doe require a lot of heavy lifting but all in all it is a very great job."
good,Work/Life balance gets hard. Great people and management. Workplace culture helps to motivate you. Hardest part can be learning all the products.
good,Awesome environment to work at the company needs to be more flexible on the short notice overtime. they have a great system but they need to boost the morale of the employees by offering perks and rewards for their hard work and dedication. maybe even an incentive bonus or two.
good,"Excellent place to work, good benefits, work-life balance sometimes a struggle, good opportunity for advancement. I would return to the Company in the future given the chance"
good,"Great People and great environment, not much flexibility on schedules and no room to advance in office positions. Management isn't always easy to work with and office work is tedious, but the hourly pay is nice."
good,"The labor itself is not too bad. You must be knowledgable on products and be able to up-sell. If you enjoy customer service and being personable, this is the place for you."
good,Great company to work for. Often hire from within and lots of room for advancement. Would recommend to a potential employee.
good,"Great company, be prepared to move out of state in some circumstances, for upward mobility.  The local store management in Oregon is amazing, loved going to work everyday."
good,"I would have a list of things that needed to be done by the end if the shift. i would check them off as I went and when I was done the shift would be over. "
good,Sherwin Williams is a great place to work. Excellent benefits and fast moving positions.
good,"Ao chegar na empresa analiso as prioridades para o dia."
good,"As being the only female working in a male based industry was challenging on that alone but I was able to prove my worth. And within weeks I had gained the confidence of the contractors as well as homeowners as a person who knew my way about colors and paints. Great training and received certificates to be able to sell industrial paints. Management was great it has the feel of a family owned company where you are looked at as a person and not as a number. The hardest part of the job was the labor of picking up and carrying 5 gallon buckets of paint. The most enjoyable part of the job is when a customer is afraid of color, takes that chance for a pop of color and they love it so much they want to do every room in the house."
good,loved working with people.. working with paints and experiencing different techniques of paint..
good,It was actually fun to go to work.  I knew all our customers and knew mostly what they would want.  It was exciting to match the colors to the strange objects people would bring in.  You felt so good when you got it right.
good,a typical day at work is just cleaning up making paint and waiting on costumers
good,"Worked in a 24/7 environment on rotation basis and involved in troubleshooting severity one tickets.Proficient in working inSun Solaris, Linux, UNIX and Windows Environments"
good,"√≥tima para trabalhar, valoriza o funcionario da todas as condi√ß√µes que o colaborador prescisa, o pessoal √© qualificado e bem treinado para exercer as ativadades."
good,"Employees are welcoming and friendly. They do many a celebration there for various occasions, accomplishments and visitors."
good,"Loved working for SW, but I was stuck being a part timer doing assistant manager duties. After asking multiple times for a management trainee position, and being denied time and time again, I changed career direction. Overall, I do not regret my four years with the company."
good,"I love the job with a passion , if I could change anything on the behalf on my experience, i wouldn't. I will keep it the same a fun loving experience"
good,"Great place to work with great management and co-workers, depending on which store you're at. Not much room for advancement without a degree. But other than that, great pay, good place to work."
good,"I would recommend this company to the end of the earth. Great staff, good benefits, and a fair management and corporate team. The job itself takes time to settle in to, but the training is top notch."
good,"Me gusto mucho trabajar aqu√≠, es una buena empresa y aprend√≠ mucho, invierten mucho en capacitar a su gente y hay mucho desarrollo comercial"
good,"Great company to work for. They'll run you so you'll get your miles if you don't mind working. Dispatchers are laid back and HR is supportive as well. The pay averages out to about 1,600 a week and the benefits are descent. The trucks are newer Volvos and are properly maintained by Penske. Hands down, one of the most family oriented jobs I've worked at."
good,"Good to gain experience and learn about the paint industry, fast work environment and sometimes working alone. Always working weekends even management."
good,Sherwin was a good place to work as long as you have a good staff. without staff much of the work is left on the manager and can get really overwhelming. Promotion from within is great once you get to management.
good,"a good place with good values, good support from head office, a great availability of resources to complete my tasks. the job demands a good part of a work day with physical tasks combined with administrative responsibility."
good,"great place to work as a college student.  great management and coworkers, minimum wage which is good for a college student. work with your schedule well."
good,"Empresa muito boa"
good,"Empresa boa de trabalhar, bons benef√≠cios."
good,I was given the freedom to do what I needed to genereate results. Though over time a rigid regiment was given. However its a great company to work for
good,experiencias compartidas y vistas y soluciones de problemas reales
good,I was supprised they had a 401k plan they set up for me and that they invested in even if I didnt. I only worked part time so the fact they offered that was crazy awesome.
good,Sherwin Williams did a great job at providing opportunities to excel and vertically advance from within the company. Management was always willing to go above and beyond for their employees.
good,I‚Äôve worked for Sherwin-Williams for 21 years they are a good company to work for.  They promote from within.  They have a fantastic benefits package.  If you are willing to move there are many advancement opportunities throughout this company
good,management is sales driven as it should be. This is a large company now with many subdivisions. You can get lost sometimes with the many employees and brands now working together.
good,"Being a recruiter with Sherwin Williams gives you the opportunity to travel, grow, learn, and connect with people all over the area. I focus on University recruitment across 6 states. My days consist of travel, phone interviews, resume mining, and relationship building with universities and leadership."
good,Motivated store manager to get all employees to understand and know what each product does in order to sell and Maximize what the customer needs in order for them to have an exceptional paint job.
good,"Loved the work, color consulting, selling products. "
good,I really liked working there and was sad to leave. The company itself is fun to work for. I found it hard to move up from part time to full time. Was always the second choice but never quite made it.
good,Since working with Sherwin Williams I have learned so much. I feel that my skill set has definitely expanded. Also my opportunities for advancement and to make valuable contributions makes me feel like a valued employee.
good,"I've worked at Sherwin-Williams locations all over my district. The best stores to work to have a well-balanced schedule. However, hard work is still a must for every employee."
good,"Um excelente empresa para trabalhar, um bom ambiente uma boa equipe e todos colaboram com as atividades. Pude crescer profissionalmente, pois, tive a oportunidade de conciliar tudo o que aprendi na faculdade com as atividades di√°rias."
good,I felt working there I learned a lot and learned to get out of my shell more. I got the opportunity to meet and work with a lot of different kinds of personalities.
good,"The manager I worked under had been employed with SW for a long time. She was extremely knowledgeable and had enough patience to make me a professional when it came to color matching by hand, and stain matching as well. The culture of the company was very down to earth. There's a reason their product and job knowledge are superior."
good,"Good company to work for but of course like fortune 500 companies advancement may be a challenge, and depending on networking to. But for full time employees the benefits are nice."
good,"Fun, team player environment, 401k health insurance and opportunities fot advancement, very friendly and helpful staff and management. I would definitely recommend working here!"
good,Sherwin Williams is great when it comes to amazing customer service and wonderful work families that will watch your back inside and out of the workplace.
good,"As a fulltime employee or management this is a great job, great job for part-time students aswell. Keeping up with product demand can be stressful if you are not prepared."
good,"Colaborar em um ambiente de trabalho onde possa colocar em pr√°tica meus conhecimentos em favor da institui√ß√£o na qual viso integrar. Focando sempre o benef√≠cio, o crescimento da organiza√ß√£o e o crescimento profissional."
good,One of my most enjoyable careers. Learned and grew a lot in this position. Very thank full for the chance to work there. Travelling took its toll unfortunately and decided to leave.
good,"The pay was good, and job security was great, management was definitely lacking though.  Every store in the midtex district is extremely understaffed."
good,Great company and benefits- no advancement for full time employees- if you are eligible or a favorite it will take years to get a promotion- at least 5 years plus- you are stuck if you have a bad assistant manager
good,Great people to work with. Management roles are not attainable in the store in which I worked . This and my relocation is all that made me leave the company.
good,Es una buena empresa y he aprendido mucho gracias alas capacitacion contactos que nos dan y el apoyo que nos brindan
good,if you have a great manager but a bad lazy assistant manager you will end up doing way more work then you are supposed to when your manager leaves for the day
good,"This has been a fun and great place to work.  You get what you put in, so if your not into working hard and challenging yourself this place might not be for you."
good,"Good pay and benefits "
good,"Direct contact with individuals and national accounts to service home and/or building needs, to include paint, wallpaper, and flooring."
good,Great Company and a personally and financially rewarding company to work for.  Management tends to rotate a little too frequently which can cause disruption.  Fiscally responsible and well run organization in total.
good,Sherwin williams uses temps to fill positions and regardless how effective they are or experience they have they let the temp go. This I feel takes advantage of cheap labor and not having to pay benefits. frustrating
good,Great company to work for and Management is on your side because you work hand in hand. Management wanted to help you further yourself in the company.
good,"Empresa id√¥nea e transparente, respeita os valores dos funcion√°rios;"
good,"Made local deliveries in a company provided vehicle as well as helped around the store, and other assigned tasks. Management was always willing to step in and help for any reason. The hardest and easiest part of the job was the same, that being part time work. I left early which felt good to get more rest but also the worst part as I am ALWAYS willing to work more because when the paycheck came, it was very disappointing."
good,"good management"
good,Great job if you are a number oriented person.  Keeping track of all the raw materials and products can be a headache.  Great employee atmosphere.
good,"fue una muy buena experiencia de trabajo, las ventas me gustaron mucho sobre todo atender al cliente en visitas constantes."
good,Sherwin Williams was an excellent spot to start my career. It was an easy transition from college to a large corporate company.
good,"Sherwin-Williams pay wells, offers good benefits, and a good bonus schedule for those who are effective and willing to work for it. "
good,not a bad place to work if you come in with the right mindset. they can feel like the regular 9-5 but if you know how to keep your work day interesting by studying the company materials. you will be fine.
good,Fun workplace with supportive management.  Working independently was a plus.  Learned how the automotive industry worked in a different point of view.  Great friendships with multiple automotive stores and staff.
good,Boa empresa multinacional  com v√°rios benef√≠cios e uma escola para aprendizagem.
good,The Sherwin-Williams Company is an excellent place to work. The hourly rate is great for any part-time job. There are oppurtunities to advance in this company.
good,"They are a great company that pays very well when you are first starting out. The job can be demanding at tine but, you take it one day at a time."
good,"Work for 7 1/2 years started as driver and moved up to color mixer then a warehouse supervisor. Was in charge of 15 people, did ordering of supplies and routing of drivers."
good,"I loved working with the people at Sherwin Williams. My manager kept it a fun environment, while also giving us more product knowledge which is required of the job. The pay was better than I thought it would be even though it was only part time and I was not able to go over a certain amount of hours per week. My manager did what he could to give me as many as he could , but his hands were tied because that was corporate policy."
good,"Sherwin-Williams has a tendency to leave things on the table.  By that, I mean there are things they could improve on.  Scouting of management candidates is a start.  The first manager I worked for was ok.  He was someone who could make the job fun, but could also have his off days.  The replacement... Not so much... She was extremely lazy, often brought her personal problems to work, often effecting her ability to do her job.  She has a tendency to talk down to customers, which in turn made many customers shy away from shopping with us.  Most of all, she was in NO WAY a team player.  Often leaving most of the work to myself and the assistant manager while she sat in her office texting away on her cell phone.  Another point of contention, was lack of benefits.  They offer no benefits to their part time employees which was another part of the reason I could no longer stay on. I finally had to leave in January 2014, as the situation did not improve, but got worse."
good,"Typically you will go in and begin work immediately, Sherwin Williams is so successful do to its great customer service, and I cant agree more because the people there are some of the nicest I've ever met and they mingle professionalism with friendly service and right when you walk in you feel welcome like a family."
good,its was the best place i ever worked but my manger was a alcaholic and was to hard to deal with day to day
good,"Day-to-day store management with short staff. Learned to accommodate varied caliber of paint customers. The hardest part of the job only occurred occasionally when through sheer happenstance, more service was necessary than our staff of 2-3 could keep up with. One rewarding aspect was a perfect paint color match for a retail customer through custom tinting."
good,While working there i enjoy using the machine i was never exposed to. Also they have a very friendly management staff and my co workers are very very friendly. May hardest part of the jobs is when am always misunderstanding the spraying techniques. The most enjoyable part is when am spraying and always getting it right. 
good,"Like the title says.. I think it speaks for itself. A typical day at SW could consist of helping customers, putting stock away, Delivering product and helping customers load vehicles with product. I think I learned a lot from working at SW. Especially with the customers even if they were a business needing our product or just a regular ""joe"" wanting to do it himself. Management was good when it came to working around my complex schedule at the time. But not really and flexibility  when it came to working weekends and it was reflected by customers who wanted a ""manager"" on hand during the weekend. Hardest part of the job was just getting to know our contractor customers' needs. Most enjoyable part of work was getting to know the staff and becoming more of a family than just co-workers."
good,"Minha passagem por esta empresa foi muito produtiva, aprendi muito conheci gerentes excelentes e muito humanos, a pena √© que o contrato desta empresa que era vinculado com a Telhanorte de Londrina, terminou e todos os funcion√°rios ficaram sem trabalho, mais uma √≥tima empresa para se trabalhar."
good,"mix paint, put stock up on shelves, deliver paint to customer, answer phones, help with front couter."
good,"bom entrei nessa empresa em 2004 foi otimo a experiencia que tive nessa empresa ,n√£o tenho que reclamar ,bom relacionamentos ."
good,"Sherwin Williams was a great experience. Management was terrific! I never had to ""drag"" into work. They are great about working with your schedule. Always positive attitudes and a great atmosphere. Most of the customers are happy. The pay was decent, but unfortunately there are no benefits for part time employees. Other than that, great company."
good,"a typical day at work would be taking care of customers coming in the store, helping them out picking a color and mixing their paint."
good,Jai aimer mon exp√©rience jai appris plusieurs truc dans l'entretien de batiment
good,"I've enjoyed my time at S-W and it feels like family. Lots of opportunity if you are willing to move. The more you move, the higher you can climb up the career ladder."
good,"Fun company to work for have to show initiative. Should know how to talk to contractors, and diy customers, fast paced but can be rewarding if you are in a higher tier."
good,Trabajar en equipo dar lo mejor de mi para seguir creciendo
good,"sometime it was stressful working here but it was always good people and over all a fun environment. also some amazing benefits, like 401k with company match, and paid time off"

good,"If you happen to work at sherwin Williams as a driver in terre haute, you will end up having the best team of people to work with. The manager is one of the easiest to get along with people I‚Äôve ever met, and if you need a part time job as an adult, look here. It is not a super physical job, you lift 120lbs fairly often if you carry buckets 2 at a time. But surrounded by friendly people."
good,Fantastic Company and Organization to work for in the painting and coatings industry. Various opportunities for growth and upward mobility in your career
good,Managnent was always there to help you learn and advance. There is always promotions happening. The best way to be promoted is to be willing to move for the company. If the customers like you then their feedback always gets reported to higher management and they WILL see it.
good,Fun and fast paced place to work. Workers were friendly as were the customers. Sometimes meeting customer demands were stressful but others in the company were always willing to help.
good,Great job for someone looking for a laid back part time job. Staff is always energetic and customers were great to work with! Some days were faster than others but overall you weren‚Äôt over worked

good,"Good work place environment ,everyone is always friendly, every manager I have had has always been understanding, respectfull, helpfull, always willing to help"

good,Fast paced and dynamic culture. Employees are given the opportunity to work independently or as a team. Flexible schedule available and a great introduction to the design field.
good,"It is an amazing company but it depends on the district and that district manager. The benefits are excellent, but you have to preform many duties and it is hard to find part time and full time help sometimes. I have nothing against the company but have felt overworked and under appreciated at times."

They take care of their employees and it shows with a large percentage of the work force having been there 10 or more years.  The company treats it's employee's like family, hosting events and creating a very work friendly environment."
good,Use software to manage drivers in over 12 districts.  Learned the layout of many different cities.  The management team was great.  The hardest part about the job was when drivers called off trying to adjust the deliveries with less.
good,"Sherwin Williams is a great company to work for, no complaints.. you have the opportunity for advancement if your willing to move. Great benefits but can be a little stressful at times."

good,"Although some days can be more stressful than others, I wouldn't trade this introductory job for any others. I started with Sherwin out of college to help pay back some student loans and am currently still working here until I can find a full-time position elsewhere. The company is great, the people (that I've been exposed to) are great, and the pay is decent as well. If I had a plan to stay in retail for the long-term, I would definitely stick with Sherwin. I have heard very few complaints from those that have already had extensive careers with the business. Overall, working for Sherwin-Williams Paint Co. is definitely worth a genuine try for anyone."
good,sherwin williams is a great place to work if you just need something to get by while your in school but you cant raise a family off the low wages working in the store.

good,"I enjoyed my time working for Sherwin-Williams.  The amount of training that is developed into each employee is outstanding.  The benefits are also fantastic including the stock options.  My only issues with my time there was the amount of micro management.  You are constantly filling out reports each week, also constantly taken out of the field for meetings.  At the time I was recruited to another opportunity I was turning in 6 different reports every week.  I found myself having to work some weekends to just keep up with the reports.  I did love the call reporting system they developed though, made it extremely easy to plan out steps in the sales process because of the easy access to calls.  I did feel though that career advancement past the outside sales person was all dependent on who you knew and not as much on performance.  For a company as large as this, at some moments it felt as if it were a small town."
good,Sherwin Williams is a great company with an excellent training program and the ability for advancement within the company. Within the stores the management structure is conducive to team success and overall success for the store and its customers whether they be business owners or home owners using our products.

good,I liked this job as a first time father because of the physical workout and long work hours. The schedule was very flexible and worked around my fatherhood and school hours.
good,I have worked at two different locations seminole and bixby oklahoma. Sherwin williams is a great company to work with decent pay and a good work atmosphere. The work is very detail oriented and in the bigger stores like bixby you have to know how to multitask and solve problems while your doing 3 other things. Overall it's a great job and could be a great career choice if you enjoy this kind of work.
good,Very good work environment and career opportunity. I learned a lot and worked with a lot of very nice and knowledgable people. Steady hours and work and great benefits
good,"Trabalho intenso."

good,"The company is a best-kept secret when it comes to compensation and benefits. The schedule is awesome and the corporate side isn't overbearing. However, unless you're willing to relocate, opportunities to move up aren't really there. However, there is a regular raise schedule every 6 months for the first 18-24 mos, if you go in through the Management Trainee Program."
good,"The stores and the athmosphere at the stores are great. Managers are usually great people to work for. They make you want to work hard. Corporate can be tough to appease sometimes. Not a lot of room for promotion from a lower position, they usually go with outside hires or straight out of college."
good,Excellent place to grow and further your career.  This company is great company with excellent benefits.  Friendly work environment and a highly respectable company.
good,An atmosphere that appreciates it's employees but can be over bearing at times.  They are great about promoting from within to a point.
good,My 4 years at Sherwin Williams were amazing. I learned almost everything from dealing with customers to hiring new staff. The management team was always eager and willing to help when help was needed. I would recommend Sherwin Williams to anyone looking to get into a retail level management position.
good,Moved up through promotion as I gained experince.They do this with most new empoyees and it seems to help maintain lower turnover.
good,"The Sherwin-Williams Co taught me a lot about managing my own store. Inventory, hiring, hitting budget, managing expenses."
good,"My typical day is managing preparing orders, visiting job sites, and keeping my inventory up to date. I learned how to manage different personalities and become more organized. My district manager was a great trainer and will promote within. My co-workers were great to work with. I just made sure we understood the policies and procedures. The hardest part of my job was trying to balance out being competitive with my pricing, but also being profitable to make bonuses. The most enjoyable part of my job is building relationships with my customers."
good,"Excelente ambiente de trabalho, a empresa oferece √≥timas condi√ß√µes para manter o bom desempenho e motiva√ß√£o de seus funcion√°rios."
good,"Arbetet var mycket diverse"
good,"Great place to work, especially for a first job. I started out not knowing anything about paint and have learned so much since then. when I first started I just did freight most days and didn't work much with people. I was able to move up and start working with customers daily. I learned how to work the tills, computers, and basic knowledge of the products. I have become very close with my Co-workers in the time that I've been working here, we even have regular customers that come in and I have formed great relationships with many of them. I think the hardest part of the job was just putting myself out there and helping customers when I essentially didn't know much at all about what I was doing. but since then I have learned how to just try your best and do what you can for the customer no matter what. The part that I love most about the job is talking with all the customers and becoming friends with them."

good,Every day you meet new people that like to tell stories and they appreciate when you have jokes for them. it was a fun environment. Managers were strict when they had to. when everything was good with numbers and they seen no problems happen they bought us the employees food and makes jokes like everyone else.
good,"*I learned about the imports and export process."
good,"I really like the fast paced days where there is always something to do. They retain employees for years, so you are able to make personal connections with your fellow associates. The biggest thing that this company has taught me is how to multitask. The one thing that i do not like about the company is that the ability to advance has significantly decreased. Part-time employee's hours seem to drop every couple years. I do love helping customers. It is a great feeling being able to help and educate customers in order for them to complete their project to the best of their ability."
good,"Great place to work, easy to learn the position, highly informative."
good,"The normal work day consist of giving great customer service to paint contractors & retail customers, you answer phones and take orders over the phone and in person. Learned a lot of useful information about painting, paints, and paint equipment, how to open and close a store, how to multitask efficiently, when working several hours by yourself. Older co-workers don't adapt to change well. Minus scheduling management is pretty great. Being short staffed(which is often) will make any of the normal parts of the job hard. Free green tea, employee discount."
good,Empresa muito boa para trabalhar com todo os aprendizados de uma grande empresa uma multnacional experiencias que vou levar pro resto da vida.
good,"Working the Color Sample Department there is always something to do. We are considered support for Sherwin Williams Representatives when it comes to providing presentation material such as Photo Imaging, Color Books and Presentation Boards. We also provide them with samples of pre-made inks or custom paint draw downs. Co-workers are great always there to lend a hand when they can. Hardest part of my job is meeting deadlines due to the high volume of projects that come in. What is most enjoyable is completing a project and sending it out and moving on to the next one."

good,"Great employer for Cleveland, culture of fairness, suitable for all types of people willing to work hard, pot luck culture, respectful and accomodating to many types of workers"
good,"I loved my time at SW. The management team was incredible and always made you feel like your role was important. The work-life balance could have been better, but that is to be expected when you're given the keys to basically run the store like it is your own business."
good,My career at Sherwin Williams was rewarding and challenging. The customers are amazing and the team including senior management are the best I have ever worked for. You have the usual head office stuff that makes you pull your hair out but it‚Äôs overall fantastic!!

good,"Great place to work and grow professionally.  Hardest part was early hours but they served coffee.  The management was professional and easy going, they definitely provided a solid work-life balance."
good,"A day at work is alway's different because you never know what kind of orders from the customers were going to be, and the Contractors are phoning in orders to get paint and have them mixed.  The supplies have to be unloaded from the truck and tagged/ received/ watch for any damaged product, then put into proper areas of sheen.  The delivery trucks to be loaded for different job sites for Contractors."
good,"Great culture and Good empowerment employee friendly, traveling is the most difficult part of your job, work time flexibility will help you to balance you life"
good,"I loved working there, loved all the customers and contractors alike along with the management and my coworkers "
good,"my typical work day consists of taking complex paint orders. setting up deliveries, taking in stain matches for customers, setting up repair deliveries for paint sprayers. we also take in trucks with product twice a week. that involves using a fork lift and scanning in big pallets with a scanner. the work place culture is astounding. as long as you get things done during the day it can be a relaxed workplace. i have learned how to deal with customer service. from complaints to happy reviews about our products."
good,"It‚Äôs not for everybody because it involves lifting. management is great and understanding. It has a family vibe, honestly a good place to work . No bad experience"
good,"Typical day at work is gaining information on leads to promote store growth. Many tools set in place to have you learn the trade, the store level is fine but you rarely get to see management. The hardest part is that there is some manual labor in restocking the store."
good,"Detail-orient job, great people to work with, great pay, benefits, if u willing to learn new things they will cross train you. Overtime voluntary and involuntary!"
good,"Overall Sherwin Williams is a great company to work for however it may be challenging at first due to product knowledge. Once you get the hang of it, you gain a sense of self accomplishment due to a wider knowledge base. Moving up in rank can be difficult unless you're willing to relocate."
good,I learned alot with the company. There is room for advancement and the employee work is appreciated.  The work is fast paced and goal trending. It's always plenty of work

good,Great place to work. Coworkers are great and pay/benefits are competitive. Management is helpful with any questions. A pretty easy job and low stress level.
good,"I learned alot joining this company as I grew more into interacting in the life of painters and contractors. I understood the mechanics more of how to use rollers ,which paint would be the best fit and how to inform customers on our products"
good,The company is an excellent to work great benefits however promotions are very difficult to get at the corporate level. Management are passionate about their employees.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was being with co-workers. The hardest part of the job was getting 45min lunch breaks while working a 12 hour shift.
good,"Great company that makes you put in the blood, sweat and tears before you get the dream job. Working in the stores can be difficult at times but also very rewarding. They weed out a lot of lazy employees at the store level. The hard workers get promoted to much more rewarding roles. They promote from within and reward those that work hard."
good,I enjoyed my time with the company. It was a new challenge to make great customer service experiences. Management was firm but understanding. Many career opportunities to be had within the company.

good,Good company to work for.  Invests a lot in training for their sales reps.  Likes to promote from within and sales bonuses. Great benefits for full time employees.
good,"The job is the best place I've worked at so far. The manager is very friendly and understanding. Co-worker usually are too. A typical day for a part timer is very simple: take calls from customers, Add their orders to the system, Tint and Shake, Sell upon arrival. There is LOTS of downtime, so much so that after 3pm you could practically watch TV (which is also present at the store). Once a week you will be required to stock shelves and complete inventory but it's very simple and only takes maybe an hour or two. During warmer seasons, work tends to pick up quite a bit and there is less downtime. Specifically at this location, one of the bigger customers of the state may place an order for 150-300gallons which is alot and can take a while. Additionally if need be you can advance from part time to a manager in training program which puts you on the path to become an assistant manager at another store and then even work your own."
good,"Customer Service and Customer education are important to the company and the employees. Education in the paint industry is needed when selling the product, And teaching our customers the proper way to make home improvements is what's important to the company."
good,I get to learn new things about DIY projects and the different products you can use. The management actually listens to you. The compensation isnt bad either.
good,"Bom ambiente de trabalho, √≥tima remunera√ß√£o e benef√≠cios, chefia muito t√©cnica."
good,Sherwin is a good company to work for. Being in management is challenging though. Long hours not much work life balance but pay is excellent. Only retailer I know that pays that well.
good,"A typical work day at Sherwin Williams was helping customer with their paint orders, answering phones and emails. The environment were I worked was more fast paced. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the stress that would accompany the position at times. It was a position that required a lot of attention to detail and if something went wrong, you needed to step it up and fix your mistake.  But overall I enjoyed working at Sherwin Williams, it always pushed my limits and challenged me. It taught me about responsibility at a higher level than I had experienced before and the overall satisfaction of customer service. It helped me grow as an individual and I  created strong bonds with a lot of the former and current employers at the company."

good,It was a fun and enjoyable place to work. I just wish that I did not have to move away when I did at the time. I wish it had been a little more busier at times though.
good,"I have been with Sherwin-Williams for just under 5 years now. I started out as a sale associate and jumped around to a couple different location while completing my degree. Sherwin has given me the great opportunity to focus my time on school while working part time as an employee. Working my way out of the stores into a Global supply chain manufacturing facility where I interned for 2 years. After my internship ended they offered me a position into their advanced development program. Once you have shown your strengths and put forth great efforts sherwin will take care of you. "
good,"Overall a great company, good pay and benefits. Sometimes very long hours and a lot of stress to maintain you budget goals. It's a very close family in my opinion."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Sherwin Williams, however I was involved in a life changing accident on a motorcycle and was unable to complete my job after my injuries had occurred."

good,"The management, and other employees at Sherwin Williams were entirely easy, and a pleasure to work with, each one knowing their requirements, and helping the others with training, and advise."
good,"As I grew within Sherwin Williams I began to realize that the skills I had learned over my entire career were being taught to new college grads with business degrees. I loved my job and gave the company my all. As I taught these young ignorant(of wood finishes) college grads my skills my position was terminated. It wasn't me it was just a financial decision. I trained them so well they abolished my job and hired younger business majors to replace me, the exact ones I trained."
good,Good place to work if you like running around all day. It does require you to learn what products work and for where. The people are all very nice and down to earth which makes it an easy place to make friends and to enjoy the place that you work rather than show up just for a paycheck.
good,"When working at Sherwin Williams, I have managed to learn a lot about dealing with customer needs, getting a feel for what customers want, as well as how to service them in a professional manner. During a regular days work I'd service about 10-20 customers which is quite enjoyable because it allows me to help people with their needs. I would make some lead generation calls, converse with fellow employees, and tint and mix paint. Overall, everyday was always very much enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was that because we were a small store of 4 staff members, there are times where there is only one of us working at a time, and we would get a rush of 4+ customers. It's then your responsibility to service all of them as quickly and as effectively as you can which can be quite difficult."
good,"This is a great company to work for. It is very structured and detailed, providing all the tools needed to be successful in your position. There is plenty of room for advancement for those who perform well in their current position. Management is very supportive and helps to enforce a culture of support, team work, inclusion."
good,It was a part time job working at delivery of paint products to their customers on a daily bases. delivery would be within 25 miles of the store. I would have to load the truck and check all stock going out.

good,Shwerwin williams was an awesome place to work at.  I would have stayed there for a much longer time if i didnt have to move.  The people and management was awesome.
good,"This job was very good, I learned a lot about running a business.  The hard part was that there was not a lot of room for advancement and when the new district manager came along he wanted to change the staff in the store."
good,"I learned there computer system is ran by Linux (Penguin). Employees are awesome to get along with. Helping customer pick out the correct product for there projects. Stocking Shelves with your employees, and mixing paint/completing stain matches."

good,I absolutely loved working at Sherwin. My coworkers and manager in particular became somewhat of another family. Working at sherwin gave my a chance to really grow personally and professionally.
good,Great laid back job with excellent compensation. Job is more so supervising machines than actual manual labor which is a plus when u think of your average manufacturing job
good,Sherwin Williams DSC Waco is a great place to work. They take good care of you when it comes to pay and benefits. The only thing is that this job is not for lazy people. They have a lot of over time and if your are willing to stick around there is money to be made.
good,Every member of the staff had a clear and distinct task for the day. This made it easy to accomplish what was necessary and reach sales objectives. It was a great learning experience.
good,If looking for a part-time job  Sherwin- Williams flooring fits the bill they play competitive wages have decent benefits for the hours worked I thought it to be  re-warding and challenging and the men who I worked under were the best!
good,"I was an intern at Sherwin for 3 years. I learned a lot on the job, and there were many people I could go to for help about anything I might have had questions about. There was great communication there, and everyone seemed to be on the same page a lot of the time. Management was great and very relaxed about things. Our department didn't face many hard deadlines, so the job was often about bettering yourself and your projects and getting things out when they were ready. There were a few promotions on my team during my time there, and it seemed like full-time employees got their fair share of opportunities for advancement. Interns, unfortunately, often had a hard time advancing and finding full-time work, but once you had a full-time position, things seemed to become a lot easier. The best part about the job was how flexible their schedules were. They didn't mind when you were in or out of the office, as long as you got your job done, and as a full-time college student, that was very helpful for me."
good,I like working at Sherwin- Williams because it is a fast paced environment. You've always got something to do. You meet a lot of new people in this job. The actual paint part of it is pretty interesting. I like to mix up paint and help customers find the right colors and paints and such.
good,"I really enjoyed the people I worked with at sherwin. I received an hour lunch time and all medical, dental and 401k benefits. Was really fresh out of college so I wasn't very great at supervising other employees quite yet but I got the hang of it after some time. Overall I really liked this job."
good,I knew very little about paint before working for Sherwin-Williams. They have a very good training program and knowledgeable management. Their stocks and 401k is phenomenal. I still recommend that company to people.
good,The customers were nice and always appreciated it when I offered to help.  Management did a good job on keeping me educated on the products we used.  I learned all about the wonders of paint and maintenance.  I also got to meet many new people who came in as customers. The hardest part was making sure I gave the right advice.
good,"My job title was to assist in generating leads and retaining existing customers by making Lead Generation calls to save consumers time and money. Financial reports, inventory management, and also managing and assigning tasks to employees were other tasks I completed on a daily basis."
good,Sherwin-Williams does a wonderful job of training their people with the sales tools they need to be successful.  They value hard work and give you a team that works toward the same goals as you.
good,I find it hard to review this company with my experience at several different locations. Management can make or break it. Waiting around for a new spot to open for a transfer isnt always an option. The job itself can be fulfilling and an excellent personal development experience. The paint business is one of the better industries to be in.
good,"A typical workday is me customer servicing, providing quality information for customers, and making sales calls. I also make deliveries to customer job sites/establishments."
good,"Being a sales associate at Sherwin Williams is one of the better jobs I have had. My manager is incredibly friendly and laid back. At the same time, he makes sure the job is done on time and correctly making sure the customer is more than satisfied. He is also more than willing to share his knowledge with the associates on how to be a better worker."
good,"Perfect entry level position. It is a fantastic place to work, could not have asked for a better experience. Rewarded well and the benefits are second to none."
good,The staff was amazing and made it a pleasure to come into work. I learned how their system was and It made me better to have gotten the opportunity to work with them. The hardest part sometimes was to always please the customer. It was hard because we weren't actually always dealing with the customers. We would hire people to do the flooring and we would not do the work. I thought that was the hardest part because we physically could not make sure that everything was done 100% because we are the one that deliver the orders.
good,Enjoyed interacting with managment teams and co-workers. Morale was always high and bosses very good at communicating with workforce.
good,opener manager will come in at 6:45am and get the store ready for the day by counting the drawers. The sales associate will come in at 7am and will usually work a 4 hour shift or possibly a full 8 hour shift. Us as sales associate will aid our customers to the right paint for there color and taste and there creativity side for what they are about to paint. Then we will grab that paint and make it to their desired color they chose. Mix it in the back and then proceed to sell them the paint. If contractors usually will call ahead and give us direct orders of specific paint color and product. We will then put it in the computer so we can make it and have it ready for when they get there to pick it up.
good,This company allowed me to grow both as a person and an employee. I enjoyed the daily challenges and pace at which the days went.
good,Working for Sherwin-Williams can be just as laid back as it can be stressful and strenuous. I've learned a good deal about dealing with and servicing customers and working in a team environment. You have to be knowledgeable and efficient about your work to be any kind of proficient and useful.
good,"easy job, every day is about the same, help customers, tint and match paint, put away stock. you don't have to have much experience as you start off, but over time you will learn everything you need to know to basically run the store yourself. since the work crew is generally small, about 10 people max, you get to know everyone and its easy to get along with any crew. the hardest part of the job would probably be putting away heavy things, and most enjoyable would be about the last hour before the store closes, pretty  much get to just chill and relax, maybe do a little bit of end day cleaning."
good,This was a good company to work for.  They have an excellent training program.  The only negative is that upper management doesn't really care about your opinion.
good,"On a typical day at work I stock product, help customers, and tint paint. My co-workers are nice, and knowledgeable. They're pretty laid back which is nice and great at teaching me the ropes. My manager tells me, ""Keep working hard and trying to learn."" He's nice, relaxed and doesn't come unwound for much. He keeps his cool so there isn't much stress. The hardest part of the job is learning everything. There is a lot I don't know and PLENTY to learn. The most enjoyable part of my job is tinting paint; I love tinting paint."
good,"The bulk of the day is selling and service to a diverse customer base.  Helping customers (and problem solving) is what I enjoy and value the most.  A typical day will also include cash handling and financial reports, warehousing, merchandising, inventory, accounts receivable and variable related tasks."
good,Working for this company can sometimes be a roller coaster depending on the department. It has it's ups and downs but ultimately it's much better than the rest.
good,"It is always something different each day, if it's just a stain match its different from the day before and that's what I like about my current job.  And we have and excellent crew where we all read and unseen language while we work with each other which is priceless. Just not enough hours."
good,"While employed, I built strong relationships with coworkers, management, and sales reps. SW is overall a wonderful place to work, there is room to grow with the company and honestly I can say they value their employees. I enjoyed my time there and the staff I worked with."
good,"It is the largest Sherwin Williams in Mississippi, with a vast array of products. It was very fast pace and I had to be good at prioritizing tasks. I thrive in high pressure situations like this. In addition to the pace, the size of the store and adjoining warehouse was impressive. I played an integral role in organizing and maintaining the warehouse and stock floor inventory."
good,"A fun learning workplace, always learning new things and working with new individuals. Very welcoming environment. Stores vary on business and if stores are busy or not."
good,".-llegar temprano tomar 15 minutos de desayuno empezar a realizar embarques etc"
good,They have a great manager training program. and they award the employees with great benefits. there is a lot to learn with products but it is easy to learn. you will be really busy in the morning and slows down a little.
good,Most of my days went pretty quick because we where busy. Management were all family oriented and wanted work to be fun. I loved my co-workers. The hardest part of  the job was getting accounts to keep their payments up to date. The most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers.
good,"Sherwin Williams is a great place to work, It is challenging and can be very rewarding as a manager financially and mentally. The only drawback is working weekends, but that's retail."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company. The clientele was good, the managers knew the store and products, and my co workers were always friendly and energetic as was I."
good,Sherwin Williams values their employees and customers. A normal day consist of fulfilling paint needs backed by professionalism and paint expertise. The management is very hands on and they show their appreciation to employees. They cater to their customers and stay open until 7 pm  weekdays.
good,"A empresa que trabalho e umas das empresas melhores de se trabalhar, pois ela aposta muito nos seus funcion√°rios com plano de carreira e tamb√©m e motiva√ß√£o para voc√™ trabalhar bem."
good,good management friendly coworkers The company went out of its way to give the employees great working conditions and benefits
good,"get to work 15min early every mourning and ontime delivery"
good,"Great place to work with great benifits, but i was tempoary."
good,"Sherwin Williams is indeed a great employer to work for.  With a stable income and a good chance of advancement, I have seen several university new graduates been promoted to store management team including assistant manager and store manager.  With the bonus structure your hard work pays off at the end of each quarter.  Certainly, in a retail store, you must be able to face daily challenges such as negotiating prices with customers and solving issues that happened during previous sale (sometimes may require assistance from your sales representatives and district managers).  To meet goals also is vital; however, with friendly staff and great support from your supervisors, sales budget is fair and can be reached with your hard work."
good,"Es un lugar c√≥modo para trabajar"
good,"This company has great training, benefits and potential for advancement."
good,"One of the top Fortune 100 Companys, we have a high level of internal promotions available due to career paths being outlined and planned out, the turnover of employees is relatively low, probably under 15% across the nation, we have a good incentive plan bonus, the salaries are competitive, and the benefits are of great quality. Sherwin Williams gives financial support to various non-profit organizations in the communities."
good,"Empresa de grande porte, oferecendo bons benef√≠cios, al√©m de boa remunera√ß√£o. Funcion√°rios bem afei√ßoados, com f√°cil integra√ß√£o de trabalho. Adapta√ß√£o simples e f√°cil."
good,"Worked with great people. They new so much about the company. I would love to work with them again, in a heart beat."
good,"a tintas sherwin - williams  foi sem duvida a melhor empresa que eu trabalhei, a empresa exige trabalho mais da condi√ß√µes para  isso a conter, la eu cresci e melhorei na minha profiss√£o,trabalhei com bons profissionais, tanto a gerencia como toda equipe de vendas; a parte mais agrad√°vel do trabalho sem duvidas era a recompensa o sal√°rio por sinal muito bom. "
good,"Family oriented, good pay, and good benefits. Lots of over time and bonuses, but no advancement."
good,"The beginning of each day begins with a greeting of all the faces going in and out of the facility. Then, its right down to buisness. I'm grabbing my pens, calculator, and glasses while being updated about the last shifts day. I'm talking to supervisors and managers about what's important for the group to accomplish in order to supply our customers. "
good,"I performed customer service for all customers, provided expert advice on paints, color selection, and applications. I also ran the shipping and receiving for my store. I also collected payments and handled billing accounts."

good,Great place to get basic management skills. Team work is a must to get day to day task finished.
good,"Fortune 500 Company, with very strong Management Program and opportunity for advancement."
good,"I enjoyed working with my co-workers. My days were fast paced and full of the unknown. I never knew what the customers or the next phone call would bring. I learned to match paint and do inventory. I had to get an eye for color! The hardest part was training management,I had to be a jack of all trades (do mine and do theirs)without the pay! Overall if it were'nt for two of my co-workers, I would not have made it. Today they are my two best friends for life. I must say I learned to like Nascar,because Sherwin was one of the paint suppliers for many of the main stock cars."
good,Great company that promoted a work hard / play hard mentality. Enjoyed promoting and training on color match and paint dispensing equipment.
good,"The day starts with a safety and quality topic for the day by associate.Followed by a kickoff meeting to discuss the days business and volume.The lineup would already be made each day was different we were a multitask warehouse one day load,unload highlift,sitdown,orderfill and i also was in a hotseat position and shipped out fed-ex for the site at the end of my shift after performing my daily function and ended with safe housekeeping assignment.Everyone performed at above standard hard workers a great team and most enjoyed was all going home safely."
good,"This company allows you to grow and advance. I started out working on the lines. Then learned to drive a lift, Management came easy people were very willing to help."
good,Formulation Technology: Research and Development
good,"One of the best companies, we would open at 7:00am, Managers would get in earlier to review last night operations, making sure pending orders queue, review inventory levels. keep customers happy, make sure your team is efficient & on time. customer service and sales performance is Sherwin-Williams priority."
good,Sherwin Williams is a nice place to work and I enjoy working with great people that makes the night go by faster. People are really encouraging here and helps everyone to strive and help them get where they need to be!
good,"Awesome boss‚Äôs and co workers, a lot of work to go around. Never boring and always learning new things, pay is good so is the benefits. If you have a degree pay is even better."
good,Sherwin Williams is a great company with a lot of opportunity for advancement and growth. My father spent 35 plus years with Sherwin as well so I have seen the rapid growth into the power house they are.
good,"Self-managed on scheduling and workload management. Sherwin Williams thinks at a high level, top down view to business. They are setup with strong process internally and externally and consistently change with the market to stay competitive."
good,"Each and every day before the shift begins we get a run down of what's ahead of us on the floor. Then we stretch and get ready to perform the task at hand. Once cross trained you are able to switch functions every day. One day you might load or unload, case pick the next day, or operate the reach truck"
good,"This is a great company to work for they incentivize good workers and offer great promotions, hob is demanding and require you to work extra hours some days and is very demanding at times, you need to have great work ethics"
good,Early to rise up to meet the daily challenges.  Take on a ever changing environment to succeed at a higher level.  Management is 100% behind your back.
good,Good place to work. Good pay and benefits. Good people to work with. Helpful when learning about the job and the product of the company. Always a clean work area.
good,I learned how to treat people with great respect and acquired people skills. I also learned how to properly become a salesman and helping customers‚Äô needs.
good,My boss and co workers at the clark location are awesome. I love who I work with and my boss is awesome. I am a single mother and he knows that and understands. I have a great connection with him and have mad respect for him. The guys at work are so helpful with me and appreciate their help. Best place I worked.
good,Show up to work and try not to get over whelmed by the quota. Do not miss and do not play. U have 12 hour shifts and it can b done but like me I was always n heavy I didnt get rotated. So dont get discouraged.
good,"Physical job, but pretty easy. Nice people in my store. Need to take in consideration that a part time person needs to be compensated for equipment such as steel toe shoes that cost more than a days pay. If they could pay half that would be fair. In addition working 5 days a week should constitute more than 2 shirts. One more would be nice. My manager is fantastic. She is fair .and knows her stuff"
good,very fast passed job. Always balancing multiple things for customers. Challenging but very rewarding. Will help you learn how to better take care of customers.
good,"Empresa muito boa, cultura √≥tima e inclusiva, promo√ß√£o a partir de m√©rito"
good,"Empresa din√¢mica agrad√°vel pra trabalhar "
good,Empresa s√≥lida que oferece √≥tima condi√ß√£o de trabalho e possue um plano de carreira muito interessante.
good,"Great company to work for, with good benefits. Great with promoting from within. Fantastic work environment with very helpful people. However there could be more room for advancement and more open communication."
good,"Excellent company to work for. I started with sherwin Williams  in 2012 as part time. Quickly moved up however left for a few years and regretted leaving. Finally came back to Sherwin-Williams in 2016. The one thing I love about Sherwin-Williams is that they are located in every state and almost every town. I enjoy moving to different places and was able to transfer anywhere I went. For the most part I enjoyed every district except SW florida and had great management until I transferred to SW FL district. Unfortunately I left this year (2019) due to inappropriate hostel management pushed me away. Customers loved me and I loved what I did. I was a proud employee and had great ideas to improve things with the company but i just ended up leaving due to these issues with management and HR ignored the issue. Anyhow yes I recomend Sherwin-Williams to anyone because of the great benefits, high pay and quick advancement opportunities. Wish anyone applying the best of luck and hold on to this job as you can really go somewhere career wise with Sherwin-Williams. The only thing I would change is I wish sherwin would hire managers with in the company more over the ones with no knowledge of paint but they get chosen first because they have a degree. Also provide better training for new employees."
good,"My experience at SW was great. The managers take an approach that allows for creativity to drive new business to the store. It is a competitive culture. But, it wasn't one that created division between stores. SW was a great place to work."
good,"lots of work hours at all times, great benefits, great learning experience, good management, causal work environment, fast advancement with hard work,"
good,"I am a chemist by trade, and got a job in a Sherwin-Williams color lab to get some lab experience while I finished my masters degree. I love the company so much, and management, I have been considering sticking with the company! I plan to get a PhD, and I may or may not stay with S.W. for another year to save money before I go to NYU. I also want to look at possible transfers to NYC positions."
good,"I loved Working here but the only way you got a decent pay was if you worked in management, which requires a bachelors degree or waiting till someone gets fired and you can swoop in. I know some managers can be meh, but my manager was phenomenal and hard working so definitely great place to work"
good,I loved working here and working with great forward thinking individuals. The work load does become tedious but Sherwin Williams helped me grow into a well rounded individual. Definitely builds character.
good,Good job with great management. Wish the starting pay was more but it‚Äôs descent. Drivers work M-F and off weekends and most holidays. This is a great company overall.
good,"empresa de maneira geral muito boa para trabalha ,muito preocupada com a sa√∫de e seguran√ßa dos colaboradores ,√≥timos benef√≠cios como PPR ,restaurante ,fretado ,desconto nos produtos ,plano de sa√∫de e odonto .pena n√£o ter plano de carreira"
good,"Great company!  Recruiter dangled a carrot in front of me. The present situation made me accept the opportunity.  Big mistake.  Great company, great people.  Currently hoping to find a window of opportunity to get back in. Hindsight is 20/20."
good,A new challenge everyday. Must have common and applied knowledge to problem solve. Very detail oriented and punctual for deadlines. A solid environment to learn new trades everyday
good,I enjoyed meeting new contractors & assocites with the company. I managed to accomplish every single work project woth my co-workers. & I loved the environment where I was hustling & giving effort.
good,"Best job I ever had. Such a fun atmosphere and I learned something new about paints, stains, and other complicated products just about every day. Also, there's no commission so you don't have to feel forced to upsell a $60 gallon of paint haha."
good,Very easy straightforward job. low stress and great team to work with. The only con I could think of was finding out that my mail counterpart who started working after me was making .50 cents more than i was
good,"Great to place to work and gain experience, learn financial and accounting basics and progress within the company. Company sales oriented. Very fast pace environment."
good,"I enjoyed working here, the management was awesome! great place to start if you are looking to move up as it is possible and many people get promoted internally. they encourage employees to be actively engaged within the company"
good,"Sherwin Williams is a great place to work. The benefits are good, stock options, health care, good opportunity for advancement. The schedule can be tough though. the stores are open approximately 360 days per year."
good,"Mixing Paint, Making Sales Calls, Inventory, Making Deliveries, If you like talking to people and interacting with the public this job is for you you will also learn about paints and how to recommend them for each need."
good,"Sherwin Williams is a combination of sales and retail. You develop the problem solving skills necessary to work people of all sorts. In a fast pace environment, you develop the competence and confidence to handle any kind of problem. Developing social awareness to provide the best customer service and products. And the empathy to build a relationship and trust to grow business for consumer. The company allows for innovation and learning. Understanding all domains of housing provides opportunity to specialize in product knowledge and create room for new solutions."
good,"A typical day at work was focused on sales, customer service, hard work, and positive attitudes. I learned the basics of customer service, delivery driving, and shipping and receiving. Management was highly-skilled in their role(s) and created a productive and positive environment. The workplace culture was great, focused on production, customer service, positive attitudes, and teamwork. The hardest part of the job was physically moving some of the orders to construction sites, through mud and snow, but that aspect truly was not very difficult. I enjoyed every aspect of this position, especially the coworkers."
good,Always things to do. The atmosphere is a little laid back but productivity does not suffer. Great team atmosphere lead by management stuff that promotes individual growth and development.
good,Sherwin Williams really prepares you for advancement in the company or a solid future through great business infrastructure. The workplace culture is very united and if you do well you will be greatly benefitted.
good,I loved the job just needed more hours and more pay. I learn a lot about paint speaking that when I first started I knew nothing. I loved the little work family feel that my store had.
good,"The place is always busy with customers from DIY to Contractors you meet all kinds of people when you work here, i would recommend anyone to the chance to work for the company."
good,"I worked at a sherwin for around 10 months and it is easily the best job ive had. the managers are great, and the district managers take notice if you do well and will do whatever it takes to help you advance"
good,"fast paced friendly environment, it helps to be a peoples person. there is a lot to learn about paint and construction in order to effectively help customers"
good,"La empresa es muy preocupada en tanto en la seguridad como en la capacitaci√≥n de sus trabajadores, la jefatura siempre esta al tanto de todo lo que sucede con cada uno de sus trabajadores tanto en lo profesional como en lo personal , muy preocupados en  todo sentido y el √°rea jefatura siempre dispuesta a solucionar los problemas o inquietudes que surgan en el dia a dia, es una muy buena empresa para trabajar y muy grata en su √°rea de bienestar."
good,Great place to work with very fulfilling work. Best place I've ever worked. Requires a degree to move up any further in the company unless has prior experience in store management.
good,"This is the perfect place for a family man to work and enjoy a 9-5 job in a chosen field of science, or research and development.  I have enjoyed working here"
good,"Excellent pay, and free schedule, managers are very open and trusting of employees.  Salary rates are competitive and the work environment can be fast-paced or slow depending on schedule."
good,"It's a great company to work for, even if you are a part timer. Depending on management the hours are flexible. Its very good pay.  Everything is a team effort."
good,Excellent Employer.  Well above average compensation and benefits.  Been around for a very long time.  The only reason that I would ever consider leaving is to be closer to home.
good,No matter how much fun we have we always try to get more productivity than fun but we are just one big family and we all have our problems and lifestyles but we still try to help each other out.
good,"If you are able to see past the retail aspect of beginning a career in sales and management, you will be rewarded with solid compensation and decent benefits. A typical day in the stores will be high stress and fast paced but you will learn how to run a million+ dollar business in very little time. As with any company, management will always add to your responsibilities based on what corporate wants and any local initiatives. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the general public in a retail setting, which can challenge your patience and resolve but in perspective is not that bad. Most of our business is to professional contractors and to wholesale markets which is the most rewarding aspect of the job."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at this establishment, especially with my lovely coworkers who helped me learn along the way, many things I would have never learned."
good,"Working at SW was fun and hap good benefits for part time employees. I do think that the company should let the store manager decide on the hours of operation, at least for the weekend (very slow on the weekends, especially in winter)."
good,"Make sure the shelves were stocked and fronted, calibrate the color machine. I loved helping customers pick colors, wallpaper, etc. The hardest part about the job was unloading the trucks. The best part was matching colors and seeing the customers leave happy"
good,"My store address is ""Sherwin-Williams Paint Store, 7361 Miramar Dr, Manassas, VA 20109"". During the 2.5 years at Sherwin Williams I was a part timer working 4.30 hours a day for about 25 hour weeks due to my flexibility with college. This was an amazing work environment! The team was quick and responsive when dealing with customers and contractors with large orders. On a regular day we would tint and shake about 300 gallons of paint for a customers order early morning until noon (or sooner if we don't have walk in customers).  I felt at home working with my team which I would say was more of a family. We would celebrate our yearly or monthly goals by going out for dinners or bowling. My store was a training store for MT's (Manager in Training).  We always had orders coming in through our fax machines even after closing. My store was a $4M store with steady orders all year round. The District manager is amazing! He's very caring for all of the employees and will take time to sit down with you should you have any problems with anyone. My team and I were responsible for setting up orders in our system, getting the orders ready, pulling the orders and preparing them for delivery, selling the orders at the register, taking orders over phone and talking with contractors for product recommendations, remember the REX identification numbers for popular cans of paint, customer service, restock, breaking down the pallets from trucks, organizing material in the warehouse, giving our contractors a tour of the warehouse and all of our products, helping customers decide what colors would suit"
good,Sherwin is a great company to work for.  I had the opportunity to advance my career throughout my 20 years.  If you are willing to relocate the opportunities are endless.
good,What I loved about Sherwin-Williams was the teamwork. Every day consisted of hard work that was very fast and hard. Ultimately it would make the days go by fast and the team would have fun.
good,Every day is a new opportunity to make a difference. Being a large company they have multiple jobs in almost all markets. Personal job growth opportunity is available if you apply yourself.
good,Sherwin Williams is a high pace work place and physical demanding environment. The management for my location was flexible with scheduling and the pay was reasonable for living expenses.
good,"I have no complaints about the company, there is no room for advancement without a 4 year degree and they pay is not competitive. Everyone that I met in the company has been helpful."
good,Great place to work.  Only seeking a new job because there is a lack of advancement for at the current time. Managers are great that I have worked with.

good,"Great company with awesome leaders. The District office set up is a bit weird, however the environment is great."
good,I love Sherwin Williams. Just having a hard time moving 700-800 lb barrels of paint. At my age of 53 a lighter load would be helpful. I like the company very much. But I realize that moving paint is a young mans game.
good,"Great benefits and terrific culture with outstanding employees and benefits. Company has multiple Divisions (Paint Stores, Global Supply Chain, Diversified Brands,) so employees can transfer and grow careers."
good,"excelente ambiente laboral, te entregan todas las condiciones para hacer un trabajo de calidad"
good,I love being able to go on the road and see Oregon for what it is. Every day is a new day with new adventures. When you walk into the store in the morning you never know what your next delivery is going to be.
good,"Sherwin overall was a great place to work, the cold calling got a little annoying but I understand why it was needed. It was a physically demanding job at times but their structure is great, just like their product. They have a successful business plan, you just have to believe in the process and you will do well and if you do well you move up quick, only left because of a competitive job offer closer to home."
good,sherwin williams is a globally located and top most painting company in the world and technologically advanced with over 300 patents and very firsts to its credit.
good,"Worked at SW for 3 years PT and loved it. Although it was not what I wanted to pursue, the company promotes from within and offered me a Full time position quickly. For the most part the job is relaxed and the staff is good. The customer service aspect is the hardest part, as the customers aren't always everyone cup of tea."
good,"While working a Sherwin Williams I interact with customers, mix and tint paint, provide paint consultation to help customers pick colors, take over the phone orders, contact contractors and customers about promotions and products, and other general work."

good,Sherwin Williams was a great company to work for. The managers in my particular store were very professional and were able to assist customers with any problems as well as fellow employees whenever things became difficult.
good,Great company and they are very focused on improving and promoting employees already on the payroll. This makes it great for upward mobility. There is also a wide array of jobs within the company aside from residential paint materials.

good,Excelente empresa. Buen ambiente de trabajo .. buenas prestaciones
good,Working at Sherwin Williams was a great experience. There was a somewhat small staff but they came together like family. I would like to return but the distance from work to home is just a little too far.
good,"Sherwin Williams is a great company to work for. the benefits are good, the people are great, and the ability to advance is there. The only downside is the low pay rate. Starting salaries for similar positions in other companies beat out pay of people that have been in this company for years."
good,"I feel Sherwin Williams is fair with pay, but really awesome in benefits package. its a great opportunity for advancement in management, but not so much in logistics. This company works well with people, both employees and customers."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my experience working at Sherwin Williams.  The management was great, the clientele was enjoyable to interact with, and the wages were good for an entry-level position.  However management heavily prioritizes part-time help to the detriment of advancement opportunities."

good,great company. It has its ups and downs.MOVING FORWARD TOWARDS MANAGEMENT BITTERSWEET. They over look employees that have been there for years for young college students that come in with only looking at the salary and eventually end up quitting because they don't want to work or either do a horrible job and end up running the stores into the grown for horrible customer service which brings up more and more unnecessary rules.
good,"clock in then see if any customers or team members needed help ,take paint orders ,stock the sales floor , make sales , unload new merchandise from pallets"
good,Productive company learned valuable information about the manufacturing of paint. Enjoyed assisting customers with there decisions regarding paint and painting products industrial and architectural.

good,Great company to work for. Thoroughly enjoyed my job & the people I worked with. SW does a very good job of keeping their employees devoted to the company & the brand name. Very tight group of people in each area.
good,"muy buena empresa siempre se me dio la facilidad de permisos"
good,"Assist customer with needs on sales floor, complete paint order, operate cash register to complete transaction, complete weekly merchandise order, shipping and receiving, and other task as assigned"
good,"As a Part-Time Key Holder, I was given a note worthy amount of responsibility which has expounded upon my training as a manager. Given the responsibility and authority to make decisions based on the store future needs such as: Inventory Levels, Scheduling, Lead Generation Call/Follow- Ups, and etc."
good,"Learned a lot about time management, multitasking, customer relationship building."
good,"You will get out of the position what you put in, can be very stressfull but also very rewarding at the same time.  Excellent benefits and earning potential."
good,"Days can be hectic, but there's typically no need to worry. The coworkers can be counted on to help you since everyone works together to help customers and prepare orders. Some days the phone never stops ringing, and some days it hardly rings at all. However it works out, there's always work to be done and good people to do it with."
good,"Established global leader in it's market, which continues to grow and increase profits."
good,"This was a wonderful place to work. A bit hectic downtown, but enjoyable. Many perks. Cafe and workout facility in the building. Outdoor basketball and tennis courts are a great way to get away at lunchtime."
good,"Sherwin-Williams is a very good job, had lots of fun working for them. I really liked working for the company but I really need to find another job to help me pay for school."
good,"A typical day as a driver involves making deliveries to jobsites, companies, or other stores. However some days there are not enough deliveries to keep me busy for my full shift, but there is plenty of gratifying work to do around the store. Anything from ringing up a purchase, tinting paint for a customer (or matching their color), to stocking new inventory on a daily basis. I have gained a large knowledge of commercial and industrial paints, and their proper uses. Management at Sherwin Williams is very accommodating of reasonably requests, and works alongside their employees while motivating them. The hardest part of the job is when I have to deliver large orders to remote job sites. Unfortunately there will be days where someone needs paint delivered out in the mud on a rainy day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the great atmosphere that is created by the employees, managers, and customers."
good,"Working at Sherwin Williams was an amazing experience to start off the career spectrum. They helped me to become very independent in a face paced environment. I would answer the phones, do billing, file, stock, inventory and much more."
good,"Great 401k benefits whether you are part time or full time,  all employees are trained to deliver top notch customer service."
good,"I loved my co-workers, we were like family.  The management team at plant level was highly unorganized, but upper management was very personable, down to earth and highly skilled."
good,"This internship can provide the path to advance if you work hard. "
good,Sherwin-Williams is a great company to work for.  First class training and they really care about their employees.  A great way to get experience in the business world and they encourage you run your store as if it were your own business.
good,Was an amazing internship! Really beneficial to my career!
good,A typical day at work consisted of me coming in and working the paint section of the store. I would open and close the store by myself normally and had large amounts of responsibility. With a good work ethic this was a great part time job.
good,Load my truck and go out and deliver paint products to customers. i learned how to talk to customers and listen to the needs of the customers. I had a amazing management team and still to this day we stay in contact. My coworkers at the time where the best. The hardest part about my job had to of been the over sized loads of paint and the unsafe areas were we had to deliver to. The most enjoyable part of my job had to of been just being on the open road never stayed in the building to much.
good,Handled inbound calls from upper tier employees ranging from regional managers and VP's.  These calls were in direct relation to Corporate IT advancements in the iphone to data network path within the companies international marketing scheme.  Co-workers within my group were average in education and performance levels in comparison to my daily output.  I was trained directly on the advancements of the iphone in relation to the data path that was yet to be written.  Overall the staff was knowledgeable and courteous as well as always professional under all circumstances.
good,Sherwin-Williams is an amazing company. It is very big on training. We continue to train through out our career. At worst Sherwin-Williams is a great career builder
good,In a typical day I interact with customers and help them with paint choices.  My management is very driven and strives to become the best store in our district.
good,My career at SW was great and started at the age of 19. I advanced quickly and learned many different roles. This company is so large that there seems to be an endless route to career growth and maximizing your potential. The only issue I have ever had is the feeling your thoughts or concerns fall on death ears. Upper management is great and giving the orders but the staff in the field feels without a voice.
good,"I loved my job working for Sherwin-Williams. The management I interracted with from store to regional levels were all friendly, helpful individuals with a sincere desire to see the company and it's employees succeed. Supporting staff were a fun, gregarious lot who knew their departments well and provided outstanding customer service. Their benefits package, especially their matching 401-k and stock options, were fantastic and well worth the percentage I put away into them. While the standard retail woes occurred (difficult customers, the monotony of stocking shelves, and the dreaded annual inventory), I always enjoyed going to work. The most regular complaints from staff were regarding the outdated computer system used, which was occasionally difficult to work with."
good,I had the privilege of attending several hours of sales and management courses all over the southeast.
good,"Sherwin-Williams is a strong company that develops its employees into strong managers. It is not easy but the support and career path allow you do apply your strengths and work on your weaknesses. The company's benefits are amazing especially in this economy. The downside to working for Sherwin-Williams is having to work retail (long hours, weekends, and some holidays), but you have to work hard to get somewhere no matter what you do."
good,Each day is always different. I have had some great managers as well as a terrible one. I suppose that happens with any job. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is the relationship forming with regular customers.
good,"I feel respected at SW, my technical expertise & recommendation is well received."
good,"My day at Sherwin Williams would begin at 7 AM. Where i would mix paint as well as help customers pick out the right colors and products for their job. I learned many things about dealing with customers, as well as knowledge about paint and how to match colors. The management was always great. Always willing to enjoy time at work but stictly buisness first, which i believe to be a good way to run a store. The co-workers of Sherwin Williams was my manager. The hardest part of the job was matching customers colors for customers, but it is also the most exciting part of the job."
good,Constantly pace throughout the day dealing with customers. You learn from personal encounters and experiences about the different products and also they have a phenomenal training program so all employees are very knowledgeable.
good,Great Company all around. Been trying to get back with them.
good,"fun busy place to work,great co-workers."
good,My work experience has been quite rewarding and my relationship with my manager has only been the best within my working career.
good,"Well organized company that allow for promotions to those who worked hard. With so many store fronts and different business plans, there was always a place to get moved to if you wanted to further your career with them. They offer great training. All the managers I had were great and really took the time to care for their employees."
good,"Usually wait on retail or contractor sale them paints and supplies, open up new contractor account set up credit line and applications for accounts. Train clerks on sales and promotions, work with sales reps in all areas of sales and growth."
good,Learned alot about stain and paint and the different types of paint. managers an co workers was great inventory was the toughest part of the job overall great experience
good,Very productive and customer oriented. Management was great and fair. Willing to train.
good,"I loved the people that I worked with in the market I was in. If you have a college degree then you could go really far in the company. The hours, pay, work life balance, and opportunity for advancement is great."
good,Enjoyed working for SW and the people were great. I highly recommend this company.
good,They are a good company to work for but internally you have to be careful with the people you surround yourself with. Things are not always handled the way they should be and often get over looked. The company is great the pay is great benefits are great it is more the workers who cause the problems within.
good,"Sherwin Williams does very thorough background, drug screening, and credit check. Minimum 2-4 weeks between interview, and first day of work. You will need khaki pants, blue collared short/long sleeved shirts, and shoes that are NOT sneakers. Absolutely no open toed footwear of any kind. Steel toed boots or shoes are not required."
good,It‚Äôs essentially sales and management put together. The more effort you put in the more you‚Äôll earn in bonus. Plan on working very hard. Do as you‚Äôre trained you‚Äôll be just fine.
good,"Energetic environment, always learning something new, repeating customer, give you many tools to be successful, many different things to do, if you have emergency they work to accommodate your needs as best possible"
good,"The Sherwin-Williams I have worked at provides hardworking and organized employees that are very experienced and outgoing. My work experience here has taught me a great deal about customer service and prioritizing customers for the sake of producing more business. However, dealing with customers and always being able to please them was also the hardest part but the most beneficial as well. The most enjoyable part about the job was the friends I made whether they were employees or regular customers, friendships and new conversations always got me through the long work days."
good,Excellent place to work however they need to step up like several top retail stores have in increasing pay. Other than pay excellent place to work. Room for advancement.
good,"Sherwin-Williams has a great work environment that is active and exciting, whether moving around paint cans and stocking shelves which provides a physical workout, to keeping the store front clean and helping customers pick out colors. The product knowledge is fairly easy to acquire if you put your mind to it and there is a lot of room for growth within the company."
good,"Great place to work, decent pay for the job, laid back work environment. My manager was amazing and helped me with anything I needed. Meeting new people everyday also seeing the same people everyday and creating relationships was one of the best parts about the job."
good,"Dedicaci√≥n y compromiso"
good,"It's a nice place to work out. I'm lucky I have a good manager and feel that  I can grow within the organization. The workplace culture at my store is great, and not all stores have the same experience. Compensation could be better, but its a part-time position so it is what it is."
good,"Sal√°rio e benef√≠cios √≥timos, valoriza√ß√£o dos funcion√°rios."
good,"Greeting customers and making them feel comfortable and secured about what they are purchasing. Explaining paint purpose and application, setting up delivers and answering phone call."
good,the management here is outstanding! and the customer base is the best i‚Äôve had throughout my years at multiple jobs. the past year working here i have learned to much about business and paint and tools that will definitely benefit my future. there is so much room to grow and learn and i never leave here with a bad attitude. best job i‚Äôve had by a landslide!
good,"Sales calls"
good,"All I had to do was stack full Duce paint buckets and put labels on buckets and make sure that the line was running smooth "
good,"You have to learn a lot of product knowledge but once you understand it, the job is very routine."
good,"Great experience, the distance I was traveling to work was just too far to justify. Loved the training, team, culture, and companies we served, if you have the opportunity to work for them I would!!"
good,I enjoyed learning about paint in my year at the company. That knowledge kept me in the paint industry for an additional 3 years. I only left because i needed a full time position and being that I wasn't a key holder prevented me from staying.
good,"es un excelente lugar para trabajar en mi epoca tuve excelentes companeros, aprendi mucho la compania daba cursos de superacion muy productivos. Tienes la oportunidad de interactur con el publico y aprender ingles"
good,"Great place to work,good people and managment. Pay well and fair. Safe place to work. Most co-worker and managment are respectful and everyone does their job  professionally"
good,I loved delivering for Sherwin-Williams. I enjoyed the physical aspect of the job and driving to different locations each day. My co-workers and managers were all fantastic people to work with and be around. It made coming to work each day all the more pleasant.
good,Their benefits are extraordinary.  It's a great place to work for.  There are a diversity of positions are the stores and branches.  Corporate personnel are very friendly and helpful to deal with.  Each store is different.  They are diversed in many areas.
good,I would still be with the company had some interpersonal things happen between me and another coworker that left me in I'll health and I needed a mental break from the store.
good,The best route to take with Sherwin Williams is their Manager Training program. The program is absolutely great and the compensation cannot be beat. I learned a lot and I always had the resources to do the best job I could.
good,Need to be a hard working paying attention to details is must. very good company to work for with excellent bennifits. I retired there after 22 years of service.
good,My favorite job till date. You were always learning something new and the customers weren't rude and the environment was very inviting. You were answering calls or tending to customers in-store. You had to be knowledgeable about your products.
good,"Willing to work around your schedule. Very laid back, decent pay. The training is easy, easy to catch on. They take the time to help you and willing to teach you. Management is great. Everyone is very friendly and is more of a family environment. Hardest part of the job is probably learning about all the products."
good,"It is a very fun and relaxed environment to work in, the atmosphere was amazing, they would let you make all the mistakes you are afraid of making their as long as you learned from them, the hardest part of the job is lifting 5 gallon buckets of paint, which honestly isn't to bad i felt was paid fairly for my work, we where allowed to talk and have conversations at work as long as we where as productive as we needed to be, overall i loved it their, the ONLY reason i left was because the location i was working at did not have any open full time positions at the time and i needed a full time job, if i could go back their full time, i would in a heartbeat!"
good,Esta es una empresa americana que valora a las personas en cuanto a tu m√©rito y se preocupa mucho del bienestar de los trabajadores respecto a su estadia y en el desempe√±o de nuestras funciones diarias
good,If you are a hard worker it is very easy to move up. I appreciate all that the company did for me.  I started out as a driver and ended up the warehouse manager by the end.
good,"Avaliar esta empresa e quase imposs√≠vel."
good,"Aprendi muito na Sherwin Williams,uma empresa de valores, excelente remunera√ß√£o, conviv√™ncia pessoal maravilhosa, cobran√ßas tranquilas sem for√ßa o funcion√°rio."
good,Great place to work. Good employees and customers. Work environment is fast pace but all employees work together to get the job done. Would recomend to anyone who loves a fast pace job.
good,Boss was awesome! Co-workers were great! The only problem is when customers come in or call in an order and they request a certain item and if we don‚Äôt have it they may get mad at you even though it isn‚Äôt your fault. But if you can just shake that off you‚Äôll do great!i loved working for sherwin Williams!
good,Excelente empresa para trabalhar. A meritocracia √© regra.
good,"It hasn't been very long since I've started but this has honestly been the best job I have had. Yes, it's not the most kind on your body, it's tedious, but it is so very rewarding. The people you get to meet within the company and the customers you get to build relationships with are just so wonderful. The glorious examples of customer service that I have gotten to learn from have brightened my horizons and made my own personal customer service that much better, and seeing just how much happier the contractors or the DIYers are every time you get that paint match correct is just the best. 10/10 would recommend Sherwin-Williams as a company."
good,"Muy buenos compa√±eros de trabajo, muy ordenados y limpios. El clima laboral era muy bueno"
good,"Really enjoy working for Sherwin. I wish there were more hours available but it's a great part time job. My boss and coworkers are all really nice, which makes work fun."
good,A great employer with job security. A place you can work your way up. The training is very in-depth and constantly bettering their service and products.
good,The best place I ever worked for good people to work with understanding managers at stores fast pace work environment as a delivery driver because you are moving a lot paint
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is when you are faced with a customer service challenge and you are able to make everything come together and meet the needs of the customer.
good,"I enjoy Sherwin-Williams very much. Work is challenging, but not overly difficult. There are a great many resources to help you achieve goals. The only knock is that middle management shuffles very quickly in large districts, and the inconsistency can lead to varying performance of employees in stores and in the field. However any motivated employee can overcome this inconsistency and still perform well."
good,"My time with Sherwin Williams was my most rewarding job I‚Äôve had. Thoroughly enjoyed helping customers with their design projects. Enjoyed educating customer and co workers, in the proper application of paints, stains and wallpapers."
good,"This company has good benefits even for part-timers. In fact, this is the only part time job I've had that has benefits for part time employees. They have opportunities for career growth, and raises. However, this job can be fast paced and a little hectic at times. If you take time to learn the products, you will be fine."
good,Muchas veces les falta evaluar mas a sus jefes ya que les falta trato con la gente a su cargo
good,"Had a great time during the internship program, learned how to diagnose an app that was having trouble launching. Overall felt important and useful as an intern. When I went to part-time work over school felt less useful and was put more in a regular store role."
good,"Sherwin-Williams is a great company, with a good company culture. Everyone is willing to help out others as long as others are willing to do the same. It can be hard to move up after becoming a manager and you can get stuck in a position and plateau for the rest of your career."
good,Great advancement opportunities. Learned a lot about paint products and the correct way to use them. Tremendous staff filled with joy and hardworking attitudes.
good,Besides it being a boys club and last bit of Horrible management I was under at the last store out of 7 it was awesome.  We had fun and we were a team.
good,"Overall wonderful experience, enjoyed working for the company and my manager and district manager made sure to make me always feel welcome to return. Smooth paced work environment."

good,"Has a cool way to handle stress they have a punching bag in the back room and it‚Äôs funny cause customers can hear it being punched sometimes, oh and the coffe is good"
good,"√ìtima empresa para se trabalhar, aprendi muito com colegas e superiores. "
good,The management was great to work with. If you need a day off or just some time off for a doctor appointment they worked with you. I leaned about the different types of paint and how to mix them.
good,It was a great program that they‚Äôre consistently trying to improve. Your voice as an employee is truly heard up the chain of management. You‚Äôre encouraged to bring good ideas to managers
good,"Empresa Din√°mica que busca la excelencia diaria, gran ambiente laboral."
good,For someone whose never known much about paint or the business its really easy to pick up on a lot of it and management is there to help you out when you don't know the answer or what to do. Their are benefits for full time and some for part time as well. You do get discounts off store items as well. It does take a toll on your body since you lift a lot of heavy paint every shift.
good,"Loved working for sherwin Williams it was a great experience and a great job. Interacting with the customers every day, and working with my fellow employees was a great time."
good,"Empresa de primeiro time, com excelentes oportunidades"
good,Muy excelente ambiente de trabajo compa√±erismo seguridad y atenci√≥n

good,"Great work culture management always willing to help you grow. Always teaching you everything when needed, understanding staff, very helpful co workers."
good,"I sincerely enjoyed my time with Sherwin-Williams. I have fond memories of experiences that were very unique to the job.  I made connections with coworkers, as well as clients, that will endure for years to come.  I will always have nice things to say about SW."
good,"If you want a shot at getting promoted quickly, making good money and being part of a great culture, Sherwin is a good option. "
good,Sherwin Williams was a nice place to work. They pay their employees well and management takes care of the employees. They let you know what's going on with the company and is a safe place to work.
good,I enjoyed working for Sherwin Williams company.  They had great pay and benefits.  It was a challenging job.  Not everyone can handle the long hours and intensity of sales management and meeting budgets.  I enjoyed the competitive atmosphere of trying to control cost and employees hours while continuing to out sale every other store in my district.  I learned so much from running the stores I managed.  The experience I accumulated will be an asset to any company that I go to work for.
good,"You're given the opportunity to learn all aspects of running your own store. You meet and work with a lot of great people, that makes coming to work enjoyable."
good,"Excelente ambito de trabajo, tanto en la tienda, como en las sucursules, excelentes pl√°ticas de motivaci√≥n para generar nuevos clientes."
good,everyone at sherwin williams was amazing. I made some work place mistakes due to being able to balance my life and work at the time and had to take leave. Love my manager and customers.
good,Great job love it just as far as manager since our store was growing they really didn‚Äôt pay attention to the employees managers used to get all the credit every year they hit bonus and changed managers every year our store 7016 grew since I was there for 7 years! Don‚Äôt move me because I was good there but only gave little raise had to leave!
good,"So far what I have experienced here is rush times in the morning until noon then its quiet and no one comes, which is exactly what I was looking for. Other stores I've heard are more busy so if you want a more busy store just look for one in a growing area."
good,"Excelente ambiente de trabalho, boas amizades. "
good,SW is a very good place to work everyone is treated equal gets along we work well together. Very productive and a fun workplace we have gatherings gets gift for jobs well done  I love SW.
good,Very productive it is kind of a shock when we do have slow days. I've learned about the different paint products. I also have had a good eye for spotting out colors that customers are looking for. I am learning how to handle customers personality and become a better employee and contribute to the team.
good,"My time at Shewin-Williams was well balanced day-to-day. Normally  it was me and two others working the store, allowing for freedom to move between tasks save for when management was occupied with conference calls and other duties."
good,"It was alright work. Not the greatest, but certainly not the worst. I would have stayed if I could increase my hours to full time. They hired outside people a lot instead of promoting within."
good,Excelente lugar para trabajar y crecer como persona.
good,"ambiente muito agrad√°vel de ambos turnos de trabalho, aprendi a din√¢mica e efic√°cia do trabalho em armaz√©m, gerencia transparente , uma cultura que visa o bom ambiente, seguran√ßa dos colaboradores. a maior dificuldade no trabalho foi em alguns pontos no finalizamento do processo transportes na sa√≠da da empresa, e o de maior facilidade foi com o trabalho em equipe."
good,Sherwin-Williams was an excellent place to work. Very calm laid back environment. Hours were great. Home every night. Very good pay and excellent benefits
good,for the job that you do the pay is fair. I was a part time CSR and that took care of me and my 2 kids for nearly a year. garren at the Chamblee tucker store was easy going manager but he meant business mike the assistant manager was very knowledgeable and he was awesome to work with. he made the day go by quickly with his quirks and singing. I loved working there.
good,"I liked working to help clients, I learned good experience, the management he was very communicative, the culture was doing professional work well, the most difficult thing was when the clients came whit the wrong information but we always positively offered them as professionals."
good,Sherwin-Williams provided me with a basis in business-to-consumer sales and allowed me to build on my interpersonal communication skills. All personnel were experienced and helpful during my time there.
good,"√â uma √≥tima empresa para se trabalhar, √©tica, valoriza as pessoas e com √≥timo ambiente de trabalho."
good,Empresa comprometida com os funcion√°rios  √≥timo ambiente entre os funcion√°rios
good,"Lots of opportunity to move up, make money, etc. Good culture, managers are approachable. "
good,"Loved working for this company, it is very fair and easy to climb, as they hire from within but you must be willing to relocate. Overall great work experience"
good,"Es una gran multinacional, me dieron la oportunidad de crecer mas a nivel profesional,"
good,"This is a great place to work, but not if you are looking for a full time position. Easy to get the job, easy to learn the information, but to be able to move up, you have to be willing to move on their demand."
good,Great company with benefits that lead the industry.  Growing company that highly encourages internal promotions.  Your success is guided by upper management and by how much time you are willing to invest in your own career.  Success in this company takes hard work but is achievable.

The culture was great, surrounded by great and helpful personalities all day. Everyone was definitely a team player.

good,it was a good job. I enjoyed working there and I enjoyed the people I worked with. my managers were always there to help us. over all a very good job.

Once or twice a week the freight would come in and my coworkers and I would spend the day helping customers and in our down time stocking the shelves. There were only about 5 of us working there when i was which i loved. You really get to know your co-workers and your not just a worker. You really feel like part of a team.
good,"Very Slow after 3pm everyday. Learned about all the different types of paints, stains, brushes, etc. Mixed paint colors for guests."
good,The people around me were great and it was nice to work with all range of people from administration to the workers on the floor.
good,"Typical day at work includes heavy lifting and tinting of tons of paint products. If you do not know much about paint, it is a big learning curve to learn about proper application and preparation, all of the different products and different tools. Management is friendly, you don't see upper management much. Co-workers are great and supportive, it is a great team environment. The hardest part of the job is the stress on the body physically especially if you are at a busy store. Some days you could have to tint 500 gallons of paint. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the contractors and painters that come in almost every day and learn about what jobs they are working on."
good,"This is a great company to work for if you are looking for something part time, People are great, benefits are great also."

My co-workers are very helpful. They understand how to run a good company and they helped me along when I didn't know what to do at a particular moment. The hardest part of the job was getting comfortable with using the phone to take down orders from customers. I have been improving daily with that. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I'm not alone. I love to work with others when I'm working."
good,"The people I worked with were great and I learned a lot in the profession. It was laid back most of the time instead of when it got busy, but that was nice to be moving around and helping others with what they needed. The hardest part was learning the system to make the paint, but in the end that wasn't to much."
good,"I worked with customers. Took paint orders, made paint, sold paint, stocked shelves, ordered inventory, made schedules, etc."
good,"After opening the store making sure the money is accurate and systems are a go, you get right to work on calling customers and helping anyone that enters the store. Management is a plus because they have become pretty much good friends due to longevity at the job. As for the rest of the co-workers, we all consider each other almost family because of continuity between the group. Making calls is not really the hard part of the job but can weigh a lot on you to bring in new business consistently is where times can tend to be hard. Going to work with people you have become friends can make each day fun, but specifically learning daily work related skills with customers and how to accommodate them whatever way I can."
good,Working here can be at times very trying dealing with impatient contractors but its most rewarding when someone comes back and says everything that you recommended worked out and everyone who comes to visit loves it
good,"Na Sherwin Williams do Brasil Ind. e Com. Ltda aprendi a conviver com as pessoas e descobri meus pontos fracos e fortes em um ambiente de trabalho. Mais que colegas de trabalho, eu conquistei amigos pra toda a vida. No in√≠cio do meu contrato era um diretor e no fim dele, era outro, mas os dois eram bem competentes. Para mim n√£o houve parte dif√≠cil, porque cada mudan√ßa se tornou um desafio que eu me propus a enfrentar."
good,"This may have just been a temp/document review job, but I absolutely loved it! The management was friendly but professional, and there was a great balance between fun and work."

good,"The industrial side of The Sherwin Williams Co., is more demanding"
good,the workflow is consistent and grueling. a lot of heavy lifting is involved. in this company you have to where a lot of hats and be great at everything because the customers are demanding. but i was lucky to have good co-workers from time to time so it seemed enjoyable most of the time. the hardest part of the job is keeping sales up because the market dictates everything. the most enjoyable part is that they take care of the employees great benefits and if you pay your dues good compensation as well.
good,"A typical day at Sherwin Williams revolves greatly around working together as team. It is essential to work together to insure all orders are filled and all customers are assisted.

Management is great, strict but not harsh, always willing to work with your schedule.  All my co-workers are great, they treat me with respect and I do the same to them.  The hardest part of this job is to learn everything in the store, you learn something new everyday.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction you give to your customers when they have everything they need to finish their job."
good,Starting this job close to the end of college and continuing after I graduated was a great choice. The benefits are incredible as both a part timer and a full time employee. They have a fast track management program that is really good in larger cities but not as great in an area (district) spread across a more rural landscape. Training for the job is very detailed and extensive so you really do become an expert in the industry. Greatest part of the job is the full time benefits that include help on buying new cars discounts off cell phone bills and the 6% company match towards your 401k from day one as a part timer or full time employee. 
good,"Typical day, relaxing and knowing your job!"
good,"interacting with customers everyday was fun.Selling them the product they truly need to get the job done can assure you of a repeat customer.knowing your product is key also making sure your team also knows.Credit management was my responsibility.accounts payables,bank reconsiling,collections,inventoring,store sales."

Most stores only offer part time but you can find some locations that offer both. My managers are awesome. They work around my schedule. If you're going to school, Sherwin Williams is a great place to work part time!"
good,"On an average day at Sherwin Williams, I would come in and clean up a little, then sell paint and mix it for customers.  Every day, I did some researching. I would also help DIY customers pick out color, type of paint, and sundry.  There was never a dull day and I learned a lot about painting projects.  I know that I would have done better there, had I painted a house myself.  Knowing Spanish helped a lot while working there and I feel like I at least made an impact that way."
good,My time here was well worth it. The management here was always friendly and would go above and beyond to help customers and even employees out. The warehouse was kept up and the front part of the store was kept clean daily.
good,"Excellent company to work for, although, opportunities are very limited to management and full time positions. Employees from all stores are hard working and easy to get along with. The bending and lifting of 5 gallon buckets physically challenges your body from constant lifting."
good,"Day starts off with a meeting of the daily workload, assign areas, and other important information for the day. You stay busy working all day, but not bearing or too much on one person. The whole job experience was amazing from the moment I had the interview, to orientation, to training, to working. The best warehouse job in Waco."
good,"What a wonderful company to work for and the pay for PT could be better but they do give you vacation time/sick time and 401k as a part time employee.  "
good,"A typical day I will tint paint, find everyone their order, receive and send out Inter-store request forms, answer and transfer calls/make sales calls."
good,"Most of time it gets busy during the morning. We get our morning rush with mostly contractors and wood finishers. Home owners come in during the afternoon, sometimes the last 30 minutes before closing time."
good,Well run business and motivational to all employees on every different level. Management always involved and engaged. Compensation was certainly fair and training was very thorough.
good,I worked part-time contract for this company and it gave me the ability to flex my hours and days of the week I put time in.  Also great opportunity to learn recruitment in totally different scope of service.
good,"Great place to work, great work/life balance and departments. I have had a great deal of opportunities at this company, and cannot wait to grow even more in my career field"
good,"welcome customers and take their order, grab paint and tint if necessary. cash them out and carry out the product to the car."
good,i learned how to manage customer accounts. how to provide a better type of customer service that would maximize each  sale. Having a great manager was great as well.
good,"- Everyone was very nice and fun, especially the management.  Everyone was always willing to help and the company had a great atmosphere."

good,Enjoyed my job very much.  Employers were great. Work environment was good. The Supervisor and managment were great to work with and for.
good,An excellent company with strong management who encourages and promotes personal and professional development. Many opportunities to learn all aspects of the company.
good,"Well defined company that has a clear vision, stated objectives, and a defined strategy for globalization.  Challenges do exist at the IT level with the integration of PCD personnel lacking knowledge of the Oracle global solution.  Left unto themselves it will ultimately become heavily customized and interfaced.  Spend too much time trying to prove the worth/existence versus skillset upgrades and/or resource changes.  Corp Controller is challenged."
good,"I learned a lot about accounting and how the business world works. This was a great internship that helped me learn a lot that I will use for the rest of my life. I also learned how to communicate with various individuals including customers, vendors, managers, and executive. In addition the accounting knowledge I obtained was invaluable."
good,"I loved working at Sherwin Williams. Always happy and responsible employees to work around. This environment motivated me to work even harder. Best job I've ever had. Need taller vans though, due to heavy lifting while bent over. Not good for long term due to the van height, but will work again."
good,"Aprendi muitas coisas durante esse tempo que fiz parte da fam√≠lia Sherwin-Williams, tive bons relacionamento com todos na empresa."
good,"Making sure all the customers needs are met in a timely fashion, along with stocking and basic store maintenance. Management is very helpful and experienced with training new employees, but you still must have a desire to learn. If you are willing to put in the work you will see the reward. There's always something to do and always new information to learn in the ever changing world of exterior/interior coatings."
good,I really dont have very much to say other than that i loved working there and my work enviroment was awesome. loved my coworkers and just had and exrtremely good experience there
good,This company is a great company to start with and stay with.  If it is something you find interest in you can stay with this company for the rest of your life if you wanted to.  The benefits are some of the best.
good,"I really enjoy the job, but the full time aspect is not available. For a part time job my manager and coworkers are the best I have ever had a chance to work with.It is hard work with a lot of lifting and a fast paced day but a challenge makes the day go faster."
good,"A typical day working at Sherwin-Willams is none stop work."
good,Have been an intern for a little over 6 months now and I really love working here. My supervisor is very helpful and my coworkers are always there when I struggle with something.
good,"Helping customers and giving them the one on one attention that is desired in order help the customer strive for excellence with any job they may have planned to do, co-workers work as a team to get jobs finished in an orderly fashion but yet productive, the most enjoyable part of workin at Sherwin Williams is building rapport with customers and knowing my help will lead them down the right path."
good,"Sherwin-Williams has a great management training program. It is practically required in order to move up within the company, but it provides you with a plethora of knowledge of how to run a business."
good,". Nunca fazer alguma coisa indeciso, sempre ter a certeza do que voc√™ esta fazendo, aprendi algumas coisas sobre a √°rea qu√≠mica sobre rea√ß√µes que pode ocasionar numa fabrica√ß√£o errada. E um breve conhecimento na √°rea de expedi√ß√£o ."
good,"Over the past year and a half I have learned multitudes of work and life lessons. My management team is extremely good at training me to be prepared for any difficult situation thrown my way. I can juggle multiple customers needs at a time, and prioritize them accordingly. I also have the tools at hand to find out information on products that I may not know about or haven't heard of to better suit me for next time. The hardest part of my position is to satisfy those customers who seemingly always cannot be pleased. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to know those same people so a lifelong customer relationship can be built and it can become profitable to our business. Overall I love my current position but I would like to move up within the company also."
good,"I start my day with a review of PIM system and by checking emails from the Lotus Notes to see if there are new and outstanding cost requests for various types of paint products. I mainly am in charge of costing the powder, liquid and automotive refinish products and quotes. And my daily job includes assist and answer questions bring up by my co-worker since she came after me. The hardest part of this job I think is to provide a prompt cost when certain necessary cost information is missing. We need to not only contact the manufacturing sites but also follow up with them if no responses are heard. I appreciate the extensive training that S-W gave me and the welcomed culture from my group,my supervisor as well as everybody I worked with.I enjoyed learning costing methods and processes and at the same time improving my IT skills."
good,"I enjoyed being able to work independently. I knew my job, what needed to be done and my boss let me do knowing that I would perform it at the very best level and with excellence. The hardest part of the job was knowing that I would no longer be doing it. Division office decided to consolidate and relocate this office to Georgia. And though I was offered to relocate also, everything for me is here at home. This job was a blessing and a big part of my life."
good,Left this job for a full time job with benefits and better pay. The management and fellow employees where great and everyone worked hard. I would work back at Sherwin Williams in an instant. Great working environment.
good,Overall this company offers great benefits with opportunity to advance within as long as you are willing to relocate.
good,"Sherwin Williams is a strong company to work for. They reward their employees with great pay and benefits. I am ready to explore my career opportunities within the company or else where. I currently work in the retail setting, and I am ready to advance."
good,"Is a very hand skill work during the day ,kinda hard but is fun work with them,they have good payment tho but it is not what i'm looking for. I'm a fast leaner I can do mostly everything if you show me how to do it"
good,Productive and fun work place. Customers are enjoyable to be around once you get to know them.  The managers make  environment good or bad and also developing a well trained staff.

good,Very high fast pace company.  Customers of all backgrounds and walks of life.  Very good job if you like meeting and helping people and offer ideas above and beyond their own.  Customer base is 99% great people and contractors.  You do have those ones that are a bit hard to please but you work through it and come out shining like a star.
good,This is an amazing company to be a part of. Your district office does a lot of outreach programs to get everyone involved. It‚Äôs a job that continuously pushes you to further your knowledge. We all became a close knit family with our workers and contractors/customers.

The company‚Äôs greatest assets are the employees and this is a core value of The Sherwin Williams Company.

good,"I miss Sherwin Williams, I worked there for 4 years as an operations manager and a commercial sales rep. honestly there is no better company  to work for after leaving there for 2 years, I actually plan to get back and never look away ever again"
good,"There was no typical day at work. Each day brought unique challenges. As a Director of Financial Services, all things working capital were my responsibility. However, the most unique part of the job was the sales aspect. Extensive travel across the Southeast US each week brought me to my team members in various states to spend time in front of customers and in stores. Thus the job was not purely financial, rather, both a sales and operational focus from the financial point of view."

good,Great place to work at. Really cool people and flexible hours that worked with my schedule I only left because I wanted to get back into school and finish my education.
good,Most days were spent mixing tinted paints that costumers requested and making cold calls about upcoming deals the store would have. A lot of regulars come in and if there was a new customer you would spend your time helping them pick a color and type of paint.
good,"I recently left this company due to school obligations. This site tried their best to come up with a plan to work with me but I had an internship that wouldn't allow me. The people were very friendly and welcoming when I worked their. When I had a question, the boss would stop what he was doing to show me what he was asking for.

good,"A day in a Sherwin is typically assisting customers in making decisions on the right products, sheens, colors, and tools to make their project successful. In my personal experience, I've learned the differences in paints, products, sheens, lighting, and colors. Along with that things that are necessary for adhesion, proper preparation, application and evaluation tools when considering a coating, along with the proper removal of a coating. Management was reliable, and had clear rules and regulations. The workplace culture was mainly about making sure both the workers and the customers were on the same page and that people felt comfortable making the purchase. The hardest part of the job was trying to connect the dots because so many customers come in with no knowledge, but with patience it can be explained. The most enjoyable part was the contractors who you formed friendships with. It was cool to see how many regulars you have and being able to just get them what they need without any fuss."

The only thing that was not great, was that you often deal with customers who curse a lot and can be vulgar at times. But if you can handle that, then this job will be okay.

This was the hardest job because I had to figure out why we had open dollars on our books. The atmosphere in the office was amazing.

I made sure our store was clean and then also merchandised our store month to month according to an ever changing Company Plan-O-Gram. Weekly I was responsible for making 50 sales calls that were made to either existing customers or new customers that we were trying to do business with. I would take notes and keep a database of all the information that was received from those phone calls. I also made inside and outside sales of everything from paint and brushes to spray equipment and obtaining a contractors commitment to purchase their material from us. On top of any normal responsibilities I had, I would also do whatever else was asked of me to ensure that all assigned tasks were completed. I also resolved any customer complaints and processed any payments from clients and or bills that we had to pay for outside services."

Building rapport with contractors, helping home owners pick out paint and paint colors. You learn it all. Everyone was extremely friendly. I would say the most challenging task is working during the summer months when the store is at it's peak business level. I loved knowing that I was impacting the community around me by what I was doing at work. Whether that was helping out a recently widowed women sell her house and move back home, or convincing the most stubborn of contractors to try a new product."
good,"Showing up to work, knowing the world is in your hands to make colorful, is the best feeling ever felt. The people there weren't people, they are family. The hardest part of the job was not being a part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was being part of the SW Family."

They are strong believers in promoting from within, giving employees a better opportunity at advancement in their current positions.

good,Plenty of advances in the field. Always training and learning.
good,A typical day involves movement of paint products and materials through out the store.  Helping customers and do-it-your self customers with projects they are working on. I learned how the computer system and how to fullfill orders by the customers. I also learned a ton about the paint and decking products in the store. My coworkers were great. Managment was great. The hardest part of the job is failure. The only way to learn is by doing and learning about the paint products because you never know what will walk through the doors or what contracter will call and ask for an estimate on prices. The most enjoyable part of the job is the store.
good,"Friendly environment, hard working employees and team leading"
good,Sherwin Williams was a great career opportunity. From the knowledge that you gained from training that was provided to the things you learned about business in everyday operations. The people were really like family. You could call any Sherwin Williams store anywhere and tell them you were from another store and immediately it was like you had known each other for years!
