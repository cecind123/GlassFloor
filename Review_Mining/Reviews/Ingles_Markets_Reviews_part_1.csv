rating,review
bad,"They only care about the company, not the employees at all. There’s no appreciation, and obviously no accommodation. They don’t give credit where it’s earned and even if you do everything perfectly, they will find fault in it."
bad,No management support. Not enough training before employees are set off on their own. not enough working equipment to get the job done correctly and in a timely manner.
bad,I'd you are looking for a part time job with Bill's it's the perfect place for you. They do have flexibility but the thing is I want more then 20 hours a week
bad,"to be fair I worked at the worst reviewed ingles in the metro Atlanta area. the walls, pale, yellow walls and the odd smell made it feel like you where in a prison."
bad,needs more people accepting of diversity not just we need to add minorities store needs several cosmetic updates im sure they have the budget from the amount of pay associates recieve
bad,"Ingles is good place to work for if they paid you for your time and gave you hours but without either you're underemployed."
bad,Job was juat not for me. Offten got screamed at in person by a customer for the little mistakes and the managers would not help of care. did not learn much of what i wanted to and the pay was not great
bad,This job defiantlyeaves a bad taste in your mouth and is very toxic down to the customers and co-workers other employees constantly make up false accusations about people and management even help keep the chaos going and pitting coworkers against each other constantly employees calling out for the most horrible excuses the store manager needs to be fired
bad,"Inconsistent schedules, co-workers might or might not show up for their scheduled shifts, poor working environment, poor salary, no paid time off, no paid holidays, no sick leave for part time employees, extremely stressfull work environment"
bad,"Horrible place to work management in the deli would fire everyone just because she didn’t like you, I wouldn’t recommend this place for a job of a career"
bad,"NOT worth working here , they oer work you and under pay you, A JOKE. I was offered 8.50 to work here but during my annual was told i was only making 8 a hour and was being boosted to 8.50 a hour liars!"
bad,"Hire you at 40 hours, then cut your hours by surprise.  No special day off weekly to set appointments etc.  you’ll be threatened with job if ask questions (no training).  80-100lb lifting of boxes and such daily.  "
bad,"Theres no orientation or training. They just throw you in, and then get mad when you dont do what you weren't trained to do. Rules and directions change more than the seasons, depending on their mood at any given moment."
bad,Other employees like to talk about another's mother whom passed away... I wouldnt advice anyone to work there... they seem to not care about the employees they still have the employees there that wanted to talk about MY MOM being gone.
bad,The mangers were rude at times. The customers were fine but the mangers I think could be nicer to there employees even if they have had a personal background together.
bad,"Sucks. I hope they close. The store manager is to dumb to know the people they are hiring is quitting because of the shift lead. She is lazy and pathetic. She takes hour long breaks and when its time to clean up so we can go home she disappears"
bad,"I've never worked anywhere this hideous in its treatment of staff. I was ignored when I asked for training in the FIELD I APPLIED FOR, the pay would have been barely enough to make ends meet if they hadn't shorted my pay and changed the system, and the managers couldn't give two shots about you. Don't go here for a job."
bad,"Overall experience working for Ingles, was the worst experience I have ever experienced. Rude coworkers, consumers were more pleasant to work for that, the employees themselves. Petty drama from employees and management alike. "
bad,Dont trust ANYONE!!  They talk about people behind their backs but to their face they're buddies. Guess it's like that everywhere. But this place is ridiculous. Management very unfair!!
bad,"Poorly paid, work hard with no congratulations. Very male preferred. You work 5 out of 7 days. Only one week paid after you have been full time for a year."
bad,"I worked at ingles for four years just to be crapped on constantly. If someone decides the want to be lazy for the day, it is now your responsibility to pick up the slack or face reprimanding. The management is crooked. Once you stop letting them take advantage of you, they find one tiny problem to fire you over. Ingles is a complete joke!"
bad,"The management always want more work with fewer people. Even a simple labor job is stressful. The managers don't have anyone to replace an employee who is on leave, thus creating stress for the remaining workers."
bad,If you're looking for a place to work filled with drama this is the place for you. They are all very unprofessional. Managers are drama along with all the workers. Threats can be made to your face and nothing is done. They cut your hours with out a notice start people at more pay than you with no experience. This is the worst job I've ever had in my life.
bad,The pay was low even tho I had the most experience out of all the service clerks and management was absolutely atrocious and I think the worst part was that I was doing more than just my job
bad,Management was terrible they never handle problems!!! Always had a bully they never got rid of that bully cause they treated her like a queen she is still their to this day!! Horrible place to work at!!! The manager always had his favorite ppl never got onto anyone for being on their phone unless he disliked someone!! Pay is aweful their food in deli is nasty!! Never in my life will I work for that terrible company again!! I wasn’t able to move up their but I quit ingles and became a manager somewhere else I finally moved up after so many years!!!
bad,I do not recommend working at ingles on the fact that the management is very poor and do not at all care for their employee's. They say that you must bring in a doctor's note even though no one ever does. You must come into work no matter what the reason is.
bad,I was a DM for this company and it took everything I had to try and keep my employees from quitting due to my boss harassing them constantly and going behind my back and question my judgement. In my two years there I had a strong proven track record but the amount of two faced people who weren’t even in the same playing field as I was was ridiculous. I wasted way too much time having to deal with drama caused by unrelated people and even my own boss. Worst place to work ever.
bad,"I have worked here for 2 1/2 years. Never really had an issue with wanting to leave, until they brought in a VERY inexperienced bakery manager. This company is very about “themselves”, you are expected to Bend over backwards for them and work every single holiday and it’s very hard to get time off unless it’s months in advance. I have called out no more than 4 times in my 2 1/2 years of working for them, and I was a very hard worker and knew everything but was treated like scum because I didn’t suck up to them. The bakery manager harassed me and verbally abused me, with smart comments and being rude and always had a rude tone speaking to me. Never once smiled, had customer complaints because they noticed the rudeness as well. I would suggest not working for them unless you’re single, because you have to give up your life and family or else you will never be “liked” or on their “good side” and get treated very poorly. Come to find out people were being hired on at what I make an hour, when I have worked 2 1/2 years to be where I was at, finding out I had been underpaid for a long time. Horrible job experience towards the end of working here!!"
bad,Very poor management overall.  Poor quality assurance of production.  No one is held accountable.  The place is always dirty.  Staff not cleaning their hands etc.
bad,"awful place to work stressful management"
bad,This is a job for the young and the  elder what I mean by young is teenagers a with no children and the older adults after retirement because there is no enough pay and not enough hours
bad,Just as bad as dollar General. The hours were horrible and I never had a mandatory break! Called corporate multiple times to report the manager and other staff.
bad,"This is the worst place I've ever worked. I worked as a deli associate for 5 months. They recently hired a new co-manager, and this man doesn't know what he's doing. In my part of the deli, I take care of making things for the salad case and putting out samples, and it's only me doing this. I was in the middle of making something and the co-manager wanted to know why I wasn't doing other stuff. I explained that I had stuff I needed to do before doing the samples. Well, after a while he came back and he decided to claim that I was ""refusing to work"", and that according to the deli manager I needed to leave. My coworkers will vouch that I was working the entire time and not refusing to work. I had already put in my notice, but they decided to fire me for some lie anyway."
bad,"They have a section where you put. What hours you can work. They never scheduled me for those hours, which is difficult when you're relying on other rides to get you back and forth."
bad,"This was my first job, and I wouldn't go back here if my life depended on it. The job overall was terrible, but the main reason i quit is this: one manager found out I was leaving and lied to me saying I'd get a raise and all this other stuff to make me stay. Being 16 years old and naive, I said okay, if they trained me for the position I wanted. I had to pretty much beg them to train me for it after I said I'd stay, and while I was training I was helping the girl who was training me set up rewards cards. A different manager came over and said ""You need to be watching the customers instead of helping her. If you're not going to watch them, you're obviously not smart enough to do this job."" I decided that the company wasn't somewhere I would ever come back to, so I finished my shift and never came back ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
bad,There is more drama in this company than there is in meangirls. The current Store manager at store 453 is amazing but i cant say the same for the rest.
bad,"I gave Ingles six years of my life.  I was produce manager and finished as a grocery manager.  I tried to become an assistant store manager but instead of giving me the position, they hired people off of the street for me to train for the spot."
bad,Most of the managers were rude. The book keepers were rude and felt entitled. It was always dirty and just unpleasant. I did not enjoy my time and corporate does nothing.
bad,"The store manager was very strict on employees about buying merchandise but would go take cookies from the bakery. He was very rude and didn’t care about his employees, only about making money"
bad,The only good thing is $10 an hour. Management sucks and there’s too much drama. There’s no benefits at all. There’s not even any holiday pay. The managers picked their favorites and treated everyone else badly.  They send you home for stupid stuff like not telling a manager you’re going on break.
bad,"The Ingles I worked for had a GM that thinks it's okay to play constantly, denigrate women and is uncaring about most of the departments in the store. I worked for Ingles before their new CEO took over. Maybe things have changed."
bad,Customers were the best. Worst management ever!!!! Schedule forever changing throughout the week. Never could make plans and always called in days off with silly questions from workers.
bad,"Workers are racist ! "
bad,Its super busy and mangers don't help during the rush people are very demanding and you have to work all holidays other then when they are closed on Christmas
bad,They under appreciate their hard working employees while trying to hold onto the dead beat employees. The management at multiple stores don't care about their employees. Never  get the raises anyone is promised.
bad,"Got hired to work in Starbucks was not trained. The only training came in between customers. Got thrown in front of a cash register and was magically expected to use it...I'd never used one before. I began to hate it...after some dramatics we will say from the staff, I got relocated to work in the bakery, which is what I wanted to be in with. Showed up to find out I'd be training in the deli, so I thought well I'll give it a try...it was disgusting. Things were left uncovered for flies to land on. After this I was done. These people work in a grocery store & think they are something. I honestly went into this with a open heart and mind as it was my first retail experience, but these people can't get it together."
bad,Horrible beware stay away they talk to you like a dog manager awful all managers awful I'm telling you it's bad stay clear they will tell you to clean toilet when you were hired for something  else
bad,The district/regional managers have so many roadblocks to fire a bad manager or even one committing crimes that they instead transfer them constantly so whether they get sexual complaints or the just manage poorly their superiors would rather avoid the paper work than take action.
bad,the job by itself was stressful I felt over worked I only enjoyed helping the customers most of the time we were short staff so it made the job harder.
bad,Would not recommend because they talk to you anyway they want and upper management think its ok to do so. In front of customers and employees unacceptable for me
bad,No availability for advancement.  No availability for full time.  Seasoned employee are treated unfairly.  Pay does not compensate for length of time employed.
bad,"The managers at Ingles expect you to control things that you cannot (Berievment, medical, etc.) It makes for a toxic work environment. The only good thing is the first job work experience. I really would not recommend working here."
bad,"hated it. it was not good, management didn't care for you, training was short and confusing, never gave me enough hours. over all, not a good place to work at if you're trying to pay rent"
bad,I told ingles I could literally work everyday except Tuesday and I could work 5-11 every single day. They would only give me 3 or 4 days a week and my checks were only one something a week.
bad,we were always short staffed because they refused to hire . So the people working there had to work 3 different positions and get the pay for one.it was long hours and har work.
bad,"It was awful. I worked there a long time, was backstabbed, had credit for my work stole on me countless times. No management skills. They were very manipulative. They overworked you part time and wouldn't give you full time even if you were working 40 hours a week. They picked favorites who didn't have to work. Alot of gossip and drama."
bad,"My job at Ingles was a temporary job. I got the job for experience and it worked well with my culinary school hours. Ingles is not a great place to work, but i went everyday and worked as hard as anybody."
bad,"The environment is toxic and the management is incompetent, not only do they lie about benefits they also don't care about their employees in regards to advancement options."
bad,Horrible company to work for. Require too much for little pay. Management is horrible. This location of managers likes to gossip and keep the drama going.
bad,While working at Ingles in the deli section I was rarely shown any respect by anyone other than the older gentleman that I was closing with. There is no chance for advancement at all in this company.
bad,Took on a role for a set price and for over a year they shorted me 1.50 an hour and when confronted acted like we had no such conversation.  Management only cares about THEIR BONUSES and nothing else. If your not in management then your just a number. And like everyother job in asheville none of them want to pay cost of living. Asheville and companies like this are beyond crooked. The only way to make it here is to own a brewery.
bad,i have learned how to do all kind of donuts and muffins. the hardest part of the job was to get out on time when work is not done. I really enjoy doing donuts.
bad,"not a good place to work, too few hours, poor pay, no benefits, work on all holidays,  work place that treated it's employees like indentured servants"
bad,"Everyone there is stuck in middle school. it is hard to move up and getting a raise after working there a year was impossible too. Managers will scream at you in front of customers for not doing their job. and i was told Quote ""you might as well not even effing show up"""
bad,This place was going into the ground because it was an outdated shopping store. The manager at the time was old and had 0 reasons to be in customer service.
bad,Ive been working at Ingles for a month now and i have been thrown on to doing something that I was trained 20 mins for.  Its like you have to live here in order to work here.
bad,"The time I spent at Ingles was busy, and exhausting. The management was very poor and the pay was even worse. I would never recommend this job to a friend or family member."
bad,Ingles is a racist company. The management and CSM's are horrible . They only care about certain employees. They just care about how the store looks not all of the employees. If you are other the white do not apply to work at ingles at all. Very racist company.
bad,"This store location is very dingy and old. It was my first job so I learned how to handle money and work a cash register here, which was the only good thing that came from working here."
bad,"Ingles does not offer full time employment to anyone except friends and family.  They do not offer discounts, only one 30 min break per 8 hour shift and they tried to element that break.,"
bad,"The employees are treated horribly here. Unless you want to be belittled and verbally abused, Ingles is the perfect place for you. There is no sick leave and the managers will openly trash talk other employees and curse right in front of customers. I have had several customers approach me to complain about not only that, but the sheer amount of homeless that come in to camp and sleep inside the cafe area. It is nowhere near a good work environment. Not to mention all of the equipment we had to work with was always broken, damaged or dull."
bad,long night no help supervisor just need more experience boring only 2 workers per shift and rude management poor performance expect all work to be on one person even when truck comes in
bad,There is such a huge supply and demand. On the other hand they try to run the entire store on a skeleton crew so everyone is frustrated and over worked.
bad,i started in the deli was in no way welcomed there  both managers were hateful not a good way to treat new employees they need to change management soon
bad,I didn't feel comfortable working at ingles thats why i left. I thought the pay was low also but i did work there at a young age so i didn't really mind then
bad,There are no chances for advancement in this particular store. The managers won't even give you the information for you to talk with anyone about advancement.
bad,Not the best place to work.  Everyone that worked there was always in your personal business.  Also if the manager said something to you everyone in the store knew it.  Nothing was private.
bad,"They will tell you in your interview that they will work with your school schedule but they won't. My school schedule was ignored, and I was scheduled on days that I was not available to work. The management team was terrible. If you ever intend on working at Ingles in Athens, TN DO NOT work in the Deli Department!"
bad,"It has been a very long time since I worked in a grocery store, but I am sure it has not changed very much. Long hard hours with little respect for your time and energy."
bad,"If you want high school drama, Ingles is the place to work. They are some of the most unprofessional bunch of ""business"" people I have ever worked for. This place will give you gray hairs at the age of 20."
bad,"I've never worked at a place that was ran as horribly as Ingles.  I personally was bullied by management which upper management did nothing about.  I worked full time without being classified as full time so I was not offered benefits.  Immature actions are taken out on employees such as, a photo of a person the manager did not like was 'liked' on social media so that person who liked it was reprimanded by having their hours cut.  Avoid at all cost!"
bad,"The managers in the deli department in Athens TN use their power to get ""revenge"" on employees just because they don't like you. BEWARE. Pay is good though."
bad,i would work here ever again or advice anyone to work there rude managers and no pay more work then I get paid for and managers are lazy they want  everyone to do there work for them
bad,"Schedule varies from week to week. Hours vary from week to week without warning. Management is a joke. Advancement is virtually non-existent when if/when one takes on tasks he or she was not hired for (no compensation for these additional responsibilities). Honestly, if you're not in high school looking for your first job don't even bother. It is not the same welcoming environment for employees as it is for customers. As far as workplace culture more than a few employees could use sensitivity training. This isnt a place for someone with a degree (even though the job market is slow...BEWARE)"
bad,I Liked the job I did but not the management or people. They will pay you no more than $7.25 and they hire people that are in drugs. They are not professional and lack ethics.
bad,i hate it! my manager in the bakery bragged about going to jail and just not a good manager! Does know hoot take care of things the right way! Someone needs to take her spot
bad,"The management is extremely bad. There is too much favoritism. Hard workers get took advantage of. First shift is lazy, and leaves 2nd shift in bad shape. 2nd shift is expected to have everything perfect no excuses while first shift doesn't do anything. First shift puts all blame on 2nd shift.  You also get in trouble over nothing/false information. There is no room to move up. Your stuck in ypur place. Slackers get away with ""murder"", and caught thieves walk away free. The upper management as no care about issues with managers in the store doing wrong. It is a horrible environment all together."
bad,This company allows its employees to create hostile work environments. This company is too rigid in its practices to allow growth for its employees. This company does not allow enough hours for pharmacist's technicians. This makes the work environment too stressful.
bad,supervisors and management do not work well with others do not give raises but tell you that the job you have to do is a no choice and no raise benifits are bad not worth the price
bad,"This location allows too much drama, harassment, bullying and lying by certain employees that are favored by management. I am looking for a new job cause I can't take it anymore. I have been done wrong by the same employees and co-manager from the very beginning. They allow these kids to run the store and do as they please. Last time I checked this wasn't high school!"
bad,its a great company to work for if your a teen or somebody who doesnt have any real obligations.the management doesnt do their job and the pay isnt that great.
bad,The worst jobs in my entire 60 years. After a knee replacement they would not transfer me. They had me driving 100 miles a day for $10 an hour for three months. My supervisor would lie to the manager. The store manager  make fun of the way I walked .
bad,"This store has poor management, They need new managers and employees all the way around. There too many workers acting up and playing on their phones. I worked my tail off while others goofed off. I complained to every manager in that store and all they say is, we will have a talk or they will take someone off the station. But yet nothing was done. The deli manager has her favorites and she don't have her head on right. They always run out of supplies. Always changing the schedule because she can't keep up with who does what or times etc. She don't have the guts to get onto people herself. She is no kind of manager at all."
bad,"Slow and very unorganized, management would come in 4 or 5 hrs after we were already working, not enough staff, management was very unprepared."
bad,"The worse place to ever work! Management is horrible! The pay sucks and they work you like a slave. You never have time to do the job you are assigned for the day because you have to run around doing everyone job, but nobody wants to help you...There is no teamwork at all, which I blame on poor management. The department does not care about their employees, with an exception of a few picks. It has no structure, just a bunch of employees not being allowed to finish their job, because they do not have enough employees, AND WILL NOT HIRE ANYMORE! You would think the goal would be to keep your employees, assign each one a specific job so that the department would run smooth without drama, and not working the few employees who will work like sweat shop slaves; but their goal including the deli manager is to run their employees away. The turn over rate is pathetic...They cannot keep anyone their due to the mental and physical damaged placed on an employee...and what's sad, they don't care. No benefits, under paid based on what an employee does should be double the amount! Thirty minute short breaks, expect you to stay over to finish because they don't allow you will on your shift from doing 100 other things, Crowded, filled with drama....ONCE AGAIN, BECAUSE OF MANAGEMENT! If they organize the place, care about the employees, stop working PEOPLE like farm animals, it would minimize the stress...which is the reason for the drama. Get rid of the manager in charge...Whether you fail to realize it or not, WITHOUT EMPLOYEES THEIR WOULD BE NO CUSTOMERS TO SERVE! Care about the ones who is"
bad,There were enough hours in the beginning to pay for food and gas to work and school. The hours were flexible around my school schedule.
bad,"Honestly, Ingles is best suited to providing part-time work to high school aged workers. I am a very dedicated, loyal, and hard worker, but I received few hours and little pay. I also saw no room for advancement."
bad,"It would not be a bad place to work, but the management is terrible. They are out of touch with their employees and unwilling to work with schedules and hour needs. Rules and guidelines are not enforced. There has been an unacceptable amount of employee turnover just in the deli department."
bad,I was cooking and waiting on customers keep area clean got along with co workers it is good place to work very clean people got along good
bad,Management located at this Ingles in Flowery Branch are a joke! Never care about the employee. Talk down to the employee. Talk ABOUT the employee(s) to other employees. Communication there is a fail!
bad,"Management does nothing to help resolve conflicts, as they are supposed to do. They will lie to your face about your financial information. They refuse to help you get pay stubs if it takes more than ten seconds worth of effort."
bad,The company doesn't like to hire people on as cashier for full time. They don't like to take care of the rodent problem they have in the gas station. This company comes with no discounts.
bad,"The management at Ingles markets is absolutely awful. Unwilling to work with my schedule or that of my fellow coworkers and has no sense of professionalism at all. Calls out coworker mistakes on the sales floor and in front of customers. Highly recommended not to work here, you'll most likely find it just as awful as I did."
bad,"work fairly simple"
bad,This used to be a place of employment that I loved to go to. Co workers were like family and management cared about you. A lot of friendships have grown in the time working here. But currently under new management everyone including customers are unhappy.
bad,"management sucks. they treat you like dirt and will talk to you any way that they want. they definitely pick favorites, those favorites get away with anything and everything."
bad,"Started out as a cashier ringing people up and worked my way to video manager. I rented movies out to people, made the schedule, kept the department clean and got rentals ready for release. It was an easy job with little challenge. I enjoyed working with the customers."
bad,cashing  scan customer with their grocery if customer need help finding an item I would assist if needed
bad,I was so young and this job was not for me at that time in my life
bad,"Part One, answering what Indeed lists to tell about:"
bad,"no benefits for part time employee's get full time hrs but don't get any benefits, management don't take the employee's serious to much joking around"
bad,"making sanwiches and customer service,how to cut meat,this job was not a hard job,the people i worked with were the most enjoyable part of the job"
bad,was my first job so I was very nervous about what I should do and what I shouldn't do.
bad,"Managers were terrible all around. I worked full time my whole employment, I wasn't tagged ""full time"" in the system, so when 3 of my family members died, I didn't get bereavement. (my mom was one of them). That company could give absolutely no care about what you're going through. The manager was not compassionate about my situation whatsoever after losing my mother. Also, the terrible deli assistant manager who did no work at all, low key harassed me and the managers knew about it and she was NEVER reprimanded. That place is RIDICULOUS. Run far, far away!!"
bad,If you need a job ok well if you are use to having a job don't expect a lot of this one. They don't do anything for you. If you work more then 5 hours. You get 30 min unpaid break. Just stsybaway
bad,"Drama in each department, low pay even if you're doing everybody else job, they hire anybody, lazy and all, they care about their pockets and not much of employees safety or needs to help the store succeed more and they allow employees to get disrespected"
bad,Every person in management is terribly trained. Playing favorite is the only way it works. It's all about who you know. You are just a number. Every few months another manager takes over and tries to change everything.  No raises unless you beg for it. The turn over rate is ridiculous. I have been here 3 yrs. Each department manager makes up their own rules which is not the policy of the store then fights you about it when you question it. This is a drama filled miserable place.
bad,"Doesn't ever help on the front end, always pulling baggers to other parts of the store, sometimes has them sweeping parking lot or sweeping back room storage, watering plants etc. Smokers get at least 2 if not more smoke breaks in addition to a 30 minute lunch break while a non smoker only gets a 30 minute lunch break. To go to bathroom is a joke! You're expected to go to bathroom while on your lunch break. He's been heard talking trash to some of the young men while hanging out at Starbucks super sweet to the younger cashiers, and very disrespectful to some of the older women who works on the front or in the deli. I've decided that when I have grandchildren old  enough to work, I don't want them to work at this store!"
bad,"In the time that I worked for this company I got no discounts of any kind. The manager of this particular Ingles is /was a very nonchalant type of person one of my co workers would come in drunk 8 out of 10 times and she was the cook he threatened to fire her on several occasions but I guess lacked the cahones to do it never once was she wrote up or any disciplinary action taken towards her except a ""stern"" talk to...my immediate manager was never given the authority to hire or fire for her department so that was a joke.I had to call out 3 times due to illnesses of me personally. Never was given any incentive to stay but I did learn a very valuable lesson working here in 20 years of dealing with the public and working in the public there are stupid questions that are asked and people are just plain mean and rude. We had the whole back of the store FLOOD OVER with the local fire department telling us to close the doors but NO our manager said if it isn't impeding  the customers then NO WAY... District manager told us that"
bad,"Management didn’t know half the staff they were over, times and days were not orderly, and there wasn’t much help to be found in the time of need. They pretty much train you for a week and then expected you to know and memorize everything with proper training"
bad,Work culture was poor with management deeming you essentially as solely a body to perform the necessary functions who was an expendable commodity.  Turn over is incredibly high due to overwhelming dissatisfaction across the board.
bad,"I worked there right after I got out of highschool. It was not a pleasant experience. I was part-time, true but I barely managed enough hours to really have it qualify as a job. The environment was stressful, I was poorly trained and left alone after three days which lead to me messing up alot as I barely knew what I was doing and had no one to guide me. Management was coarse and neglectful and the pay was barely minimum wage."
bad,Very strict. I really didn't like this job. Most of the mangers were overly strict. The job was fine the employees were awesome. Most of the customers were very rude.
bad,Unfair place to work employees were not treated the way they should be treated. For the work you had to do you sure didn't get paid what it was worth.
bad,"Management only wants to hire part time employees so they don't have to provide benefits. They had two different managers over the deli and neither one was involved with the employees. Upper management made rash decisions and fired employees without cause. Management looked down on employees. They didn't care to discuss future advancement. No benefits, no discounts. And Ingles throws away all their food that could be given to a food bank."
bad,"lack of structure and leadership .No chance of advancement.asked to above and beyond your job position with no chance of compensation.Made to go behind others to check that theyve done their work,when I am not a manager."
bad,If you have never had a job and  need to start this is  a beginners job for someone who maybe in high school and may want extra cash during the summer.
bad,"Was a horrible work environment , harassment, back biting, talking about everyone else behind their back, treating everyone like they where 12 years old. Management was horrible. There was no enjoyable part of the job. They acted like it was a horrible chore to come relieve you for 30 minutes so you could go take lunch. ,"
bad,the job I had there in the deli was easy but the supervisor I worked for was awful I also didn't like the atmosphere it was very angry.
bad,"Absolutely appalling place to work. The management resorts to thinly veiled threats to make you work on ""off"" days. Store manager is highly disrespectful and will confront and insult you openly in front of coworkers and customers alike. Company policy will allow them to fire you for any reason, or no reason at all if the store manager is in a bad mood. Also, the healthcare plan they offer is terrible as it only offers reimbursement for any bills you incur. You still have to pay for any and all medication and treatment upfront. Don't let your kids work here. Don't shop here. Avoid it like the plague."
bad,Working at Ingles (on the poor hours they grace me with) has been a downright boring. Our ingles has three good managers and one A-hole. If you are a service clerk here then I wish you luck at your store. Hours are distributed randomly with some having 35 to 8 while favoritism does take place as well.
bad,"Management was very unreliable and would not call in to replace a missing worker, which happened everyday so the workload on everyone else is harder and more stressful. not enough product or too much was always ordered. NO benefits or advancement at all, even with great performance reviews the managers would play favorites. Very unsafe environment. However with all of the bad things something good did happen. I learned to solve problems for myself and realized that I could handle customers better than top management."
bad,"I learned how to manage money more efficiently while strengthening my customer service skills. However, in times where teamwork was necessary or desirable, I was limited but managed to complete many tasks on my own."
bad,"I don't know what it is about Ingles as a franchise, but it sounds like it is notorious for having terrible management. The managers were some of the rudest, most lazy excuses for workers I have ever seen. They did not treat any but a few of the workers with respect and expected the impossible from them. All for extremely low pay as they are a dying brand. And don't be thrilled if you're suddenly hired during the holidays since there's a chance you will get no training yet still be expected to do all the procedures you never knew existed. Have fun!"
bad,"They like to think that they offer ""flexible hours"" as long as you are there between 8:30-5:30.   Don't dare exit the office space before 5:30p, even if you have worked several long days the same week.    They will notice and they will reprimand you like a brand new employee to their first job.  Cameras are everywhere and they are watched by mid management because they clearly don't have enough to do otherwise.  "
bad,Ingles market was not a good place for me. I became pregnant September 2016 and was placed in the hospital due to high risk pregnancy. They knew that I had Type One diabetes from the beginning and refused to let me take my break at the reasonable time which led me to have low glucose levels causing me to almost lose my child. Then got upset when I couldn’t come into work because I was in the hospital.
bad,"Disrespectful managers, bad scheduling, bad hours ...good costumers there very respectful but really lazy disrespectful employees that work there including the managers"
bad,Promised full time with health ins then put on part time by management which wiped out health insurance as soon as it started.  Management can be very nasty in the way they speak to you. They would rather speak down to you than jusy speak to you. Most workers have had run ins with management. Complaints are not heatd.
bad,Store manager is clueless about how to run the store and to treat his employees. Not much advancement for females. Unfair treatment. The store runs very slowly in the winter and is fast paced in the summer. They like all of the company are always hiring but unlike most other stores... this one there is no wonder no one wants to work there. Word gets around in a small town.
bad,"I’m a former employee and would NOT recommend this place to anyone. Especially 3rd shift. It’s like slavery how management treats you there!! The third shift manager is a complete jerk, he will degrade you and say you’re slow while he does literally half the work. Tons of health code violations, such as mold on the walls in the stockroom and cockroaches as well. Cockroaches!! And don’t think about bringing these things to the managers attention because then they will try and fire you!! Or make your job living pain! They definitely think there is an I in team there."
bad,"A typical workday was high stress, with no ancillary help. I learned they don't follow through with promises. Store management is overworked. Corporate management are only ""yes men"" to the VPs.  Workplace culture is unprofessional with high turn over.  The most frustrating part of the job is dealing with managers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was leaving."
bad,"Ingles Market work place is poorly managed, stressful, busy, and understaffed. They do not follow all health codes as well as they should be, and the store management is incompetent."
bad,"The work day is hours on your feet. Any training was negligible.  Management has no idea of investing in positive growth. "
bad,"Ingles doesn't care about their employees. The turn over is ridiculous, and the pay is terrible for what they expect of you. I do not recommend working for this company."
bad,The management was very poor in my opinion and they refused to put me on full time even though I was working 37 hours a week. I often had to work 6 or 7 days at a time with no day off.
bad,Vgighhxggghfddgvvhgfhvvdffffuuuccckkkkkm(kkknnbgfgxyxgfygkgicufudyfivkgkfhdbduvkvjdyatzuv8gif7v9g8c7 i ivivivi uvigjeu. Ivivigkfidysycuuxhdhzjtdktxtjzktt
bad,So they claim to be a family friendly work environment and say that your family is important to them then the deli manager straight out will tell you you'll lose your job if you don't come in the day your child has a dr appointment and isn't breathing when they fall asleep and you've even told her that. Night shift associates are nice there but if you have kids and they have any medical issues dont think the managers will work with you.
bad,Every schedule week would constantly change causing life outside of work to take a backseat to a part time job that did not pay enough. customers were terrible and so was management
bad,"While I worked there for the two years that I did, the company had changed at least 3-4 different managers.  With that said, there is clearly an issue with management.  It's a grocery store so it's nasty anyway because of the food, especially the raw meats.  Customers can be rude as well."
bad,"I've been working for Ingles as a cashier for 2 years now and I have only received a 25 cent raise. I have given them the availability of 36 hours and I only get about 13 a week Meaning that I only make about $100 a week before tax. I would say that this is the hardest part of the job. However, the most enjoyable part of being a cashier at Ingles would have to be conversing with all different kinds of people and learning how to handle the different situations brought to me."
bad,"Constant violations of hippa laws"
bad,"Ingles Deli had to much drama and could not keep regular staff. The manager really did not know her job well and it was like working in a mad house. I quit to be at home with my boys during the summer, at that time they were to young to stay home alone."
bad,"I worked for this company for a year. I could only work 21 hours a week. The manager could never get my schedule correct. When i worked 2nd shift, 1st shift left work responsiblities for 2nd shift that were supposed to be done on 1st shift. If you had a problem  yyou could not discuss it with management because it did no good to express your opinion. Also, the wastefulness of the company was ridiculous. I would not recommend working for this company"
bad,I have worked there for 1 year and I hate it right now! Can't wait to find another job asap. Management is horrible they do not no how to run a business!!!
bad,In my experience as a 10 year department head. I seen on numerous occasions upper management enjoying making employees uncomfortable and scared. It seems that ingles has to many manager with different opinions on how they want things to be. The right hand has no idea what the left hand is doing basically.
bad,"I don't like it. I had a racist manager who didn't care for anyone's weekend schedule but his own, granted no raise for hardworking/loyal employees and also didn't give enough hours but like giving ridiculous shifts such as 7am-12pm."
bad,"Not a very bad place to work, but if you are a hard working person, and cannot stand to do other people's job, then this is not for you."
bad,"I've been working for Ingles for a good few months now. But if I would have known and seen what I'm going through now I would have never applied. The job its self is easy and most of my co-workers are extremely friendly and helpful. The real problem is management, very inconsistent, unprofessional, and just plain out rude. The new store manger is terrible. The money is terrible and good luck with trying advancement unless you're a favorite. It's really sad that people who work their butts off never get the credit deserved."
bad,Cook/  put chickens on rotisery/ fix reciecpts/ fix hot bar and place food in hot bar/ fix any orders that is on board. wait on costumers.  It is not always easy when you have alot of orders and still have a  regular job to do.  They sometimes get in way when you try to get things done before you leave for the day. When you have someone that wants to play around and not do their work; it gets very bad when you need some help and no one wants to help. keep up on holidays. Some coworkers and costumers that you keep seeing every day makes your day when they just say hi to you.
bad,all ways busy too much favoritism going to work everyday the most enjoyable part of the job was when I finally left the company
bad,The stores may be different but the warehouse is run by abusive small town small minded dysfunctional and incompetent managers who have had no managerial training. They are there only because they've been there so long. They allow for sexual harassment by some employees. They create the very friction they are trying to prevent. They don't know any better because they have never been challenged. There is no real competition around here so they get away with this and the fact that the ware house is filthy with a leaky roof and shelving that intentionally allows for wasted food. Its very sad and disgusting to watch.
bad,"The manager at Ingles in Granite Falls is too complacent in his job. Too much socializing and too many ""friends"" in office. Good ole boys club, Corporate could care less."
bad,"ingles is a terrible place to work. they pick favorites, no raises to the people who actually work. christmas bonuses are cheap gift cards to the store itself."
bad,"A typical day at work is full of trying to help customers as best as I can and getting yelled at by incompetent managers who do not take responsibility for their actions. I love working with people and getting to know so many different customers and employees, but the managers at Ingles make life feel miserable. They dodge responsibility, ignore personal requests or issues that are brought up to them, and on many occasions, they needlessly berate employees even when there was no reason too (The employee didn't do anything wrong or break policy in any way)."
bad,"Not very well managed, the workers and management were not very friendly. The management are rude to you even when you first start and are learning. Wouldn’t recommend this job."
bad,"No Discounts!!!!!"
bad,Very poor managment. Loved the work the managers were very rude. Doesnt allow advancement or the chance for full time usually. He has a very poor attitude mainly toward women.
bad,"The manager have their favorite who they like to work in certain position and let them slack off on work, while they work the least favorite employee`s til they are fatigued and exhausted."
bad,"The pay was low,  promised FT stayed PT, Manger was horrible didnt care to advance women, Manger yelled and intimidated workers, Without FT there were no vacation days or PTO..Worst job ive ever had!"
bad,"Run by morons who don't care the slightest bit about their employees. If they can squeeze one more penny by cutting just one more corner, they will, and the employees suffer for it."
bad,"Sleaziest place to work. A bunch of minimum wage trailer trash individuals. Everyone treats each other like garbage. They like to hire straight out of high school, almost like they set up a booth like the military does. A bunch of trailer trash high schoolers with attitudes that treat the job like they’re at high school.  Old people over the age of 70 with attitudes. Management is disgusting. Either teenagers with an ego or older individuals who could give less about anything. The current store manager is an absentee who does a better job as a stocker than anything else. It’s an absolute trash heap. The customers are just as bad. Don’t ever work there. Ever. Save yourself the stress, wrinkles and time of your life. It would actually be better suited at the nearby Burger King. Absolute worst job I’ve ever had. It will make you feel like you failed at life to end up there. Go join the military or kill yourself. Either is better than working there."
bad,There is way too much drama. the manager did nothing to discourage it and in some instance encouraged it. They would actively make fun of the appearance of their workers behind their backs
bad,"No management skills, no training, constant harassment from management leaving no job security. Deception. Broken promises, being cursed at. Being humiliated and talked down to in front of customers"
bad,"Stressful environment, harsh bosses, poor baggers, quick paced, fair pay, poor organization, easy clock in and out, easy job duties but stressful and quickly moving"
bad,doesn't favor female advancement. two full-time males were hired in after me and I  was still part-time. most workers seemed stressed all the time and there were cliques within the store
bad,"The pay was bare minimum, the managers were mean, i ruined lots of clothes with bleach (khakkis because the require you to wear them) nothing was ever free. horrible experience."
bad,"I have worked here less than two months, and I hurt my hand. They did not even offer to help with the costs much less if I want to work or not. This is not the greatest place to work."
bad,"Usually would have to put everything to the aside, especially my education. There are certain tasks that you must do that are not mentioned on the original application."
bad,You deal with customers all day long. The management was not so good at their job. co-workers are nice. The hardest part of the day is walking in the heat getting the buggies.
bad,"management is awful, doesn't work with scheduling due to kids and school, customers are nice but become rude do the manager no doing their jobs, lots of gossiping, non professional work place"
bad,"The management was horrible, my working schedule always conflicted with my schooling and extra curriculiar activities, the people were rude, and my manager was inconsiderate."
bad,dum. i hated it an it was nothing but drama. but i did learn how to work an get the job done
bad,"It was very unorganized. Poor management. Corporate would not listen to our concerns, at least in the deli. No room for advancement. The store stayed clean and we were known for being one of the best stores for customer service, but other than that there isn't much positive I can think of, in my experience at least."
bad,"Management at the Hayesville Ingles is very poor. They do not care for their staff and could care less if you are deathly sick or anything as long as you are at work. Greg Hughes gets a bonus every christmas and the amount was $20,000 last Christmas while his employees work hard for the little bit of money that's paid there. How do I know? He bragged about it."
bad,"No proper training, employees will lie on your name and make up false allegations, hours will get cut for no reason at all unless you talk to a supervisor about why."
bad,"As a part-time employee, it was very difficult get time off.  The owner told you straight out that he would fire you if you asked for time off.  Its a part time job!!!"
bad,"Worked here for 10 months and it was miserable. Loved working fast food compared to this job. Management was the absolute worst, in my 10 months here I was given very little training and then thrown into specific positions in the deli. Always low staffed so had to contribute to others jobs as well as my own and got written up when it wasn’t completed correctly, again very little training. Absolutely do not recommend this job to anyone!"
bad,"Management doesn't follow through,  you are guilty before you even go to court.  Some coworkers are hard working,  others are just crazy ~ you should want your customers met with a smile but you don't get it as a customer or coworker"
bad,"Consolidate pallets for 2-3 hours, lots of bending, you learn to stock, rotate and remove merchandise. Gotta be fast with everything or the management will complain about the over time when there is not enough man power to fulfill the demand of finishing on time. I would not recommend working at ingles to make it a career but would recommend solely for temporary employment until a better job is found."
bad,I really enjoyed the position as a  scanning coordinator and the store manager that I was under was delightful. He put me into the store manager training program and that was exciting. Shortly after I became a store manager they changed district managers.
bad,Mangager in the deli is evil and unfair. She has absolute no regards for you or your well being. She will speak to you as if you are nothing and make you feel incompetent. I have seen her run off employees as soon as the first week. The employees who have been there a long time do whatever they want and put all the work on the people who don't stand up for themselves. A lot of unnecessary drama. Something needs to be done about that deli. Do not work here unless you want to be stressed out everyday!
bad,"The particular store I worked in had very incompetent management."
bad,"I run the register and I run Uscan. Clock in, scan groceries, bag, and ask to help takeout buggies. Hardest part: standing on my feet all day."
bad,The ingles I worked at had poor management. They wouldn't work with you and they complained about you Ben asking to change your schedule
bad,"Maintain the cases of product, interact with customers. Make quality product for purchase by customers. Rotate stock and check dates on existing inventory to make sure we had fresh product available."
bad,Had many schedule conflicts due to their inflexibility. Expected this PART TIME job to be my TOP PRIORITY. Managers were rude and talked down to many workers including myself.
bad,They make you pay for your drink I used to work for a company where you can get your drinks for free. they make you clock out but they don't pay for your break. they don't even discount the food.  today I wanted to get a cup of water they wanted to charge me for it from the soda fountain. I used to work for a company where they were discounted by 25% when you're on the clock for food.
bad,Awful managment and even worse pay compensation incentives. 0.25$ a year (if even) the hours became worse over time due to lack of employees on stock team.
bad,Most of the co-workers at Ingles are frightened because Ingles fire people for very small and significant reasons. They're always trying to hire but have no problem letting go of good workers.
bad,They don't pay their employees for time worked and lie about giving you a raise.  The hardest part of the job was always being short staffed during a shift.
bad,"This is where you go to get your first job because it pays, which you wouldn't probably be used to, so you wouldn't realize that minimum wage isn't nearly enough for what you do there. Don't do it."
bad,Management was the worst part of this job. Store manager throws employees under the bus for everything so she could reach her sales goals and get her six figure bonus while paying her employees nothing. You were lucky to get a 25 cent raise a year. Again...management is horrible! DO NOT work for this company....you will regret it!
bad,"Over all I enjoyed my co workers that were on the same levels as me (Cahsiers, baggers, ect.) but most of the upper management was very rude. They have no respect for personal situations, no understanding for mistakes, and often jump straight to conclusions. The Store manager especially has no respect for any type of family emergencies."
bad,"When your manager does not care what transpires inside the deli and the rest of the work force know that, then there is the idea that well they do not care so neither do I. It makes for a very unfavorable work place."
bad,"Since there has been a high volume of turnover's within the company, a lot of staff starting feeling like there was no longer any job security, no matter of the length of time with the company. I learned from being here at Ingleside that, I loved being of service to others, especially those who really appreciate what you do for them."
bad,"The first thing is your saftey with all the chemicals you have to watch what you are doing. my co workers and I got along  very well, I learned that customers are always right and first. The  deli managers well we went through three or four the time I was there. The hardest part of the job was keeping yourself calm when you had customers with attitudes and yelling at you. The most enjoyable thing was cleaning and helping people out as much as possible"
bad,"• Manage cashiers, service clerks, and bookkeepers while overseeing business operations"
bad,The worst training I've ever had in my career. The only positive thing was the coworkers and department manager were very friendly. I would never work for this company again. Nor would I reccomend it.
bad,I wouldn't Waste anymore of a Nickel or a Dime of my Time there. Like really They suck with the staff hiring. One minute when they hire new people at the starting they'll be expecting a bit more outta you in the next 2 months. Plus side Mgmt Sucks lil bit on Late nights and Some what at Mid Day shift You'll never know it Till you see it's like nothing new but always with the same vibe. #working in a different Department is a lot better then the front end. #if they can afford to make a spot for you to work there.
bad,"Management will lie to you about your raises, mainly you would be throw into the job with no training, and they make you work every weekend,management would forget about 2 shift,so they would be short handed everynight. Plus on 2nd you will feel like a babysitter work with kids.its jt nobody cares about making your job hader."
bad,"Horrible Pay, not worth the effort of the actual job. Baggers do the most work in the whole store but get paid less than anyone else. Cashiers get paid more and all they do is stand in one spot all day. Baggers are to clean the whole store and get shopping carts from outside. Horrible job do not work here."
bad,I have enjoyed working there over a year. ;I just am not getting enough hours I have to work at different Ingles just to get the hours when my own Ingles that hired me can't give me the hours cause they are giving it to everyone else.
bad,was cashier made sure the customer was take care of. took money for each trans action
bad,The management did a horrible job the started cutting my hours till 4 hours 2 days a week asked for more hours didn’t receive other workers asked and they received
bad,Witness many times the Store manager talking down to the female employees and bullying them. I have seen one of the female employees crying. The manager is very unreasonable and hard to get along with. The morale of the store is very low.
bad,This company views you as a number and that is all. They have no regard for you as a person. All you are to them is a body to fill a position. I was miserable working there.
bad,"This job was so bad that I ended up quitting within 6 months because I got tired of being neglected for breaks"
bad,My experience at Ingles was extremely terrible and I'm still having to pay for the effects it had on my mental health. The management is completely unfair.
bad,"typical day at work would be kind of busy, learned how to multitask, management is alright, hardest part of the job was trying to scan fast to be able to avoid long lines, the most enjoyable part was when it was played back you had time to get to know your coworkers."
bad,You really shouldn't work here unless there is no other option. Poor management decisions that are never reconsidered even after being openly questioned.
bad,"Amazing place to shop, expensive stuff, more for rich people but overall amazing stuff. working for the deli is more for slaves, they are rude and over work you way to much. Very rude deli manager who thinks shes better than others when she is not."
bad,I would not recommend this company to anyone. They do not appreciate employees with good work ethics. A person is not paid according to difficulty of job.
bad,You aren't really treated fairly here at all. Over worked and underpaid seemed to be a problem. Wouldn't recommend for anyone unless they were desperate need of a job.
bad,"Loved my job there till I saw how things where handled by management, and allowed the things that went on to continue to happen."
bad,loved the customers and all the people I worked with the public is who I work for because making customers happy is what makes me happy.
bad,"My day consisted of stocking the dairy department, rotating products, and filling milk. I often get pulled to help in other departments so I was unable to finish my own work. The management team was very unorganized and lacked respect for the employees. I have worked for Ingles for many years and transferred to different stores because of the management in the past. Not the best company."
bad,"I've worked hard, and have been in management spots in this co. they are unfair on how they treat employee's that truly work hard for them. max out in pay in dept. that if you are one of the best you should be rewarded by a raise even if it's a yearly inflation, I've worked with this co. for almost 7 yrs. and have never gotten a raise, even though I have gone over and beyond my  position helping anyone who needed it."
bad,"Working as a front cashier and in the deli was very busy and sometimes stressful but i maintain and got through,meny who has worked their has learned to become patient, determine,and willing to what need to do, so that they can prepare for the next work day.working at ingles is very much time comsumeing."
bad,"Working at Ingles is a very fun and great place to work at. I work in multiple positions at the store, the manager as friendly and great to get along with. I look at my co workers as family because that's how we treat one another. the best part of working there is just getting along with everyone and knowing that your going to have a great day."
bad,A typical work day here at Ingles would be a lot of work . You have to work fast while serving customers great satisfaction so they can come back
bad,I am particular about being organized and things in their place. I am diligent in rotation of stock and customer service.
bad,"Not a great place to work"
bad,The management was slow and unprofessional. Took weeks for me to even be put into system. I tried to relocate and no one would listen to me. They were rude and worked you like a dog considering no one wanted to work there.
bad,"Working the night shift is a time when Management decides to treat employees any way they please. I was untrained and doing things for the first time. No help what so ever from the supervisor. Just looks of disgust while I tried to help unload a Truck. All throughout the night people telling me ""you better hurry up!"", Your too slow, Speed up! I remember one night when the Manager was pushing another employee so hard; that employee snapped and got in his face to cuss him out. Over all I had enough of this hostile work environment and quit."
bad,"I’ve seen people get fired over things that was not their fault. I’ve seen a co-manager  completely ignore customers and treat them like children and not give them the time of day,  the same manager is also sexist. It doesn’t matter if you do your work and everything you are asked it’s still not good enough yet the coworkers that slack off get praised. The management is prett sucky they don’t  communicate with their employees or anyone else for that matter. If you are a younger female be prepared to get hit on and possibly harassed especially if you  catch one of the managers eyes."
bad,"I wouldn’t not recommend the job, but the job wasn’t for me at all. I didn't enjoy it, I was miserable the entire time. The managers are disrespectful and doesn’t understand the concept of respect."
bad,"great job for High school kid. Im looking for a new job. Benefits are only offered to full time and they are not the best. No raise. will get hired for full time but management gives part time hours, great food."
bad,"Isn't a good job for a long period of time, just a part-time job to give you some extra money, mostly teenagers, and older people or retired individuals."
bad,"horrible hours, low pay physically demanding work a lack of solid management and no credible appreciation for strong work ethic and initiative. poorly kept store and work environment."
bad,Management is awful and always in a bad mood. Your typical day at work is very stressful. The customers are always cranky and are never satisfied no matter how nice you are to them. Most co-workers don't want to be there and hate coming to work here. The hardest part of the job would be the management and the customers attitude.
bad,"Clean"
bad,"You have no life, if you request 1 day off for a school activity they cut your hours almost completely. I ripped my pants on the job one day and the GM was so mean about it and would not let me change. I got sick and threw up all over myself and the GM was a jerk about having to let me leave work early. Just would not recommend Ingles."
bad,"Not a great place to work at all, everyone is fighting for a job and most people end up leaving after one week. With most places everyone works as a team, but here no no. Everyone looks out for themselves and no one else."
bad,Not the best place to work when providing for a family. They are decent with working around my schedule with my son but still doesn't make up for my the compensation part of living.
bad,I could never consciously recommend working for ingles markets after working there for over a year new employees were starting 50 cents over me with the only raise I would be able to get being a 25 cent raise while i was training all the new employees. Also once saw a employee lick a spoon they were using to prepare food then continue to use it and when it was brought up to management nothing was done about it and I got yelled at for it.
bad,"Management while I was there was terrible. If the manager did not like you, she did her best to cut hours and make working there miserable if she could. The customers were okay and the pay wasn't that great either. You do get a 25 cent raise, but you only get this based on your performance. So, if the manager did not like you, she would find anything to not give you your raise, even if you did everything right to the best of your ability and no customer complaints. Other than that, it's great for a first job and it really helps with your customer services skills. Some coworkers were great to have and others weren't. But what really made this job so bad was management. There was SO much favoritism. Luckily, that management team is not there anymore and I hope it is a better place to work now than it was when I was an employee there."
bad,"Do your home work, before working there.. I feel the at the store I work lack of communication from management not fair when it comes down to promoting Within"
bad,"I worked in the deli it was very stressful, the manager only knew how to yell at people, and talk bad about everyone, had her favorites and they could do whatever they wanted even take 3 breaks a day, she would give you your lunch break 6-7 hour after you have been working, I seen over 40 employees quit in a year because of management"
bad,"Besides the friendly people in the front, the management and all they expect is terrible. You’re forced to deal with discrimination, the managers have favorites and begin cutting hours if you’re not one of them"
bad,"Not really a good 1st job if you don't like messing with food, plus the kitchen is terrible and small and everyone and everything is in your way. The slicers were dirty and was never properly cleaned and sanitized. Manager seemed irritated while asking questions on things, was told by mulitple people who work there that is was a terrible place to work and disorganized."
bad,"Ingles is a good job to start out in. Like a high school student looking for a side job. It is definitely not a career you want to be in for long. I’m thankful for the learning experiences, but not the best work environment."
bad,"Good for teenagers but not for much else, it's something to do when you're between actual jobs. There's not much room for advancement and no real perks."
bad,"You get paid the bare minimum with no chance of a wage increase unless you are hired as a manager. Outdated computer systems make it difficult to properly and quickly address customers, as you had to run to a separate kiosk to look up an Ingles card number."
bad,"low wages, no benefits, no lunch room, extremely poor management, closed only on Christmas day. Good workers are just worked harder, while lazy workers prevail."
bad,"If you are a member of any protected class, you will not be respected in this work environment. I strongly suggest you work somewhere else. If you're not, go for it. "
bad,Very low pay scale to make ends meet.  Negitive environment and poor management.  There were issues in this particular store that management was aware of but chose to ignore.
bad,management had no idea what was required to perform the job and really didn't ask about the health and welfare of the drivers
bad,"A typical day at work is somewhat tolerable. I've certainly learned how to maintain a positive attitude. The management has slowly started to downfall with all the young CSM's being hired. They are also inconsiderate to days requested off. My co-workers on the other hand are supportive and help me get through the day. The few good decisions that management has made, has been hiring cashiers and service clerks. The most enjoyable part of the job is probably the customers. Although some may become slightly annoying, you have your memorable moments."
bad,The time at Ingles has been one of lowered expectations and frustration with the treatment of employees from the higher-ups. I do enjoy interacting with the customers.
bad,"A typical work day is just the necessary things that need done: wash dishes, put dishes up, put out the bread for the morning shift, make backups for the sub bar, make subs, slice meat/cheese, get people their food from the hot bar, get their chicken salad/potato salad/banana pudding/red skin potato salad, etc."
bad,"Temporary second job as a cashier to supplement household income. Very low pay, not reliable hours, no benefits, sometimes no breaks. This job is sort of a last resort job."
bad,All work no play. Supervisors were very strict and not very kind. Co-workers were fearful of losing their position and didn't like to show emotion. The hardest part of my job was pleasing the supervisors but the most enjoyable part was pleasing the customers who shopped there.
bad,"When i worked at ingles, the assistant store manager (not even the one in my department though on what ended up being my last day i did hear her talking behind my back because i misunderstood something) was very poor at his job and very creepy. he often stared at women and made me extremely uncomfortable."
bad,"Under staffed, expect same amount of work no matter how many employees they have. No respect for the employee. If u are full time they expect u to be available 24/7"
bad,Very poor management. Management and regular employees have a high turnover rate. Lots of micromanaging from upper management and never enough staff to complete the job in a timely manner.
bad,"This was a terrible store to work at due to bad management .  Favoritism was rampant , the employee turnover rate was very high ...so you were often short staffed. When Corporate would come they would make a big deal out of  * helping* on the floor. It was hard to get classified as Fulltime even when you worked that number of hours. They made it seem like doing you a huge favor at your Annual Review by giving you a whopping 25 Cents an hour  * raise * ...  It was a Toxic environment. Thank goodness for some good Co-workers ."
bad,"Pay is terrible,  especially in you work in deli. Little regard for maintenance and good working equipment."
bad,Schedule is not flexible at all. They get mad at you if you call out. Management is just as bad. They are too strict and too annoying. People at ingles do not get payed enough to be stressing over these clown managers.
bad,Management is horrible. Constant targeting and bullying. Always felt on edge or if I was going to be a ploy to my managers bullying. Not everyone was horrible but most people were influenced.
bad,"Like most stores you're required to be on your feet for extended periods of time. Raises are rare and sporadic, and typically not very good. You're expendable and replaceable and the management treats you as such. It's a decent job for high school kids if they're not expecting much other than basic work experience and to generally be treated very poorly."
bad,"I have worked at Ingles for over a year and on top of that am in highschool. They refuse to work with my secdual and whenever I talk to them about it they just blow me off. For some people it's an amazing job, but for many more it's hated. I would gladly leave the second I got to."
bad,Typical shift was 11-7. You're on your feet a lot and it can be stressful at times. I was a cashier in the deli and also assisted with preparing food and cleaning. The co-workers really made it bearable.
bad,Hope you do not get hurt or sick from the employees w kids. Sanitary conditions are very poor the place is seldom wiped down and cleaned. Subs are made on counter that is tainted w chicken blood or raw meat. Poor customers
bad,"hate this job so much "
bad,It is a horrible place to work. The management is horrible. No one in management knows what they are doing or what they are talking about. They do not know how to communicate well. These is no help when help is needed.
bad,Ok company some areas understaffed. Mgt. is good for the most part some areas of mgt. Need to be looked into because of the buddies system makes it not a pleasant place to work
bad,"poor management, no organization at ALL, the deli is infested with pesty roaches, flies, and knats swaming all around the food in the deli. The equipment we have to work with is old and breaks down a lot. they need OSH and need to be inspected ASAP. It is a total disaster."
bad,Working here was fun at times. the customer service managers were always great but the store managers were more rude. Even if you requested a day off a month ahead you still wouldnt get off.
bad,"You worked 8 hour shifts for minimum wage. I personally didn't like it because I constantly felt like someone was breathing down my neck and I wasn't allowed to mess up. Also, I always had to clean the bathrooms."
bad,open the store making sure things are done so customers can get what they need helping customers get what they need throught the day stocking items as you go hardest part of the day is never its always the same
bad,"So its what you think of your typical job stocking groceries overnight. the hours are long, its really hard work, and you don't get paid enough to deal with the amount of drama that goes on in the workplace."
bad,"Ingles is an easy going store that is good for the kids who are just starting their work experience. It teaches you what working is like and they work with your school schedule. Unfortunately, it did not challenge me at all, and that's what I was looking for when starting my career life."
bad,"The store on carbon city road in particular, is a terrible place to work. Your hours are not stable, you get no benefits and the management is atrocious."
bad,"Good place to work, management is lacking in basic people skills.I worked in the deli dept sliced meats and cheeses served salads, worked the sub bar made sandwiches pizzas Asian foods. Did all chicken in deli...fried and rotisserie. Cleaned deli did dishes stocked what needed to be stocked."
bad,"I like the work I do, but there is no communication between management and staff. Changes are made without any notice, and the employee's are expected to guess at what is going on, which creates for a bad work environment.The department I work in is unorganized, cluttered, unclean, and unsafe.I have fallen once, because of the arrangement of the crowded equipment, stabbed by sharp objects that stick out, and by fellow employees who are not polite enough to ask or tell you to step aside so they can push carts. Boxes (empty) are left piled up on the floor, work tables, etc. Bullying is permitted by the idiots Ingles hires as MALE shift supervisors."
bad,"A typical day at work, well I order product, stock shelves and try to help customers.  I have learned that things are made extremely difficult to accomplish over the smallest, silliest things.  The Management, well....  No Comment.  Most of my co-workers are great people, but each individual is treated very differently and sometimes completely unfairly.  The hardest part of the job is trying to make a customer happy when you are not given the tools to do so.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to talk to people."
bad,"Working at Ingle's can be rewarding at other locations, but the South Forest shopping center location is a mess from the management down."
bad,"if you want to get along with bad management and have them cut your hours just cause someone new is working go ahead, and very bad managment"
bad,Don't work here. Awful managers. Poor environment. Childish workers! It started out amazing and fun and i thought the pay was nice until it just got too hard to deal with. I put in my 2 weeks and stopped coming 2 days after.
bad,i was at work on time everyday. I learned how to look up upc codes. management was ok. hardest part of the job was having to stand behind the counter all the time. i didn't have a most enjoyable part it was just some were to work to keep my on my feet.
bad,"Bosses were horrible. Pay was horrible."
bad,Relies heavily on the good old boy system. Some employees are expected to do all the work while others are allowed to stand around and talk. The same rules do not apply to everyone. Management are rarely ever helpful and put their work off on everyone else. 
bad,This was not one of my favorite companies to work for. They are not concerned with employees because they prefer turnover as opposed to having hard working life long dependable employees who they would need to give raises to.
bad,"The management works you a lot like A LOT AND THEy don’t pay you as much as you should be getting for your work, they also like to micromanage you for the littlest things."
bad,Pay wasn’t very good. Managers weren’t very nice. Coworkers were friendly. Got fired for listening to music in the parking lot with my earbuds in while collecting carts.
bad,"Working at the Help Desk, 40 hrs+ per week, at a pay scale 15% lower than the national average. The department is understaffed.  The work load is constantly increasing.  Everyone has a breaking point and we will see burnout happening more frequently for those who try to stay, hoping it will get better.  It won't.  Management practices preferential treatment. Most current employees are looking for other employment opportunities.  Save your sanity and don't even contemplate working there."
bad,If you want a job it’s just that but if you can’t work under a lot of stress be careful it is hard but I was on 3rd so other shifts might not be as bad
bad,"Management needs improvement. They change the schedule all the time and don't say anything until you're ""late to work"". They will do that and fire you unless you have some kind of proof of your schedule. No insurance or benefits offered. The work isn't hard, just face paced."
bad,"One of the worst companies I've ever worked for the management is horrible they do not care about their employees they treat their employees like dirt "
bad,I got hours for the first month but after that they cut your hours. They don’t pay you over minimum wage and for sure don’t give you over time. They will make you do other jobs that are not listed on your job description because
bad,"What I learned from this experience, I do not want to work in the grocery business due to their typical days. The management needs improvement along with the employees under them."
bad,"Depressing atmosphere, verbally abusive coworkers, inflexible hours, overly strict bosses. Being an employee there is not worth the pay, evident in the fact that every few months an entirely new staff will be on the payroll because everyone else has already quit. Best part of the job is early morning shifts on weekends when no one would be in and the most easy going manager would be there. Worst part is dealing with coworkers and managers who won't even let you keep bottled water at your station during an eight hour wok day."
bad,"ever since i started there a year ago ive wanted to quit, i only stayed cause they kept showing me new things,but then they depended on me for everything, and i never got a fair raise for my hard work. management couldnt care about their employees they just fill departments with bodies and not actual hardworkers. its also tiring to be yelled at and belittled for personal problems by ur manager."
bad,once you get here----and they will try to put u in the Deli....WATCH OUT!!...you will get stuck and they WILL NOT MOVE YOU no matter what you do or say...
bad,"As far as the management in my department and my coworkers go, they are great people, and I love working with them as well as some others in other departments. However, there are some people that seem to think that working at Ingles is just like being back in high school and that everything should be all about drama. Some upper management seems to think that it's fine to be friends with everyone instead of putting the job first, or it seems like they just don't care at all. So many people have left the workplace in search of other jobs, and instead of asking and/or investigating as to why so many people are leaving, it simply assumed that the people ""just couldn't hack it"" or were troublemakers. Don't get me wrong, there are some really good people there, but then there are some that need a serious reality check."
bad,I have been with Ingles for two years and there are no benifits and no really good reason to stay with the company. They make it very hard to advance and it's really just a stepping stone to finding a better job.
bad,"The teams would be fine but it seems they suffer from a lack of management knowing what they are doing. Typically we could be on one station one day and on a completely new one tomorrow, not super structured."
bad,"the managers act like children, the night shift in the Deli has to do all the work and cleaning from all the other shifts washed dishes, fryers floors hot cases etc. and its hard work the younger workers goofed off didn't do their fair share it was awful and no discounts  for employees  so you spent your whole check back into the store cause they are expensive."
bad,A cashier rings things up and cleans up their station. Managers aren’t really that well respectful but we do what we got to do for money. Most of us only work 4 hours a day which cuts our hours
bad,I worked in the deli so I can not speak for the whole store. But I barely had any training and some days we would be so under staffed I could not stop to even go to the restroom. There was multiple times I didn’t get to take my lunch break until I had an hour left in my shift. Also a few of the college kids that worked there would goof off the whole time and not pull their weight and the managers never did anything about it. It always seemed like the manager was wrapped up in her own personal drama. Luckily this was just a job I had to take for a couple of months till my new job started. So overall only work here if you are desperate and do not care to be totally over worked and under paid.
bad,"Clique-oriented. Management plays favorites. Stressful gossipy environment. There was good pay, but only after about 2 years of working there. There is no professionalism, not uncommon for managers to become ""involved"" with their employees."
bad,"If your in need of a job work at ingles. It just won't benefit you in any way. The management at the location that I was at had so much drama, disarguments, issues, problems, fights in public. Just very poor management. Other than that, it was a nice job to have."
bad,"Worked from 3 AM in the morning to an undetermined time each day. Other employees would call off for that day an hour before their shift started, leaving a replacement or management to do the work. Promised full-time hours and benefits with no determined timeframe and the promises continued with no action."
bad,This job will give you plenty of time to work on other things in your life aside from just working. It will also help to open your eyes to what the working world is like. Overall it's a good first job but not much else.
bad,"Some of the worst management I've seen most employees hate the job by the end of the first week. Unfair conditions, most locations are severely understaffed."
bad,If you have a family it is not the place for you. You are required to work all holidays (and long hours on the holidays). You are also expected to come into work with bad weather conditions (even if you are scheduled off).
bad,"I enjoyed working at ingles but the location i worked at was full of childish drama, talking behind peoples backs, and jealousy. Even the managers and supervisors would play a large role in these games. Good job for someone in high school but if your there to work and not gossip, maybe browse around for other employers before deciding to work here."
bad,Ok i would refer ingles to a friend that needed a job if they didnt have one of course better to have one than not one but my manager at the ingles i worked at really shouldnt have been manager i worked 6 days so that the other people could have days off which aint fair worked every single weekend so people could have days off which also wasnt fair but hey worked them anyway i manager cussed at us smoked in the store the whole 9 that whole store really needs a revaluation.
bad,A lot of drama in some departments. Hardly ever get a weekend off. Some managers are nice & helpful. Good place for young adults to work. You get to meet all types of people
bad,Bad mangment lazy always talking on phone are to busy to inter act with employees very self loathing all about there money. Treated bad Unless your pretty female no room to advance unless your mangment favorite or know in the company Take advantage of good employees till the leave or give up poor pay for most but favorites of mangment poor  in many ways could go on but will stop here.
bad,The management is rude to employees as well as customers. Very unprofessional and stressful. I would not recommend this job. The drama and mistreatment is definitely not worth the pay.
bad,"A great job overall with decent pay, always open to hiring new individuals with no work experience, but some of the staff is very unprofessional and inconvenient when it comes to scheduling around important events."
bad,"I worked for Ingles 6 years and never missed a day. The Mest department manager is off putting and several people have transferred or quit because of him in my time working there. I got fired without being written up and without them explaining to me why I was being fired. I have seen many people come and go in the meat department and the manager is extremely hard to get along with. The rest of the store is great and I got along with co workers and it was a great environment to work. This is my honest review and I am not posting this to be rude by any means. Just my honest review. There are several other things I could say but I'll leave my review at this. I would highly recommend working as a meat cutter and my only complaint is with the Meat department in Chatsworth, GA. I have also worked at the location in Ringgold, GA and have no complaints and it was a great environment."
bad,Cashier position is good. Management is okay. Fun job at times. Math and people skills are required. Alright atmosphere and okay store.
bad,"I guess poor management was so bad in the bakery department that they hired me with no experience to learn how to do baking and to be trained on certain techniques.  Well let's just say that I only received little training, then employees left me all by myself to do tasks that i've not been trained at yet (like decorating cakes).  Considering that I was being used and possibly at the risk of losing my job I left for another job before head management got to me. Oh, and not too many happy employee faces were pleased to meet me either when I was there."
bad,I learned about the values of working in a retail chain the hardest part about the job was keeping up with everything going on at once
bad,Greet potential customers
bad,No one seemed to want to help others in this store. Not too many customer complanits otherwise. It was an easy job but kind of boring.
bad,"Night crew was understaffed and underpaid.  Management would never listen to the night crew that they were ordering too much merchandise on some days, and not enough on others.  My coworkers were mostly lazy or on drugs or both.  The head manager of the whole store is a jerk."
bad,Although they had a good environment the management and the associates were not really good and helping with the customers and some of the management was very rude. Other than that it was a pretty good job
bad,"You have to work an entire year, as a “part-time” employee, before you’re evaluated and potentially “promoted” to full-time status.  Then you’re limited to no more than a $0.25/hr raise (pending your evaluation).  All employees (expect management) max out their pay at $11.75/hr."
bad,Management has no respect for employees as people. Was told that I did nothing even though I completely rearranged the back freezer and made the process of stocking frozen items more efficient. Our store had the highest sales in frozen during my time there but yet I was told I don't do anything.
bad,"Good coworkers good customers, the job was very slow and repetitive would have keep working there just no good benefits and couldn’t make a living off the wage."
bad,Deli manager is unprofessional and lazy. He never addresses issues between coworkers and lacks empathy for the people who work beneath him. Not sure about the other departments but the deli is full of drama and lazy coworkers.
bad,"Just don't torture yourself and go to work here. You get yelled at and talked down to.  And all for wages that are barely above the minimum wage and much lower than the national average. You're on indeed if you're reading this,  so hold out for something better."
bad,"Not the best place to work. Managers don't seem to really care about you and there's a lot of drama. There is no set time of getting out, if any other employees slack off you have to help them until everyone is done to go home. There have been many days where I would work 10 to 13 hours because someone wasn't on their game. Overtime is not allowed at all and they will send you home early on Mondays. The best thing to do is get in, get done, get out."
bad,it’s fun meeting new people every time you work. And I love the regulars that come in and chat with. I love working in customer service. But the only downside to ingles is they don’t give many hours.
bad,"The work is fun and you meet nice people with interesting stories. Good atmosphere overall. However the management was awful. I was 17 at the time. My dad just left my struggling mom with 4 kids who was working every waking hour to get by. One day she had to go in early for some reason and I was unable to obtain a ride to work. I called in 2 hours before -which is company policy. That Saturday we had a meeting at 6 in the morning, my mom was going to her job at 6:30 so I was able to attend. After the meeting I was scheduled to work a 6 hour shift and I would get a ride from a fellow coworker who worked the same shift as me. But after the meeting the manager asked why I was there and that she had fired me the day i called in. I was charged with ""avoiding work"" and therefore terminated. Wish they would have given me a call to tell me this before hand but no, I had to hike 3 miles back to my house at 6 in the morning."
bad,Management only cares about themselves and not their employees. There is little to no job security and all the management talks bad about most of the employees to other employees.
bad,"Rude manager, had to work every weekend, no work/life balance, stressful. Would not recommend to anyone to get a job at Ingles, definitely not in the deli."
bad,"Worked here for 6 months the managers at Starbucks didnt do their job right, they gave their friends all the hours and gave everyone else less than 15 a week, one manager sold their friends trenta (xl) frappuccinos when the largest size of fraps were a venti (large). I asked for more hours so I could pay my rent and they never raised my hours. Was making only $120 a week at 9.50 an hour I barely got 10 hours in."
bad,"I would not recommend this job for anyone unless no prior job history, such as a high school student. It is a good stepping stone, but would never go back."
bad,Job was ok not hard. Other employees were friendly. Some of the other employees would not do their work but were friends  with manager and got away with it. Manager not very nice hard to work for.Big staff turnover.
bad,"High school kids that never had a job before,  hired after myself were making more money than me although I would give them instruction on what to do & how to do it. Had to eventually call the home office about the payscale difference & the roach problem only to get in trouble for doing so. Was told by the store manager that I would get a raise within 2 to 3 weeks however 6 weeks later, still no raise. My department manager was always complaining about anything,  would yell at co-workers in front of customers, would not tell people if they were doing a good job, just very negative in general. Also when department  received a ""face lift"" & other job opportunities for day shift opened,  I was not allowed to change but new employees were hired for positions & shift times I had requested without any prior experience."
bad,"Always busy, most managers are awful and some will make you come in sick, half the employees are lazy, huge cashier bias, baggers are unappreciated, and minimal pay for your workload. Corporate makes stupid decisions and refuses to fix/upgrade what is broken/outdated. Management expects you to complete tasks in impossibly short amounts of time, and as mentioned earlier, makes you come to work no matter the situation; they do not care if you die on your way there. Only saving grace for this place is the friends you can make."
bad,"The job is okay for someone who is looking for something that who really enjoys cooking food."
bad,Management is not worker friendly.  Over worked and under paid.  Hard to get time off to go to Dr's appts.  Management is hateful to their employees.  Too demanding
bad,The departments have poor communication with each other for example a customer needed to be compensated for a drink at starbucks and the office gave them an ingles gift card even though the ingles gift cards cannot be used at the starbucks register. Additionally there is no holiday pay or discounts for employees and raises are extremely low.
bad,"Facial piercings must be removed. Tattoos are frowned upon. ""Trendy"" hair is forbidden. You cannot roll up the bottom of your skinny jeans despite the fact that air conditioning is almost never utilized. The store manager at my Ingles fired a kid because his four year old brother was sick and he couldn't come in. I wouldn't recommend it."
bad,"working in deli, slicing deli meats, preparing salads , providing customer services. learned how to prepare foods. enjoyed assisting customers"
bad,"The store was close to my home and the hours were good. The manager had a hair trigger however, and the turnover rate was high.I felt as if I was walking on eggshells most of the time."
bad,This was one of the most horrible jobs I have worked. The coworkers are nice but management is not friendly at all. The job to do isn't hard but nobody would like working here.
bad,The management isn't the best. A typical day is you by yourself stocking a shelf with plenty of stock to put up. Co-workers were alright.
bad,The hardest part of the job when the day is very busy. My co-workers tend to make it easier because of their assistance. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the day is slow which will make everything more relaxed.
bad,"They worked around my schedule at school but beyond that I could not ask for a day off without getting lectured or even my hours cut, weekly hours were rarely stable (I could get anywhere from 34 to a mere 16 hours a week without notice), the managers couldn't care less about the employees beneath them and would harass workers over any minor stumble, there are no grocery discounts or health benefits, and you are always subject to firing at any point or anything."
bad,Its basic bagging and retrieving grocery carts. There really isnt much else to say about it.
bad,"This location has a bad turnover rate and the employees are not treated equally or fairly. And since most of the management never take care of the employees other than their personal pets, customer relations are very slim. As a Starbucks barista, I take pride in being able to creatively make drinks for each customer's specific tastes and I get to connect with the customers while I do it. However, the rules and regulations constantly change, and illogically so, the hiring process is a joke, many fellow baristas are stressed by management until they give up and leave, and if you happen to be lucky enough to remain, there's no chance of advancement. All in all, the stress level there is an eight out of ten, and though it is a good learning experience at first, the larger picture seen after being there for more than a year is that there is no professionalism or integrity backing this store."
bad,"A typical day at work would to checking customers out, and helping with their prescription. What I learned was how serious giving the patient the right prescription was. Management was ok just communication was not what i thought it would. Hardest part of the job would be moving from one area to another in less then a minute. The most enjoyable part would be learning about the new prescription an the affect it has."
bad,I loved working for ingles and really enjoyed it. The customers were polite and my co workers were a delight to work with. I loved it when I helped a customers with there prescriptions
bad,This was my college job. I started in high school.  Working here permanently did not fit with my goals. There are opportunities for advancement and you can make more money.
bad,"Ingles has provided me with a step in the door which I am grateful for, but provided no opportunity to rise above or motivate me to strive for their success. There is a company wide policy of no raises within the first year of work, no exceptions. Every performance review is in October/September and the maximum raise you can earn is 4% per year. You will receive no vacation time, and 5 sick days. Most benefits don't kick in until you work for three months and your 401k doesn't start for 1 and a half years. Additionally, it doesn't become fully vested for another 5 years after that."
bad,Most managers do not know how to handle employees. They talk down to you like you are stupid. They promote bad employees to management. They have rules but they do not enforce them.
bad,A typical day working here consist of constant customer interaction. Must be able to multitask. Time management is essential. Conflict resolution is inevitable.
bad,I did not like working at ingles. Coworkers made you’re job hard there was a lot of racism. There was a lot of disfunction when came to scheduling and who was assigned what job.
bad,"The mangers were very laid back, among the workers there were the ones that worked and the ones that didn’t.  A typical shift was about 5-8 hours, mainly you will depending on position bag and get buggies or be a cashier."
bad,It's not a bad first job for a teenager. I learned how to operate and maintain company equipment and environment. Hardest part of the job was dealing with customers.
bad,Corporate only cares about $$$. Ridiculous policies. Dept managers are treated like dirt. Customer service managers are clueless and usually promoted within a short time of employment and know nothing about running any department ( most have never even worked in a dept other than front end) but are given power over them because they have a white shirt.
bad,Its like your fully staffed most days but it would only be you working like crazy and no one is around and your overwhelmed with delayed taskes and orders and have to make sandwiches and then lunch rush amd dinner rush after 5 and having to cut meat ans cheese its alot to handle if everyone is not working like a team and sharing responsibility.
bad,"Needs better communication between departments."
bad,"We joked constantly about how little time it takes for the place to completely suck your soul out."
bad,"They’re very flexible with hours which is great for people in school but management is awful. They often give raises late (if at all) and tend to treat the front end enployees as expendable, at least at my store"
bad,A typical day at work consisted of standing in one spot and not moving very much. The management were very reluctant to understand emergency reasons to miss work and were very rude.
bad,Cashier and helping customers. Bagging groceries and cleaning up isles. Ringing up groceries bringing buggy's back in the store and customer service. Help
bad,"Every day I worked here, I did not want to come in because the management was very hateful and unfair. They always wanted you to work but never wanted to help. There was no team work."
bad,"It was okay but advancements are hard to come by and pay isn’t competitive. Management was not very good, but do workers were great people. I enjoyed working there just needed more pay"
bad,Some management really were not good managers and did not deserve their positions. Working with some of the employees was awesome and some not. I probably would not go back to work there.
bad,It's a great place to work for high schoolers or if you're just looking to make some extra cash. Not so great if it's your only job and you depend on it to pay your bills.
bad,The job was an experience and some days were easier than others. The busy days were a little difficult when we were short handed. If everyone was doing their part then everything was much simpler.
bad,"Ingles is a great job for someone working in high school or working their way through college, but don't make a career out of this place. Ingles is a job that you have when you're in between jobs and just need some sort of income."
bad,"I enjoyed the work but the hours and pay were not enough for me to sustain a living. Management was ok to work with and the job seemed like it was easy enough. I enjoyed the job, but it just wasn't enough money to live on."
bad,"work long hours  with little time off, with low pay rate. Upper management does not seem to care for the well being of their employees. "
bad,"Original manager nathan was promoted- he was a wonderful, fair, hard working supervisor. Replacement supervisor nick, was lazy and out all the time. Stock crew suffered as a result of his work ethic, ordering issues, laziness"
bad,"heavy work, must be able to work in the cold all shift. I enjoy not having to work weekends. Must be able to work alone most of the time and order all products in work area"
bad,I liked working there at first but then it got stressful and management wasn't helpful and didn't help like they was meant for it was fun making donuts and stuff
bad,I would never recommend anyone to work at this ingles becuase of how bad my experience has been. The best parts about the job is the other Cashiers that I became friends with but  as far as managment and the job itself goes I HATED it. You don't want to work here unless you like being around heartless people.
bad,Not quite the best place to work at. Was pretty much people trying to get you in trouble to make them look better. Didn't appreciate the people too much.
bad,"My time at Ingles is very rigid and slow paced, I enjoyed the workers and the customers but the management team is very unforgiving and sometimes refuse to be flexible with hours."
bad,Long hours and not enough pay.  Poor management and no benefits. A typical day at work was lots of complaints from people not receiving their benefits.
bad,"The boss that I had in the deli was very rude and even though she knew that I was good at my job, I could never win. I never got any praise or thank you's from her like I have had at other jobs. The other associates were amazing and sometimes lazy! But I enjoyed working there when the deli manager wasn't there."
bad,"Pay is typical for a retail environment. But you never get informed about pay raises or benefits."
bad,3/4 of my store managers were terrible. All around wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. Might have just had a bad experience. The work is easy it's just the try hard supervision that kills the mood for everyone
bad,I've been working for Ingles for almost 3 years and I haven't gotten a promotion nor have I gotten asked did I even want a promotion. I have also witnessed that only certain people get promotions and special accolades.
bad,"The management we're rude , but the overall experience was exciting & fun! A typical day at work would be slow & get busy, it was pretty laid back for the most part. The most enjoyable part of working here was getting to know the employees & getting to know your everyday customers!"
bad,"Bag groceries, stock shelves, take out trash, clean bathrooms, get shopping carts from outside, help deli out, good management, stock milk, put go backs on shelf."
bad,Company notified employees 9 days before shutting down the store. Do not see the grocery stores staying in business much longer
bad,"HORRIBLE store to work for. I've worked at two different Ingles locations (which I absolutely loved and is the reason I stayed with the company when I moved for college) and absolutely HATE this one. It's so bad that I started looking for a new job after two weeks. The store manager is a very nice man, but the rest of the management is a joke. They treat the place like it is a high school and allow the book keeper to boss everyone around, even though they are not managers. They play favorites and act like they are too good to help anyone below them. I will give the managers credit for giving decent hours, but I'm sure it's because the store is understaffed. I wonder why?"
bad,Very bad management and business practices from the top down. They keep lousy workers while riding good workers to do more. Deli at times is like a three ring circus. Forget about advancing out of the deli. If you are hired in there is where you will remain . Pay is not good and you have no benefits. They will keep you classified as part time forever.
bad,"typical day? I was lucky to be scheduled 1 day a week while working there "
bad,I was able to use all the other skills in customer service and clean ettiquite.  I was trained in how to operate all the deli equipment and was taught the safety of operating them.
bad,"typical day at work included serving food from the hot bar,keeping clean and sanitary,and working fast paced. co workers were great and easy to get along with,the hardest part of the job was dealing with the deli manager"
bad,"Though this job gave me the opportunity to work in a retail environment, I found myself often bored because I would finish all the work my supervisor would leave for me to do throughout the day. Customer flow was very low in the Video Department at Ingles."
bad,A typical day of work involves me going in to work after noon and beginning clean up of the early day's work. I have learned better how to accommodate customers in the manner they deserve.
bad,"interacting with coworkers with everyday duties,managing my employees on customer service skills and increasing sales.the hardest part of the job is getting your employees to care as much as you do!! the best part of my job was hearing the complaiments of customers and the overall sales at the end of each week for all my hard work!!"
bad,Ingles is a mom and pop store thats become too big for its own britches. many stores cant compete with powerhouses like kroger or publix that are usually located nearby leading to a lot of stores starting to close their doors. management tends to be shifty and communication here actually sucks. There is an odd enigma though where the managers tend to be jerks but most of the employees are actually fantastic and ive made lifelong friends from my time at Ingles.
bad,"I am 69 yrs old and retired but I  enjoy working and meeting people . All my children are grown so there's not much to do at home. So I work to keep things moving in order to have a more fulfilled life. The job help to supplement my s.s. income. But I gained a great experience working with others and seeing how the work force is now."
bad,Really hard work at times on your feet. Customers can be as nice as they can be nasty. Most of the people worked with were very nice but a few didn't do their job.Had to put up with other employees expressing open political views in front of customers.
bad,The company was not very well managed. I was an experienced meat cutter that excelled but never really was compensated for my skills. Not recommended.
bad,"Worked there for 10 years, started having some medical issues involving my hands(beginning stages of RA). I had only ever called out 3 times in 10 years, was having a flare up of symptoms which was incredibly painful, called Store Mgr left a VM. He told our District Manager I no call/no showed and I got let go. I loved working for Ingles and my Job, but just goes to show you that people you lok up to and think have your back are the first to stab you in the back"
bad,"The ingles i worked for had horrible management, horrible pay for the endless labor, bad health standards, zero benefits as well if you work for this company."
bad,Pretty good place to work the managers are not the best. Good pay but not enough to live around the area. Good flexibility with schedules and good benefits.
bad,Rules do not apply to all employees. Depending on department some drama and workers that do not put forth the effort to apply themselves. All managers are for the most part will work with you to help you succeed.
bad,"If you're still in highschool, go for it. But if you have a better option, take it. It's working with a bunch of highschooler who are all dating each other. 'nuff said."
bad,"Ingle's Markets is not a bad stepping stone for teens, retired elderly, and Special Ed. However, I would not recommend this place of employment as a career path. The company does not focus on family and the schedule and workload are very demanding, with little to no reward."
bad,"I came to lingles with over twenty years of meat manager experience. Left a manager's job after being recruited by singles meat supervisor. Took $600.00 a month pay cut on s hand  shake"
bad,"Too much favoritism and management is not consistent with employees. Recognition is not expressed to employees that go above and beyond, other employees are often credited for my work and accept it."
bad,Great for kids just starting but in order to move up you must be friends with the higher ups. You get tons of sick time but can't use it unless your out 5 days at a time.
bad,It was a good learning job and I learned alot of skills. Business decisions do need to fit this store in the seasonal resort town. I enjoyed working with just about everyone in the department and got to know and look forward to serving the regular customers.
bad,Dead end job unless you are higher management. Good for older people or people who have little to no job experience or high school students being a part-time job. Is no place to make a steady career of
bad,"12 hours work day different managers was treated different it depnded on who like you or not, we was surpose to close 2 nites a week i was the only one in the district that closed , i mean i locked the door at close the other store managers either left at 8 pm or 6 pm"
bad,"When working at Ingles Market, I found myself to be at a stand-still and no way to move up or advance. The people were nice, however some of the management styles were not something that I was comfortable with. I found myself taking on more loads of work for other people while having very low compensation. Though I met some great people and formed great friendships, Ingles was a good starting job for a high school senior/young working college student."
bad,A typical day at work was just nasty. The boss in the bakery would always leave tons of work for me to do that took longer than what time i was spouse to work. The next day she would yell at me for staying later than what i should have to finish work.
bad,"Management is lacking necessary skills to perform job, very stressful environment for such little compensation and days off are seen as a personable attack"
bad,"Poor Management. Accused of not doing work while I was cleaning up the store. Completely Random Schedule each week."
bad,"Typical day at work involved clocking in, then going to your dept. Daily duties involved pulling out of date product, refilling shelves, baking bread and other goods to fill shelf, fulfilling customer orders, unloading the truck on the days it would come in, scanning out out of date products, conducting monthly inventory, and keeping dept clean. It was a good learning experience for management as I was able to move up within the department, and great for learning how to interact with customers on a face to face basis. Management isn't the best, you move up based on who you know, not by your work ethic and it's a revolving door for the most part. Co workers were alright overall, most were unhappy with the company and morale was low. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with product needed around the holidays, and pulling other peoples work when they would slack. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customer in what they needed."
bad,upper mangagement curt and rude to employees. a lot of employee turneover.
bad,"A typical day at Ingles is slow in the mornings and busy in the afternoon. Customer service is key within this job if you want job security. What I learned at Ingles is how to multi task, learn management skills and great customer service skills. All my co workers were all on one accord which is have great customer service and help one another when needed. The hardest part of the job in my opinion was not having enough hours and not being able to move up within the company. The most enjoyable part of working at Ingles was that I was able to help customers, I was able to make new friends and have customers that came to just see me."
bad,"A typical day at Ingles... open at 7am, do morning prep work, and by 9 customers were flooding the deli. Customer service isn't bad at all; I enjoyed serving customers. "
bad,"Ingles Markets was a good first job for me right out of high school. It has paid me through three years of college so far, and it has taught me some valuable lessons and skills."
bad,On a typically work day I provide customer service for many customers by processing their transactions. The best part of the job is the interaction I get with the customers that I come into contact with. Most customers are very nice and enjoyable to talk to. The interaction among co-workers is ideal because most are very friendly and are easy to relate to.
bad,It was a good way to get through college but for the great reputation Ingles has they don’t treat employees near as well as people expect. Even full time employees do not receive many benefits.
bad,They don't pay you enough for what you do there. Its not worth it. You should make a minimum of 15 an hour for how physical it is. I also think the benefits are not that great.
bad,I would arrive around 4 in the morning having to wait for someone from stock to let me in. then I would be turning on the bakery defrosting proofing baking and frying everything for the morning displays. The early hours and the commute were the hardest part of this job as i liked a little over half an hour away and would have to wake up at 2 or 3 in the morning to ensure I arrived on time.
bad,"Most of the workers are friendly, and most of the work can be enjoyed if you have a good attitude. But compensation is not good and ingles insurance is awful, sometimes the co pay through ingles insurance is more than the cash price for prescriptions (at its own pharmacy). Plus corporate is very rude and never kind or friendly. Store managers aren't much better. It can be a fun job but it's not a good company in my opinion."
bad,Really good first job helped me out of my shell to communicate with others inside and out of a work environment. Taught me how to mange money and assist in customer needs. Interested in obtaining more experience and skills from other work environments.
bad,Was interesting. The manager was young and didn't really handle certain situations well. I was never given enough hours even after asking. They switch you around to different positions and there is no training involved at all. (Thrown to the wolves)
bad,"Although pharmacy itself is stressful and fulfilling job at Ingles Markets, the company wants to work you to death but will only pay you the bare minimum which is unacceptable."
bad,"Good company overall, but management in my area, specifically in the pharmacy department lacking.  Nobody local as a resource, the manager was always in NC or GA and not even licensed in TN.  My manager would have to call me to ask questions about TN laws."
bad,They work you like crazy. no steady wor shifts. no paid sick days. not family oriented. managers are cool. but the store manager is hateful and mean. constantly hiring people so hours are constantly cut from the other associates.
bad,"A typical day of work involved a lot of harassment by other co workers that the management blew off most of the time. I learned that there is a load of favoritism in the Ingles market corporation. The most enjoyable part was driving around the isles on keeping to yourself most of the time while picking, however it did get lonely sometimes as i am a very sociable and friendly person. The hardest part of the job was picking 200+ cases an hour in the cold."
bad,"I worked in the deli in Easley,SC and I don't recommend anybody to apply for a jo b there. Poor management the people in the deli are just hateful and rude. The deli manager is no better."
bad,"It's a ok company to work for. It takes a while to move up the ranks, or to get a raise. The people are friendly and willing to help. You just have to show that you are willing to work."
bad,"Working there was ok, but the manager was pretty mean. The pay was decent though. And the job was easy. The only problem I had was the hours, I didn't get enough."
bad,"You have a lot to do, and it needs to be done. Dont have much of a social life if on night shift. Takes a while to move up in the ranks. Great people to work with, and can have some fun times while working."
bad,"I wasn't trained properly, they has a recently hired employee that  trained me and even he barely knew how to operated the register."
bad,Really great staff. Management is very unorganized and not very supportive of department heads. The residences are very demanding and management is unable to tell them no even when it is not the best for the community. The budget is is too small for the expectations of management and the residence. This makes for a very stressful work environment. It is a miracle that the community is doing so well but I am afraid that it will catch up eventually.
bad,"A typical Work Day Is working with the public helping customers and checking them out and making sure they found everything they needed. working at a grocery store can be a very tuff job because of some customers. but the normal everyday customers that youll see everyday and love to to talk to is what makes you love the job. and just like every job there are the good and helpful managers and there is also the not so helpful ones, that hate being there."
bad,"Worked one year and that was enough."
bad,"I liked the job but it was the environment and poor management that fled me away. I was a great worker at ingles Deli in Madison, GA, but after I heard rumors my boss and my supervisor was not taking care of serious situations that needs to be taken cared of. I left. I not only left because my boss and supervisor was making rumors about their employers I left because they didn’t give me my position that I so righteously earned. All I have to say is watch your back and stay on your p’s and Q’s ."
bad,Managers weren’t professional. i was given too many hours. The schedule was very confusing. Other employees didn’t like this ingles too much either. etc
bad,"Over my time working for ingles markets i had gone through multiple locations and management. On most occasions my managers were unaware of what me or others in my position were supposed to be doing and would frequently scold us. The customers were rude and, at times, verbally abusive. During my time at my last location I was tasked with doing more work than the other workers and was consistently underpaid for my effort. when I brought up that I was making less than everyone else my manager assured me that she would take care of it and then did not place the request to fix it for another month of consistently telling me she was about to do it ""today"". I have no regrets in leaving Ingles Market and if I ever did want to work at a grocery store again I could easily find one that is better managed, pays more, and cares about its employees more."
bad,I work in the deli and they expect you to do your job. Not a terrible job and not that hard just terrible management.All in all I could work here if they had better managers.
bad,I got a .25 raise every year . i left due lack of hours and not enough hours to pay my bills or geta head i stugled then and im struggling now i have worked minum wage jobs all my life im pushin 30 years old im not a kid any more im a grown man
bad,"Ingles is fairly similar to Wal-Mart, in that you can work full weeks, but usually you stay in your designated area, the management wasn't exactly the best I've had, sometimes rude and contradictory, never helping anyone in attempts to learn or progress through the company."
bad,A great job for high school students but not for people that have a mortgage payment and other bills to pay for. Great management though.
bad,Working here is nice but can get expensive when you not live her on the metro there always issues here with parking management here is flexible but the Pay Suck
bad,"My fast learning skills allowed me to conduct an opportunity of expanding my skills by learning different things in the department. I had fun using my artistic skills by being creative with my projects, and satisfying customers with my work of perfection. I had a goal of making everything I do perfect, neat, and finger licking good, to keep our customer's business."
bad,"They don't know how to treat there employees. "
bad,"Greeted customers made sure service area was clean and neat. would stock grocery bags, you did not want to run out at a busy time when there would be a rush of customers. Would stock the front end caps and do inventory on candies and chewing gum."
bad,"This was my first job and I am a front end cashier. Way too stressful and easy to make mistake that will get you fired very quickly, no exceptions. The pay is not worth the stress, rude customers, rude management( or management that just treats you like your'e five). Hardly ever have baggers or anyone able to help, way too busy and not enough staff because everyone quits by the end of the month. Heck, I would even take being a bagger than having to deal with being fired over being $5 over/short on a busy day with many mishaps and having a total tendered being over $6,000 and the majority paying with cash. It's alright for the first week, then it gets worse. Of course there's a good day or two when you can talk to a coworker or two, but  overall I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS UNLESS YOU ARE AT ROCK BOTTOM!!!"
bad,"Ingles is one of the better jobs that I have had, but there are too many cons for me to stay there. One, they consistently add extra hours before asking. I am a full time student, so I can not work more hours that what I have agreed to, but I am expected to make it fair for everyone and work every holiday (even on school days) and split extra hours up with other employees. I am not allowed to have my nose piercing in, have dyed hair, and I must wear a strict uniform. The shift that I must work consumes my entire day and leave me exhausted."
bad,"In my experience, the managers for the store are rude and not helpful. Some employees are fine but it seemed there was always drama in every department. I have pointed out employees stealing food or shopping during their work hours only to stick it in the cooler with our foods and they did nothing."
bad,Don't work here if you don't plan to move up in the company. The pay is low and the benefits suck. Management doesn't care about your opinions on how to improve the store.
bad,"When I started working at Ingles on Thomson bridge they were very flexible with my schedule, which was wonderful but the downside was the drama with all the coworkers wnd the managers taking part into it and as well as they do have direct payment which I attempted to give the paperwork to the main manager TWICE and she kept saying she was busy and wouldn't take it and I was not getting payed on time on several occasions which was really inconvinent. Not worth the stress."
bad,Received a lot of on the job training.  Work around a diverse group of people internal/external.   The hardest part of the job was the swing rotating shift.  It was challenging to have a family life or go back to school.
bad,Job was okay at first but due to management just about everyone on my 3rd shift stock crew quit until there were only 4 of us to work trucks throughout 7 days of the week.
bad,"Pay is below average for grocery stores in the area. I had friends there and enjoyed my job but pay was not enough to live off of. Some employees take smoke breaks about every thirty minutes"
bad,"Always make sure to listen to managers."
bad,"My review for ingles is that it was my first job. I didn't expect it to be great but since they mostly hired high-schoolers, it was ran like a school. No phones, ask to go to the bathroom, generally not the ideal situation for someone like me who has medical issues. Not very slack on sick days or vacation days."
bad,My first week I worked almost 50 hours because people decided they didn't want to work. I was getting called in on nights I wasnt suppose to work. My schedule changed so many times I almost didn't get a day off for a week and a half. Management wasnt great and always wanted to seem bossy. People really didn't want to help each other to get the job done quicker.
bad,"The management is poor and they definitely show favoritism in the workers there. Employees aren't too great, but it is an easy job to pick as your first."
bad,"A typical day at Ingles consisted of ringing up people's groceries, handling a variety of different situations in a timely and respectful manner, and assisting customers to the best of your ability."
bad,Its a good job its just they cheap they wont get the van that we drive fix by real mechanics and never organized on the schedule and around hoildays they late with our checks.
bad,"typical day: unload products from truck, stock shelves, organize storage room and block the store"
bad,"Ingles Market is a fair place to work, but it is very much the good old boy system. The management was very fair and open at the store in Burnsville, NC."
bad,learned a lot about the produce business. mran a produce dept for 15 years with ingles. would love to run a dept again someday
bad,A typical day at Ingles for me would be managing the front end and all front end employees. My job on a daily basis is to ensure that all customers feel that they were taken care of and to make sure they will return. A huge part of my day is making sure the front end is running as smoothly as possible. I also do the scheduling for the store. I have learned that in order to run a team or department you have to be dilegent and organized. A manager has to set an example to be followed. My co-workers and I get along very well. I try to ensure that they are given the best possible enviroment to work in and I also try to help them progress in any way I can. The hardest part of my job would be the amount of stress that the job can bring. I have managed to deal with the stress and not let it affect my work. The most enjoyable part of my job is being around people and being able to help them.
bad,"the work was good and the hours were good. But this company dont care about you as a human being if you are sick, death in the family, and etc they always want to come into work"
bad,"If you like working like a dog, and being used as a tool to run the store in exchange for a paycheck; ingles is the way to go."
bad,"This was not my favorite job, it was the same thing over and over, and the company was going through a lot of changes that made it difficult to appericaite having a job."
bad,"the pay is horrible, the benefits are horrible and the managers treat their employees with no respect."
bad,"Customer Service fast pace"
bad,"The managers didn't seem to know what they were doing, and were uncoordinated. Sometimes they would each tell me to do something different, leaving me wondering what I should actually do. I eventually quit because I was called ""rude and disrespectful"" when I attempted to talk about my hours with the manager. He's 19 by the way."
bad,Pay was okay. Good for a person in school. Underappreciated by management they don't notice anything you do right nitpick everything you do. Little to no breaks. Overall it was a short term job because they make you feel like they don't care about employees never say anything nice just criticize.
bad,In a typical work day I am assigned to a random station due to the fact that i learn fast and have picked up on how to do almost everything within a year. I help out my managers and love learning new things. the people are the best part because you never now who is going to walk in. My coworkers personalities vary. Some work really hard and others slack where you have to do their jobs.
bad,"Bookkeepers have long hours and I hope they change this, but it is hard to balance work and life!"
good,Worked at Ingles for a couple months now. Management is often very rude and coworkers only care about drama. The managers also talk about you behind your back and generally have little to no respect for their employees. Very toxic work environments and quite boring.
good,This was my first job in N.C. Its was a new store. Management was horrible. This store was in a small town and it was really hard to find people that could pass drug test and wanted to word.
good,"Too short handed to cluttered unsafe perparing of food store ,anager and district deli manager let things go broken for months poor safety managers have no respect for employees"
good,At my Ingles it was very very busy. It was also incredibly dirty at my Ingles. Proper cleaning regulations were not implemented. The hours were not distributed properly due to influx of employees and some employees not wanting to work. I learned nothing except hot to be patient with customers.
good,found maggets   under the deep fat frier in deli were i worked. asked questions about why they were there.was immediately cut in hours.was cut to 8 hours a week later fired.
good,"Promises of advancement used to be upheld. I spent over 8 years as. Co-manager receiving nothing but accolades, yet I watched as countless other Co Managers with half as much tenior as I had were promoted and given their own store. As it tirns out, my Store Manager had the opportunity to put my name in for advancement more than once and never did. This is why I left the company."
good,"management was awful"
good,"Working at Ingles, especially in the front end, you will learn a lot of skills. In my particular store you will work in floral, video, and work at the gas sation if needed."
good,I really didn't like some of the co-workers they sometimes bring drama in the work area and i'm not a big fan of drama. some of them just stand around and do nothing and no one complains about it.
good,I enjoyed this job for the first year or so. I felt like I was not appreciated by management. I worked between 7 and 9 hours a day.
good,"Typical college/high school job that isn't something to pursue a career in. You go in to work and bag stuff, keep quiet, co-workers help ya out when they can, people are annoying, nothing enjoyable about it."
good,"My typical work day would require me to come into work, put my work stuff on, and get to work on the production case, which was pre-made salads, banana pudding parfaits, chicken salad parfaits, and pimento cheese sandwiches and parfaits. I would then help any and every customer that came into the store wanting meat sliced, something off the hot bar or something in the bulk salad case. The management isn't very understanding of any home life situation you have."
good,This was an ok place to work. This was my very first job. there was a lot of drama between managers and coworkers.
good,Manager was not a good one. People never stayed long in the deli and I also did more than cashier. I always did whatever needed to get done when people didn’t show up. Also horrible language was used by people in the deli even when customers could hear even by deli manager. I’m now working at Walgreens
good,Pay is decent but the benefits are terrible. Health insurance is not affordable. Management is tired and overworked. Too many rules and point system rack up to suspension.
good,"Each manager is different, therefore each store has a different atmosphere.  On a whole, Ingles expects more work than possible from most people, and financial compensation isn't the best."
good,"Was good at the first store I was at then went to another one (119) and the atmosphere is awful. The store manager is more worried about posting pictures on FB than running the store. He rarely helps checkout or bag when it gets busy and gets mad if he has to do anything. there is so much drama and you don't get backed up if someone else is in the wrong, if they are the ""picks"" of the store. And don't ever think about calling out cause if it's bad weather you'll get hung up on and possibly have your hours cut. the best part is getting to meet new people every day some management is better than others even though they don't enforce what they make to be ""rules"". The best times to work are holidays cause it's always busy and there's stuff to do."
good,Low pay for what you do. Your consistently moving and stocking. They are very nice people there but again low pay and no advancement. The raises are very small as well.
good,It’s okay. Nothing great. Got maybe 4 hours a week. Quit because only paid $32 and it takes $30 to fill my car up. It’s is either really dead there or a million people in line. The bag boys didn’t do their job so the cashiers had 2 jobs to do.
good,"Ingles was a great job, got to meet a lot of new people, and step out of my comfort zone. The security just needs to be worked on. I would also take in cosideration the hours and pay."
good,"They have a good environment, but most staff is rude to customers and does not have respect for other people and other employees. Management treats certain employees different than others also and doesn't work everybody equally."
good,Didn't get the raises I was promised for moving up in the corporation. Never had an evaluation. Was treated poorly.  Never got more than a 30 minute break for a 12 hours shift. Managers were horrible
good,"As a person who has worked in Management all of adult life, it was upsetting to see such a poorly managed store.  Ingle's was a stepping stone company for me.  I was hoping to start at the bottom and work my way into management.  However, there was no room for advancement in this company."
good,store is not ran very well in comparison to other store I have worked at. needs more leadership training and needs to update their practices to be current with todays standards.
good,"A typical day work for ingles I would come in a five in the morning to start cooking breakfast as I get that done I would then start on Lunch inbetween starting lunch I would have to stop wait on customers, take oreders, put up trucks,etc The hardest part of my job was lifting things over my head that was very heavy. The thing I enjoyed the most was my co-workers and the customers I was able to meet a lot of people for different parts of the world, and my everyday customers."
good,"The management had no compassion for my high school years at all, they hated to give me time off although I was a part time associate. I had to work until eleven most nights while i was underage and rarely went to lunch with in the 5 hour legal window, and never remember taking a 15 minuter break, asked once they laughed."
good,Working at ingles was an great time there it was sometimes slow an sometimes relaxed an at times a lot of customers would come by the deli.i would say ingles deli now has improved better an more cleaner now an new faces an more different food to select from now.
good,"Come in after school clock in go check the bathrooms make sure there clean go outside bring shopping carts in for customers, I learned nothing really just how to bag grocery's. Managers where somewhat cool yell at you for no reason sometimes the store manager would never talk to the employees just mumble at us. Some of the employees got special treatment from the managers because they would kiss up to them so they didn't have to do anything but talk and cut up while other employees where doing meaningless tasks. The most enjoyable part of my job was clocking out and going home."
good,the manager was awful. worked full time hours as a part time employee making part time pay with no benefits. Illegal. no sympathy for dying or dead relitives
good,"There are no benefits as an employee for Ingles Markets, and the pay does not make up for it in any way. I made the same amount per hour the entire time I worked there, and I saw several people get hired after me with the same amount of experience and get paid more. Despite making it known several times that I was eager to learn other aspects of the job, I was never even taught how to run Self Check or anything other than running a cash register and Video Department. The management was very inconsistent, so much so that even the customers complained about it. The hardest part of the job was working so hard every day and being treated like I was not worth the managers' time."
good,"The management isn’t the greatest and will blame you for almost everything that’s wrong, your fault or not. But it’s a great first job. And if your shy, it helps a lot with opening up and talking more."
good,Excellent I loved working here at ingles but as I got more into it. It start getting more difficult. It was a fun and exciting experience but I wouldn’t go back and do it anymore
good,"Not a great place to work, because of poor management and unfair salary situations.  I could handle it, because it was my first job. Don't recommend for an adult."
good,"I would come in at 9 am and start working on making portioning pasta and moved on to help the sous chef with prep work. Anything that I could help the kitchen. Working at the Vingenzo's restaurant was a blessing as I was introduced to the Italian cuisine and getting tasks assigned and taught by the owner also the main chef was an incredible experience that I'm always grateful for. The most challenging thing was I sometimes lost in a professional kitchen because I was lacking in experience at the point. Again, I enjoyed working in the kitchen of the Vingenzo's restaurant was quite an experience as I always love to learn new things and absolutely have a passion for foods."
good,"It’s not a bad job, but doesn’t give any benefits. Employees aren’t reliable, never enough scheduled. Lots of drama and conflicts accruing constantly."
good,"I worked here for 2 months, and we were not able to talk to the other cashiers across the snack stands right next to our registers. They would assign us hours being just short of a 30-minute break, which is the max that they will give us part-time. So often we would work for 4 hours and only get 5-10 minutes of break time."
good,"Going to work at 7 am . Prepare items for sushi. "
good,Both the department I was in and the overall store had poor management.  Several members of management  hold grudges based on assumptions instead of work performance and punish employees by cutting hours and spreading rumors.  An environment where one thing is promised but another is done.
good,"As a first job, I would say this is an decent job. For somebody looking for a stable job, I would suggest otherwise. I started cashiering in January this year, and quickly learned everything to become an excellent cashier. I was trained to be UScan for a new store opening, promised being on UScan most days because I ran it so well. After a while, not only did management change but the atmosphere. I was being treated poorly by one of the CSM. This person being my manager, of course I had to have respect but it failed when this person told me I was slow. In this situation, I actually was correct and this person did not know I was. I nicely told this manager, that I was not going to tolerate being treated as he/she was treating me. After that, things were terrible. I did have one amazing manager that taught me how to do book keeping, and ways to be a CSM. She saw  the potential in me. I am grateful for the experience, not the work place. I had heard from multiple people that they did regret starting at this workplace. As I quit after they(my managers) had been talking about me behind my back like we all were children."
good,"I believe the department managers, as well as store management, need to be more supportive of their employees scheduling needs pertaining to their education.  Managers need to be more professional in their demeanor."
good,Fast paced/ customers are friendly/How to make some good food/The hardest part was clean up and sanitation/The most enjoyable part was the customers..
good,"Ingles would be a great place for individuals who are still in school or looking for a second job. The pay is way below a living wage for Asheville, and the corporate structure reminds me of ""Office Space"". Look elsewhere if you're looking for good pay with benefits, and the possibility of advancement."
good,Good starting place for work easy to learn as well as get along with co workers and customers. A lot of things going on at one time but easy to keep up with and have fun at the same time.
good,Ingles was a pretty good place to work if you just want a job to make money. The people there that you worked for was mean and not fair to the employees. Sometimes you will find another employee that is nice and willing to talk to you. The supervisor would always have you do too much work so you could get easily stressed out.
good,"its a very clean and organized store the people is very nice, But there is no communication between management and employees"
good,Ingles is a great place to work if you are a high school or college student that needs flexible hours. They worked with my hours very well! It is not a good place for long time employment though.
good,"Ringing up groceries and communication with the customers that camr through my line. I advanced in my communication and money handling skills. The managers were over-all friendly at times. They had thier favorite employees but it didn't take much to come off thier favorite list (like having an accidental stain on your shirt from coffee) They weren't fair with the work schedule and if you asked for a day off, your hours would be cut slim to none, even if it was an emergency. I loved all my co-workers. I still talk to the ones that still work there when I go grocery shopping. The hardest part of this job was dealing with the extremely rude customers and the unfair managment, but over-all it was an easy job."
good,supposed to be an 8 hour job...
good,Not a fun place to work with too much daily pressure.Managment never hires enough help.
good,"The job itself was easy to learn and execute. It was easy to train other cashiers, but there was drama amongst coworkers and the managers that was hard to deal with"
good,Your on your feet a lot. You need to be very friendly.Need to be able to deal with difficult customers with a cool temper. Need to be willing to help others.
good,My grocery manager doesn't work but pushes and forces everyone else to pull his weight along with the missing employees he will do the cereal aisle but when someone finishes their first aisle he will have them come finish the work he is supposed to do while he goes and sits down and plays on his phone or grocery shops in my mind the grocery manager should lead by example he should be working the hardest he model for how everyone else should work
good,"Ingles on hwy 81 in Anderson has horrible management for there deli. Scheduling is horrible, yet if you request time off you get it, sometimes. They do not like to giving hours or for workers to get overtime. Only good thing is the pay rate. They don't even offer discounts on food and you have to pay for water cups."
good,Not enough hours to pay bills. Not a living wage. Can't take time away from the register to go to bathroom. 30 min lunch break. No overtime.  No benefits.
good,"While the jobs here are okay they do not pay enough to make a living, they have no employee insurance or care, and as far as i know no paid vacation days"
good,"I was informed after working there for a few years and wanted to move into management that the managers only got paid $12 an hour, which is pathetic. The company does not give nearly enough incentives for people who can succeed to stay so you are left working  with a lot of retirees and young kids. anyone with any responsibility in life who needs money to make ends meet is going to be disappointed."
good,when i clocked in everyone complained about having to work the night lead would take hour breaks and would leave untrained baristas in the kiosk alone while customers were lined at the register nothing was ever good enough for him always complaining about his job and the manager would see his friends walk in the store and leave a drink that he was making to go talk to them and we would have to finish the drink which was fine to finish making it but don't just up and quit what your doing and expect other people to do your job for you
good,"Ingles implemented customer service within me. The most enjoyable part of this job was getting that little bit of interaction with the customers, while your ringing their items up, especially when you start getting your regular customers, and you get to follow up how doctor appointments or parties went."
good,"Overall ingles is an great place to work but the their were drama and favoritisms and you would get over work just to be disrespected , when moving up to a better position it’s sometimes hard because in order to learn the right way you have to be taught and if not taught then you will not know and here they do not teach they throw you out thier"
good,"This job was a good starting out job when you are still in highschool. I enjoyed the job other than the fact I wasn't being scheduled for enough hours. I also prefer not to work customer service, this job best suits friendly, talkative, patient people."
good,"I did enjoy my time at ingles. There isn’t very much opportunity for advancement unfortunately. The people I worked with were very nice, but the employee turn over was very high."
good,"The hours are pretty flexible. I am a full time college student so i can only work strict hours on certain days, and its pretty easy going. Managers are rude to the employees. Some  take advantage of their authority and arent the best examples ofmanagers. I have worked both front end, bakery, and i am now a book keeper. Ive been there for 3 years,  and book keeper is the best of them a."
good,"The people I worked with are great, but the job itself it extremely stressful and you will receive very little help. I was often left by myself to run the slice station."
good,"This was my first part time job that i worked, it provieded ok pay and hours at the time that i was employed, however, my job soon turned from my intended position as a cashier, to becoming a janitor, scrubbing toilets covered in feces."
good,"I had to work at multiple store locations and it varied from store to store the environment and training."
good,"they don't appreciate what you do. You get in trouble for a lot but if you do something good you don't get a ""good job"" or anything for it.  They are a bad company to work for with drama between employees and management doesn't care"
good,This place taught me a lot from dealing with different customers and handling money. Most days were busy but Sunday's was the most packed day after church hours. This is an easy job to catch on too.
good,"Because , I asked I had a set schedule, with certian days off so I could make or plan things I needed to do. As long as you got approved you could take time off as needed, for vacation or whatever you needed. I loved that part , instead of waiting a yr. to get a week off . But I did not have benefits . I loved being pd. Every week.!!!"
good,I enjoy the work I do and the department manager is excellent but the store manager has double standards. There is a lot of drama and back stabbing in this store.
good,Ingles is an okay place to work if you have the time. Part time employees were asked to work 40 hours a week but were n ot allowed overtime and not offered benefits.
good,At first it was good but as time pass lots of management position was not mate up to part no problem solving in management behalf . it became stressful to work with management and other employees base on too much family ties at the work environment..
good,"I was in an accident. Very bad, I wanted to see how my physical body would do in a work environment."
good,"The day to day is not too difficult, but upper management, such as district managers (merchandisers) make life extremely friggin' difficult by constantly changing policy, nepotism is rampant, and it's more about whose bum you kiss than if you do a good job or not."
good,"Typical day at work.   Assisting customers, taking orders, checking customers out. Learned how to make beautiful party trays.  Management is POOR.  needs improvement. Enjoying the people I work with & the customers that visit the store & get to know them on a personal level."
good,"I thought Ingles would be a great place to work for my first job, and at first, it was. But soon after I started, I realized that this wasn't a place that I wanted to work at all. The managers are biased on who they do and don't like, and that's where your hours come from. They hired everyone that came in so I got maybe 4 hours a week! Not even worth the drive!"
good,"The front end is all teenagers, and drama and talking behind people backs, including the managers."
good,Management had a lot of issues they needed to sort through. Most coworkers were quick to call out without punishment. The turnover rate was insane. The bosses were frustrated with the amount of people that didn't care about their job so it made it hard for those of us who did to be able to advance within the company. Annual raises were impossible.
good,"Ingles Markets is non stop interactions and movements. It is stressful & always keeps you in your toes. At the end of the day, it still is a decent job if needed."
good,"i had to go back to work for them when i found out i was  pregnant it was still awful and i choose to leave, they also wanted to pay me less but make me work more hours, not happening."
good,Ingles is an easy job to do. But mentally it drains you. Managers literally talk to you any way they see fit. The managers will always back others managers even if they are wrong. You get one work shirt for forty hour work weeks and have to pay for any others. I could go on but they and I should hold on to any other dignity.
good,It was great working there and serving customers and my coworkers were great to work with and I worked under great management.
good,The store manager was a butt. Co-works call out ever Friday for a month a I had to work in there place and I was going a school and didn't get out until 8pm and hour away from home and had to go in at 4am.
good,It was my first job and I enjoyed every last bit of it. It allowed me to learn what it means to make my own money. It was overall a fun time just learning to work in a professional setting.
good,"It is a good company to work for if you like getting paid every week.You was busy from the time you clocked in until the time you clocked out.You did get to eat a lot of different foods, you also saw a lot of different people"
good,Ingles is a great place to work for teenagers after school. They will work around a school schedule. Ingles hires many people and it helps to teach someone to get along with all types of people.
good,"The Ingle's deli in Brevard, NC had a really great crew that had fun working together and made working with customers equally fun, on Thursdays and Sundays, which are the deli manager's days off. The rest of the week was filled with pointless screaming, overloud gossip about whomever wasn't there at the time and blaming anything that happened to go wrong on the night shift employees because the night supervisor wasn't there to defend them. Store managers are completely ineffectual as numerous employee and customer complaints have been filed but no discipline is ever administered. So one by one any skilled employee either transfers to a different department and loves it or quits and loves it."
good,"management wasn't the best, scheduling wasn't fair, favortism happened there a lot! customers were rude and employees could be the same way"
good,"this job was fun for a young person, you got to hangout with your friends while working, though i might add this business that i worked at the management was not that great. sometimes the job was rewarding by people thanking you for your help. it did have its moment of customers blaming you for everything, but thats when you learn how to react in the right way and handle everything corectly."
good,"decent place to work, decent hours and managers are helpful and nice."
good,preform duties as assigned by management. such as restroom cleaning unloading trucks and cleaning spills. helping customers out to their cars
good,18-20 year olds running the store. Workers are not treated equally.
good,"A typical day at work was stressful but I am really good with handling stress. I have learned that if you come to work and do your job that will keep you out of trouble. Management was terrible,confusing, and not well organized. My co-workers were extremely hard working people and very nice to work with. The hardest part of my job was standing for 8 hours or more. The most enjoyable part of my job was to make the customers happy."
good,"I deal largely with customer service at the gas station. I will help customers at the pump, I will set the pumps, and take care of lottery and miscellaneous items they buy. When I work in the store I will check people out at the register and bag their groceries, I will also run the self check out. That will consist of helping the cashiers, helping the four customers at the u-scan and managing breaks."
good,"This was my second job and it was okay, i got exactly what i expected which was terrible pay and grunt work."
good,I am thankful for Ingles for giving me an opportunity to work for their company.  Although I was looking for advancement in the company. After talking to co-workers that have been there for years I was told there is none especially in the department I was working in.
good,The people that also worked at Ingles were not always nice. There was a lot of drama and then Managers didn’t do anything about it. Even when you made it known to them what was happening. The pay was good and the hours were okay but the people were the worst part.
good,Ingles is a Ok place to work! Most of the time when you need time off they work with you! Or around your schedule! No discounts on food from the deli!
good,I loved the job itself but was severely taken advantage of. There was no advancing and the raises were minimal to nonexistent. I enjoyed customer interaction daily.
good,"The company focuses solely on production and perfection rather than the employee. They, as a company, prefer the workers to not have opinions or new ideas, they feel threatened by someone coming up with new ideas, even if that specific idea may improve the sales of each store."
good,"My store manager never came to me about problems he had with me, and therefore, he replaced me. Never gave me a chance to do good and prove myself. I was put into the manager position with experience in the department, but not enough to be the manager. He never came to me to tell me what to do differently."
good,"I love the store I work at and the people I work with but the way people higher up treat you is ridiculous. They want you to work hard but don't want to pay you what you deserve. Benefits suck, pay sucks."
good,"I needed a job, they gave me one. Top management was mediocre and scatterbrained. Always felt like I was putting out fires, rather than pushing the store forward."
good,"The only reason I stayed at ingles for the period I did was because of the people I worked with. I gained friendships with those people that will last a lifetime. The store manager is absolutely horrible, he has no sense of authority or backbone in his body. He also does not respect the people around him. On the contrary, he CSMs are great. Very understanding and authoritative when they need to be."
good,"A great entry level job in high school, but not for long term placement or advancement. Managers Personal Home lives and relationships brought into the work place"
good,Its grocery retail shopping.  Some systems are  and aniquated behind other competitors.  It doesn't pay well and there really are no benefits for part time people.
good,"the days work was scattered. There really was no consistency. or organization. "
good,"I liked my position and responsibilities, as well as my coworkers. My hours were good and flexible. Although management is not well trained and do not treat people well"
good,"I worked here as a teenager in order to pay for my own auto insurance and gas for my car, any extra money I spent on leisure activities. It is a good job for someone who has no skills but needs a part time job"
good,"Working at Ingles gave me the required work experience I needed to begin my working life in the USA. The training was sufficient to complete the role as a sales assistant but the supervision was sporadic, Nice one day and not so nice the next. I found the sales assistants very helpful initially and supportive when you established yourself. On relocation to another store due to my family moving home I found myself in a totally different situation, better management and more stable supervision. I would work for Ingles again if the pay was better and they provided benefits."
good,It was okay. The boss was very strict and did not give me more hours even though I was better than all the other workers. The workplace was very slow paced since it was not as popular as other grocery stores nearby. The management was not flexible and considered themselves the priority above personal priorities.
good,"Slow, some of the managers are good, this place would be good if you don’t have payments you have to pay but not good if you do due to the low amount of hours they give you"
good,"It was a great first job. I learned a lot about how to deal with the public and how to run a register. My only complaint was with management. They were not professional,and they did not take their job seriously. They socialized with each other instead of doing their jobs."
good,"Ingles isn’t a bad place to work if you need a job. You get to meet a lot of great people, whether you’re a cashier or stocking the shelves. There are definitely worse jobs."
good,"Because I am a customer service manager, I directly deal with the Store Manager on a daily basis. Because of the store manager, I have not been able to fully enjoy my time working for this company. The store manager is rude and degrading, judgmental, nosey, and quite frankly a horrible boss to work under. The entire store can actually breath once he leaves the store which makes it easier and more willing to get our jobs done in a timely manner. Other than that, the people are great to work with and the job is demanding yet doable and fun. I have enjoyed dealing with customers and cashiers on a daily basis and managing the office and the store."
good,The store manager himself was pretty good but he was usually taking care of problems throughout the store. Employees are mostly supervised by customer service managers. Some were good but some were completely awful. No matter the complaints nothing was ever done. It takes a lot for people doing wrong to get fired and any decent employees get driven off because of all the problems you have to deal with in order to do your job.
good,"the management is awful and your severely underpaid. the hardest part is having to ring up the groceries, then bag all of them and then load them into the cart because the baggers don't do their job."
good,As a cashier you waited for costumers which seemed to come once in a while to check out. However during holidays like Thanksgiving or Christmas (which were required for employees/no requesting them off) the store would be insanely busy.
good,Starting out it was a great job! but after are six months it went down hill fast. The managers got be be power hungry and if the one who made the scheduled forget about having hours. They hire too many workers and throw all the hours on about five workers the rest get very low hours for the week. They also let the favorites stand around and do nothing while everyone else is forced into the grunt work. But for a short term job it would be great.
good,"I really enjoyed the 1st year of employment as a deli associate. I had the pleasure of working some good people. Like in any retail industry, management and staff  are either promoted, terminated and/or quit working for the company. I really did not have a desire to work for the company because of poor management at the location where i worked."
good,"I have almost nothing good to say about this company other than the fact that they hired me. The produce department was ill equipped, and the staff was judgmental and unprofessional, even going as far as to make rude comments concerning food stamp use in front of customers."
good,"It was just like any other grocery store, it was pretty boring. The store i worked at was also very small so that didn't make it any better. But overall it wasn't too horrible"
good,"Good place it 3 rd shift is hardest part, I learned better organizing since I been here good people with the company"
good,"The main thing about my job is that I feel that the company doesn't financially compensate for the position I work. I have to make orders, put truck up, and count the inventory. That's not counting the stocking I have to do."
good,"Ingles was the first real job I got (I mostly worked under the table up until that point, doing odd jobs). It wasn't fantastic, but everyone needs to start somewhere, and no one is too good for a job. The management wasn't great, they hardly ever knew who you were and they hardly ever cared. The work was fine and I did my job to the best of my ability. There wasn't much encouragement to do better or good at all, but it was made clear that they could replace you if you didn't. As far as a first job goes, it is ok and it does teach you the value of a good work ethic. As I said, everyone needs to start somewhere."
good,A typical day at work would be what you make of it. I've learned to motivate team members in completing their daily objectives. The store was poorly managed. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with friendly customers!
good,Job is okay. Pretty simple. Management is terrible. Very rude assistant manager. She has a bad attitude towards coworkers and customers. She never wears gloves when preparing food and frequently steals cookies from the case.
good,"There is no benefit of working here. The only good part of the job is that it works with a busy school schedule. The management is ""not very good"" because they don't care about anyone and they are just there for the paycheck."
good,"Much of the store is full of needed renovations and would not be a bad place to work except for the constant harassment from managers and customers. Has a problem with keeping employees because the customers know they can treat the employees any sort of way and the managers just go with it. Oftentimes they'll enact rules that the employees have to enforce but when the customers complain the managers with brush the rules aside and give the employees what they want. This is both hypocritical and irresponsible. While they are trying to add things to the store they will face many of the same problems if they don't fix what's broken and treat the employees better. Overall the job consists of cleaning, serving food, lifting heavy objects (if you're a man), dealing with trash multiple times a day and having good customer etiquette."
good,"there is alot of drama, and the managers never resolve it, people are always fighting. the pay is absolutly terrible. i worked there during highschool and hated it"
good,Expect the same everyday with no new project. You'll get your basic knowledge of work by self teaching or learning. There's very little success climbing for they'll most likely hire from outside first
good,"If it wasn't for one amazing manager, I would rate this place a 1/5. He keeps the business running and is the only happy manager there that doesn't flirt with or cuss out customers."
good,"A good first job for high school kids, easy and quick to learn all the responsibilites. The management is not great, the pay is awful if you're trying to support yourself but for supplemental income it's fine. The customers were often rude."
good,Its a great place for school aged employees.  The store manager at store #480 is not the best to work for.  Coworkers are fantastic.  The hardest part of my job is the lifting.  The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting and getting to know the customers.
good,"When I was working at Ingles, I worked in several different departments and I loved working with and helping the customers."
good,I became close to many of the customers.Especially nice to keep up with their lives and them with mine. It could get very hectic in the deli and to look up and see a customer checking on you was appreciated. The hard part of the job was the constant turnover and retraining so the deli could run smoothly.
good,"A typical day was to set up work area for the day, prepare breakfast, lunch and/or dinner, fill orders per request and greet customers. Management was very unprofessional, played the favoritism role and made bad judgement calls.  The co-workers were lazy and ran from work.  There was nothing hard about the job once you know what to do. The most enjoyable part about work was clocking out."
good,"Busy day everyday, occupied and productively involved"
good,because of the hours you worked third shift this made it difficult to have a social life.
good,"This is at some Ingles Markets, management does not relay messages, or tell important information. Stress is horrible."
good,A descent job that included good hours and an early start time. We would often come in at 4am to begin unloading a truck. I often would get annoyed at the other workers because I felt that they did not take their job professionally and often times would not show up or come in late. I also felt that management was weak and did not understand the workers at the store and did things that I found to be very inefficient.
good,"-Typical day at work consisted of cashiering, stocking, lifting, and cleaning"
good,This is a good job and isn't too physically demanding but keeps you busy which makes time go by fast. Make sure you disclose background because they do check and will terminate.
good,I would clock in and they would either put me in register or carts all day. There wasn’t much to do but to remember the codes and smile at every customer. Decent work place but it wasn’t really for me.
good,"I had the unfortunate experience that shortly after getting my job, I kept getting sick. One thing after the other, I had to miss a lot of work. They were annoyed with me and were rude about me having to call in- even when I brought in a doctor's note for proof. It got to the point that they didn't want me there and were trying to find reasons to fire me or persuade me to quit. Eventually, one evening my manager sent a coworker into the bathroom to spy on me. And I no longer felt safe or comfortable there, resulting in me quitting the next day."
good,The company is good to work for as long as you are not in district 7. The district manager in D7 claims he isn't friends with his store managers but he is. He shows all kinds of favoritism towards his store managers that he like. If he doesn't like you watch out because one slip up and he will fire you. Doesn't matter that you put in 10 years.
good,No help or benefits. Schedule is an absolute mess been here 3 years and never have I had a set schedule. There is really no way to advance yourself in the company.
good,The job was very accommodating for me as a full time student. Most of the managers were great but it was difficult to get time off and there was not enough peep to compensate for needed days off.
good,"I worked at Ingles for a little over 2 years, and hated every day of it! They disrespect their employees. They care nothing about your employees. People are always calling out. They expect you to do your job plus the job of 4 other employees. The pay is ridiculous. They definitely play favorites."
good,"I was a cashier for almost two years and out of that every year you would get a 25 cent raise, but the people who would just get hired would either start out at what you pay raise was or 25 cent higher."
good,"While I enjoyed my base job, as a barista, the reason I left was lack of proper resources and a constant lack of help. M"
good,"The job as a Deli Clerk was not too difficult, and was fairly reasonable to manage. Responsibilities include cooking food, maintaining the appearance of the deli, cleaning, running the cash register, and shutting the place down for the night. The job wasn't bad at all, so long as your fellow employees were helping. Management was not hard to get along with, but they seemed to turn a blind eye to the needs of the deli. The biggest difficulty was  an unfair share of the workload due to other employees slacking off. It was not unusual for fellow employees to leave their post, with no notice, to go and do things that were unrelated to the job, such as talking to friends, texting people, and taking cigarette smoking breaks, all while on the clock. When this situation was brought before management, they simply did nothing. I'm sure that this is not true of all of Ingle's locations, but it was true for this one."
good,"I didn’t really like the job, there were a lot of rude customers. Some managers barely talked to me, and the other one was very rude to me when I asked for time off due to my health issue. The pay isn’t worth it for what you deal with. I felt like I barely had a check when it felt like I worked 24/7."
good,"It’s chill, not too stressful. It’s a good stepping stone or a good first job. Workers are pretty nice, management is cool. Could be worse but nothing to really complain about"
good,A lot of good people work there some work better then others most of the time the store is pretty clean except the bathrooms on the weekends when there is no one actually doing it
good,"When it comes to Ingles, this place seems to always be slow during the non holiday seasons.  Management can be very inconsistent with each member of management team and is considered to be very unfair."
good,"A lot of the high up management don't respect the employees that are high school and college students. Many who work there don't do their jobs either and find any chance to walk away from their registers, which can make it harder on the workers who actually do their job right."
good,"Very fast pace."
good,good job for younger adults by not really a lot of room for advancement. does a mostly okay job working around a schedule. usually a busy place so time goes by fast
good,This was my 1st job and I was still a kid and not very insterested in working.I don't remember very much becauer it was ove 20 years ago. No more information is avaliable
good,would never do it again not my type of job.  I just never liked delhi work I do enough housework at my own home needed something different to do.  Not really their fault but I just never was happy there then we also bought a house and property 75 miles away and no way was I driving that far for min. wage.
good,I really liked working at Ingles when u started. I liked my job and it's responsibilities but in the last few months I was there everything changed every other week there was a new policy it got to be to much.
good,"I was part-time working full-time hours. Employees were rude, they didn't work with you at all. Their healthy standards are not high. Managers were rude. Made promises for moving up or raises, but never follow through."
good,Great place to work. I really enjoy working with the other employees. Everyone pulls together to get things done. I enjoy meeting people and helping them.
good,"The work was not mentally stimulating and put an extreme strain on my back and legs. It was, however, very reliable work. I would recommend it to someone who needs reliable work."
good,"liked some of my coworkers however,the manager was on me to move faster even though I was still getting used to where the products were located.then there was a store reset which changed things around considerably, which set me back again. I then became ill with bronchitis and was out for two weeks.i had called and informed my manager of the situation. I called after the two weeks to tell the manager I was ready to return to work at which time he said I was replaced."
good,The schedule was limited with a few hours because they had too many people and they wanted all the employees to stay unde 40 hours. At times if the schedule was not done correcrly to cover all departments and shifts you would have to leave your department and work elsewhere.
good,It is good of you don't have stuff to pay for and if your married or have someone helping you out with things. The management could've been a lot better they weren't always doing their jobs they chose favorites and would just stand and talk to them
good,"As there are many grocery organizations to work for, Ingles is just another one. There is nothing overall great about this company but it's a decent place to earn money."
good,At Ingles most workers don't want to work but when they do they consider it as just another task preventing them from leaving early instead of helping a customer. Training dosent seem to be consistent with people saying doing different things and not knowing what to do.
good,"Working at Ingles has been a great expierince, I have worked at 3 different stores and they have all been wonderful and worked great with my school schedule."
good,Images is an overall place to work if you're ambitious. Not much of a homelife and promotions are few and far between. Upper management is typically fair.
good,"A typical workday for me would be to clock in and then  go to my register to start cashiering. Then afterwards when it's time for you to leave, do your designated chores and then clock out. I learned about the ins and outs of customer satisfaction. My management there was and okay experience, I had some I liked and then some I didn't. Most of my co-workers there were easy to get along with which made the job experience a little better. The hardest part of the job I would have to say would be to not let the difficult customers get to you , everything else was good. My most enjoyable part of working at Ingles would have to be interacting with my peers who worked with me. Also, making new friendships through the workplace."
good,Busy place to work with great co-workers and good hours.Supportive Management most of the time and ability to grow with the company over a long period of time.
good,This job is stressful. Management tends to rush you through your daily duties. Other employees may or may not be of a team mindset.
good,"A typical work day included handling cash, working with customers, checking them out and bagging their items"
good,"They pay pretty competitively for the jobs they have, but expect long periods without much to do, not a busy location. Certain members of management enjoyed writing people up and would look for any any excuse to do so, others were truly kind human beings so it depended on who was scheduled."
good,"I loved my job, I needed full time. The hardest part was not enough help.  I was there by myself most of the time."
good,The work shift was ok. It had its moments like any job. Management use to be very understanding and now are will tolerate nothing. The hardest part of the job is having to pick up others slack. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping costumers.
good,typical retail environment
good,not a whole lot of fun on the job
good,I was pleased to work for Ingles Markets in the
good,When I worked here things were a little bit boring at times but this is to be expected in a cashier job. I was held to a high standard and expected to do well.
good,Its ok. Need to pay more to keep quality help. Need  to have protocols in place to ensure everyone does the same thing that is required of them. Wish they had incentives
good,The pay for the amount of work expected is terrible. Managers do nothing to aid employee retention. Lots of rules but staffing is so short that rules aren’t a priority. Wild West sort of environment.
good,"Fast paced, no training but I needed none. Pay scale is low and no real benefits , my management are decent folks, but your hard work isn't paid any better than the average fool that you work with."
good,Wasn't a bad place to work its just that nobody wants to work. Pace depends on the time of day. Cleanliness is EVERYTHING!! Always make sure your hands are clean.
good,"A great place to work if you are just getting started. I worked at a Ingles for nearly a year and really loved my job. The pay is well but you must be the type of person who really focuses on his or her job if you want a raise  (so basically like any job, if you do what you're supposed to , then you'll do just fine)."
good,Working for ingles was ok. I would not work in the deli again. Things were done in the deli that i would never do to feed my family or friends. Staff was nice. Management was a joke though.
good,This is just a stepping stone kind of place. Great for young people. They don’t pay well at all. I was there about five years and I only made 9.50 by the time I left. They have you working crazy hours when your a bookkeeper. I’d close the store meaning I’d get out at about 11:30-12:00 and have to be back in at 7:00 to open the store. People rarely ever get full time. They work you as close to 40 hours as they can without hitting that mark so your not considered full time.
good,I worked at this company for a year and they treated me well was a great first job learned a lot about helping customers and how to work a deli. I learned everything really fast but it is not what I am passionate about but a great job for a young person trying to figure out who they are.
good,"There was a minimal amount of stress but it kept me on my feet and busy. Ingles is a great place to work and succeed. I was let-go due to the lack of money coming into the deli from customers. The management was very disrespectful to me , using no respect when spoken to me or any of the other workers."
good,"I worked for Ingles for 1 year, as both bagger and cashier. The job itself is not demanding at all if you’re used to working 7-8 hours a day. The job does get boring after a while because it’s all rinse and repeat. Hours are fairly inconsistent unless you practically beg to only work certain hours/days. Your pay is usually right above minimum wage for the area. Started off and stayed at 7.75/hour. Management was decent with the exception of that “one manager”. You’ll only get 1 break if you work a shift that is 5 hours or more. 30 minutes, and a 10 minute break for smoking. Ingles is a good first job, but not for life."
good,"Not a bad job for your first job when you are younger. The deli is usually pretty laid back and the tasks are easy. However, when they decided it's time to really focus in on something, they'll stress you out like crazy. Every manager has their own unique personality and way of handling things. However, most lack transparency. If I or someone else for that matter is doing something wrong, tell us. Nine times out of ten, we'll understand and we'll take what you say into consideration. Customers will be customers and some customers aren't nice. Overall, a decent place to work for a young adult."
good,"Usually fast-paced; especially on weekends. Good job for entry level workers but being an older worker the physical demands take a toll on the body, Most of the time enjoyed co-workers and management was decent as well. Only problem is corporate demands on local store can be stressful."
good,The hours are sporadic best. The managers maybe nice but regularly change. No benefits unless a full-time employee including overtime. The business is a good place to learn customer service skills.
good,"I loved working in the Bakery, not the Deli. I know what to do and do what is needed. I have learned how to work a cash register. And the hardest part of the job is doing too many things at once."
good,"I previously had worked at the Ingles deli, and it was enjoyable hard work, plus the hours were flexible. I had to leave because I was in college full time then."
good,wonderful people in the deli at ingles. that made for a great work day that went by fast and fun. it was an easy job 10/10 would reccomend to others..
good,It's a good place to work if you are just starting out. They really try to work with you on anything that you need help with. There is more than one department to choose from. The co-workers and managers are nice.
good,ingles is a great company outta high school easy money not hard but moving up is the hardest in the company i never received a raise during my time there
good,"Constant turnover"
good,"I worked at Ingles 2 years ago while I was in high school. I was a cashier. My starting pay was $7.25 and unfortunately, it stayed the same throughout the entire year and a half I worked there. My manager gave 75 cent raises to everyone who had worked there for a year except for me, and I never knew why. He even gave raises to people who had been working there less time than I had. I was a decent employee. I was always on time, always did my duties, and would even stay after my shift sometimes. I'm not sure why I never got the raise. "
good,Ingles is a good place for a starting job but not much room for advancement. Only horizontal chances and very few vertical advancement opportunities. A
good,"Flexible hours if you ask, but sometimes you will be scheduled the night shift from 2-10pm and then scheduled the next day morning shift from 7am-2pm "
good,"I genuinely did not care for working at this place. Some managers were easy to work with while others were difficult because they could be. The main manager was confusing, especially when it came to things such as overtime. I felt that the environment at the store is very unprofessional, be it from customer interactions to communicating among other workers."
good,It's a good place to work if you're in high school but that's about as far as it will go for you. It could also be a possibility if you're a college student.
good,"I worked with the cashiers and bag boy. I ran the store when manager was not in the store. I help customers and department manager. I enjoyed the customers,"
good,"I worked for the Ingles Markets Inc in the deli department for a year. A typical day at work would involve clocking in and attending to the station you were assigned. I learned the baics of working in the food industry because it was my first job. The management was okay, it could have some work. The hardest part would have been not knowing your scheldule for the next week till like the Friday or Saturday before.Therefore, you couldnt plan to do anything. The most enjoyable part of the job was making friends and interacting with different customers throughout the day."
good,Company uses a lot of micromanaging.  I have made good friendships with fellow employees.  Store managers are kind and help out the pharmacy when needed.
good,You're well paid considering most jobs these days. However management doesn't acknowledge their best workers and poor performing employees seem to get away with anything.
good,"This company is great for you to move and learn new departments but, unfortunately, they don't give raises for the new skills that are obtained. I was there for two years with no evaluation when they are supposed to be done yearly. Never even a pat on the back for a job well done."
good,This place is great for first time workers. You don't receive the best hours. Pays minimum wage. Great co-workers. Management is okay for the most part.
good,If you like a fast pace work place this is the job for you how ever it is a Stressful work place you get really nice customers and you also get not so nice customers. that will push your buttons . I have  been at ingles for 1 year and it is fun to work their because of some of the employees are fun to work with. and some not so fun to work with.and I wish they had longer lunches .in stead of just 30 minutes .
good,"I normally come in the earliest at 7am right before the morning rush. When I enter the kiosk I make sure that all sanitize bucket are full and there is enough product for that day. when my boss comes in I assist her with re stocking and making sure the other baristas take lunch on time. In the midst of those I always make sure that ever customer is happy and satisfied with each drink and food product that we make for them that day. The most enjoyable part of my day is my customers...They aren't just my customers they are like family as you get to know each customer one by one you start to create relationships and that's what its all about. you never know what person has to go through before they enter your place of business. My goal has always been to keep a smile on the customers face, it will guarantee a high come back rate and increase the sales!"
good,"A lot of work, high expectations for low amount of money. "
good,"Un dia tipico en ese trabajo, era trabajar cuatro horas y desayunar,luego seguir con las otras cuatro horas correspondiente. No disponia de almuerzo y es un trabajo en negro por lo cual no me pagaban mucho economicamente .Ademas,no tengo un seguro ni una obra social. "
good,"wrote orders, cook, manage employees, inventory, worked on the grill, worked on the wok, made pizza, etc."
good,"I worked in the bakery department. My job started out as being a closer, which was not altogether terrible. I quickly started training as a cake decorator and was told that, if I did well, I would be hired on full time for the position. Though I was regularly told that I was doing well, I was never offered a chance to learn more than the basics, and therefor never given a chance to advance in the department. I was then trained to make the doughnuts in the morning, which required me to start my day at 4am. This was difficult, because I had a child, and finding a babysitter at that hour was a regular challenge for a while. I did, of course, leave the company of my own accord with no notice, so ill feelings abound on both sides."
good,It was a good place to learn the basics of a grocery store. I liked the people that I met while working there it really was helpful to me
good,"Ingle's Supermarket is a supercenter grocery store that caters to all consumers. Their focus is to meet and exceed to retail competition and adjust prices accordingly. "
good,"- A typical work day can go from extremely slow to extremely busy within a matter of minutes."
good,Busy workplace so stayed busy luckily. I learned a lot about seafood and how to cut meat. Was a great learning experience and met some great friendly people.
good,"Ive learned about stocking and running a acash register from the company, co workers dont put effort into their job, hardest part of my job was being treated wrong because i didnt suck up to my boss"
good,"Clock in, check out customers, that's your day."
good,"It was an enjoyable job for the most part, your there all day for small pay. A typical day at work was like any other retail related job. My co-workers were very welcoming, helpful an nice."
good,It is a great pleasure meeting customers and their needs. There are some days where customers are very friendly and want to talk to you. There are some days were customers had a bad attitude and it did not seem like they want your assistance on anything. This is a good company to work for if you are looking for some extra money in college or high school. There is not much opportunity to advance in the company unless you have seniority with the company. I was not pleased with the environment that I was working in because it seems like things were individual focused instead of team focused. You just have to be smart and know who will stand by you and who will not stand by you. I was at Ingles for 12 years and I enjoyed the friends I made and the people I worked with. I just had to move on and advance my career because I have a college degree and I can go to bigger and better places. It is so hard to get a raise there because they expect so much from you. But I was thankful to have a job and it was time to move on to bigger and better things. Be wise and smart about everything that you do and you will make a great employee.
good,It starts out at above minimum wage if you work in a specific department other than cashier/bagger. Up front isn't a big deal but you get minimum wage and no hours. Working up front is for kids in high school.. Working in the deli or other departments is 8/hr and you are underpaid i promise and will never average more than 20-25 hours a week. Mgmt at my store was a joke but that can vary depending on store. This is a very cheap and greedy company that values money not customers or employees. I know you can say that about every company but it's emphasized here. The reason i give 3 stars is because it is extremely easy and can be laid back. The main reason i left was the people not the job. Don't expect any benefits for a few years however.
good,"Bag groceries and bring in carts."
good,It was my first job and great learning experience. i enjoyed it.
good,"If you can get into a good department where the employees work well together, the job can be good and fulfilling, and there is the potential for good paying positions. However, the company relies heavily on the ""Good Ol' Boy"" system; management doesn't have any clue what they are doing, nor do they have the proper training; departments are treated differently in regard to fairness/favorites; employees work 12-hour shifts and finish their work, but are wrote up for ""leaving without permission"" while other employees are absent for ten days without leave and are not fired."
good,"As a stock clerk you can work during the day or overnight from 10pm to 7am on truck nights, and 11pm to 7am on back stock days. I learned to check invoices from discrepancies, order product for the store, Unloaded trucks and worked the freight to the shelves, and trained new employee's .Coworkers were at sometimes negative, some of the management was new. Most enjoyable part of the job was the working relationship with coworkers. Hardest part of the job was doing the inventory of the store."
good,"I did it all there, bagged groceries, ran a register, dealt with customers, stocked shelves, worked in the produce dept. Had so many different mangers, cant even remember half their names or faces. Not really a hard job, got boring some days."
good,"It is very apparent ""The good ole boy system"" is alive and well at this location. They tolerate being insubordinate to your management and being tardy. It is rare to get 2 days off in a row (on graveyard shift at least) and you get unprofessional, sarcastic remarks if you ask for it, like you're asking for something special."
good,Not a very good place to work. Poor management and alot of favoritism
good,did maintenance on the main door if broken
good,"The store is usually never to busy, so its pretty easy but there isn't much job security."
good,"Typical day at work, I start by blocking all the displays, endcaps, and promo section of the store. Then go to the back room and check if there was anything that we could fill up with, if there was put it on the shelf. Then, I would sweep the back room, go to lunch, come back check and see if anything needs to be reblocked, take the trash off, and go home. The hardest part of the job is inventory, I would help count and then help crunch the numbers. It would take about 12-14 hours to do."
good,"I was working here as a second job, trying to get deli manager to set my days off the same as my first job was impossible. Trying to get out of work to handle family emergencies was like pulling teeth."
good,"Ingles is a great place to work while focusing on school, however those who choose Ingles as a long term company will be disappointed. The higher in management you get, the more corruption and nepotism you will notice. It more about who you know, verses how well you perform."
good,"I worked at Ingles at the store, retail level and I also worked for their distribution center in Black Mountain, NC. The culture is very different in both places even though they are the same company."
good,I started out working at Ingles in December 2017. I started out as a beggar and was quickly moved to a stocking position about three to four months of working there. In my experience this is a great first job to have if you want to get your foot in the door of working. There where always great people there to teach me so much and the management was always fair as well.
good,"The hardest part of the  day is a bad guest, but you get used to it. management DOES NOT respect your availability. The staff is enjoyable and the work environment is clean and safe."
good,"Great for students . After you get past 40 the company doesn't seem to appreciate you.  "
good,"Wasn't bad, just bad management. Raises were refused even after working their for a year. The work overall was fairly easy and only sometimes became overwhelming."
good,it's a good job but it's not a career. there are definitely favorites so advancing is difficult. but the customer service managers are great and the job overall is a great opportunity.
good,"Be prepared to go in and have to actually work, it may seem like common sense but some people will show up and then get upset that they actually have to work. It is physical work and you do have to pull pallets so its not all easy breezy and its not extremely difficult either."
good,"Ingles market has a very strong customer service quality. They can serve as a great place to start and learn how a functional work place behaves. They also taught me many important skills, such as communication, teamwork and problem solving."
good,I liked working there at first but I have been working for a year now and I feel some things could be better handled. Management could do a better job.
good,"Was an okay company to work for, didn’t get along well with management except for the store manager, they wanted to work with a skeleton crew and we couldn’t leave till we were finished, I remember one night we worked over 12 hours and had to come back a few hours later."
good,Depending on who you know you may like working there. If you are shy and not part of the in group you should not work there. Managers make fun of you and have you do the jobs the in group doesn't want to do.
good,Lack of communication between the employees and managers. Alot of drama just like anywhere you work. Lacking on stocking skills. In one department in particular did not take there stocking seriously always hard to find anything that you needed.
good,"At first it was a fun place to work. There were many friendly faces and the customers were very kind. It eventually became very mundane and boring to work there. Everyday was the exact same thing. Sometimes customers would get upset because they didn’t understand our system. When it was not busy, time went by slower than anything, and I can’t say it felt to go by much faster even when they were busy. It wasn’t a terrible first job, but it was definitely not a place I could’ve seen myself at for longer. Eventually, it got to the point where I felt like this job sucked the life out of me."
good,Decent company to work for. Benefits are not that great. I truly wish they could relocate pharmacists to another store/position instead of letting them go upon store closing.
good,"I have worked for Ingles for 3 years. After I turned 18, I was able to move up in the workplace and gained 2 different raises in less than 6 months. Most of the employees are really nice. There are not any discounts and you must be available on sundays(most of the time)."
good,The way they worked you wasn't worth $8.00. It should've been more. No time off. If you ever couldn't make it to work for ANY reason you had to get someone to cover or you got written up.
good,"Decent place to work, flexible schedule, and good people. Doesn't pay as much as other places though, and many people don't show initiative. Management all the way acts as if it's just a job, so they don't try to make the company better."
good,You are given instruction and as long as you follow them you are left alone. There is no micromanagement like some other companies I have previously worked for.
good,"Have to pay close attention to customers and pay attention to cash and credit card transactions.  You have to be willing to do what is asked, at times you have to check dates of the products at your isle, or fill in at uscan if needed."
good,"Our management was very poor"
good,"I learned how to makes subs. Management was not that great, issues with the scheduling. Opened, set up, and closed sub bar and hot bar. Co-worker atmosphere was good at times. People would call out and we would have to do the extra work. The hot bar food is disgusting and the way it's made is worse."
good,"Job was what is expected as a front end cashier. Management was not friendly, encouraging or approachable. Fellow Cashiers were fun to work with.It was a typical retail job. I loved most the customers and helping them have a better checkout experience."
good,I love working for Ingles it's a great company with great employees. My only problem is right now after transfering stores I don't have anywhere near the same hours much less the hours that work for me and my ride.
good,"Ingles Markets is a pretty laid back environment. As long as your finish your work, then they are not very strict. I worked in the deli. My manager was amazing. She is great about working with school or other work schedules."
good,"Ok job environment, poorly  managed at times, too much favoritism. Pays management decent, however, they are not competitive in pay with other companies."
good,"Coming in to clock in for work, heading to the back finishing where I left off yesterday. I proceed to stock shelves and block items until the truck gets to the back to unload. After that I work until it’s time to clock out."
good,"I would prepare food for the hot bar, wait on customers, slice meats and cheeses from the deli, clean the dishes and the floors. Prepare food for the salad bar."
good,Working at Ingles honestly wasn't all that bad. I worked in two separate locations during my time there. I moved up quickly within the company and ended up being a night shift grocery manager. My only complaints are the pay (below the national average for this position) and the amount of gossip between associates.
good,This is one job I would not allow my child to work at.I know people who been working there for year or two and just got on to a full job position.And they also give people a rise to who they feel like it.But they will work you like crazy.
good,"A typical work day includes assisting many patients with understanding their medications, filing electronic claims with insurance companies for payment of prescriptions, data entry, greeting patients, customer service."
good,"ringing up customers and assisting them all day. For the most part you have friendly co-workers and management is decent if you deal with the right people ,new manager from ive heard is rude...."
good,Overall good job for people in high school but not career wise. They could do better with the pay rate. They didn’t do the pay raise in enough time. They barely work around school schedules.
good,Well paced customer service with very good customer service. Also pays well for students who are still in high school. I recommend this store to people in the brevard  area only
good,"It was an okay job out of high school, but I am looking for something a little more advanced. I did learn to handle money and customer service. I had a chance to advance, but I was in college."
good,"Strictly work , great customers  supervisor loved my work. And the  customers lived my creative meals that was prepared. Ingles super market is one of the best  supermarkets in South Carolina.  It's been around for years."
good,"While employed at Ingles, I gained knowledge in customer service, cake decorating, and baking. I enjoyed my working experience at Ingles and recommend their company for employment."
good,"A typical day would include working at my register and greeting customers until time for my break, then back to work until time for my chores and then time to go home. I learned many social skills,to keep an open mind, and that mistakes happen. Management could use a little work and the culture of the workplace could as well. The hardest part of the job is when a customer is displeased with anything and I have to see the look on their face whenever they've been let down. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people as they check out and just talking with them and engaging into conversations."
good,The job just was not what I wanted to do anymore and the pay was not worth the work. I also received very few hours during the week. But some of the people were very nice and overall interesting people.
good,"Working here there is a ton to do, you have to learn how to do everything back there from cutting meat to cooking and cleaning and serving customers and doing the cash register."
good,I really enjoyed working there meet a lot of good people. Always busy plenty of things to do. Best I of all these customers would come through my line when I was working and tell me they missed me which is a great reward.
good,"For anyone looking to gain experience with customer service and also trying to get their first job, Ingles is an excellent place to start with. It was very hard to have promotions just cause every spot was filled but there was never much talk."
good,"overall this job is for people that are looking to receive financial stability while in college, I would not recommend to someone trying to make a serious career."
good,"You learn so many different things at ingles, from how to handle customers to new management tactics. Dealing with the public is never easy, but it is satisfying knowing you can help them."
good,"if you were not liked by the mangment it was a hard. Thankfully I was and was given up  to 40 hours a week even tho worker were only titled part time the managment of the store it self needed alot of work, but over all i loved the people and the work wasnt to straning."
good,"Good place to work, unless you plan on making a career. I've worked there for on and off 10 years, and still haven't made a decent career. Though employee's are very easy to get along with."
good,the job was to really bad just cold in winter month and hot in the summer. long hours that was fine but no notice. If you got a coast of living raise the insurance would go up and take it
good,It is a good place for a starter job. You develop soft skills with customers and learn to stay calm in front ignorant/angry people. Overall it is a starter job and not a place to have long term goals.
good,"Being a cashier at Ingles Markets is a great way to start building your work experience on your resume. They work with your schedule. You can move around the company (i.e. bakery, deli, pharmacy) . This is an easy job."
good,This was a very difficult place to work as most employees were part-time young kids right out of high school.  It was very hard to build relationships.  Part-time positions were all that was offered and I need full-time employment.
good,"Management was not as good as I thought because many manager disregarded worker complaints."
good,"I was a teenager at the time.  I enjoyed the customers and enjoyed becoming friends with the employees.  Overall, it was a positive experience. I don't think I would want to do it again, though."
good,The job is one that could be very enjoyable. A bakery is a fun place to work. You provide happiness for kids... make their birthdays special. Also Ingles has the only supermarket bakery i know of with double whipped buttercream icing. IT IS AWESOMELY FLUFFY. Delicious. And the deli has the best chicken salad.
good,"Decent pay, poor raises.  Corporate bosses disconnected from workers in the trenches actually making the money.  Not enough recognition for a job done well but more than enough if you slip up even slightly.  Not enough support from management to discipline subordinates when needed."
good,"I was hired at Grand-Opening and worked until November of 2016, the same year. Management was way too strict and never gave Employees advancement opportunities."
good,Ingles in Hiawassee has great customers and fine management. Ingles works great with your schedule and will also call you for additional work shifts if you are available. The hardest part of the job is standing on your feet for a long period of time. Co-workers are great at Ingles and most will help you pick up shifts and take shifts when needed.
good,"Went and sliced meat and cheese."
good,"In the bakery, you might work as early as 4am or as late as 8, and it's earlier at other stores. Theft is a constant issue, with both employees and customers. Your work isn't always valued, and swing shifts are necessary when coworkers call out or never show up for work again. Pay isn't much more than minimum wage. Ingles is notorious for hiring lots of people at one time and cutting their hours until there are only the ""good ones"" left. Overtime is frowned upon."
good,There a good place to work for except they don't pay more thanthan a little above minimum wage. Not a whole lot of advancement unless you work there for a number of years.
good,"waiting on customers , full filling there needs, cook,  setup, prep,sales, ordering supplies assisting in inventory. Frying, prepping for next day. Cleaning work area."
good,"I love this job, however, I do not see much room for growth or advancement with the company. I have learned a lot about customer service, how to work as a team, and appreciate the efforts of co-workers. I have learned how to understand and identify problems, as well as providing solutions for customer satisfaction and approval."
good,"Store is poorly run. When things break, it often takes a month, maybe longer for it to be fixed. Store manager is lazy and cheap with employees. No overtime is allowed due to the store manager wanting to cut money where they can. There is no holiday pay."
good,its a nice highschool job and you get to meet a lot of people from the community but overall i wouldnt recommend a long term career there
good,ok place to work but no benefits mamagement was pretty decent. Pay was very low. Not a hard job. Great place to interact with people
good,"work entail doing everything"
good,"The only thing I really have to comment on were the co-workers. It's because of them I stayed as long as I did. A typical day was unloading the truck, putting the products on the necessary aisle. Then, we would go back and put them on the shelves."
good,"A typical day consisted of unloading our grocery truck, seperating it into its specific locations. Stock product and finish aisle, block shelves, order for next truck."
good,"A typical day of bookkeeping entails working on a tight schedule.  Deposits have to be done by a specific time as well as drawer and till counts.  Must be able to complete office duties while managing cashier's and their scheduled hours.  I'm always working with a store manager and customer service manager.  As a bookkeeper, I was trusted to take care of sales and deposits.  If there was a discrepancy or error, I had to work with a manager to find the error and fix it.  The most difficult part of the job was the second shift hours and identifying possible financial errors that occurred during first shift.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the experience I obtained from working with the public."
good,"Working as a cashier I had a good time until I realized the management was filled with drama. The only way to advance was to please your manager in a shallow way. If you work hard you still may not get recognized."
good,"This place is what gave me start in my customer service. I learned how to respect the customer and I always gave a smile. Also when I worked here, I always felt safe and secure. I got to work with some great people. I also got to meet people in my town that I never crossed paths with. For me, Ingles was a great start off job. It taught me a lot, and even gave me some experience that I used later on."
good,"I was able to be cross-trained in various departments, handling customers in different areas of the store was very interesting ."
good,"This position involves report completion, price changes,  checking in vendors, bakery returns and back up cashier."
good,"the work at ingles was hard because there was a lot of lifting, and walking. but I enjoyed that kind of work. "
good,I learned the to stock properly and in organized fashion. I also picked up a little more responsibility skills. Hardest part of that job was being there when I wasn't wanted. My team members made me feel more welcome eventually.
good,I work in the Meat Department. My day consist of Cutting Wrapping and keeping the department freshly stocked for our customers.
good,"This Job is Flexible with you schedule, but it is low pay and boring work."
good,Great environment to work in. Learn new things everyday. Am very dependable dealing with money and deposits. Positive attitude towards customers.
good,"A typical day of work included micromanagement and verbal abuse over minuscule things. I have learned to separate my personal feelings from work, and powering through things I felt like were unjust. I also learned to be more personable and I have gotten better at talking to people and helping them work through the same hostile environment I was in. Upper-management often berated employees in front of customers and coworkers, threatened jobs over small things in the heat of the moment, they were not professional, and did not value their employees or their efforts. The hardest part of the job was slowly starting to not enjoy what I did anymore, as I loved my department and the people I worked with. I enjoyed working with my coworkers and there wasn't anything that I would not do or didn't want to do."
good,"Co-workers would often leave work on the next shift."
good,"Ingles is an understanding and easy workplace to maintain a job at while finishing my education at Western Carolina University."
good,When starting off working at ingles I would get enough hours then months in they had gotten cut and it docked my pay. Managers would leave and  have no one occupying costumer service. At times the hiring manager would be rude with employees during a personal phone call.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of my daily responsibilities and if I 'closed', I would have additional 'closing chores', which included the cleaning of the Frontend of the store, bathrooms, and parking lot.  It was an overall easy job, but pay raises were never considered for somebody at my job level.  After a year, I left because it was my first job and while satisfying and not a complete nightmare as feared, I wanted to expand my experience and get a job with better pay.  I stayed at minimum wage for a year with no disciplinary actions filed against me."
good,I would say that I loved this place . First job I had for over 6 years. Very friendly staff.  Very clean work place. Job was easy. Very understanding supervisors
good,I picked up a lot of everyone’s slack and I’d stay late to help out management or another coworker. Wasn’t paid enough for what I was doing. Some managers were better than others.
good,"I was excited to work there at first, it’s my first job. When I began, I worked a lot. Now, I barely get any hours, so I don’t make much weekly, especially since I get paid $7.75/hour."
good,"Very little diversity, male driven, unfair promotion practices, good ole boy's club environment, and very hard to hire and keep good help. I wish this experience would have been better!"
good,"i really liked my coworkers in this job, i just didn't like the job itself because of managers and customers. Of course that is everywhere so you just have to be able to deal with it"
good,"The work at ingles varies from hour to hour and day to day. The work can be slow and very boring or extremely fast and stressful. I would say it's ok, but they make many empty promises."
good,NO Review  Not happy with this company.  Never fixed anything always patched things up and I was the one to get hurt. Did a lot of fixing of different equipment myself.   That is all.
good,"One thing I didn't like about Ingles is the management and the closing hours... Third shift get it the most because sometimes you have other co-workers leaving there mess behind  for the next shift to clean but with it all said and done, if you want a laid back slow paced job..then Ingles is the one...."
good,"It was a good job for part time. Management was unfair to workers. Some had more hours than others. Management was also biased towards certain workers, but they were all nice people."
good,I started my first day of actual work to being called in the office over a write up for clocking in late during training with management. I showed up 5 minutes before clock in time regulations and it just went downhill quickly felt like another joke
good,"Ingles had its own issues, but while doing my time working for the company, i realized how it was a job for people to just get some experience with. The pay didnt match up to the odd tasks you'd recieve, or the last second shift changes."
good,It is a decent starting job with good management. The management there is understanding and helpful most of the time. The work there is relatively easy but can be tedious. Overall my experience was above average.
good,It is a very nice place to work if you like a fast paced environment.  It is also strenuous with a lot of lifting and bending.  In the department I worked in there was also a time to have things finished and displayed
good,It was cool working there but they weren't very lenient with things going on at home and well that was an issue from the start along with them taking over a month to get me my first paycheck
good,"In the Deli Department if a person was hired for a specific duty such as salad bar he/she also had to do sub bar, hot bar, meat and cheese cutting, cashier, etc. even if you were busy with a customer. Customer service and Deli Mamagement was sub-par."
good,"My work experience with the company was my own and others seeking employment may enjoy the job thoroughly. I however did not, and for me it was the management. They didn't seem to care about making the store better and the negative attitudes seemed to trickle down. The employees were all hard workers but all seemed disappointed with the management. "
good,"Job enlargement rather than job enhancement and pay is not at all competitive.  Their is not much communication, all positions are trained, ""on the job"" and there is no Computer Based Training.  Management depends on which store they are working at."
good,Iv worked there for two almost three years was a great place wen I was comeing into the work force now iv graduated so looking for better job store manager is great tho all the mangers are
good,Ingles helped me get started with a career in management. Company defiantly needs to update their culture and get with the times when it comes to pay structure and technology.
good,"It was a good starter job. The employees were very friendly and management was caring. There was a lot of team work, especially in the deli where I worked. Overall, I enjoyed the job, but left in order to pursue other career paths and due to moving."
good,"Overall good first job, fair job at working around schedule. Management was very respectful. Good work environment. Had some minor experiences, some unfair treatment."
good,"As a sales associate at Ingles, all you really had to do was the bare minimum of cashiering as long as you did it with a smile and had a good attitude. When closing or opening, you would clean. Hours were fine, the pay reasonable for a teenager but nothing else."
good,Worked here for about 3 years. Was full time for a year. When i started they promised me certain amount and gave me 25 cents less. Takes a long time to move up if at all. Raises are 25 cents a year unless you complain to corporate and they'll do a little more. Work load was a lot for 1 person. Expected a lot of you but for barely any pay. SO MUCH DRAMA. The adults act like high schoolers. The managers are buddy buddy. If you know the store manager you'll start off making more than the rest of the employees and if youre a male youll make at least 50 cents more than any woman there. Even if they've been there for 2 years longer. Every employee is replaceable and youre told that.
good,"When i began working at Ingles there were a lot of advancement opportunities, however once my previous manager left things went downhill. I have been training for a co-manager position for a little over a year and a half and was told that I was next in line for the position, needless to say I was told by my new manager that I needed more experience. This would be fine if he didn't ask me the following week to train the new co-manager. I have been with Ingles since 2013 and my hard work is being overlooked and I am now working pretty much as a co-manager but still getting paid less than all of the other CSMs that I helped train. The new manager does not seem to care about his employees and it is very discouraging."
good,"For the most part, working at the iMarket wasn't so bad. I got somewhat decent hours and somewhat decent pay. The biggest issue I had was the management. The managers don't really know how to be managers. They aren't very good with people."
good,There are flexible hours but you do not get paid enough. It is clean and the people are nice. You are expected to provide great customer service. There are no benefits or discounts for the position that I was working.
good,I'm a people person new how to put a smile on someone face Ingles was laid back I would recommend this job to other's no bad place to work. I may would go back in the future
good,"Ingles was never very busy and there were many times where there was nothing to do.  However, working face-to-face with customers is a very enlightening experience."
good,"In my position, I worked with a number of competent and even some experienced coworkers who were self-taught. Management was easy to deal with--most of the time--but benefits were promised, as was full-time hours, and the promises unfulfilled eventually led me to leave the company"
good,The 2nd shift has been very nice to work with.  Good management and co workers. The company has a program to train you in other opportunities with in the company.
good,On normal days I come in to work have to greet my customers ask for an ingles card if they don't have one I ask if they want me to look it up or get a new one. We have chores to after 8 it is a list by the office with our names on it with things to do. I built up character and just like how I used to be shy now I'm dealing with thousands of people weekly I've really came out of my shell and not shy anymore. I think the most hardest part is trying to juggle school and work and a social life. Because I want to make money but also I want to hang out with friends. I have work based learning at high school so now I leave early but they still take away my whole weekend Friday Saturday and Sunday only time I'll get those days off is if I request it off. But I like meeting new people their different personalities. I just really want something new I've been there for more than 6 months.
good,"lots of room for advancement in this company they would always hire from within. "
good,i enjoyed working and being around and seeing new people everyday. management was very well the workplace was very oriented and well together the only hard part of the job was standing in one place all day
good,"I learned how to deal with customers, make lots of different salads, and prep different foods. My deli manager was great and very helpful if ever needed. The hardest part of the job was making sure everything was done in a timely manner."
good,I would not recommend working here u less in management. Lower level employees are given no motivation and even in management there are true incentives. Work/life is very imbalanced. The pay does not match the demand.
good,"On a typical date at work its very busy because its a food market, but the customers are great its just the managers can be rude at time and have extreme favoritism."
good,"I worked as a cashier at Ingles when I was in High School. I filled out a sheet on what hours I could work (which was after school) and they still scheduled me before I got out of school, and would get upset because I was late. There is no benefits unless you are a manager."
good,"Worked there to save money, did such, when something better came along, I didn't hesitate to go and get it. Not a bad place when I worked there several years ago, but not sure what it is now."
good,Lingle's cares more about expanding and opening more stores than taking care of their employees. They do not properly train management when switching from one store operation to another. Lingle's use to be a great place to work but they have forgotten who made them successful which is the employees.
good,"A typical day at Ingles would start with getting ready for a busy day. Usually everyone works together to get the day going smoothly. Management would help wherever they could, but it'd mostly be the deli clerks. We all had to stick together to make sure the smiling face of our customers continued to come through. I really enjoy the workplace, along with all the customers."
good,"I really enjoyed the people and the managers at this job. To me, this is a great company to work for, for people who really want flexibility and have just began working from high school."
good,"My day consist of constant customer service both the customers and employees."
good,Come in before the store opened cut up produce for vegetabale and fruit trays. Management worked wit you hand in hand. Co-workers very friendly and helpful. Most enjoyable part working with the general public and meeting new people.
good,"Easy job, sometimes long hours. Enjoy working with people and coworker . Half hour for lunch, ten minute for a break. A lot of cleaning and sometimes disagree with management."
good,They need better management. It can be a great place to work but the management is what prevents it. The scheduling of staff and workers to cover shifts is never consistent. Lack of communication from worker to employee is something that can be worked on. Easy work load for job that can be very high paced at times.Great job for someone in school or need a part time job but willing to be flexible.
good,"typical retail setting , they work you 40 hrs a week but do not pay out benefits to the majority of their employees, no real opportunity for advancement"
good,I enjoyed the work that I did however it was difficult to balance my personal and work life considering I worked night shift
good,"Typical day at work was somewhat boring, not looking forward to going to work every day."
good,Ingles isn't a terrible place to work but it isn't amazing either
good,"A typical day at Ingles consisted of stocking, inventory control, loading and unloading trucks and customer service.  I learned how to deal with customers of different cultures and personalities.  I also learned how to take control of a situation when dealing with customers who were unhappy.  I strived to lead the customer in the right direction and to make their day better if I could."
good,I learned to take on a lot more responsibility. It is a decent place to work. My co-workers were friendly and helpful. The customers were always nice.
good,"Can be a greaat starter job, especially for high school students or someone looking for part time job."
good,A typical day at work was pretty monotonous aside from the customers who become friends. The customers are the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,Summer job for kids in highschool. Enjoy meeting new people.
good,"This was a very peaceful place to work. While the nature of the work was mundane, it was a good employment opportunity for me to make some money while maintaining a student career. I learned some basic organization skills from maintaining the back storage room. My co-workers were all very friendly and made working there more enjoyable.  The hardest part of this job was the constant bending over to lift boxes while the most enjoyable part of this job was the lack of stress in the nature of the work."
good,"It was a nice opportunity & great people to work with at night; however, I could never get full-time hours.  "
good,"Working at Ingles was a great experience, due to never working in such an environment. Only issue was that the management was poor."
good,I had problems with the management of the front of the store. I never spoke to him after so many attemps to converse or just get alone with him.
good,Ingles was a pretty good company to work for as I got most of my experince witrh them.
good,"Ingles is a good job for someone with a busy life, but does not have a very big moving up opportunity and does not pay enough for anyone with bills."
good,"Work here was fine. As a cashier a day at work was very simple. You came in, checked customers out and made sure they were satisfied. As a bagger the day was similar, with the added responsibility of retrieving carts throughout the day."
good,Working at Ingles is place where you work fast paced and are always around customers. You must learn customer service and hospitality when around as many people  as there at Ingles on a daily bases.
good,After a year of working on the front end I transferred due to the new front end getting a higher base pay under the promise of a two dollar raise. After three months they had failed to give me the promised raise. Situations like this were common within the store.
good,"It’s nice because if you ask for days off a couple weeks in advance, you will for sure get them (as long as it’s not a holiday) but managers pick favorites, and if you aren’t one of their favorites you will definitely know"
good,There really isn't much I can say about working at Ingles. It was an average work experience. Everyone did what they were supposed to and nothing really stood out.
good,It wasn’t a hard job. Asked a lot of their employees. The managers were cool but wouldn’t be understanding over some stuff. They were pretty decent with pay and hours. Could potentially have room to move up in the company by starting at the deli.
good,Ingles is not the place if you don't want to work.  Ingles dos expect you to be on time and ready to work.  The drug test are random and no way to know when they will come.
good,"A typical day for me at Ingles was i would clock in, go to the back and put my apron and hair net on and start my day. I mostly cleaned the rotisserie chicken box, either one or both. I would clean all the pieces and then have my small break; after my break, all i had to do was clean the floors since i was night shift. After the floors, i was free to leave. I learned time management by cleaning the rotisserie boxes and the floor. The management at Ingles was okay but the management in the deli department wasn't the best due to there was a lot of drama. The hardest part of doing this job was just having to do the same thing every single time I came into work, after a while it got boring. Most enjoyable part about the job was the pay was weekly."
good,It was my first job in high school. I don't have anything really negative or positive to say about this place. It was an easy part time job. I mainly only had a couple of 4 to 6 hour shifts each week. Not very hard.
good,"-a typical shift would begin with taking customer's orders, and then either processing the transaction or preparing the order."
good,It's not a bad place but I want something more in my field. People work well together. Set hours and asigned positions. The work is not hard and the time moves fast pace.
good,Ingles is a great environment. Very friendly. Great for a first job. The management is very nice. Due to having to relocate I was unable to stay but I would definitely go back!
good,I wouldn’t recommend if you aren’t ready for additude cause there is a lot of it at this store . Certain mangers are snakes in the grass and just dint understand people’s problems
good,"This was my first job, and got to advance quickly through the ranks and become a manager in no-time. The different jobs offered at this site are fairly easy, involving money-management, food preparation, stocking, and customer service. They are fair to their employees, and work well with schedules."
good,I would recommend working at Ingles if you are still in school or just as a temporary job.  The schedule is very flexible and the management and staff are nice.
good,I enjoyed working with others while stocking shelves. I enjoyed the physical part of the work because I like putting all items in correct place and making sure things are correct.
good,Management is in need of improvement. Money is ok for a starter but no benefits for part time worker.  I enjoyed some co workers. The kitchen area was a cleqn enviroment.
good,It is a good part time job but for a full time job there are other places that have better benefits and a better salary. That job was the same every day and was just boring.
good,"Its a good job for teens who's still in high school and want a little extra money to spend on fun activities or other important stuff they have always wanted like clothes, shoes, etc.."
good,"not the best job out there did not get enough hours on a paycheck, could not work overtime. management was a joke and the environment was not that great either."
good,Icant give kuch of a review because I was working for ingles for a short time. But the time I was there wasn't bad. They pay is not bad for the grocery department.
good,Its is a good job for high school students. Possibly college. Customers were not the friendliest most of the time. Poor training in the deli but that does not apply to all stores.
good,Working at Ingles Markets has been a good experience overall. Most positions work with your schedule or create avenues so create the best schedule for you.
good,"Pay is not the greatest, great jobs for kids in school but not for adults trying to make a living. Just really not my thing but I still work there for now"
good,"Ingles was okay to work for. I believe in hard work. The job was fairly simple. However, I wish the reference helped me to get better jobs. The management was  okay to work with."
good,The job was easy good hours and good money it was pretty good hours made really nice friends and they train really well there are some mean people but mostly a good place to work for
good,Is a good place to work and start a career always you can found coworkers available to help and teach and they have different styles to jobs for everyone no discrimination
good,"Actually this type of job was too fast for me.  It was strenuous, involving carrying heavy pans, boxes.  Always dishes to wash/sanitize, trash, running back and forth from front to back of store."
good,"management there definitely keeps you on your toes as far as  ""what section am i working in today"" but a lil bit of mystery in life keeps things interesting."
good,They would not give us a a whole lot of hours and the hours we did work were very stressful. I also wasn't the biggest fan of the managers. But i was grateful for the job experience
good,"Overall, I love my old coworkers. The job itself was not difficult. The only time I had ever had a bad experience was right after my miscarriage. I called in as soon as the store opened and said I would not be able to work until full recovery. My boss was not there at the moment and a former employee of mine took it down as a note and gave it to her as soon as she came in. I tried to call in a few weeks after and got noreply. I then decided to put my two weeks notice in and my boss read the message and never replied. Also told all my coworker I was let go. Overall an unfair experience at the end of my career."
good,"It was a long time ago since I worked there, I worked there as a teen and it was a great starters job for a 14 year old and to past by time in the summer. As a 30 year old man I need more from a job such as benefits, and higher pay. As a teen it was good. 👌👌"
good,This job has very slow and very fast-paced moments. A lot of the time you just have to stand at the end of your register for forever with nothing to do but organize the shelves around you. Sometimes management would get mad if you talked to the cashier next to you.
good,This is trash and racist other than that I cannot complain the workers with smooth but I appreciate the experience I work with also it taught me how not to take things personal
good,"I liked working at Ingles, the work was as expected and I loved the face to face contact with customers everyday. I also liked that the days there were mostly busy, the days seem shorter when you’re constantly working."
good,"The store it's self isn't bad at all but between customers and management it gets stressful and irritating to work in such a place, hours can get bad from time to time but the pay isn't worth putting in the amount of work we do."
good,"I left because I was told to do something by the store manager then got yelled at by the co-manager. when asking the store manger, was thrown under the bus by him saying he never told me to do that. I will say he was really good about working with you schedule."
good,The management absolutely sucks. Especially since they all conspire against people that get onto them for not doing their jobs correctly and breaking health department codes
good,"In my time at Ingles I worked in 3 different departments, and all of them were okay but the experience you have is based on which you're in. Some will be slow and monotonous, other's will be fast and you'll always have something to do."
good,At Ingles everything ran smoothly until at night when all the weird things started happening. Customers would do anything they could to rip apart the store.
good,"I worked for Ingles for two years. For the first year and a half , I was a bagger. For the last 6 months of my time there, I was a cashier. The hardest part of being a cashier, was not having the ability to move around while working."
good,It was a good environment to learn different aspects of the job. It has more opportunities to keep things fresh with chances to go into new departments.
good,"A typical day at work at Ingles was helping customers finding products, collecting carts, bag groceries and cleaning the store. I learned to take pride in what I did and enjoyed helping customers. The hardest part of my job was trying to find something for the customer and if I did not know the location I would asked another employee or my manger where i could find it. The most enjoyable part of my job was pleasing my customers."
good,Enjoyed working for the video dept. Meeting the customers that came thru. I had to find another job with more pay to support my family. this facility was a wonderful place to work for.
good,"Benefits with this corporation are very poor.  As with any company, working becomes acceptable is the coworkers are good, knowledgeable and have a strong work ethic."
good,"Decent place to work. Job stability if you do the job and show up. Most people are good people there. Managment does try to work with your hours, and days. Try to help you move up in company"
good,"Typical day: stocking, managing back stock, reporting errors in orders, placing orders, making bales of cardboard for recycling, unloading trucks with pallet jack"
good,Management does have problem with scheduling proper amount of workers for high work days. But the training does go into full detail on how to do your job well.
good,I have worked at ingles since September of 2018 until now which is January of 2019. I have been up front at the register since ive been there. I was wanting to leave bc the managers are so rude with customer service. Mangers stated she didn't care if I had kids I had to stay and couldn't. I had got moved to the bakery and currently working there at the moment. It's okay it's just alot for onw person to do on your own. And also have to assist customers and it's very hard. I always come in and they leave a mess and 100 boxes they have not taking to the back or done any trash it's just all done for 2bd shift to do I think it's wrong and shouldn't be tolerated bc I'm getting sick of it I'm the bakery if they cannot clean up after themselves before other employees come in I mean we clean go 1st to come in should be the same for second. I still haven't gotten a pay raise. Bakery starts out at 9$ and hour I'm still getting paid as a cashier pay 8.50. I have asked the store manager and she has never changed it I'm getting the right pay and I also have 2 kids cannot  get paid it's not making it in my house hold
good,Ingles was a good place to work had fun working there just the scheduling was never a set schedule and the management wasn’t the best. But I did get along with most everybody there.
good,Overall great starting job that teaches people skills and money handling. the hardest part of the job was pushing buggies in the August heat. A typical day consisted of assisting customers and checking them out. management was friendly and flexible. the most enjoyable part of the job was helping and being nice to people
good,"For the amount of work that night shift had to do, it was not always worth the pay you got. Day shift would often leave dried meat caked onto the deli slicer, which night shift would get scolded for when it came time to clean at the end of the night. The tagging system for meat and cheese was frustrating, because not everyone would follow it, and people would quit and new people would be hired so frequently that it was impossible to keep track of how old something was sometimes, so a lot of things were thrown away for safety."
good,It wasa good place to work. I liked being grocery manager and working nights until my daughter was born then i needed off of nights but there was no spot for me on day shift
good,it was a okay job for high school  it was not very difficult the people were nice they paid way to little it was a om  job I would not go back again it was
good,Ingles is great for high school kids and someone wanting something part time or to just get out of the house. Could not live off the hours I was given to work.
good,good place to work if u still in school or need a job for the money for the holiday they only work you 4 hours a day I loved the job at irst then I noticed I never had no money but the people I worked with was nice and friendly and love the people that came in but the part time job ant for me
good,Ingles could be really stressful and hard at time the  customers could be really rude. But other than that it was great sometimes it was slow and got boring. Most of the managers are good but there was some managers that were really rude up there which made things hard.
good,Good starter job especially for a kid in high school. If you have roommates you can make it work by becoming a customer service manager or a department manager but to live by yourself you need to either become an assistant store manager or higher.
good,Decent for a first job type company. Benefits are expensive and not good. They way under pay employees and management. Everyone is expendable at this type of company.
good,"At first I had a good time working at Ingles, but after a while,  I began to dread going. The managers were hateful at times, but others were kind. It depended on which one you had to work with. Some of the workers were also hateful, but it depends on what Ingles you’d be applying for."
good,Just your basic grocery store. Nothing flashy but not too bad. fast paced work environment. Managers were good as long as you were doing your job. The employees have a great family feeling with each other.fast
good,"Ingles was good for a first job. The job wasn't to bad, the employees were the issue. Not to mention you never saw the managers unless you called over the intercom. The only discount you get is only if you have an Ingles card, which doesn't do anything if you're eating food."
good,"If your looking for a job while in school this is the place it’s not for a person looking to advance in the world, most of the people working on the floor are retired or they lack ambition in life so if your an adult there’s other places to work"
good,"They don't give u enough hours to work there. The pay was minimum wages. When working cashier u have to clean the register, take trash out, sweep, mop, and bag customers items."
good,Ingles deli is an okay place to work. there was no overtime for part time employees. The work environment was very stressfull and the managers were not great
good,The majority of people there were always very friendly and professional. Hours were very competitive due to a high volume of employees. Management was all in all quite nice. Main downside of this job is the lack of a real paycheck. Low hours and low hourly pay.
good,"As a first job, Ingles wasn't a bad place to start, but the location I worked in was very cliquey. You weren't able to get in the hours you wanted unless you were friends with managers."
good,"From the start of the morning to the end of the night, there is never a dull moment at Ingles Market. Upon entering the establishment, you are bound to see smiling faces greeting you at the door. With outstanding customer service representatives, the energy you receive from the employees is heart warming and will always want to come back."
good,You are given an opprotunity to make an average wage doing an average job. There is a slow to no promotion pay raise rate and you will bae asked to nothing special.
good,I think the hardest part of the job is getting along with your co-workers. Some of the co-workers can be really rude and think that they are better than you and try to out shine the other workers. Some employees think that they are the boss of you and try to tell you what to do.
good,"I got this job as a way to pay for gas and a couple bills while I finished off college. I got exactly what I'm getting paid for. The hardest part is reconciling the fact that some people are just mean no matter how nice you are to them, but I don't know their stories."
good,I think that store was poorly run. My drawer came up short 3 x but they never showed me video or went into details of what happened. I have never been short on register and it was only when i worked with one manager my drawer came up short.
good,When i was there i had fun due to the other employees but moving up was hard due to being one of the smallest stores in the area training was very limited
good,"Making and serving sandwiches, while also serving the hot meals and working register. Had over 4 separate trainers and only one actually tried and cared enough to train me."
good,"This was my second job ever and I really enjoyed it for what it was.  Of course there would be days when you would want to rip your hair out, but I had more good days than bad days."
good,They are well aware that you are human and don’t get too upset about mistakes unless you make the same one over and over again. Corporate doesn’t always make decisions that make sense but they never make it impossible for you to deal with their decisions.
good,"Unloaded trucks, stocked items on shelves from the trucks, straightened items once on shelves, and did a final cleanup at the end of the day.  For the most part, the back room of the store was VERY messy."
good,After a while of working there the management started to change a little bit and it wasn't that great of a job. My typical day at work consisted of walking in to the store clocking in and going to my register and start my shift ringing up customers groceries. The hardest part of the job was trying to get the long lines to go by fast when the store was really busy. I didn't really have any enjoyable moments while working at ingles. I learned to be quick on my feet and work harder.
good,"It was somewhat monotonous. My day never varied, except for the mood. Sometimes it was calm, when everyone wasn't sniping at each other. Management of my particular department didn't help matters, as they were always demanding the associates help the customer instead of helping themselves. Fellow co-workers were pleasant to work with"
good,This job is a very basic job. You are a cashier and you check people out and tell them to have a nice day. They like to be sure that you ask for the customer's ingles card.
good,yes no maybe no maybe yes maybe no yes did they do that I liked this job for real though I wish I was still there cleaning and running the register I was a beast
good,The Ingles market managment worked really great with my schedule as I went through highschool. I remember enjoying some parts of the job but not liking other areas.
good,"The other people that worked there were all very nice and helpful, but when it came to the managers it was very confusing and  they were not upfront with what they wanted done. One manager would tell you one thing to do and as you're doing that, another will come and ask why you're doing that and you need need to do what they just at that moment asked you to do."
good,"they dont really trust new employees with really anything and dont want to teach a lot because they ""dont have enough time."" hardest part of the job was the downtime."
good,"Working long hours with standing on your feet with only minimum pay. Enjoyed seeing regulars in the area, and Sundays being busy after church service."
good,A good company to work for. Most locations are in small communities. Management does try to let ask for time off. Many stores operating hours were not reflecting the business being conducted.
good,"Ingles is an average company to work for. If you're under a great manager it is fine, but most are terrible. All upper level management rarely ever speaks to their employers. They are also kind of greedy. There are no discounts on anything!"
good,I haven’t worked at Ingles in over eleven years. I’ve heard a lot has changed in that store and in the company. I enjoyed working there but the pay was not that good
good,"Some of the management is bias to certain people yet if you do your job, people tend to leave you alone. The workplace culture can range from a desert to Alaska depending on the department."
good,"I had an ok,experience,and the job is easy. It's very easy to attached to the residents,and then they pass away. The atmosphere was ok as well. The pay is dissent ,but I didn't like working overnight hours. There is also no way of advancing,and they would rather hire from outside of thecompany then to promote from within.I haven't really seen any African-Americans promoted at all , they work pretty hard ,and do a wonderful job. The raises are 15 cents every six months which is tax on purchases in some states. The raises are a joke. I liked a handful of employees. Also once you put in your two weeks notice they never hire you back,nor can you come bck to visit."
good,okay place to work as a part time job to make ends meet until could find a more permanent place with full time hours and benefits to work at locally near home
good,"Good company to work for friendly service,  it's a good startup job for anyone in high school or college it's.  Not a long term career the work is hard but fair"
good,Good place to work good people there good pay positive attitude good benefits nice people and very clean and overall a good place to work very easy to
good,It started as a good job then the money was hard to get raises been there three years and only one raise management isn't the best people on the shift are two faced and talk behind your back isn't a positive place most the time
good,Relatively good place to work if your a student or elderly. At $9 an hour there isnt much of an advancment. Some days are harder than others. But a good place to start.
good,"My job was to pull stock for the shelves.  We had to pull out of date stock and then fill the shelves with fresh products."
good,"Wonderful work environment.  Cultivates customer service skills.  Management took responsibility for decisions and provided support to employees as needed.  The hardest part of the job was constant standing, comes with the job though.  Most enjoyable part was being able to interact and connect with customers."
good,Deli associates get treated very poorly. Deli department associates have way to much stuff to do in very little time & was very short staffed. Always people quitting. Lots of drama.
good,Ingles is a good high school job to have. The pay is good for a highschooler. They work with your school schedule and won't work you over unless you Volunteer
good,"Ingles Markets is a good company. They have a great atmosphere and they are very family oriented. Ingles Markets is a great place for a starter job, flexible schedules and decent benefits."
good,"On a typical day, it is not very busy. The lines don't get too long. I have learned to operate a register, as well as process checks. Management was nice and understanding. The hardest part of the job was during the holidays, such as Halloween and Christmas because there were many people trying to buy things at once. Also, it was difficult at first with the checks but eventually it became easier. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to communicate with a large variety of customers as you were checking out their groceries."
good,"Alot of responsibility. Not enough people.  I didn't have a very nice manager and co workers.  I honestly did not have a good experience, "
good,Ingles Markets is the perfect job for someone beginning in the work force. They work well around school schedules. Management changes frequently. Breaks are nice
good,The hardest part of the job is communication between the coworkers and some of them likes to have attitudes with you for no reason and it is ridiculous.
good,"Ingleside at Rock Creek is an upscale Continuing Care Retirement Community that is in the midst of an expansion project that will double their Independent living apartment offerings. Much of the day to day operations and work place culture are going to be defined by that. Expect difficult parking, and to have to be very flexible to adjust to the changes on campus."
good,Ingles is a great first job. The work is easy and the pay is not that bad. The work days are never exceedingly long and the staff is easy to work with.
good,"great place to start off, can grow fast in the trade. great for those out of high school as well. great customer service skills and benefits. not a miss."
good,very old fashion work place. very customer friendly but not with a lot of benefits. very unpaid work place for the pace and work the employees have to keep up with.
good,The company was not a real good company in my opinion.  I worked there to just provide for my family.  Culture was not good at all the store I worked at.
good,The pace of the business was sometimes slow but also fast. The customers were rude from time to time. But at the same time they were also kind but only to a tee
good,"he trabajado en este negocio y he aprendido mucho, va buena gestion y lideres fue bonito, para mi fue una buena experiencia"
good,This job is like any minimum wage job that can pay reasonably and can cooperate with school hours; but the era of fake professionalism and the guise that the store was higher class then it actually was made this workplace hard to work at.
good,I only worked there for a short period of time. It was a fun job cause there were different things to learn and they wanted you to advance and learn new things.
good,It's a good experience. The hours were usually really good and they tried to work around schooling schedules and such. The staff was generally nice and worked well together.
good,This job is good if you are looking for a decent-paying gig that is pretty fast-paced. The manager when I worked there was generally easy to get along with.
good,"Show up to work on time, don't call out, don't get on the bad side of management. The hardest part is remembering all the codes for produce and getting quicker at scanning. Management could be better but they're not that bad as long as you do your job and don't call out/get out of your shift."
good,"Being with Ingles for as long as I have, I'd say it's a decent place to work. That being said, there is plenty of room for improvement. Their dress code is outdated ando sexist for one, and their lack of employee benefits is hard to chew sometimes."
good,"Good people. Hard work and stressful.  Overall a good place to work. Like all jobs, Ingles has it's ups and downs. I mainly just want to be closer to home."
good,Typical grocery store work environment. Everything comes down from HQ so there is no real autonomy or room for personalization. It is nice working with so many different people.
good,"The typical day at work was working cash register, helping customers and serving food. I learned how to help customers, work the register. The management was okay, there was a good amount of control in the work place."
good,"Great for a first job.  Learn basic cash handling techniques, customer service skills.  Very repetitive job with little pay.  You can request certain days off but no paid time off."
good,"The employees are a bit out of it on some days. "
good,"Consists of waiting on customers, handling money, running errands,etc. Shifts five hours or more require a 30 min break. You always need to be alert to the customers around you."
good,A typical night at ingles was kinda the same like walmart. I learned how to order merchandise for the shelves. Management there was a little different they actually take care of their own isles. My coworkers were also fun to work with. there really was nothing hard about the job. The most enjoyable part of my job while I was working there was everyone got along even though i was not there that long
good,"I would get on a cashier and I would check people out, the management was there, but not as much as I wanted them, the hardest part of the job was balancing school life and working at the same time."
good,"Competitive pay and family are not two words this company really cares much for.  Overall management seems to care for their people, but also it is evident that they are there to make money."
good,"I had this job back in high school. I got decent hours, and okay pay. My postion was was cahier. I felt overwhelm a few times when other cashiers would dissappear and not being at their stand to ring. The customers were the most enjoyable part of my job. They were always so nice."
good,"A typical day at work is scanning and bagging groceries, cleaning, and providing great customer service. Most of the management and co-wpokers are very nice."
good,"Great prices, many vegetarian options and choices among meats. Many frozen meals to choose from, employees generally welcoming."
good,"Its a job, they don't pay well unless you climb up the ladder a good bit. Management is on you a bit. It puts food on the table."
good,This was my first real job and I enjoyed working at ingles. I learned to work with others and provide social skills by talking to customers. It is a great place to learn about dealing with customer service. It is a really good first job to have.
good,"Customer service, cleaning, dealt with money, Some co-worker was fine. Got to work with family. Was alright for a first job."
good,"A typical day is doing simple cashiering. "
good,"I made subs and plated food everyday. There was a lot of drama in the Deli. Some of the people that I worked with were easy to get along with, but others were really hard. Management in that department wouldn't do anything to correct the bad behavior of some. The hardest part of the job doing other peoples job for them."
good,"Overall it was alright,the pay was low and recognition is hard to get.But the people I worked with were great with exceptions.It was a great opportunity for me. To get on a better understanding of one on one customer service to be able to feel that bond when you can provide customer service and be proud of it."
good,"Ingles was an excellent first step into the working world, and provided plenty of experience in dealing with the public."
good,"I was a cashier, I greeted customers and scanned their groceries. I learned to stay patient with people. The hardest part of the job was, just standing there when I didn't have any customers coming through my line. I really enjoyed working with friends."
good,"Overall the job is quite simple and the customers are friendly for the most part. However certain employees/management act extremely childish and set up the entire social interactions between other employees to be similar to that of young, immature teenagers, despite them being ""adults""."
good,Everything about this company is a joke from pay to the way they treat their employees. Definitely not first on my list. The coworkers are all about about themselves and the managers are all about their money. So no.
good,ingles was great!!!! loved my manager Tina Hales. the reason I quit is because of my ex stalking me but the job itself was great.
good,In charge of the warehouse taking in inventory and making sure products reach the shelf and are in date. Loved working with the people there. Just always worked hours that were different every day.
good,This company cut back everyone's hours to avoid having to offer health insurance to its employees.  Rate of raises and promotions are low.
good,Get my draw and go to register and start scanning customers groceries. Learned responsible as a teen.The managers were good.
good,"Ingles can be great when there is something to do however, a lot of times the place will be slow and you will be stuck with nothing to do until you go home."
good,Good company to work for.  Could hire more full time employees.  When employed with this company I worked full time hours with part time salary and benefits.  Hope this has changed.
good,A typical day at work included working with nice and receptive team members to assist customers. Management and co-workers proved enjoyable to work with as well as cohesive. The hardest part of the job was telling customers we weren't able to make custom cakes and also not having a desired product in inventory. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers.
good,Like every other cashier job. the job is boring and repetitive. Not a bad first job but do not suggest for long term occupation.
good,While working at this job I met new people all day every day. My coworkers was fun and enjoyable to be around. Hardest part of the job was learning how to type in WIC to ring up.
good,"its a place to work if you really need the money, i wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they are just flat broke. the management was horrible, just plain awful, they didnt care about anything and the main manager there is an alchoholic who doesnt know how to run a business"
good,"The store was dead all the time and had horrible prices compared to other stores. I didn't like it at all, and was glad to get out."
good,"flexible hours, nice management, the company likes to promote from within and if you are interested you can move into a management position"
good,Co-workers were fun and easy to get along with. Needed more people on night shift to take off the stress of those that were undermanned.
good,"Good job, friendly people, hours ok, nothing really bad to say it was just a job. with nice people and good atmosphere that would be great for anyone to work in. like working the deli the best while i was there"
good,Ingles has helped me to become more diverse.  Working with the general public has been a great experience and I hope that it will pay dividends in my other career opportunities.  The staff was great to work for overall.  I have enjoyed my time there and wish them all the very best.
good,Worked well with other co-workers who worked hard to insure a good customer experience for our customers.
good,"Good place to work for, mine was in a small town so at times could be fast paced and competitive."
good,I stocked shelves and supported my team. Assisted with anything that needed to get done. I was very efficient and felt like I had a lot to offer but was unable to do so. I was able to make long term friendships and a great relationship with management. I am thankful for the opportunity and experience.
good,At this job I made many new friends and had a good time. I wouldn't care to go back to this job.
good,"Nice People for the most part."
good,"Ingles is probably one of the best jobs I've had in the food industry so far. Every person has their roles, but luckily, I'm still allowed to help others fulfill their roles so we can complete the job more efficiently and with better results. I've learned many things about cooking, cleaning, and serving people satisfactorily. Management in the deli itself is tricky at times, but luckily the head manager of the store and customer service managers have been helpful whenever I've needed to speak to anyone. All of my co-workers are friendly, although sometimes lazy. I've made friends with many of them and hope to keep the friendship alive even after I've left the company. The hardest part of the job is how quickly I've learned, because I end up having to do most of the work on nights when we're short-handed. However, the ability to make friends, socialize with co-workers and customers, and be the best at what I do is very enjoyable."
good,"Hard work, good pay. Too much drama though and always running out of stuff or things are breaking all the time."
good,"productive workplace, clean and neat. not the funest job but its a job and it pays the bills."
good,great environment but bad hours available. only 19- 25 hrs a week. no full time for 1 year.
good,"Always expected to do more. Nothing was ever enough. If you increased sales 20% they wanted 30%."
good,"The store was awesome, clean and good to work for. Management could use some work but over all it was a good place to work for."
good,"Unloaded produce and grocery trucks Maintain sanitation and food safety requirements established by government guidelines to ensure the best rating from DHEC regulations "
good,"rang up customers groceries, bagged them and interacted with customers"
good,"A typical day of work here was hectic. First off, I would gather supplies for the cakes due out that day, then produce cakes to customer specifics, all while helping other customers, and producing cakes for the display case. The hardest part of this job was multi-tasking and getting everything ready by the time of the customers pick-up time. I am quite lucky to get along with most of my co-workers, and we really have a pretty good team. The most enjoyable part of the job is when customers are thrilled with their special occasion cakes."
good,"Customer service is a large part of the super market industry and it taught me a lot. The management was fair and reasonable, but still stern with what was expected. Co-workers there were great people. Hardest part of the job was customer service but also the most enjoyable."
good,"The managers would cut your hours down to 8 hours a week, and would hire more people."
good,I received experience here typical that any cashier would.  They were good about letting me work in other departments.
good,"My typical day at work starts at an upbeat pace at 06:00 and ends, likewise, at 14:30. The pace rarely slows! I have learned to work in a group with multiple unmotivated co-workers, which has been my greatest challenge. The hardest part of the job is conveying important messages to the management team that is on different levels of communication and knowledge about current events/circumstances. On the contrary, the most enjoyable part of the job is when a customer expresses sincere gratitude for helping him/her, whether or not the request is large or small. It makes me happy to know that my customer is happy!"
good,I bagged and I clean the bathrooms and I unloaded the trucks and I stocked the shelves and I kept the store clean
good,"Typical day in the department I work in can be stressful time to time.  We have a high turn over rate in the deli because you either like your job or you don't.  "
good,ring up the mrchindise then when we was not busy i would restock the store.
good,"Overall, I really enjoyed being a cashier at Ingles. It was kind of simple, mind-numbing work...but that was what I wanted at the time. I was pregnant with my first child and I continued to work throughout my entire pregnancy. The Store Manager didn't exactly have his priorities straight. He was very rude and had unreasonable expectations of my abilities at the time.The Assistant Store Manager, however, was an amazing boss and was so supportive of me during my pregnancy. He went out of his way to accomodate me with regards to my doctor's appointments and the two weeks of required bed rest I was forced to undergo. My co-worker's went out of their way to teach me little tricks and shortcuts and how to get a bag boy's attention when I was in desperate need for some assistance. After my son was born, I was welcomed bak with open arms. Everyone was so very good to my husband and I and our growing family. We were always treated with the utmost respect. I would still be working at Ingles if I hadn't recieved the promise of more hours at better pay from Taco Bell. Even now, I would gladly go back to work at Ingles if given the opportunity."
good,"first thing setting the case make sure we are ready for business. i need to put together cut list. check in product and get with vendors for there orders. place all meat orders. Ive been in the restaurant business all my life and so when we order meats at the restaurant they where already cut so learning all the different meats and cut has been very educational. The staff is very easy to get along with they all have the same passion to help our guest. I find the best thing about this job is I can walk the customer around the store and help the pick out and suggest things for dinner, parties and events."
good,"ok job, picked orders. got paid production pay, so the faster you worked the more you got paid."
good,A typical day is very productive managing people making sure all baked goods are in date and baked for sale.
good,"It was my first job. I enjoyed working there, but there was a few problems. i.e I was still in school. They had a hard time with my work hours. Asking me to come in before I even got home from school. But I still tried my hardest to make it in."
good,I learned many thing working with Ingles. I had many task to handle and I succeed in the task every time. Even though it was only a summer job I enjoyed it. 
good,"management is easy to get along with."
good,"Assisted customers with check out; operated cash register, bagged groceries"
good,I had very good managers and coworkers.  It was a very good work environment that was very constructive.
good,"Ingles Warehouse is a diligent and no nonsense environment. A very stable job, however, if your attendance is good and you perform tasks as assigned."
good,"Not bad for my first job. I worked afternoon shift and I bagged groceries, assisted costumers, stocked the shelves/freezer. I also cleaned the store. All of my managers were nice but were sometimes hard to find when I needed to ask a question. Got to know a few of my co-workers and they were nice people varying in age and position in the store. There wasn't really anything that was hard, but there was a lot to do. And my favorite part was getting to see people I knew that came into the store."
good,"It is not a hard job, Ingles is fine other than dealing with rude people and not getting enough hours."
good,Pay is minimal and can at times give sporadic schedules there is no set schedule.
good,"Ingles was good jumpstart on my career, and has opened new doors for me."
good,Didn't really like the slow pace that went along with the job. But it wasn't terrible
good,"greeted customers, and helped them find whatever they needed. Scanned their items did cash or electronic transactions. Balance cash drawer for cashiers and for office. Filed vendor paperwork."
good,Easy job. learn to work alone. learned a lot of responsibility. Typical day was stocking unloading trucks an setting up displays.
good,nice place to work for someone looking for many jobs at once. responsibilites were endless at times and very fast moving workplace.
good,Ingles was my first job. I really enjoyed the experience of working with others.
good,I have had a great time and experience learning all I have working for ingles. They have given me opportunities that I may of not had with another company. I feel with all my knowledge and success I have had that I can bring more of that to another company.
good,They work very well with your schedule while in college. Really nice managers and co-workers. Teaches you how to deal with the public and good customer service skills.
good,"i worked in the deli. we would go in, depending on where you worked you would make chicken, do dishes, make Asian food, slice deli meats, serve customers on the hot bar or keep the salad bar clean. i dont know how it is at other ingles stores but if you go to the one in west union SC. work on second shift. you dont want the drama on 1st shift."
good,I prefer working for an organized company that supports its employees.  There are no consequences for unprofessional behavior and employees run all over management.
good,"I love what i do, but when i needed help on anything regarding my job no one was found. Wish management would care more for their employers. Corporate ingles come in and down talk everyone as if they’re perfect. appreciation is key!"
good,Overall the job is good just not enough HR guidance in the roles of management does not adhere to company policy in regards to attendance and other hr functions
good,"There were good and bad days. It’s a pretty decent working environment . The pay is pretty good. If you like steadiness, then Ingles is a place for you to work. I’d recommend this job to anyone who is not lazy."
good,"Worked there pretty much straight out of high school, I learned how to do several warehouse jobs and had the privilege of meeting and working with some great people."
good,"I enjoyed working at Ingles most of the time, but it was not without its share of problems. There are many departments for an associate to work in; I started out as a cashier and moved to the bakery after a year. There are many cashiers, so the scheduling is handled electronically with what seems to be little intervention from management. This can be frustrating at times, but as long as the associate keeps up with his or her part, they will be fine. Also, the head managers are not unapproachable and tend to be fairly understanding whenever there is a scheduling conflict."
good,"Working at Ingles definitely had it's days. When a new store management came in alot improved, but department manager need more training in how to be a team player as well as a leader."
good,It’s more for highschool students who need a job. Co workers are friendly but you barley get help from baggers. It’s a fairly easy job so nothing too complex.
good,"Buena experiencia por el área que desempeñé, fue de mi agrado ya que podía intervenir para ayudar a personas que lo necesitaban, aprendí nuevas formas de rol de guardias, la parte difícil es el trato con la parte sindical pero siempre salimos adelante para bien, me gusto mucho las diversas actividades en un área nueva para mi ya que nunca había trabajado en hospitales."
good,"I worked at an Ingles part time up front on cashier, in the produce department, and in the bakery department. This was a really easy-going place to work and they were flexible when it came to time needed off. There is room for moving up into departments and getting a small raise. Ultimately, everyone was so nice to work with- there are the lazy people - but that doesn't mean you can't do a great job and be noticed for it. I will always vouch for Ingles being a great college/school job!"
good,As fun as scanning groceries can be. Work days can be long and hard or fast and fun. You have to always work and clean. Most bosses are great! You just have to focus on the goal.
good,The store I worked at has communication issues.  They struggle with keeping employees because they tend to mislead you.  They do not stand by their word.
good,"A typical work day was not all that bad. It is repetitive work, which makes it easy to get in a routine at work. From my experience, however, management would not get along with our crew leader/manager. This caused some unneeded tension between everyone to either work less so ""quota"" hours are maintained, or complain all night about someone/something. Based solely on their characters, the crew leader and management are great people and never made the work environment unbearable. I do not know what causes or has caused such tension to exist."
good,My overall experience working at Ingles was enjoyable. The employees were fun to work with and the work wasn't that difficult to do.  The hours were flexible and the pay was decent. The management was easy to work for and I liked the people. I was not overly fond of working at night but wasn't too bothered by it.
good,"I loved working for ingles, it was just a temporary job for me until I moved onto bigger things. I loved working with my friends, and the management was great."
good,"It was a pretty good job at the time, it didn't offer much advancement within the company but it was a good part time job. And the weekly pay was nice."
good,Worked here for my first job. It was okay. They were very understanding about young people in school and young people having a social life. It wasn't too stressful.
good,A regular grocery store. mostly older people shopped here as we were a store more dedicated to helping each customer with everything they could need or ask for
good,"The managers were sorta frustrating because they changed your hours due to job performance, so I couldn't balance my life correctly due to scheduling."
good,They make you scared for your job all the time. They nick pick everything you do instead of say thanks or good job. I mean I'm not looking to have my butt kissed but a thank u or somthing every now and then would be great. Management lets there job go to there head they think there better then everyone else.
good,A typical day at work includes insuring all produce is fresh. I learn how to communicate with customers daily. Hardest part is the heavy lifting daily.
good,"I felt like the corporate cared more about them saving money than the customers. If a customer forgot their card, you couldn't scan a card unless they ask another customer. Mangement was nice thiugh"
good,Ingles is a great work environment. They are understanding and very flexible with hours which is great because I'm still in high school. It's just great that hey are so understanding.
good,"Ingles provides an adequite work experience, providing decent wages, 401K, and healthcare for those applicable, with the means to move up in serveral areas. The ablility to work around other schedules is exemplary in areas where such a thing is important like for students or people with other jobs/responsibilities."
good,I worked with some of the best people ive ever met they're hard working strive to get everything done before closing and chat with their customers. the customers came in and just knew exactly what they wanted and management was so friendly and helpful
good,"A typical day at work was standing in one place (behind the register) for several hours, occasionally strolling out to the end of the check-out aisle during slow periods when no customers are waiting in line. I learned that as long as I had an energy drink near me to sip on and I talked and joked a bit with the customers, I could get through the day just fine. The store manager is rude and doesn't care about what you have to say and gets annoyed if you try to speak with him. The hardest part of the job is not knowing what next weeks schedule is until the night before. The best part about the job is meeting all kinds of new people."
good,I enjoyed working for this company because of the fellow employees and customers. Knowing most of the people that walking into the grocery store was a nice touch with the job.
good,The job is simple and your environment completely depends on the people you work with and for. Ingles is just like most grocery stores excluding the fact that it's always clean and the cashiers are nice to every customer that they encounter.
good,"-a typical day includes bursts of cashiering activity, interspersed with long waits of nothing to do at the cash register, or else fetching shopping carts from the parking lot"
good,"Good Place to work, Your learn great customer service and how to multitask."
good,"New schedules every week, depending on store location the management and customers are friendly and easy going, pretty aid back rules, great place for first time job, no piercings are allowed, overall it's alright."
good,"I worked third shift so I would clock in at 10pm and clock out at around 6:30-7am. A typical night would consist of pulling pallets from either trucks or the stock room, depending on which night of the week it was, and stocking those items on the shelves in a neat but fast paced fashion. One group would start on one end of the store and another group would start on the other side and we would work our way to the middle. I liked my co-workers. I wasn't too fond of the management. They were know to have been rude to customers, attempt to start fights with other co-workers, etc. The hardest part of the job was working short-handed. The most enjoyable part had to be listening to music while working, the music helped keep me going through it all."
good,"I have worked here for 6 years now and have liked it most of the time."
good,"Ingles wasn't horrible but I wanted something better at the time, the management was fine, they were up to date with the store, spoke to all their employees. My co-workers were very nice helped me when needed but at times would get lazy and not even put effort in while they were at work some would go to sleep in the break room while others roamed outside for 30 minutes. The hardest part was the amount of customer I may have in my line but it was also enjoyable because I love a challenge so I learned a lot about customer service while working there."
good,"A typical day at work includes assisting customers, counting down drawers, filling shelves, rotating stock, managing several stockers, and minimizing potential thefts. I've learned to think on my feet, utilize the computer equipment and programming available to make necessary price changes, and work with difficult customers to ensure their issues are handled quickly and that their experience with shopping at Ingles was a good one. Co-workers were pleasant. The hardest part of the job was the physical labor involved at times, like pulling pallets of milk or ice. The enjoyable part was everything else. I truly had fun at this position."
good,"I come into work , clock in, notify manager get a til and get right to work providing quality customer service to our customers. management is cool. the hardest part of my job is bringing shopping carts inside while raining ."
good,"It was a fine stater job. I had few requirements, the management was fine, the customers were fine. The only problem was when there was store renovations."
good,"The whole store is understaffed, so duties are frequently pushed onto other associates. Highly stressful because of this. Little encouragement is given.  Production is often behind and instructions are not always given.  Not to mention management does very little about problems brought up to them.  Regardless, most of the other employees are helpful and good people."
good,"A typical day started at 5am."
good,"Needs a little bit of better management, maybe better employees but for the most parts it’s decent. I’d recommend as a first job or one just to get you a little bit of money coming in."
good,The job was very consistent and busy at all times. The work day went by pretty fast. My coworkers were very upbeat and we made sure every customer left satisfied. Management wasn't the best and they didn't respect their workers often.
good,"I considered my time working here as a stepping stone alongside college from simply going to school to working in life. The hardest part of the job is not everyone working as a team, where I felt I did my share and beyond."
good,"Daily tasks included taking out the trash, cleaning the bathrooms, stocking the water, milk, and egg, sweeping and mopping. The culture there was good, everyone was nice to one another but the lack of pay and hours has left a sour taste in my mouth."
good,it was and ok place to start off with for a first job to have managers was not good sometimes they picked on you and if u were sick they didn't care at all.
good,Working in the deli requires a self-starter with initiative. It is fast paced. An employee will succeed in the Ingles' deli if they maintain a positive attitude and come in ready to work.
good,"I really enjoy working at my location. The hours are flexible and work really well with also going to school part-time. For the most part, its a very encouraging and collaborative environment. My only complaint is some of the people I work with do not take the job seriously, and when they slack off, it makes it harder on the rest of us. Management only sometimes takes notice of this. They tend to be more on the overly understanding side. This position is very much like other customer service oriented jobs. "
good,The overall work was simple and involves working and communicating with customers everyday. Other employees and management were easy to work with and get along with.
good,Assist customers also help other employees. flexible hours and they are pretty good to work with you. Not very fast paced. not many chances to advance.
good,I enjoyed working for this company for a 11 and 1/2 years. The associates were my driving force. Every Year it seams that there is a further separation between employees and management and that business is becoming more important than people. I was let go after my time here with little cause and no discussion. This showed me the separation that has been growing for some time between employees and management.
good,"I was a cashier so my job was pretty simple, but it wasnt meant for me. I like to move around and be productive and the cashier role was the exact opposite until someone came to your line. And then again the work spaced was still too limited cor comfort."
good,You are able to learn a lot from this company if you work for the right individual. Pay is not as competitive as other corporations. If you allow yourself to be taken advantage of you will.
good,I open at 6 AM and prepare coffee for the day. I take orders and prepare the customers drink(s). Ingles is a family oriented place to work and big on customer service.
good,My wife loves to shop at Ingles but as far as working there I only recommend part time. Management was awful at the time I was working there..........
good,"Rush hour usually began between 12-4, then it would slow down. There was a lot of favoritism among the managers and certain employees. The hardest part was unloading the truck, if you did not have a partner.The most enjoyable was bagging and helping the customers to their cars."
good,"The typical work day at Ingles was very slow paced and required pretty minimal intensity. All of my employees were either high school aged or seniors, giving it a pretty diverse workplace environment. The hardest part of the job were the slow times in the day, and the best parts were interacting with customers."
good,"Ingles is a dependable place to work with full time benefits such as vacation pay, sick pay, 401K and insurance. My main complaint is the department manager has employees in the department that he gives special treatment to and favors to and the others are treated poorly. When these problems are taken to the store manager and cooperate nothing is done and the complaints aren't kept quite so retaliations occur."
good,Great place to work something you want to do the rest of your live.you can make a career out of it.you just have to work hard to prove yourself.you will be rewarded.
good,"Hours change weekly, depending on your computer generated schedule. This can make it very difficult to plan things in the future. Management can play favorites, and it is very noticeable. Hard work is always recognized though, and fulltime/management positions are almost always filled from within."
good,"I worked here for 5 years getting jerked around about being in management. I was in school and was not available all the time, but when came available was told I was next in line, I was not. Payed my bills."
good,"This was my first job ever at 16, was a not bad place to work at. Manager was amazing and was able to move up. Didn't like the way raises were done, .25 a year, no matter how good a worker you are."
good,"I was hired as a bagger while i was still in college at $7.50 an hour. It is a very easy job and the people are nice to work with. Dealing with the public one can expect to encounter difficulties from time to time. However, the it is a great first job and resume builder."
good,"I've worked at Ingles for 2 1/2 years it is a great ""starter"" job and ok for advancement if you are willing to relocate. Advancement is more about who you know rather than what you know."
good,"A typical work day consist of talking with customers, cleaning my work area, organizing shelf's, directing customers to things they need."
good,"I had an ok,experience,and the job is easy. It's very easy to attached to the residents,and then they pass away.  The atmosphere was ok as well. The pay is dissent ,but I didn't like working overnight hours. There is also no way of advancing,and they would rather hire from outside of thecompany then to promote from within.I haven't really seen any African-Americans promoted at all , they work pretty hard ,and do a wonderful job. The raises are 15 cents every six months which is tax on purchases in some states. The raises are a joke. I liked a handful of employees. Also once you put in your two weeks notice they never hire you back,nor can you come bck to visit."
good,"I sort of enjoyed working here, because the customers and my fellow employees were great.  The managers...some were very ""by the book"" and others used logic to determine what rules they enforced. The hardest part of the job was bringing in the carts in all weather; the worse the weather the more likely the asst. director was to send me out.  The next hardest part was the SLOW nature of the job.  There were very few customers in the mornings and very few in the evenings, with nothing to do but stand at your register and look cheerful.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers, they for the most part were fun to talk to."
good,"I had a good run with them and no animosity is still there, I was offered the same job back a few months ago. I was quite bitter for a while as I cut 11 inches of my hair to get the job as males can not have hair past shoulder length so I just went short for a 3 month job. I wouldn't have taken the job knowing it wasn't permanent. It was just a basic stocking, back stock, rotate kind of deal. Not much to it, but it was 3rd shift and closed store so we had fun too. "
good,"I learned that no matter how difficult the day or how busy, always to keep a smile on your face, have a good attitude, and be the best no matter what type of job you do. My co-workers were a positive influence in my life. The toughest part of the job might have been answering question from customers, while running the register, especially during the holidays. The most enjoyable par of the day was being around different people, especially customers, learning where they are from, and working in a diverse environment."
good,"Its a grocery store which is in good business. You save a lot; there some good people and bad people but, that's how the world is. I liked it and didn't like it"
good,Prepare Daily menu for the day. Daily scheduling for the department.
good,"Cons:"
good,I worked in the deli and we were short-staffed a lot in my 4 months. I also learned how to do just about every task in the kitchen in that short time. I was stressful 24/7.
good,"I have enjoyed working here, it is not the easiest job, but it is definitely not the hardest either. I have appreciated their willingness to work with my difficult schedule."
good,Ingles was a decent place of work but the people on the area make working unbearable because they treat work unprofessional like its a high school all over again.
good,Ingles was my very first job. I loved the work environment I also loved how hands on the management was with the company. the only issue is the pay wasn't that great
good,I have worked with ingles for five years in various departments . Is a joy to work with the public. Has decent benefits . Pay isn't very good ! Is flexible if it needs to be .
good,"Ingles Pharmacy was a relaxed place to work three to four years ago.  Since that time,  the workload to allotted hour ratio has increased, tasks have begun being timed, required time on the job has been increased with no additional pay, micromanagement has intensified, and management as a whole has declined.  Needless to say, a relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere has become more stressful and gradually is becoming what I thought I'd left behind."
good,"I worked at Ingles for a little under 5 years, for most of that time I was in a management position. The pay was good, and I never had to worry about being able to pay bills, but the environment itself was unnecessarily stressful. Upper management is ok, but they are usually very busy, leaving lower management and employees to figure things out on their own a lot of the time. The work itself wasn't bad, but at the store I worked at, it seemed as if we were always very short-handed. There were times we kept entire departments open all day with only a single employee to tend to them."
good,"I started at Ingles with no experience as full time, which is difficult to come by starting out at most places. As soon as I was hired, the company raised the starting rate of my position by $1, because I missed out on it, they gave me a .50 cent raise. Ingles is a decent company to work for, but they don't give bonuses out, the Store Manager, the two Assistant Store Managers, and the Grocery Manager splits the bonuses among themselves. Even Walmart gives out their bonuses."
good,Ingles provided a calm environment to work in. Had advancements to move up in your career. Easy to become a manager. Hours were flexible. It was a good job if you were part time.
good,Great place to serve and meet people. If you love working with public this is it. Work is steady and friendly.
good,"A typical day at work included ringing up customers groceries and bagging them. I would also go outside and collect buggies. Sometimes,  was asked to clean up messes."
good,"Clock in"
good,"I was a cashier and also a bagger on days that were really needed, I believe being a cashier and or bagger is a great first job if you are first starting out. The management is great and always work with you on days you my need to take off or if you need to switch shifts. The workplace environment is really what you make it, if you come in with a positive attitude and uplifting spirits then it would be a good day. I think the hardest part of the job was working with someone who didn't have a good work ethic and always wasted time or ended up making the people that they were working with do everything. I think the most enjoyable part of the job was how close you could get with all the other employees and staff and how everyone was like a big family on the good and bad days."
good,"Greeting customers in a fashion manner, cleaning up around my area, stocking while having nothing to do, taking items back that customers do not want, sometimes helping deli at night when they are leaving."
good,"For a first job, Ingles is a great choice due to the large amount of people you get to interact with. It's great for people starting out to learn a foundation of what ""Customer Service"" really means. Plenty of room to move up for those willing to stay and put the work in."
good,Started out in an older store . I transferd to another store when the orginal store i was closed and rebuilt. The fello employees most of the time are helpful. Requires alot of team work. I worked in the deli the past 5 yrs. Since my transferr to a differant store i have learned how to make sushi. And gelato. I also make pizza amd have leraned to cook asian foods as well. On the average day fun is had task are complete. When all is said and done we wish all a good night.
good,"when a customer has a problem with something, or a problem with the store or another employee, and they have no filter. keeping it professional of course, always take care of what they need. at the end, make sure they leave with a smile."
good,"It was a Fun Place to Work , I Did Learn alot Not My First Time being in a bakery I did have some disagreeing with Manager Will Explain My Co workers was good friends and hardest part was doing Frozen trucks Myself with no help most of the time and the Most enjoyable part of the job was Making Memories and Friends and The Customers that came in there !!"
good,"A typical day was Tuesdays when we hard to unload delivery trucks, learned new things, management and co-workers were amazing. The hardest part of the job was climbing up the ladders to stock goods in the warehouse."
good,It was a new learning experience for me to try something different. I enjoy it but it was difficult.The work was very demanding and physical.The hardest part was find were everything went. After a month i pick up on things i didn't know to make my job easier.
good,it always business at Ingles. You sometime get were it really slow but then you have to clean and make sure you look business. the managers are great and are willing to help
good,"Very slow paced , friendly clean, one on one with the customers ,paid vacations, stock options ,401k . Overall not a bad place to work.  Flexible shifts ."
good,A typical day at work is relaxed. As a cashier you stand still too long and your feet are dead by the end of your shift. The pay is decent for a high school student (8-9 an hour)
good,"A typical day at work for me is fun, smooth sailing, i would like for management an co- workers to take the jobs as serious as i do. i will do what it takes to get the job done."
good,"A typical day at Ingles is nothing to stressful. You always have someone by your side helping you with anything and everything. I have learned alot at Ingles and how they do things and the kind of stuff they cook and make. The management to beyond great, you couldnt ask for anyone better to run that store. The co workers will do anything for you and they dont question one thing. The hardest part of the job would be co workers leaving to go to another job thats really hard losing a good friend. The best thing about the job is learning new things and everyone that works there."
good,"There wasn't much to learn. The staff is all friendly and like a family. Pay sucks, advancement is tough."
good,"very productive fun meeting different people ,fun working with co-workers.learned lots about retail ,manager was nice but could use some people skills. lifting ,needs to have updated equipment to make job easier on the body.talking with different customers"
good,"Great place to work and you get 41k and great benefits and healthcare, Medicade and nice people work there and no one is mean to you and your always doing some kind of work and no matter what it is.What is your work position and there is always more work to do."
good,Having good management to work under is the most important. Having positive and reliable coworkers is the next more important part of an enjoyable part of a job
good,"A typical day at work is generally good. However, everyone has their bad days and encounters in the job. I learned a lot about retail such as managing transactions. Management there however was not up to par. They will not work with you on work scheduling and have favorites chosen by whom they know personally. They are diverse, but most of the workers are family and family friends. New-comers are not as welcomed. The hardest part of the job was remembering codes for produce, but the easiest part had to be counting money in the drawer and back to customers as well as customer service."
good,Did not plan to leave. At that time I had many problems with my mom an dad. They were good to me. I was not interested in management but they paid me very will 16.50 hr.
good,Was taken into the back by my supervisor and her assistant and told that I was nothing and nobody. And that they did not need me or want me there and that if they had their way about it they would fire me. I resigned two days later after returning to work. The deli and it's staff are very unsanitary and don't follow safety guidelines. Ingles in general is a great company but the pay is sad as well as lack of hours.
good,It's OK I learned quickly and really loved and enjoyed my job their made great friends with my coworkers they were friendly and helpful and trained me well and my supervisor was a great guy became friends with him and his wife we hung out went to church together and it was fun and great they treated me like family their only person I didn't get along with was my manager since day one she was moody and very aggressive and rude to me then I got sick and was out of work a few days went to the doctors got on medication and sick note for work and my manager approached me and said she won't be needing my sick note that I was fired... I asked why and begged her to let me stay I loved the job and she said sorry it's not up to me the headquarters said to fire you again I asked why she said cause I posted on facebook I hated the job and threatened to quit and all this other garbage and she also accused me and my family of stealing from the store and vandalism. I have never stole from them or any company I worked for or anything and I never vandalized their or any other place. No charges were brought but I was threatened by the owner not to come back to any Ingles Markets in the US I was banned from all locations no charges were brought he said he wouldn't press as long as I never trespass on their property ever again I tried to work it out with him told him to view the cameras but he refused so I just agreed and left it alone.. But other then that great company.
good,Great place to work at first. I was there 20 years. So a lot of changes over the years an not for the better. I did get great experience in a lot of things while I was there tho. An met a lot of great people.
good,"This job at Ingles was of course the ideal job for any teenager in high school. A typical day at work is pretty moderately paced and it gives you experience with working with people from all walks of life. However, the hardest part about this is not necessarily the job, it's the management, and the amount of hours they allow you to have each week. I enjoyed all my co-workers and the people I was able to make a connection with."
good,A typical month at Ingles for me would be I would be somewhere different every other day from being a cashier to store clerk to bakery assistant and custodian. It was a nice place to work made several friends but pay was lacking and no benefits.
good,"The work was easy enough. It was the click that made working there hard.  Promotions in this environment (while I worked there) were offered to certain people from the click.  The managers are rude to you if you ask a question pertaining to the promotions and or schedule.  They WILL NOT work with mothers who have no late afternoon or night sitters.  The relatives who work under there relative managers get all the choice hours.  "
good,"Working with customers were enjoyable. they did not hold to original agreement of days off . manger with hard to work with, kept insisting on me doing other peoples jobs."
good,"Serving food from hot bar, sub bar, preparing food, cutting cheeses and meats for customers and helping customers with purchases."
good,"Good luck getting full-time and benefits though. And DON'T work in the deli. They are so understaffed right now and you will end up either working yourself to death for the low pay and doing double the workload, or end up walking out, just like everyone else has recently."
good,"TOO much for ONE person and such little pay . and, you even train new ones that makes more than you..who does that."
good,"Often times your work is overlooked or unappreciated. It's a nice starter job, but doesn't seem like a lasting career unless you're in a higher position full time."
good,Management communication was almost non-existent. Not a well balanced job if you want to have some. Staff goofed off too much and never maintained a steady experienced crew.
good,the work place is like for high school and rising college students nothing long term rude employees and some managers no benefits
good,"I worked at the bakery and would typically always close by myself, so I had to be taught to get out the materials for the following morning. The woman who trained me often reported me to the head managers as “not doing my job,” that she taught me to do. Very often, the bakery manager would yell and complain at me so viciously and demand that I do things that others did not. After being told I was not doing my job, I put in my 2 weeks and politely finished my job"
good,A very relaxed place to work but it did come with un-needed drama. Worked out for me because I stayed to myself but it was an regular working experience to me.
good,"Some of the management is really helpful and others are not, they pay is was not good when I was there and they are very strict and expect a lot when they don’t pay anything."
good,a typical day started was fast paced to get everything that had need to be done. I learned more about food regulations and safety. the workplace was cut throat and tension was always high. The hardest part was getting things ready for the next day. The most enjoyable part was an internal sense that I knew I gave 100 %
good,"On your feet all day. Never work same schedule. For some, it’s perfect. In school, would be great. Hard work, espically night shift when you help close"
good,very laid back and stress free with the chance of meeting new people everyday. great co-workers and great team players.
good,"Ingles was a exciting place to work at, but some of the management was very unprofessional and the pay was not enough. Also the hours given per week was not enough, I only got 30 hours per week."
good,"I've learned a lot but, It's just a lot of drama there. The pay isn't equal. It was fun there. it just wasn't for me. maybe it's good for others just not me."
good,"bad managers, ok co- workers , small lounge area for workers, no benefits, not great pay and the customers are not the best, not hard labor just tiring"
good,I have learned to use more manners. I have also learned to have patience. Dealing with the customers sometimes it can really test your nerve but you just have to keep your composure.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my job, learning everything I could about operating the deli. The closing team worked well together. We went through 4 managers in my time there and the turnover rate was high.  Many times there were only 2 or 3 of us to do the closing."
good,It is an okay job but when it comes to your kids being sick they don't care  they don't care if ubarevsick or your kids are sick they think that u should be there anyways well I am sorry but my kids are mormore import
good,It is a great place for younger generation to start out and advance onwards. Promotions done within the company with fair pay rate for services you provide
good,I loved the job and wish things could get better at ingles. They don't give you enough hours to live on and the pay is not equal. People who started a day after me and had the same experience I did...got paid a dollar more than me. And come on...eight dollars is not enough to take care of a family!
good,"a typical day at ingles was standing behind the cash register and checking out customers. Working at ingles, i learned how to work a cash register and to have good customer service skills. The hardest part about working at ingles was mainly just how busy it would get and most of the time the baggers at the location i worked at were always outside so i would have to check out and bag the groceries at the same time and its a lot harder on a busy day, but i have to say i really did like the job at first it was a good starter job."
good,"Fun workplace, enjoyed heading the new guacamole program that was active only on Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  The produce manager was outstanding to work with as he encouraged ALL his crew by his own work ethic, which included humor."
good,"A typical work day, I would come in, count cashier tills and reconcile them. Answers calls, fax documents. Customers would come in and cash their checks. Three times a day, I would make bank deposits for the managers to deposit at the bank. I would manage the stores revenue throughout the day and reconcile it at close. Managers were always on the floor or in the back, so I learned how to manage things on my own. I learned how to multitask. Answering calls, while counting the tills and making sure the customers were happy who came up to the service desk. The hardest part of my job was the late hours on school nights. But I would not trade it for the world. Love to meet new people and have the customer interaction."
good,Ingles had great management and good hours for me but it was a job to take care of my small expenses while i was in school
good,it is a great job for a working college student. the work day can be hectic but fun. you are always on your feet and learning something new. management always works with you for your schedule
good,It was another place to work while in high school and to adjust around my athletic schedule.
good,"The things that ingles is lacking is be able to ensure that their employees are dining what they are supposed to do the way they are supposed to do it. Multiple peoples doing the same thing multiple ways can cause problems. Customers like things that they can depend on and trust. So if you have six people making Watergate salad 6 different ways, the customers never know what they are going to get."
good,Depends on where you work and what position. Some is good snd others bad definitly not anyone specific. But some things could be alot worse in my mind
good,be kind and always work the best as possible. You have to have a good work ethic. they’re really good and letting you off work and easy going all the way around.
good,There was a good opportunity but it wasnt able to take me further in life where I needed to be for my future. There was unnecessary drama throughout the entire work place. I enjoyed talking to customers.
good,Managers was not friendly and expected to stand around while ordering people to do things. A job is suppose to be teamwork not a democracy. I would not recommend working for this specific location.
good,it was very fast paced and confusing!. I was too busy to enjoy my time there as I thought that I should have but I enjoyed working with the people there and they were friendly.
good,"Ingles has some kinks it still needs worked out, but the manager was the best man I’ve ever met. Everyone has their days and their faults, but not that man!!!!"
good,At Ingles I thought I would always push carts and bag groceries. But I also was told to clean the bathrooms 2 or 3 times a day. When I had Dr. appointments they cut my hours.
good,"It can be a great place to work, but they expect a lot from  department managers that is not compensated. Never given enough man hours to get everything done to the standards set,  mentally stressful environment"
good,Its a good part time job if that's what your looking for. The managers are fair for the most part. Sometimes there was lack of communication. Just not the job I want to do unless I can do it full time.
good,"I was cashier, its not grand & most of the people at Ingles are older people, who were sometimes mean."
good,"This was an easy going job, wasn't hard on the body but could of been better with a more flexible schedule, they do availability on a computer but always ignore when i could or could not work so i always got stuck working a lot for being in high school. Other than that the job was fairly easy and good on the register."
good,"The quick turnover is related to the age group that is hired.  Management could take a higher responsibility over the control of the younger employees, but are frequently over shadowed by corporate people."
good,I like working at Ingles most of the time but some days the business is slow and I get bored. The uniforms are ugly and I get hot in them. I like seeing the customers smile and I feel like I'm doing good for the Ingles market by brightening others day making them want to come to Ingles more often.
good,"The individual dept manager's are horrible. Don't work in the bakery, (in the Brevard store) the manager in that dept is crazy. And that is putting it nicely. It's alright in most of the other depts"
good,"Flexible hours, managers willing to work with your schedule. Regular part time job, pay is not bad for what you do. Other departments pay more but also include more work."
good,This was my first job and I enjoyed the people I worked with and the management. Days were often quick and it was hard to get more hours due to the number of other employees.
good,"A typical workday starts at 3am and I begin baking then. I set up, proof, bake, and package all fresh bread and pastry items for the bakery. Management is subpar at best most of the time. My coworkers are pleasant and fun to work with. The hardest part of my job is to determine what people want to eat that day. The most enjoyable part is the baking and friends."
good,"Loved working for Starbucks, however. The clash of companies was more than unorganized. Ingles and Starbucks never agreed on anything. Management was great, but hated the schedule."
good,come in at 6 block your department go help dairy department on his truck till 1 till the frozen food truck comes in and then go work it and leave at 4 pretty much no time to rest. same work everyday nothing ever changes. Management doesn't want to do any work and make double to triple what I make and I don't believe that's right. I pretty much love all of my co-worker there pretty easy to get along with. I have learned a lot about my job hopefully it will transfer over to my next job. Im a really hard working person that gets no credit for what I do. I have to have a job to pay for my car so im blessed I can make some money. Ingles is the main reason why im going to college to better my self and make more money. I want to start my future out good for my family.
good,A typical day at work includes a large sized truck. Pallets come shrink wrapped off the back of the truck. We break the pallets down by spotting the freight on the floor near where the items are on the shelf. We then go to lunch and after re-stock the shelves. Members of management are hard to work with at times. My co-workers are the same as management hard to work with a lot of the times. Hardest part of the job is the physical strain you put on your body while down on the floor stocking the lower shelves. The most enjoyable part is a relaxed working environment.
good,"This company primarily hires high schoolers, first-time employment, and retired individuals. I was disappointed at the amount of product waste when it could have been donated to charitable organizations to feed the needy before the expiration date."
good,"If I hadn't gotten fired, I would be working there still. It's a good place to work, friendly atmosphere. Management is fair, and will work with you for the most part."
good,"A typical day normally includes handling customers at registers and making sure their change or cash is correct. Cashier’s are also the ones responsible for the cleaning and up keep it the places customers go in the store such as restrooms, aisles, and the front we take out the trash in the front and clean restrooms. Also we assist customers when needed"
good,"Less than a week being unexpectedly out of work due to downsizing, received a call for a job interview with Ingles markets.  This job is relatively repetitive, considering this a grocery store.  The management style at the store I was located at seemed very bi polar.  They seem like they're understanding, and caring, the next time you greet them friendly they bite your head off about something completely out of your control."
good,"* Depending on your position in the deli, sometimes you had little to do, and just helped others on their station, or you were busy enough that you never had to leave your section."
good,"The people in the at produce dept at in Ellijay are very nice, helpful and patient in helping learn the job.Nice to customers and hard working.Attentive to cleanliness and sanitary conditions.Happy to help customers."
good,Faced paced environment. Need to be ready as soon as you click in. Work with public and be respectful even when you have rude customers. Customers is always right.
good,I really enjoyed working at ingles. I was at ingles almost 6 years. They really worked with me when I was enrolled in college. They made sure that I had a job when I came home for school.
good,"The job is fine, most days. Sometimes there is a big truck to unload, sometimes there isnt. Working through the night is tiring but managable with good asleep."
good,I recommend this job for teenagers still in high school for after school job. It is good work experience for young adults. It's not to stressful so it's easy to work there and still go to school.
good,"Cook/prepare  food products to be ready for purchase by customers for breakfast, lunch dinner rushes in clean well maintained areas. Learned how to be productive and keep order of cleanliness as well as time management."
good,my typical day at work was frustrating customer service was awful customers were often upset about the customer service even though i tried to make it more pleasant.
good,i think this place is an okay place to work i mean it wasnt bad but it wasn't the best either. I don't mind putting on a facade for the public but over a while it gets tiring
good,"A typical day at work: It's always busy."
good,Ingles was a good job with great people to work with. I did everything from bagging to working in the deli. I was the first one to be able to make good gucamole.
good,"I loved my co-workers and my manger but the work i was asked to do for what i was getting payed was unfair. I was a normal deli clerk who not only did my job as production along with helping my co-workers, i was ask to put trucks up along with rotating our products. I was doing my mangers job on top of mine but for the same pay as my co-workers."
good,"I had the privilege of working with some of the nicest people a person could ask for. Great work environment there! The work would at times be extremely hectic according to influx of customers. Our managers would often help with the proper place of cusomers food purchases and expedite to their vehicle. "
good,My co-workers were nice and helped me if I needed it.When I first started there the bakery manager was easy to work with but as time went on she'd have days when she'd have bad days and take it out on us. She was good about giving me time off when I needed it though. She'd only give me 4 hours and day 2 to 3 days a week.
good,Learned a great deal about customer service and the DSD vendor system.
good,"A typical day at work, was the same boring process and some days were ok. I learned how to stock properly, bag groceries and janitorial skills. Hardest part of my job was dealing with certain customers."
good,"Its ok but the manager plays favorites. Its a pretty normal grocery store job. co-workers are fine. supervisors are helpful. "
good,A typical day is to greet the customers and assist them! I learned how to handle money and to be a great customer service worker! The managment was fast and there when you needed them. The co-workers were great also. There really wasnt a hard part.
good,I really enjoying baking learning new ways got along with every one .
good,"Fast paced job that involves being able to multitask proofing doughnuts, baking pastries, frying donuts, and glazing donuts at the same time. Very rewarding job and I was typically finished with my shift by the time the store opens for business."
good,"I enjoyed this job as my first job and most everyone there was very nice and I liked most of the management, but there at times would be poor schedule, and poor management"
good,Smiles make me feel joy and happiness therefore when I help someone smile it fulfills my day as well as theirs because I made them feel the same. I set a minimum of three goals a day for myself simply put a smile on a customer's face totwo of my goals.
good,I have been working there for nearly 2 years I am a deli employee I do the rotisserie chickens and production case mainly production is is all of the cold food in front of the deli.
good,Ingles is a good place to work with a good management team at most stores. The hours are not great for having a family and there is a level of competition between employees for advancement. Mostly it is a job that pays the bills.
good,"For the most part, it was a very relaxed job and the coworkers all got along and that made the hectic hours a lot easier trusting that whoever you were working with had your back and that the job would get done in a timely and appropriate manner."
good,There were a lot of workers trying to be the boss when they were just coworkers. There were people using the bathroom without washing their hands n taking off their aprons.
good,"Ingles has great workers, great co-workers. They are flexible with hours. Manager are very nice and ingles will treat you like family. It’s a great place to work."
good,"Ingles is a great place to start. It's pretty laid back and doesn't take as much of a toll on you as most other jobs do. Management is decent enough. The cashiers/baggers consist mostly of students and teenagers. The work gets a little more challenging when you move departments, but still nothing super crazy. The worst part of the job is the pay - but even then, as easy as the job is, it's fair pay. No benefits if you're a part time employee, mediocre benefits if you're full time. All in all not the worst and not the best."
good,"From clock in to clock out your go, go go which make time go faster. Product is always freesh.  There is room to grow if u wanna work in 2 different areas & that usually means killing yourself"
good,It is a good place to work. There is not much room to advance. Pay could be better. You work different days every week. The people are great and management is understanding.
good,"The biggest downside to the location I was at had to be the staffing. We never had enough people trained in enough positions to have much flexibility in our schedules. It could wind up causing people who are well trained to feel spread very thin and there often isnt enough time to get people properly trained. "
good,Management is very inconsistent on their treatment of employees and somewhat shows favoritism among employees!! Hours are very inconsistent and difficult to understand schedule at times
good,"Ingles is a good workplace. It is very organized, and they hire good workers. The pay is reasonable for a starting job. Don't get on your phone. It is fun though."
good,I enjoyed helping our customers. I really got to love our local repeat customers. They always put a big smile on my face. Working this job really showed me the ins and outs of retail grocery and how to give great customer service.
good,"There's not much room for advancement and pays minimum wage but the management is good with working around schedules, so the job did well for me as a freshman in college who need just enough money to pay bills and stay in school."
good,"In the beginning this was a fun environment that kept you motivated to reach for more. With the latest upper management changes it has become very stressful. No appreciation shown for efforts. It seems as if there's something added to the work role constantly with the pay now getting cut from year to year. "
good,"Not a bad job, just might not produce a position which would be desirable for long term if ful time is needed. Involves being able to talk to a vast amount of people everyday, you get to meet a lot of people. The standing all shift is one of the hardest parts, not all positions provide the 10minute breaks. Weekly pay is nice!"
good,"If you are still in school, this is a great place to work. They are very flexible with hours, and can work around your schedule. I would recommend for a freshman in high school."
good,"I enjoyed being able to assist customers everyday.Each day was a new adventure, because u were able to make subs, pizzasa, slices meats ,cheeses and kinds of stuff"
good,"On an average day its relaxing and not overwhelming. The environment is great for learning the basics of how to work with people, and how to handle everyday situations. Management is understanding and will work with schedules concerning children, other jobs, pay, etc. Everyone is nice and always willing to help if need be. The best part about being a cashier was to put a smile on someone's face. There was not a hard part about the job. Most people can catch on pretty quick."
good,"learned stocking , keeping inventory , truck unloading. "
good,"Ingles is a wonderful company to start your resume with. There are many different departments and positions available to advance through and with the proper attitude and skill you can go far fairly quick. Whether you’re looking for a place to get a start on your career or somewhere to work around your school schedule, Ingles management will do their best to find the right placement for you."
good,"Working with Ingles was my first job, and when I started it was a good place to work for. the people I worked with were friendly and they all seemed to like it there. Sometime when the time we moved to a new store everything kind of changed. The people were less sociable and it was more of a one-for-all and all-for-one kind of feeling working there. During a regular day of work I would clock in and either go to self-check, get a till from the office and go to my assigned register, or go into the office to book-keep. While working there I learned how to run a register, very efficiently, and I learned how to book-keep. the management of the store were all there to help you excel, yet sometimes they could be a forgetful and fake-caring. The hardest part of the job had to be proving yourself worthy of moving up in the company, you truly had to put yourself out there harder than anyone else had and sometimes it could be next to impossible to stand out. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely getting to work with a very diverse and good group of people."
good,"It is a good job for students in high school, just not for someone trying to raise enough money to go to college. Nice coworkers and Managers though. I would recommend."
good,"Ingles market is a typical place to work from the everyday work to the managerial staff it was a decent place to work, everyone was treated fairly and the pay was fair."
good,"Ingles works well with anyone who is in High school and/or going to college and is flexible with schedule. Typical day at work always depends on what day it is, but mostly Tuesday and the weekends are busiest. Management are good people but there can be a few rough times. Rules are very strict."
good,I started working at Ingles right before I started working in Castle car wash it was only a temporary job I only work there about 25 to 30 hours a week I was a cashier there I help with stocking and I hope unload the delivery truck shortly after working there I got offered a manager position at Castle car wash and put my two weeks in at Ingles
good,If you can’t handle customer service it isn’t the job for you and i can definitely tell you that .! It was very hard at the beginning but getting the hang of it ... It was that bad after the fact really nice job.!
good,I have worked for Ingles for almost 2 years now. It has been a great experience in retail. You become like a family with the other employees in every department. We joke around like a family does and we get our jobs done.
good,I worked at Ingles for less than six months. I loved my customers that I got to see everyday and I loved being able to have a lot of co-workers that helped you if you had a problem. It was my family away from home.
good,Working at ingles was a okay job if you had no responsibilities and just need extra cash. I enjoyed working there but I now have responsibilities and I need and want more in life than a part time cashier job
good,I enjoyed working for this company. It is a fast pace environment that keeps you constantly moving. The company seems to genuinely care about their people.
good,"Clocking in, putting apron on, and entering password in register to open my line for customers to come through when they are ready to check out. It was a very busy job but I really enjoyed doing it and being face to face with customers and communicating with them and helping them as much help as they needed"
good,When I worked at ingles the job was very demanding and I worked long hours. The managers helped as much as they could but sometimes it felt like too much to handle at one time.
good,I started at ingles when I as a sophomore in high school. Ingles is a fun entry level job with little to no skills required besides basic math skills. Ingles taught me to interact with customers and provided a basic knowledge of how to deal with different personalities.
good,"I enjoyed getting Boar's  Head certified. I had a good manager that worked with me.  I was with the company for five years."
good,Pretty good place. Clean able to work your way up. Most management very helpful.  Some not so.good and careless . But over all. Enjoyed working for this company
good,Great introduction back into the work world! I was a stay at home Mom until this job! Great place to start! I enjoyed the skills that I acquired while working there!
good,"the most enjoyable part of my job working in the bakery, was the look on the customers  faces when they picked up there order and they would smile, we had made someones day go a little better knowing they had got what they wanted and the person  they were  getting it was going to be happy"
good,"Supportive management, but at the same time not willing to hire new employees.  I loved working with my coworkers who made the job easier to handle.  As a senior employee I was asked to teach new employees and take on the more difficult tasks.  The job is very repetitive and requires an immense amount of work ethic in order to complete the job on time and with quality.  The job is also very physically demanding with almost no down time besides the given 30 minute break."
good,"It was a great job when I was in school, but when I could no longer go to school is when it got bad. They refused to give me the hours I needed to pay bills, even if it was working an extra 5 hours, it would've made a difference. Management sucks and there are no benefits. This job is definitely made for high school/college students, not for people trying to make a living. Even if it is a temp job."
good,Being a cashier is almost easy after you get the hang of it. It was a fun workplace and I have made life long friends. The company itself is an overall great place for a job.
good,"Never fun to start at retail, but it's a decent stepping stone towards getting a lot of customer service and experience for later jobs."
good,A typical day at work was very busy. I learned how to manage money of all kinds and how to solve problems. My co-workers were awesome! The hardest part was getting my duties done in a timely manner while dealing with a line of customers. The most enjoyable was making customers happy.
good," Prepared simple food items such as coffee, tea, ice cream and other deserts, using"
good,"I have been at Ingles for almost two years now, I have really enjoyed my experience that I have been offered at this job, however I feel like it is time to get a different job and learn new things. I have worked there through school and hey have always been pretty good about working with school, that most places wouldn't have been as well with the scheduling. I have learned a lot from this job, how to work with the public was a big one. Of course like any other job you're going to have those people that are just not pleased, but you have to just smile and be respectful. I have meet great people while working at ingles, it has been a great experience. Management could work on a lot of things, the structure and communication isn't the best between the mangers, and a lot of the mangers have attitudes toward the workers and customers, and I have personally experienced that people will not be back to ingles due to the disrespect of the mangers."
good,"The job in general was pretty easy and the environment was welcoming and enjoyable as were the people. A typical day at work was usually, running the cash register, greeting customers, and doing miscellaneous tasks here and there."
good,I didnt not like this at all well I didnt enjoy working in the deli. Management is horrible.
good,"There are some great people that all come together to make the store awesome. Very productive and know what it means by customer service. Management knows what their job consist off and what the goals are for the store. There are times that some people get lazy including management but the job still gets done no matter who does it. It is all about the people you hire. The most enjoyable part of the job is when while working with other people, able to laugh and have a good time while getting the job done. The hardest part of the job was getting the job done in time cause of the amount that needed to get done. The job always got done even if it took most of the day."
good,"Ingles was a good place to work at while the manager who hired me was a manager, after he retired the new manager and assistant manager let money go missing from registers; it was my time to quit when they turned their cheeks to wrongful terminations."
good,time goes by fast there is plenty of work to do to keep busy co-works are for the most part  get along with and help each other out some days it really hard to keep up with customer demand closing is the hardest part because there is just not enough staff to close most of the time management is good put over the last year they have had many changes in the management staff and its really hard on the over all store
good,This job is low paying and it is mainly for the younger kids. I liked the managers and got a considerable amount of hours.
good,"Was not very sanitary, and cashiers always had problems with customers."
good,I worked at my local Ingles back when I was in high school. They offered a solid amount of hours and good pay. Gave me enough money to put gas in the car and have a little extra to spend on myself.
good,It's a decent job to work at while being a full or part-time job. I recommend only working here if you are able to stand on your feet for long hours and can occasionally deal with ruse customers.
good,"Retail pharmacy isn’t what I’m looking for personally, but generally speaking, was a decent experience. The people were nice enough to help train me during my internship for school."
good,overall ingles is a very great job. the only bad part about the jobs is really just the schedule. the best part about the job is meeting people and them telling you about themselves while you bag their items.
good,Working at ingles was fun at times. I was good at first but they don't work with you school schedule or your church schedule either. The people there was good too and I got along with everyone.
good,Ingles supermarket wasn’t a bad place to work this one store was just over ran with family so they would cut your hours for a family member or friend other than that good job
good,"This was my first job and it gave me a good picture of what it means to join the workforce. I enjoyed working there, my supervisors were great and helped if any issues came up."
good,Fairly easy place to work even though some days got hectic. Managers never seemed to be around though and it made it difficult to talk to them. I was never even notified that I was let go.
good,Nothing really special about it. Just do what you need to do and help customers when needed. Don't goof around. Make sure to please management as well.
good,Would like to work for HomeDepot instead of a food market. Would like a change in employment where i can maybe able to advance have gone as far as possible with Ingles in North Carolina.
good,"My job there was great, am just looking at going to the next level in my life. This will include me getting a new place to live and becoming more of an adult."
good,"Each department has their pros and cons - a little too lax, but also easy-going and a lot of friendly and funny coworkers. Management could be better, workers could go to be more serious and have far better work ethics. The customers are mostly rather friendly and it makes the job simpler. It’s your basic job that still comes with a load of stress at given times."
good,"Ingles is a good company to work for. They provide great management, a fun but sophisticated work environment, will work with your hours and your needs."
good,It is a decent place to work especially if you are trying to get more work experience; but you don’t get any benefits unless you are fulltime and it’s hard to get fulltime.
good,Ingles markets Is a great place to work. Great benefits and management that always helps and listens to your problems. There are many ways to move up in pay scales and many different departments to choose from
good,"A typical day as Customer Service Manager at Ingles consisted of assisting 10-14 cash register associates, use the register in problem solving skills, conferring with customers on where items were located and solving any compaints, and scheduling each associate for the subsequent week(s)."
good,The work isn't usually too bad but I worked at a smaller store and we had less people and the same amount of work as big stores do. I like most of the people I've worked with. The store managers aren't too bad and the manager in my department has been really great.
good,working for this company was a great but different experience for me I never worked at a gas station before getting the chance to do so was an interesting time for me I learned new things as well as bringing in the job skills that I already have helping me improve in the work area that I was in. I enjoyed it and wouldn't mind working for them again
good,Co-workers very friendly. Some positions are very fast paced and you are standing and/or walking the entire shift. Heavy lifting if you have a position on the floor.
good,Although I enjoyed working at Ingles I missed out on quality time with my family due  to working a lot of nights and holidays.   I loved working with the public and getting to know my customers personally and helping to meet their needs! I got along great with my co-workers and grew to love each one of them!   It was a great opportunity that I am grateful for but I feel like I need to do what is best for me and for my family by moving on to something better!!
good,It was a great work experience met new people everyday very friendly staff and managers would highly recommend this job to others unfortunately it wasn’t for me my health at the time wasn’t good but it showed me there is more to life then just friends some call it family!!
good,"If there was a better store manager there I may consider going back. Giving employees more respect,  just don't talk to people any kinda way, employees has feelings as well."
good,"Training is very good and management is very supportive in that respect. However, they don't keep their word with regards to scheduling. The pay is not even close to the cost of living. Customers are great. Working with the kids is challenging."
good,laid back usually not too busy and most the staff is helpful the pay could be a little higher but considering the amount of work it isn't bad at all makes a good part time if you need so extra cash
good,"Friendly staff and customers, hands on training, learned how to handle money and work registers, along with gas station duties and a bit of customer service."
good,The company is great to work for if you are a young person looking for a part time position to make extra money while you are in school. They are usually pretty flexible with hours and time off.
good,"Ingles was very unfair, I liked the management as people but sometimes not as management because of what they let people get away with. It is a fast paced job and its hard near holidays but controllable."
good,I was part time and needed to be full time. My hours were staggered which made it hard for me because my children were small at the time. But overall I quite enjoyed working there.
good,"Nice clean place to work.i enjoyed interacting with customers.my supervisor was very nice.i was part time,and was treated fair.you get out of this job what you put into it."
good,decent job with weekly pay checks. the manager has a problem with allowing you to work two jobs. will not do anything about any complaints you make.....
good,"I would have stayed with Ingles, but I had to move from the area. Ingles is a good company.  I hadn't been a cook before this opportunity, so it was nice to learn something new."
good,I was a dairy stocker for almost a year.  Loved the people I met and the job.  Just found something that was more money and fit my interest.  Can't say anything bad about it.
good,Fue una etapa agradable donde aprendi muchas cosas.
good,The most important part of the job is to have excellent customer service and to always treat others with respect. I learned that you can go from have one customer every now and then to having a line of customers for a solid hour. It is very fast paced and you always have to stay on your toes.
good,It was not bad just to little of pay. I would have stayed I would have got paid better. that is the main thing that ingles lack in. I was a pretty quick pace but the pay is to little to want to stay when you pay bills
good,The hours were great for my needs. Loved interacting with the customers. The work isn't hard but you do stand on you feet for long periods of time. I loved it most when it was really busy and crazy!
good,"Very busy in the Deli. always something new going on. Never a dull moment. New customers along with regular ones. Learn something new every day. Remembering certain things was difficult at first,"
good,Helping customers find the items that they need. to bring a smile to their face while allowing them to feel welcome in our store so that they have a wonderful shopping experience.
good,It's a fun work environment. Very flexible with people's hours. Benefits are great. And there is always a place within the store to keep learning and moving up
good,"A typical day is a fairly fast paced working environment. There is always something to do when your shift begins. I have learned how to better myself working. in this service type of work. I am a manager only when the full time manager is not there. My shift may be to close the deli."
good,Great job for high school or college students. As well as other ages. Great environment where you make friends with the customers and they will wait in your line just cause you are their favorite. No complaints about job
good,"High School Job with High School kids and High School Managers, seemingly in my situation, but it varies per location, I've heard good things and bad things while experiencing both at Ingles Markets, my husband and I both met there and worked for years at one location yet never moved up, he moved on to another company (WalMart) and was promoted within Months.. If you're seeking a career, i simply do not recommend this job to you, but its an easy low-money job, I would stay if I didn't have a career to pursue and money to make."
good,make donuts and put them in boxes and put them out on the shelves and then i would prep for the next day by getting tha donuts out of the freezer i learned how to decorate and make alot. I enjoyed it because i went in at 5 a.m and got off at 12 p.m
good,Ingles was a laid back job except on holidays and snow days. Managers were easy to work with and listened to the workers. Hours were limited but was good for a first time job.
good,"I think the place is great to work at but you cannot grow, i want to grow at a job and have more benefits, i wanna be able to love my my job anf it’s kinda hard."
good,"I appreciate the opportunity that they gave me to work there. Have a lot of trouble reining in some employees. When they decide they don't want to work, they leave you holding the bag - literally!"
good,"Everyone at the company is friendly and helpful. I enjoy working with co-workers. Cons it is only part time employment no benefits, no paid vacation or sick time."
good,"Employees are mainly fresh out of highschool and looking to find experience in customer service or even just have their first job, and I believe that it is a nice smoothly paced place to start out."
good,"A typical day as a Florist for Ingles Markets started with watering the plants, and straightening up the merchandise. I would then check the stock of special arrangements in the cooler, and make more if necessary. Would restock cut stems on the floor from the reserved cut stems in the back room cooler. Assist customers with balloons, and plant questions, or special orders. "
good,"A good environment to work in, in the position I held I had no opportunity for advancement. I enjoyed my position and enjoyed working with the customers."
good,"meeting new customers and being able to make a connection with them. great communication skill , the managers communicate well. the dress code isn't really clear."
good,"In general this jobs strongest characteristic is flexibility, you can set your online availabliity and call days off a week before or way earlier, and they will make a schedule based around you. Other than that the salary isnt great and the advancements are slow, my tasks as a bagger were to get buggies do light chores and bag, i went above and beyond buffed metal scraped wax off of the entire stores tile walls and do regular cleaning constantly and i havent been notified od any sort of advancement. The atmosphere is fun, and the most of the staff are friendly, a GREAT place to work, just not a great job to make any money... atleast as a bagger."
good,"Ingles was my very first job, working strictly weekends. I enjoyed my co-workers. Most of them were teenagers so we all had like personalities. Most days didn't even seem like work."
good,Good place to work. Training process and safety procedures are very thorough. A constant work routine everyday. Employees willing to help out one another.
good,Flexible hours. Lays higher than average grocery stores. Would highly recommend night shift to motivated individuals who are willing to work & keep up a steady stocking pace.
good,"It's a job.  I bagged, worked the cash register, stocked, and worked the video department.  All were decent until you deal with rude customers or demanding managers."
good,Worked the overnight shift in college and it was pretty cool. It was in a small town so the pay wasn't amazing but it was convenient and the people were cool.
good,"I worked at Ingles throughout my high school years and the beginnings of college. While tiring at times, it was great at helping me refine my interpersonal skills."
good,"As a cashier, I ring up groceries and give back change. I bag groceries, do carry out service, and do chores. I work part time, so I usually work 4-5 hours on weekdays after school and usually 8-14 hour shifts on the weekends. I work 14 hour shifts when someone calls out. The management is great. Everything is under control, runs smoothly, problems are solved pretty quickly, the managers are reasonable and easy to work with. The workplace culture is great. Everyone gets along with one another and the customer service is emphasized from everyone. We try our best to satisfy the customer. The hardest part of the job at one point in my experience is probably  putting up with one of the difficult managers that thankfully transferred to a different store and dealing with rude customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is making sure everything runs smoothly, getting along with coworkers and managers, and being efficient in my job as a cashier."
good,I think that ingles markets was a great place to work at. The work was fast paced and detail oriented. although i think that the company  lacked in the management.
good,Great co workers. Very relaxed environment but can get stressful. Management is great and opportunity for advancement was good. I was a cashier and worked there for four months.
good,"Manegment isn't the best and they have an unfair pay, no benifits at all to anyone, they don't hire full time and no steady schedule always different every week"
good,"In the department I worked in, people quit or got fired on the regular. The store management team can be overbearing and scheduling could be a problem."
good,"Ingles is a good place to work.  Great co-workers and fair management. The pay is reasonable and the hours are great.  It is a very demanding job, it is a heavy workload."
good,"I didn't get good hours, employees are just as lazy as management, rude customers on a daily, the pay was good but you don't get many hours unless you're out of school and have an open availability. It was very boring and you don't get a break unless you're there for like 7 hours."
good,"Ingles Markets is good for somebody with a limited or complicated schedule, they allow you to specially ask for days off and call out for sick days. Overall Ingles is a very good company to work for."
good,Large grocery chain. About typical for this kind of work.A lot of difficult people to work with. Enjoyed interacting with the customers.
good,"They were able to work around my school schedule very well, and we're always glad to give me more hours when needed. Pretty good place to work if you want something temporary."
good,"Working at Ingles was a good experience.  I was always smiling and talkative when I had a customer, so I met a lot of people and learned a lot of things while working at ingles.  A typical day at work consisted of standing in one place, ringing groceries.  The hardest part of the job was probably cleaning the men's restroom and also dealing with customers who shop lift."
good,I have work for Ingles for 3 years now. I have worked with some people that i can count on to get work done. My boss is always nice and reasonable. i never had any problem with my co-workers.
good,Ingles is a typical supermarket. It is dominated by highschoolers and so that can sometimes bring the maturity level of the workplace down.
good,"Go in and organize our truck"
good,"Bakery Clerks work in the Bakery Department, preparing, baking, packaging, pricing, and merchandising cakes, pies, rolls, muffins, breads and other baked goods. They inform customers about our bakery products and services and often ask customers to try samples of bakery products as a way to increase sales. They work with equipment like ovens, proofers and frequently use store intercoms to announce promotions and weekly specials"
good,it was a cool job to work at ringing up orders and baggin groceries and helping people out to their car. i liked stocking in the back sometimes when they needed extra help and helping the ederely peoeple out to there cars
good,Good volume store with a great customer base.  Great place for advancement within company.  Excellent department training with supportive staff. Wonderful location
good,"Can be fun, but you have to put the work in when need be. Could be managed a little better and hiring more mature co-workers."
good,"Not a bad job, good people to work with, they are flexible and understanding when situations arise. pay is adequate. There are opportunities to move up though they are small and not always based on seniority or qualification."
good,I really liked working here decent pay and also enjoyed working with the customers and meeting new people everyday also management and fellow employees where nice to work with.
good,we're usually pretty crowded but theres a good vibe management is great! the co-workers are even more great! the hardest part of the job? there isn't one. the most enjoyable part is being able to interact  and converse with the customers!
good,Working for Ingles has taught me how to deliver excellent customer service at all times. Through Ingles I developed wonderful bonds and relationships with my customers and co-workers.
good,Great people and very friendly store. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping people. Management is very understanding.
good,"The experience at Ingles was very positive in light of the skills gained and relationships formed.  Being a large chain company, the benefits did not reflect their corporate structure."
good,"Very fun employer to work for. The employers have respect for employees, this makes the employees very happy and thrilled to provide efficient customer service to customers."
good,I typically start the day off looking over the inventory and opening up the Gas station. The position I have you are by yourself so it seems the job is for solitary people
good,"A day consists of cooking and setting up food for the day, making sure customers are happy, cleaning and making sure everything is on point. Helping supervisor with inventory and helping coworkers with other jobs."
good,I worked in the gas station and in the store it was just according to the day. learned how to deal with customers.
good,I liked it but I was just working to pay for new school clothes and so I could pay for my GED classes and get my car fixed. if I didn't need the money I would have quit after the first week I hated it but it was my first job so I couldn't complain
good,The company was very understanding and willing to hire people that were qualified. I learned a lot of new things. Like great customer service and how to handle and manage money. The hardest part of the job was working on the holidays. The whole environment was great to work in.
good,This is a wonderful place to work at. Since the very first day I walked in I knew I wanted to work for this company.
good,i like it. it's a good place to work for extra money in the pocket
good,"While working at Ingles, I have had a lot of experience with different things. I have been taught how to bake bread, trained to decorate cakes and shown how to fry donuts. The staff at Ingles is great. The hardest part of the job would have to be coming in at different hours due to the fact that I have not been allowed to have a set schedule. The most enjoyable part of my job would be the experiences."
good,"Working as a cashier in a small town really opened my eyes. I became much more of a people person, and everyone knew everyone! Can get stressful, but it is rewarding. You learn multiple people skills."
good,"I did this in high school and college for extra money. It was a job, and the management was great!~"
good,great job with great ppl to work for.  was very laid back. The most enjoyable part was getting to meet new ppl.
good,You can easily move up within the store over a period of time. Enjoyable place to work.
good,"Various day to day. Depending on time of week/month, and season."
good,"Typical day includes stocking, customer service, ordering, inventory. Have been in management for 2 years."
good,A typical day at work consisted of bagging groceries and retrieving carts.
good,I liked the work. I started as a bakery clerk. In two weeks I was in the manager training program. 
good,Great job just did not pay well. Management was good. Good people to work with.
good,"I like working with the customers day by day. I have met many interesting people (customers and co-workers). It is a totally different experience than working in the corporate world for the past many years. I enjoy dealing with the customers/public. Customer service is my highest priority regardless of what posistion I hold. My management has been flexible with my schedule which I really appreciate. The hardest part of the job has been that my manager has had to cut hours and there aren't enough people to fill all the positions. I try to stay to fill the spots, but need to watch my hours. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping people. I worked in IT and helping people was the main part of the job. I know working at a deli is not the same, but customer service is customer service. It's all about making the customer feel comfortable and want to come back."
good,Our management was a great staff to work with. They're very understand when you need a flexible schedule. I learn how to deal with customer encounters better and how to build relationships with people.
good,"on a typical day i bag customers groceries, offer to take them out to their car for them and then i bring in shopping carts. i also communicate with customers on a daily basis. my co-workers are all nice and cooperative. the hardest part of the job would be lifting heavy objects. the most enjoyable part would be the customer's satisfaction."
good,Productive and fast work place. Learned a lot while their. The co-workers and managment was good to work with.
good,Ability to learn the fundamentals of grocery operations and dealing with profit and loss
good,1.Good place to learn about American foods and American life style.
good,"Good company that was good to work for. They closed the store in Calhoun, GA or I would still be working there. Worked part time after school and weekends."
good,"Ingles market was my first job so i gained a lot of skills such as; customer service, product knowledge and multitasking and prioritization from them."
good,"Managment issues when you need something to be done, new people didn't stay or didn't show up. Holidays are required to work. Atmosphere is calm and collected"
good,"Co-workers are great to work with. Always doing something, always busy. Very productive place to work. Managers are nice, at least when I was there it has been a few years."
good,"It was a great job environment and i would work there again. The managers were amazing and it felt like a work family. There was not any benefits, but it was still a good first job."
good,It's a good job. The customers were great. I was there for years. There are some great people that work there. Can be fast paced and busy at times. I loved it there for a while.
good,"Ingles worked with me and had a flexible schedule, fast paced, multi tasking but I enjoyed it and would recommend it to a friend or family member !!!!!"
good,I really enjoyed working there. Good People. Benefits and pay can be lacking and upward mobility is somewhat limited. If you work hard you will be rewarded.
good,It was an alright job to do in high school. Got to help out and meet a lot of people. The managers and staff were pretty good people to work with. Great flexible hours.
good,"Ingles Markets was a great place to work. Although after being trained in a different department and was promised a pay increase, nothing ever became of it. While being hired on part time, I was actually able to get almost full time hours, in which I was very impressed."
good,"I work in the deli department. Very slow pace, but on holidays it get very busy and very fast pace. But I like working here. The most easy job i have so far."
good,"The biggest thing I learned working at ingles was to be a team. This made the job much more enjoyable, when everyone can get along and be productive. Also management was always so respectful and willing to teach when errors were made."
good,"As much as I wanted to continue working only three days a week, I had expenses I needed to cover. Thankfully, the job itself was decently enjoyable, as all I had to do was unload a pallet and place the goods onto the shelves. And because it was overnight, I didn't have to work around customers."
good,I worked at Ingles during high school. It was a great job that was easy to go to after school and have a little extra spending money. I enjoyed the customer service aspect & getting to meet new people.
good,Ingles is very good with working with a persons schedule. Hours aren’t that great but they are amazing at working with your schedule. It’s easy to balance work and life outside of work.
good,"I only worked at Ingles for about 7 months and I can say that my overall experience was pretty good. The hours were very good and they were super understanding of schedule changes and will give you your hours if you work well. Some of the managers seem like they slack off and will make you do a random job here and there, but the overall management team was good. I am able to work about 4 positions at Ingles because they will try to advance you in your career at their stores."
good,I would recommend Ingles for first time jobs or for someone who wants the ability to work their way up. Was able to reach as far as I can go in 2 yrs from Service Clerk to Customer Service Manager. Its not for everyone though.
good,"I worked for Ingles for almost four years while in college. I was able to move to different departments to experience what I enjoyed most. The management is flawed at times, but they are overall supportive people to work for."
good,Fun first job and easy way to make friends but also management was constantly changing and there was a lot of drama between departments. Got promoted after showing hard work but now they promote anyone.
good,"The Pharmacy department is essentially separate from the rest of the store.  There is a Pharmacist who is responsible for the techs working in the pharmacy, evaluating their performance, accuracy, attendance, keeping current on Ingles policies.  The training of new employees is somewhat difficult due to the fact that the department is not given any extra man-hours for training - you are expected to jump right into working and training at the same time which can be sometimes be very difficult depending on how busy the pharmacy is at given times.  The pharmacist stresses good customer service and extreme accuracy in filling prescriptions, which is definitely understandable.  The pharmacist is an excellent manager and tries to be accommodating when preparing the schedule.  There is no ""set schedule"" from week to week - you may work day time hours for a couple days, then switch to evening hours, then back to day time."
good,I worked at the Ingles in Toccoa and loved the hours that where given to me and my manager. Relocated to the Winder store and my hours where cut in half and the manager wasn't very nice. I left due to needing a full time job.
good,I was a bagger that helped stock certain items around the store. My managers had me doing various other things all over because they liked me a lot and I enjoyed having that freedom
good,"A typical day would consist of me arriving, clocking in, and setting up my register. I have learned that taking too many coupons can make the company pay the customer. Management was a little loose, but decent. Workplace culture was more for the younger crowd for employment and a variety for consumers.Hardest part of the job was nothing really. Most enjoyable was how everyone was so kind and helpful, not a lot of work place drama."
good,"Working at Ingles, was a great experience also a terrible experience. Some days, you are super busy and some not. Management was good and employees are great, the people there made the job so much better to deal with on any given day."
good,"After school ended for me, I would usually go to work at 4:00. Sometimes my shift would go by smoothly with no major problems, and other times the day would be so busy I wouldn't have a chance to take a bathroom break. During the stressful days, I learned to value the relationships I made there and the teamwork I developed with them. The store manager was very understanding and I enjoyed working with him and the CSM's. The hardest part of the job was my nerves starting to get to me, but it was never too much for me to handle. My favorite part of working in customer service was meeting so many different people and being able to talk with them about their days."
good,Working here is a decent first time job. It allows people to get the basics down such as customer service and working with money. As far as a long term job I would not recommend
good,There’s some drama but not a lot and there is very friendly people if you look past the drama. If you can’t handle drama then this is definitely not the place for you. There’s a good amount of people that work there that ignore drama and have a good time and also work. Then there’s a small part that include themselves in all the drama and try to hide out when it comes time to work.
good,I learned many skills at this career although it was a very relaxed first job. Other locations were stricter but the location I worked at was much more laid-back. I enjoyed my time here but I am ready to face new challenges.
good,"Started when I was 16 years old, I love the company overall. I moved up pretty fast.I am currently an assistant store manager at the age of 23. I was recognized for my dedication and skills I learned from previous managers."
good,Great place to work and a very relaxed and fun environment. The pay should be looked at though and also toe job titles I found myself often doing other positions jobs.
good,Ideally this job is for teenager and retirees they don't offer very many hours and there isn't much chance for advancement. A great 2nd job or job for someone looking to supplement their income.
good,Most of the people there are very nice. I have made many friends while working there but some of the managers are a different story. But I’ve worked there for about a year now and I love what I do.
good,Its a good job but its too too fast paced an i wasnt trained so inhave no clue what im doing half time an they tell me to go find stuff an i dont know where anything is at?
good,"Store manager is nice. Assistant store manager great. My manager (deli) can be great, but sometimes she does this thing where she ""doesn't recall"" having certain prior conversations..."
good,"Ingles markets was a good first job. Although there were some pros, they were inconsistent on hours and you didn’t get very many at all even if you have been there for a long time. It was a good working environment where the work was steady and most of the people were good workers. There were some employees who sometimes didn’t do their jobs or did them halfway and left someone else to do it. Management was really good and was probably one of my favourite parts of the experience."
good,It's a good place to work but has a tendency to attract drama amongst the cashier's especially it's a sociable balanced pace the hours bounce alot hard to have a life outside work that you don't have to rush and complete tasks
good,Good place to work at and a good boss man to work for. Willing  to work with you on stuff. Good people get along with. The summer time of year is our busy time of year. If you are not unloading trailer you will be cleaing.
good,"Fast paced business, in charge of day to day operations of store, management was very demanding, culture diverse, best part of job, meeting people, worst part long hours."
good,I started at ingles while I was enrolled in college. they were very flexible with my school schedule and also once I started working in my career.  I would absolutely refer this place to anyone.
good,fast but steady work in my department .enjoyed icing cakes and writing names on them.the hardest part was moving heavy products from shelves.I enjoyed interaction with people.
good,"Restocking shelves and managing my department. Learned a good bit about food placement, organization and time management. The employees were much older than me(I was 18). Not a difficult job, just constant work. I enjoyed the fast pace lifestyle."
good,Was good place to work they were good to me over the years.  Great vacation policy and very neat and clean place to work  very good place to learn skills of the trade
good,Good environment to work for a first job learn how to manage money a register. Learn to build good work ethics. Learn to work under good supervision with good people
good,"What I learned was how to basically run the store. from running cash register to stocking, loading and unloading trucks, housekeeping ( running floor machines). ordering stock and doing inventory audits. and managing my own stock crew."
good,A  faith based community that deals with seniors and neighborhood residents  does great  for their community.  Enjoyed working with staff.
good,Very nice place to work as far as grocery store's go. I was able to be promoted very quickly. A lot of young people who need a job for school will be working there. This can be good or bad depending on their attitude. It's fast pace and smiling all the time.
good,"Ingles will teach you many skills involving customer service. Also, the harder you work the more noticed you become. Even though the pay rises were alright the paycheck and hours never failed."
good,"Fair benefits, fair treatment of employees. A chance to learn about teamwork and learning new skills. Work in a.c. and heat. Learning about new food products and trends"
good,"Ingles is a good first job for people right out of highschool. Or someone that's wanting a part time job."
good,"This was a job I worked while attending my last year of High School. It is a great option if you would like to have some money coming in. Pay is a bit strict, and so is the schedule, but usually just requires hard work for the extra benefits."
good,"I enjoyed working at Ingles up to a point. Unfortunately, I often had to do more than 2 other peoples jobs, and what started out as kindness it was quickly taken advantage of and I was not allowed to leave until finished with other people's jobs. I handle stress rather well and stayed until I had to move and had no options to relocate."
good,Easy job with decent pace. Good if you are in school or retired and just want an easy job with low stress. Minimum wage job without much room for advancement unless you know the right people.
good,Ingles Markets is a very nice grocery store. I was a cashier and enjoyed working here most of the time. Ingles is very strict with their employees regarding mistakes and how you present yourself to customers. There is always a fear of the secret shopper.
good,I enjoyed working there for the most part.  Management would always tell me what a good job I was doing and that I would get customers through the line fast.
good,All in all it is a pretty good job.  The people I work with are friendly and helpful.  A real team oriented atmosphere. A typical day is fast paced .  The most enjoyable part of my day is interacting with the customers who in this area are very friendly.  Management  is always available for questions or problems.  The hardest part of my job is bending into the carts to retrieve the merchandise to ring for sale.  Lifting the 36-packs of water all day give me a backache by the end of the day.  I am over 50 so this may be because of my age although even the younger women have issues sometimes.
good,Some Managers at my store did not consider their employees. This person would tend to be very ugly to some of them. Also there is never an equal amount of cashiers to baggers. Most of the time there will be five cashiers and two baggers scheduled.
good,"Ingles is a good place to work, to get started in the job world. Its made a big difference in my life and I have throughly enjoyed it here for 3 years."
good,"The job was fun and easy, I really enjoyed working with the public. There wasnt much room for advancement unless you knew the manager. (under new management)"
good,"Working at Ingles was a good first job, but it is defiantly not a job that you would want to keep for a long time. It is difficult to advance in the company unless you are close to the management, and the pay is below what anyone over the age of 17 would need. Overall the staff is really enjoyable, but the job is not one to stick with for more than a couple years."
good,The work was easier due to slower business. Most co-workers are friendly and easy to get along with. Management needs a little work but overall still good. Pay and benefits were a little lacking.
good,"Great people work here, the most friendly people that I have come to know in years. This is an easy atmosphere with the only people coming in are regulars who are loyal to the brand. The most enjoyable part of the job is your co-workers both up front and in the back."
good,its okay but its only part-time and its very hard to get full time and if you work in the deli you run the risk of getting sick with raw chicken possibly if you work that area.
good,I enjoyed my time at Ingles but assignments often ended and then I would be re-hired. It was not easy to gain a full time position. Pay was fair but shift changes occurred frequently
good,"This is a great place to start out at, especially for students. There doesn't seem to be a great chance for advancement. It is a great opportunity to get customer service experience and learn to communicate with the public."
good,A typical day I would run the register for 6 hours while also stepping away to help mangers when needed. I learned management and leadership from this company. I worked well with each of my coworkers and trained 4 cashiers while working here. Coworkers come to me with questions and I help them to the best of my ability. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with people that I love. They are all very friendly to work with.
good,"Working for them in the beginning was a great...I couldn't have had a better boss....until the end of my tenure there, then I realized how fair he was."
good,Worked there on 3 separate occasions all in which I left on good terms so was eligible for rehire all 3 times.  The place was my first job as a teenager and lasted throughout until my early 20's.  Was a great part time job although worked full time hours there were no benefits.  Fun place to start out in the workforce and would recommend to any teenager wanting to get a taste of the working environment and working with customers on a day to day basis.
good,This job was definitely a learning experience. This was my first job when I was in high school. So it prepared me for a lot. I wasn't sure how I was going to do at this job because it was my very first job. However i did maintain a coll level head at all time. I enjoyed working here tremendously
good,"I learned how to manage my time in a job situation, how to deal with the public, calmly deal with a long line of people, how to serve gelato, how to work a grocery store register. My manager and co-workers are supportive and nice."
good,I did enjoy my time working for Ingles but I transferred schools and couldn't continue to drive back home to work.  Overall it was a good experience and one I am thankful for.
good,"My first job I served as a cashier. I love working as a cashier, i love math and working with money. My co-workers was great, alot of them was older than me and they helped me out with anything i needed it. I had alot of responsibilities at Ingles, i really learned the true definition of hard work."
good,I have been with the company for almost six years and even though I love my job I would love to get more hours. Also working in customer service jobs has helped me with my confidence and shyness. I love all of the people I work with we are like a family!!! The hardest part of my job is not having enough help when needed due to the customer employee ratio. The most enjoyable part is getting to know all of my customers on a somewhat personal level enough to know their wants and needs every time they come in the store.
good,"Worked a lot of hours while still in school, but easy to juggle a life while still in school with flexible hours. I enjoyed my job and the many friends I made."
good,I loved working for ingles. The management was poor and they do not appreciate there employees. Overall a great company to work for. I learned how to work with all kinds of different personalities. I also learned that working with people and fast pace environment is what I love to do. The hardest part of my job was learning how to deal with the poor management.
good,Working at Ingles is great.The managment it good they are easy to talk to
good,"-It was a good environment surrounded with good people."
good,"muy buen instituto de trabajo para aprender idiomas, hace que sea mas fácil el aprender ingles y se trabaja en equipo"
good,I preformed all duties as a cashier. That involved dealing with money and working the register. I handled exchanges for customers and solved problems when the manager was busy
good,"Friendly enviroment, enjoyable co-workers, groceries and merchandise at afforable prices."
good,"Very good place to work, co workers very friendly, management was very organized. Job security was very good and advancement in careers were always very good."
good,Great learning experience. Friendly enviroment. Costumer oriented. Amazing costumer service.
good,I miss some of the of the people and coworker  and my work was really good. also enjoy doing my job.
good,"3rd shift schedule was terrible."
good,"Good people, enjoyed my time working there. Equipment for cleaning floors before closing was pretty beat up."
good,"Ingles was my first job, and i actually loved it. I didn't get many hours, but it was a good experience."
good,Good place to work laid back company fast paced always something to do could be cleaning helping a customer cooking or preparing specific orders for the customer
good,"This is a minimum wage job, granted; I love working with the people I work with, nonetheless. Ingles is a good company and a good environment to work in."
good,"Good place to work with the right team in place.  Fair wages, good career advancement opportunities, salary positions can get hectic around holidays, but overall not a bad experience."
good,"Our department works as a team to provide excellent customer service to all customers. The day consists of early morning food preparation for the sub bar while taking care of customer's needs. I am in charge of the deli-meats and cheeses and ensuring that all items are fresh and the customers are provided with the right cuts. The work is fast-paced which I enjoy, as well as knowing the customers needs. Management is ready to jump in when we our very busy during the lunch hours. The hardest part of the job is making sure all meats and cheeses are tagged and machines are staying clean while servicing many customers. I enjoy the customers and keeping the slice line neat and clean. Ive learned a tremendous amount of information about the different cuts of both meats and cheeses."
good,"This job was repetitive, but it was also enjoyable. I worked with all types of people and enjoyed working with them. There is a variety of tasks to be done for any given job even if your main responsibility is somewhat repetitive and boring. Most of the management was great and respectful but her were also some who weren't. Overall, I enjoyed working at ingles and being around my coworkers and meeting new people throughout the day."
good,I enjoyed the work and the company but my manager just did not cooperate with any employees on anything and would not hear them out. Was told many time that she could do it without any of us there.
good,"Like all businesses, Ingles would have slow days. But, around the holidays, the company would receive alot more business. In my position at Ingles Markets, I strongly felt my end of the store was underpaid for all of the work we really had to end up putting in for everyone else."
good,This was my first job and Overall i felt that this was a good experience. i feel like i came out of this job better equiped to handle other jobs in the future.
good,It is a good place to work if you’re in school or need to work a flexible schedule. They work with you in hours and you can tell them when you’re available.
good,"I worked not only as a cashier, but as a deli slicer, sub maker, cook, stocker, or anything they needed help with. They considered me a valuable worker. It was always busy with no time to spare."
good,"No problems and  friendly coworkers. Daytime hours were good."
good,I learnt teamwork can get you so far throughout the day depending where you're stationed and customers come first. I've became more organized and more aware of things
good,I love working with the cakes. I also love my schedule. Go on early get off early enough to get my kids of the bus. I am the bakery manager and all my employees are wonderful.
good,"I learned many things throughout my time at ingles, way too many to count. Management was great, always willing to work with my schedule as a student."
good,"I started this job at the gas station knowing it was temporary, but throughout my time I learned how to deal with customers ranging from the most cooperative to the most antagonistic. The most significant tip that I still remember is stick to store policy, no matter the sob story, and always flag the manager should a customer get persistent."
good,You have a clean and nice environment to work. You have chances to advance and help the community. It's very friendly place.it has workable shifts for people.
good,"I enjoy my job but had to learn how to roll sushi.  I have become very good so customers say.  My co-workers are supportive, but I am alone in doing sushi.  I do fill in at other stations when we become busy but cuts into my time for meeting quotas for sushi.  Every moment counts as we are very busy."
good,Working for ingles was a quick paced environment l enjoyed working for them it was my first job experience. I learned to cope in a stressful environment. I made mistakes but I learned as I progressed through the job.
good,The schedule wasn't the best but when I did go into work I always had a positive attitude and i kept up well with the fast working pace. I learned how to handle money and customers within a fast paced working environment.
good,A very productive and professional company other employees were welcoming and nice. I only had one problem with how the management of the department I worked was acting towards me at times but would never address if they had a problem with me.
good,"Overall, Ingles is an excellent place to work. After only 3 months, I was given a promotion that gave me more pay, more responsibilities, a better job title. The management was able to work with my schedule, and provided excellent training for me to able to my job efficiently. I did, however, have a problem with one of the managers."
good,"It was great place to work, and easy to advance in career options. It just is not the right place for a lot of people. They do work well with schedules."
good,"Empresa con mucho empuje, variedad de productos, mercado creciente."
good,Great first job. They employed a lot of students. I work on the night shift stock crew. It’s a lot more laid back on the uniform because they’re not open to the public durning the night shift hours. So I could have a beard and dress casual. Day shift on the other hand had uniforms that the company provides the shirts and you have to have your own khakis. Some of the management was great and other managers not so great. Overall I did not have a bad experience with this employer.
good,Working at Ingles was slow at some points. But I feel that we could have been paid a little more with what we have to put up with. Although it got me started and working outside of my comfort zone.
good,"Ingles Markets was a good place to work a part time job as high school student. The work hours were decently flexible, and the managers were nice and helpful."
good,I loved working at ingles the best job ever ! I would definitely recommend it to a friend ! The staff was great and the managers were also great ! It was a fun clean environment!
good,"Bien trabajo y siempre estubo algo que hacer."
good,Its an alright place to work . I really loved it. I would love to try something else besides the deli. The people a d bosses are nice . they work with you.
good,"Each day was different, depending on how busy the store was. I enjoyed this job because it was very fast paced. The hardest part of the job was learning to deal with different customers."
good,"I felt like the work environment was something that I enjoyed, but unfortunately I wasn’t planning on staying there for longer than I needed to. Only long enough so that I could dip my toes into the water of adulthood and learning how to save money up for things I would need in the future."
good,My experience everyone for the most part work together.  However wages are not competitive with other Grocery chains. Started out as Experienced $12 hr
good,see above....decent job with limited benefits...I was a 3rd shift Grocery Manager with this company for about 6 months...due to not enough help on my shift i was forced to leave
good,"Depending on which store you work at,  Ingles is a pretty decent place to work. It really comes down to management and the work environment. They are usually flexible with work hours and if you need a day off."
good,"I understand that now that there is alot of Drama in the work place but the drama did not stop. When i got there to start working the older employees that have been there for a while, had come to me and was suppose to be training me but were instead just telling me about everyones bussiness. Over all I did like the fact that the managers of the store would come by and actually say hello and good morning."
good,"Working at ingles was a good work experience, just needed sometbing with a better opportunities to move up and improve my position to make more money."
good,The days typically went well always busy but not stressful. Always learning new things from every department. had enough employees to cover shifts so didn't have tostresswho was going to cover..
good,"Management is pretty chill, there are slow parts of the day along with fast, good for part time work to gain work experience but there are better jobs about there that will more than likely pay more than $9.00/hour starting out."
good,"I truly loved my job. I made it a point to learn 95% of duties and jobs so that I child benefit my employer as well as myself and my check. I refuse to do any job without doing it correctly abc top the best off my ability possible. Flexible and versatile I quickly advanced Becoming abc asset to my employer. I knew more about System and books and policies than all managers, and how to fix or find errors immediately. I made weekly schedules for staff, and dealt with them in a professional manner while trying to continuously motivate more in rerurn. The customers were why I loved it though. They knew they could come top me and I'd help them all I could and trusted me and my work knowing and having seen the work provided ."
good,There were not enough hours provided and there simply wasn't enough pay. Hours were flexible and managers worked with you most of the time but not always.
good,Clean and productive workplace. Well organized with good management team. Working with customers is the most enjoyable part of the job. I like working with the associates at Ingles because we work as a team.
good,"It’s a great first job and it’s easy to move up to certain positions. Great people and coworkers. Flexible schedule.  Very easy job, at the least the front end is"
good,I have learned many things from this job. I've learned bookkeeping skills and management skills. I love the people that come through Ingles. Fast paced environment and sometimes stressful.
good,At Ingles It was a very Good job; I learned how to do customer service well and it taught me a lot about serving the customer. I would recommend anymore looking for a first job to try it out it gives you a good picture into how the real world works.
good,I enjoyed working with the managers and the fellow employees. I made some wonderful friends there and got a lot of good working experience in the two years I worked there.
good,"My experience there was alright. I just had a few problems. I was doing the assistant manager's job in my department, but wasn't getting the pay. The other managers knew about it, but didn't make him do his job or give me a fair raise for what I was doing. The workers are nice and willing to help if need be. The store managers are good at keeping things under control and will correct you if you need it.  Sometimes work days are busy, and other times it can be extremely slow."
good,"Was a very flexible place to work when I was still in high school. Worked there 4 years never had a problem. Moved up in pay multiple times. Maxed out as a Bookkeeper because management positions were hard to come by unless willing to relocate. In that case if you are willing to move, moving up the corporate ladder may come easy to you."
good,"This is a great place to work if you're younger like through high school or college. Just don't get yourself in the deli. The deli is very fast paced and stressful, especially on Sundays."
good,This job was great for my first job. I was a high school senior and it was great to have spending money in my pocket. The only down side about working at Ingles was how busy we would get and the customers got very aggravated but that's all jobs. I would definitely say that Ingles is a good job for a high school student to work.
good,"Working at ingles has been an alright experience. I do everything an assistant manager would do such as doing all of the paperwork (bills, sales, invoices, etc.) and making truck orders when the manager is in vacation."
good,"Overnight Stock team."
good,"Ingles Markets is a nice place to work. It is a very high paced environment with little time for anilyitical thinking though. I have enjoyed a good work culture there and still do. The hardest part of my career there includes short staffing, cuts in management, that led to a lower degree of all management follow through. The most enjoyable part of my job there is the customer experience. I have found that many of my customers and employees are like family somewhat."
good,"I worked many positions at Ingles. Stocking is probably one of the better ones, except I didn't like 3rd shift stocking, as too work much was put on 3rd shift. Also, it gets too crowded in the back of the store with back stock.  The pay isn't good and little to no benefits and no discounts, but the hours are flexible if you are part-time.  I don't recommend it for long term but it's perfect while you are going to school. Management could be better but not the worst.  And as with any customer service job, you have to be very tolerant of some very ignorant customers."
good,"This was my first job and gave me the experience I needed to help give the boost needed to reflect on my resume for future career choices. Cashier, Customer Service, Bookkeeping, Time Management, Conflict Resolution, and various other skills needed for better job placement opportunities."
good,"Most of the people there were friendly with nothing to complain about. Some of the staff there however were not so friendly or some might even say over the top rude and unfair. The environment was friendly and I loved associating with the customers. I don't really think that there was a hard part to this job to be honest. I loved when the customers would come through my line and I got to hear about their day. A typical day would include running the register,handling money, and sweeping the floor and keeping your area that you worked in clean. Occasionally you would put things back that customers didn't want."
good,"I had an overall good experience working with Ingles Markets. A typical day at work was me coming in at 6 in the morning and I immediately starting facing my section to make it look presentable for when the store opened. Then if it was a truck day we would try to throw a little back stock before it had arrived so we could push out older dates. My favorite part of the job was definitely when I first started working there on 3rd shift I loved the people that were around me more, but after working that shift for almost a year and a half it got very tiring. When I started out they helped me greatly on 3rd shift stocking to get me where I needed to be to become successful. Managers were fair most of the time. Sometimes they gave me a hard time because I didn't want to become their ""buddy"" because I was more focused on my job and how I could improve myself. There wasn't always the best of communication for sale items and back stock but we figured it out in the end. I definitely learned how to work very productive in a short amount of time on the job, and my organizational skills were some of my best qualities. Hardest part of the job was near the end of the week and whoever had the most hours left on their week had to stay the longest so it was unfair but it needed to be done. My favorite days were working back stock and rotating items. I also loved to do inventory because I'm very well with numbers and organizing."
good,"The pay and hours were good. Third shift took some getting used to."
good,"Well, I've been working for ingles for almost 2 years and I like it o.k....it would be better if I had some kind of meal discount.. pay raise after 90 days."
good,"Ingles was a good company to work for, but they quit wanting to work with my school schedule & sometimes did not put me on the schedule. Good with giving days off."
good,"I like to work in the mornings during the weekends. Being more active with the customers. Like to have the customers satisfied. I control my anger, I have respect with everyone. Is to be standing in one place. That I get along with my co-worker's."
good,I enjoy working in the bakery. I come in busy and I stay busy until I leave. This is what I love the most about this job. I also really like the store managers; they're very friendly and normally check in just to see how i'm liking the job.
good,I loved working here it was a chill environment . The hardest part of the job was when wic customers would come because I would have to keep calling the managers over. But i loved it overall
good,Adapted to your Schedule. Managers cared about their workers. pay was average but weekly. Ran very well as a organization and a company. All departments were in order.
good,The best thing about Ingles is how flexible they are when it comes to scheduling. They often let employees go away to college and then work when they're home on breaks which has been great for me.
good,I've worked at ingles almost 2 years. It's a great place to work with really good management. I've learned a lot in my time at ingles. I enjoy all my co workers
good,I worked at Ingles when i was in high school. This was my second job but I loved the job and the people I worked with. There is room for career progression as long as your willig to work for it.
good,The bakery itself is a lot of work that one must do alone and sometimes it's too much work for one person to get done in one night and instead of being understanding there is reprimanding.
good,This was a good experience working with Ingles. I learned a lot of skills that has helped me out since ingles. I worked with wonderful people and had great customers.
good,"A typical day was standing at a register for eight hours.  Not hard work, just the same thing day after day.  The manager lacked people skills."
good,I was promoted twice within a six month period so there is a ton of room for promotions. The management hours can be long but all in all it's not a bad job for the pay.
good,"Each day we had to come in and block the store so it would look presentable when the customer started to arrive. I learned how to cashier and handle money quickly and how to organize a store and do inventory. didn't care for the management directly over the stock crew because he was young and still figuring out how to manage over others. I absolutely loved my co workers, we all got along quite well and it made our work environment a much better place. The hardest part of the job was getting the truck done before specified time. The best part of the job was meeting new people, and helping the customers when they asked questions..."
good,"Ingles is a company that will put you to work from the very first day. My typical day was spent behind the fruit bar, preparing fruit and veggie bowls for customer purchase. "
good,On a typical work day began as customers and coworkers exchanged greetings. Before shifts began its important o discuss any changes prior to beginning of shifts and anything that may have taken place that could possibly affect or carry over into the closing shift. After i would go into the office and begin my day by accounting for all monetary assets and any paperwork that needed to be signed off on i would make sure it was done in order for the shift to be successfully turned over to myself and closing manager.
good,"Ingles is a great place to get face to face customer service experience. In my career there, they have been very accommodating as far as my schedule goes, on what days I can work, and what days I absolutely can't."
good,"You will work, work, and work!! I learned hard work pays off and it will be noticed. Most of the employs have 10+ years of experience but hard to get along with. Hardest part is ill employs. Most enjoyable is seeing that you made someone's day."
good,"Some of my co-worker do not do what they are suppose to and just expect to get the hours, most of them do. I also do not get enough hours here to cover all my expenses. Some of the managers have their bad and good days. There are a lot of people working here."
good,"I was Dairy Manager. I had to order truck, unload truck, stock shelves, do backstock, check dates, clean coolers, hiring/firing, scheduling, block the isle, and keep it clean."
good,I enjoyed working here. Nice people to work with. Got a good bit of hours. They were very understanding when I got sick for a good period of time
good,"I've worked her for only about nine months, in that time I have learned a lot about the grocery business.  The deli at the Locust Grove Ingles is a high paced place to work, but once you get the have of the environment,it's a very fun job to be at."
good,I started in 1 department and went into another. Learned many things.  Great Co-workers.  
good,"I've learned a lot working here. I love working with my co-workers. When I first started working here I was taken advantage of. I was given management keys, but at the end of the day I was told that I was too young to have them. I did it for 2 years. Now my new manager compensated for what they did to me."
good,Stocking isn't that hard of a job.
good,This was my first job so I learned a lot on how to earn and manage my own money. I enjoyed meeting new people and customers. My boss was fair and gave me Sundays off for my religion.
good,"A typical day at work is just being a cashier and providing customer service when needed. I learned the art of processing sales much more excessively and efficiently. The management was very well rounded, treated the employees as equals but then again they would have their days when their not so much into the equality. My co-workers were great to get along with. The hardest part of the job was the weekends and how busy the weekends would be but it sure compensate time. The most enjoyable thing had to be the relationships between me and the workers we made our work days fun days but still made sure we were productive."
good,I enjoyed working at Ingles Markets because of the opportunities it gave me to meet new people.
good,"Bagging customers purchase. Bringing carts in from the parking lot. Assisting customers out with there purchases."
good,"I work night stock and it's actually a very enjoyable job, minus the graveyard part, but I have a good crew and everyone works hard and gets it done together. Attention to detail is key in success. This is not easy work."
good,Very understandable Especially when it comes to family emergencies. They are kind friendly work around hours. They value you being there and value the efforts that you put in. All in all they are a good place to work for coming out of high school or while in high school.
good,"I started working at ingles at 16 years old. I was in my high school’s marching band and had a crazy schedule. They worked around it generously. At times the management would act childish, but it was still a great work environment."
good,I overall like this company once you get a feel for it you’ll find its kinda a cozy atmosphere and the people who work with you are like an extinction of your family I’m very grateful to have the opportunity to come to work for my store manager and department manager
good,Its a nice envirenment to work in but can be a little stressful if you let the job and home life get to you. The customers are nice at times and then other times rude. But thats at any job no matter were you work. Its very clean. For shopping experience its very easy to get help to find you need if you or a customer can't the item you looking for.
good,"Ingles has a pretty good work environment. I recommend a good bit of people if they’re in need of work. The job can be slow, but picks up during rush hour which is around 11am. I enjoyed talking to customers and getting good reviews on my job. The schedule is what you make it so there never any issues in terms of time. However dealing with rude customers was never fun."
good,Overall a good company to work for. Lots of different positions available. Very good about letting you have time off when you need it. You have to have a tolerance for putting up with customers if you work on the front end.
good,"Ingles is fine as a job while trying to earn a degree.  As with some occupations, it had its ups and downs.  Overall, the people working for Ingles Markets Inc. are nice and respectful."
good,Overall a good fit for anyone who is willing to work a lot during a week. Demands a lot of hours but pays very well considering. Have to weigh the pros and cons.
good,"Great people, but little pay that focuses on the extortion of college students for the majority of labor. The people and culture were the best part of working there."
good,"I would come in and go straight to work. Each worker has their own job, the deli runs like clock work if everyone shows up for work and does their jobs. Working in the deli feels like being in a dysfunctional loving family."
good,I really enjoyed my time at Ingles. I would recommend this company to anyone especially someone looking for their first job! I really enjoyed my coworkers as well. It was a great environment to be in!
good,"As a deli associate for Ingles Markets, I was in a fast pace high volume store. Most of the customers and co-workers are friendly and make the work atmosphere family like. The managers were easy to work with and seem to value their employees. There is the opportunity to advance with the company also."
good,Ingles has been a second home to me; not only is the staff friendly but the management is great too. I would recommend working for ingles to anyone! I definitely love my job.
good,Being a cashier was pretty fast paced during the weekends or holidays. There were some slow days but was always busy cleaning or putting products back that weren't wanted at the time or check out.
good,"A great first job experience and opportunity. I learned how to manage my time effectively and contribute as a team member. The managers where very helpful, patient, and thorough."
good,"Great place to work, however is not family oriented and hard to keep a life outside when in management. Career advancement is very achievable and pay is decent."
good,I never had a problem with this company. when i started working at the new statesville store that is when all my problems come. Manager at that store let me go once before for no reason and when he became my manager he had to find a reason to let me go bc he never liked me anyway
good,"A cashier at Ingles was my first job and I was there for six months. I don't think I was trained well enough, for example, no one told me you keep certain checks and give back others depending on what number the machine shows. If you give back a check you're supposed to keep you lose money. I did this and got written up, despite having never been told about this. Overall, working here wasn't too bad. They work with school or other jobs, if there's a certain day you want off every week you can generally get it. The managers had their days where they were moody and would take it out on you. For some reason there are five managers and one might say one thing and another would say something contradicting that. They also sometimes did stuff that didn't make a lot of sense. I was closing one night and had come back from lunch. I waited an hour after returning and asked to go to the bathroom, it was around 8:30, not a lot of customers, and two other cashiers, both of which were not set to leave for 30 more minutes. As soon as I ask, my mangager sends one of them home! I just as soon make it to the bathroom and sit down when my manager calls for me to come back to the front, so I hurry and get back up there. She was on my register checking a customer out and continued to do so and I just stood there. So why did you ruin my last chance to use the bathroom (I can't go after the other cashiers leave) for the night? You see a lot of people come and go, most of them were alright, but there are cliques and drama, at least with the cashiers and baggers as a lot of them are high school and"
good,Working here is fun. it is not stressful. the pay is decent for the job. the people in management are very nice and laid back. I enjoy going to work everyday.
good,It is a great job for someone in High School or College looking for part time employment. Being part time means no benefits. Great job for a first time job seeker.
good,Ingles was not a hard company to work for. As long as you worked hard and showed up on time you did not have to worry about much. There is room for advancement more so if you are willing to travel between stores.
good,"Ingles is a great place for starting out. It provides great customer service experience as well as teaching employees how to deal with customers. Overall, Ingles is your average grocery store."
good,Ingles is a place to advance quickly if you are willing to learn the job and have the skills to performing the job. The down side if working with the company is that it is severely understaffed and what could be a easy job turns into a difficult one.  This would be a great company once enough staff is hired and trained properly.
good,Decent employment. Sick days are almost useless because you must be out 5 consective days before you can collect your sick pay. So if your out with a stomach bug for a day you just loose a days pay meanwhile your sick pay just continues to accure so unless your extremely  or terminally ill...you want get to use it. Another words that benefit basically just looks good on paper not one they intend for you to use.
good,My typical work day consisted of preparing food both hot and cold to be sold on the floor. The number one thing I think that I have learned would be to appreciate the food industry. I had never worked in this field before this and it gave me a greater appreciation for the workers. Management has been great. They are always very flexible and understanding of scheduling needs. I really enjoyed serving the customers and meeting all sorts of different people.
good,Ingles was not a bad job. There was opportunity for advancement. Pay was not that great. Customers are hard to work with sometimes and depending on your store management can either be really good or really bad.
good,"Sometimes it is fast-paced depending, but overall a good place to work for and managers are nice and understanding. Did not see much advancement while I was there but everyone seemed to enjoy their job."
good,i love ingles! been working there for over a year now. only wish i could move up and be a bookkeeper in the next 6 months to a year. Great first job! Mostly good co-workers.
good,"Ingles is a great starting job or after retirement job. Depending on who the management team is they may work with your schedule or they won't! Ingles doesn't like competition or working around other jobs - they will work with you if you're in school. I work in the Deli and it's drama 24/7, but the work is fairly easy albeit stressful on some days and pay is competitive. You get a 25 cent raise every year you work there, plus a raise when you go full time, or if your position at the store changes (ie some departments make more then others). If you are looking to get promoted look elsewhere. It's almost impossible to get promoted at Ingles unless everyone above you quits. Hours depend on management, but if you are full time you are guaranteed 40 hours. Getting full time may take 1-2 years depending on positions available. Management does play favorites and if you try to call out sick they expect a doctor's note."
good,A typical day would be about the same everyday day having the same tasks to complete unless a person works in multiple departments. I learned that even when it is not busy to also stay busy doing something even if it is only extra cleaning. It always helps to stay ahead if possible. The management was fair at Ingles in the department that I worked in. The workplace culture was relaxing the co workers being friendly and everything seemed to go smoothly. The hardest part of job is trying to prepare large amounts of food and several different types while trying to serve people wanting to order food in the Deli Department. The most enjoyable part of the job was I love being around food and I enjoy seeing customers being satisfied with my service.
good,"Fun work, my first real job with a company. Worked a lot while balancing school and they are happy to work around your schedule. Worked a lot of hours a week for low pay."
good,Enjoyed working with staff and managers. Offered flexible schedule that worked well with my school schedule. Learned how establish a rapport with people very quickly.
good,Follow food safety requirements. Keep machines cleaned and sanitized. friendly customer service.cooking and food prep required. knowledge of cash handling
good,I enjoyed the job that I did but the employee interaction can be very stressful because there is a lot of back-biting going on.  some department were worse than others.
good,"Store got a new manager... Horrible"
good,It takes some getting used to. The management was friendly and the pay was good enough for the work put in. Could have been a little more flexible with hours.
good,"Working for the Produce Department was fun and relaxing. But there was no way to build a career there. The managers of the store did not understand how manage a store, they lacked the knowledge to treat employees correctly."
good,"lo que mas me gusta del trabajo es el servicio al cliente, ya que conoces mucha gente diferente, cultura, religiones como clientes"
good,Very easy place to work if you can show up on time and do what your job requires of you. Ideal for elderly and high school-college kids. The employees give pretty terrible customer service and nobody seems to mind. Great if you are an introverted personality who likes clocking in and out when you are supposed to.
good,I've worked for the company for close to 13 years and have reached the miles stones that I've strived for. It has had its ups and downs. Overall Ingles is a good company to work for. It has potential to make a great salary.
good,Good place to work and people are fun and careing. Have good days and bad day's.hours are good for school kids. Nothing is very hard at all to learn how to so your job.
good,"Clean and sweeping of the floors, washing and folding towels, answering phones and setting appoints, checking and out of customers. Processing nightly credit card deposits. Inventory and cleaning of shelving."
good,"If i could have worked their forever i would have. Management was awesome, atmosphere was awesome. working with the public sucked but overall it was an amazing job"
good,"A good place to work, especially for a first time job. Pay is decent and the longer you work there, the more chance for advancement."
good,"I would like for everyone to have a good time while im at work, and also for the people(customers of the cruise ship) to add on to their knowledge, also."
good,Always try to be busy moving around the store. The more you know the faster you can move up.  During the middle of the month its pretty slow but the begginings and end are always pretty busy and you can push yourself to see how many people you can check out in a time period.
good,"Working at Ingles Markets was enjoyable. I would say a typical day at work would be busy and the customers would be full of life. Things that I've learned working at ingles is that always make sure that you're customers are satisified before leaving with their grocery. Management was used well and they ran the store according to how they should have. The co-workers were fun and easy to work with and they helped me learn stuff about the store. The hardest part of the job would be trying to please each and every on of the customers, and I would say the easiest part of the job was learning how everything works when being a cashier."
good,"Bakery Associate, but sort of asst. bakery manager w/o pay."
good,"A typical day at work is usually very busy I come in and make sure the office is balanced then make deposits soon after. I'm in charge of all the money going in and out of the office and making sure things stay balanced throughout the night so we don't lose or gain too much money. Also I work with the public a good amount to listen to their concerns or complaints and try to fix what is wrong, such as refunds and good customer service from other employees. I've learned a lot by having this job considering it was my first job but hard work pays off and lets you move ahead in life.  I started off as a cashier but was soon promoted to a bookkeeper.  I have great co-workers with good attitudes although most of them are a lot younger than I am I enjoy their company. The hardest part of my job is keeping everyone happy, especially customers that have complaints that I have no control over fixing.  The most enjoyable part of my job is I'm able to stay organized and work in a timely manner to get my job done correctly."
good,"Nice people, most of the work is just busy work that has to be done so you can easily talk with coworkers and enjoy yourself as you work."
good,good job as a small individual grocery store chain. Most enjoyable part of the job was talking to so many customers in the department everyday.
good,"While I was at Ingles I really enjoyed my job.  I enjoyed the people I worked with, the busy pace, and there was never a dull moment.  My managers were firm believers of the open door policy.  I never felt like there was a problem I could not bring to their attention.  No matter how big or small they were willing to listen.   Co-workers were typical, you have good ones and bad ones."
good,I felt like this was my home after awhile. I was welcomed kindly and when i left it was like a part of me was missing. The benefits and pay was pretty bad I think they could do better with that.
good,"This was my first job in high school and if I could go back to working there, I honestly would. one of the least stressful jobs I've ever had looking back."
good,"the most enjoyable part: was the people i worked with."
good,I enjoyed working at Ingles; that's why I stayed for two years.  They have a variety of products for relatively low prices and plenty of opportunities to take advantage of their savings.  They hired people who were willing to work and if they weren't they got rid of them.  All of us Ingles employees worked together as a unit to provide customers with the quality service they deserve.
good,"Ingles is all around a good company to work for, a typical day at work would be unloading trucks, stocking shelves and meat case throughout the work day. i have learned in my 3.5 years of work there hard work eventually pays off. the co-workers was a great part about working there everyone was normally in a great and cheerful mood. in my opinion the hardest part of my job was Holiday seasons, the job was not hard in anyway just very busy trying to meet every costumers needs throughout the season. the funnest part about working there i became close friends with my co-workers and they made me feel very comfortable with my job title and supported me through hard times...."
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at Ingles is the management staff they are upbeat & create an enjoyable & friendly atmosphere. While working here I have learned strong interpersonal relation , organizational , multi-tasking skills. My co-workers are pleasant and helpful as team members A typical day at work consists of fast paced efforts to meet the needs of customers while working efficiently to complete daily tasks ."
good,work was a nice place to go to. friendly environment and people made the work day go by faster. working with the team was enjoyable while serving the customers.
good,Ive worked at Ingles as a service clerk for about 6 months. Management is very laid back and fun to work with. You often see them out on the floor stocking shelves etc. Need a day off? No problem. As long as you request it off before they make the schedule. No discount in the store for working here though. The hours change every week so one week you may get 10 hours the next you may get 27. Our management does seem to hire too many people which cut into my hours along with others.
good,"* Great place to work"
good,"Typical day at work, was okay, everyday that I was working I had to block, which meant to go down all aisles and pull all products to the front. I learned that life isn't fair even worse. The management, some were understandable and some were hard to get along with. My co-workers were what kept me there for so long. The job wasn't hard, just that at some co-workers didn't want to work all the time. The most enjoyable was towards the night when the rush went down."
good,"They are good people to work with, friendly atmosphere, clean working environment, but low wages and not much chance for full time employment or advancement. "
good,"Arrive at work"
good,"The management was very professional and understanding of life issues that would occasionally arise. They were willing to adjust your schedule around most anything you request. The pay was minimum wage or barely above for most employees and there were no full time jobs available below management level. It is a very clean, very respectable place to work!"
good,"I enjoy bookkeeping, however I would like to move forward and don't feel there is enough opportunities to move ahead."
good,The department I worked for was deadline driven which I found to be the best part of the job. You knew the importance of each part of your job and it made choosing which projects needed to be completed and when. The entire corporate office was like one big family and everyone was kind and caring.
good,"Ingles was probably my least favorite job because I only worked two days a week and that was not near enough hours, and also I did not like the town I was located in! I learned great customer service skills at Ingles, and how to run a cashregister very well. Management at Ingles was probably the best out of all jobs I have worked because they where very friendly and trustworthy people and it was easy to talk to them about any problems. My co-workers at Ingles where amazing, I made lots of great friends there! As far as the hardest part of the job goes, I cant really think of one. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people i worked with."
good,"My days at Ingles were really up in the air. I worked many different jobs being cashier, service clerk, frozen/dairy clerk, and even assisting in produce, meat department, and gorcery. I learnes alot from Ingles considering it was my first job. I learned just about everything the store had to offer. The enviorment was frendly and the job was really simple. The hardest part was the easiest depending on day and that was where I was going to be placed."
good,"I learned how to cash checks, wic checks , paper checks. I also learned to work on a register with difficult skills to it. I learned to do store sales and build up my customer service skills."
good,"Scheduled as needed, I have learned to be more flexible as a part-time cashier.  One needs to be very inquisitive and observant to learn the ins and outs of the retail operations. On the job training makes one to learn the details of the job requirements.  The hardest part of the job is when the baggers on duty are seniors and are slow-moving, making cashiers assist in bagging even when there is a long line of customers waiting."
good,"decent paycheck for new employers"
good,"Great place to work , good managers and supervisors. Friendly stores for customers and do employees . Good locations and good sales in all departments for good  sales a"
good,"I would have stayed but had late shift and had to stand for 8+ hours. It was affecting my knees."
good,I enjoyed it as a teenager but as an adult i had to move on . Management was very unprofessional at certain times . They were very wishy washy . They lacked in communications with the cashiers .
good,Pay really well once you earn your way up. Must be willing to move to move up within the company. Work life balance isn't the best as the job is so demanding.
good,"Lots of food preparation and cooking, and also helping customers for service. Most of time stayed very busy time passed fast. The faster the better, and "
good,"its a nice place to work, it was fair enough just a lot of stress. Ingles is a good place to work if you have to incomes in the house. They have really good benefits and the insurance is ok. It's nice place to work, the people there are pretty good to work with for the most part. ... Ingles Markets was a great place to work."
good,I enjoy the managers and my other coworkers. Everyone is nice and gets a long really easily. The customers are nice and easy to get a long with also. It is a very easy job.
good,Best thing I’d say bout Ingles is the people/workers are great and hours are flexable. Worse thing is even tho you work full time hours your not considered full time and no benefits. They have limited number of full timers with benefits
good,"Good place to "
good,"Everyone is friendly, manager has no tolerance for no call no shows from what I've observed. Some employees are slower than othwrs and everyone has to pick up their slack."
good,"Ingles Market is an excellent place to challenge yourself and communicate with others. Also, ingles also taught their employees to put the customers first no matter what."
good,This was a great company working for. I had great management. I worked well with all the people. I did good there. The pay was fair for the job but I need more in order to live.
good,I loved my job and actually it had good pay but not many hours. I was only part time though so that's something to take into consideration. I would've stayed if I could actually
good,"Amazing store-level boss and coworkers, lackluster management above this level. Flexible hours, decent pay, room for advancement, good customer base, stressful work."
good,"I've enjoyed the years I've worked at Ingles. My coworkers have become my second family and I have wonderful managers I get to work with/alongside every shift. There are a few bad days and sometimes it can be stressful, but all the good times and great customers we have and get to see on a regular basis make it worth it."
good,"A typical work day was laid back I am looking for something more fast-paced. I learned a lot about customer satisfaction, I enjoyed the people that worked there. The hardest part of my job was working with individuals who were less productive than me and lazy I could not stand that."
good,I love working with the people there and I love the people that came in but the manger was not treating me right I always had to come in on my day off they wanted me a hour early but overall I love the job
good,"Ingles provided valuable customer service experience, and teaches how to deal with a variety of customers in a retail setting.  The hours for part-time employees was flexible and management was fair when doling out hours."
good,"Everyday I learned something new every day, it’s a high volume store, so I stayed pretty busy.  I’m used to standing on my feet for long periods of time. I enjoyed working here"
good,"understandable management, great place to expand, clean work environment, positive workers. managers are very flexible with your availability. smiles all around."
good,Ingles is a good place to it is very flexible with sceduals and i would recommend it to anyone still in highschool looking for there first job the only down side to it is the pay they are not competitive in there pay.
good,"Clock in, ensure proper attire is on, cull and stock bananas. Then I either cull the produce department, or if it is Wednesday I switch over weekly ads before culling. Culling involves pulling undesirable produce and marking close ""Sell By"" dates. Then I stock and fill holes, utilizing any extra time I have to clean and or repack/chop up fruit/veggies as needed. "
good,"It was a steady, fairly easy job that gave me many close friends. The hours are flexible which was nice, and it's easy to catch on. The pay was fair and the managers were pretty cool. Would transfer to another one in the future."
good,Not enough hours .it was difficult to live on so few hours. Great working environment. I had wonderful customers! I had to relocate because I wasn't making enough on the few hours that I was given.. Could not ask for any better managers though.
good,"Good company with good benefits.   Pay could be a little higher.  Overall, a well run company.  Would recommend for those who are interested in retail."
good,"When I worked at Ingles, I was pulled to the side from the managers to help stock and pull pallets on the floor. They also complimented me on how fast I was at bagging."
good,"Typical day was mostly just tedious. Management would usually leave me alone until they bumped into me in the isles. Culture is split, working with teenagers on the front end to more mature workers in the other departments. Hardest part of my day was wearing too many hats and sometimes being spread thin."
good,I liked working for ingles at the time I had quite I was going threw a lot at home and really stressed out...i wish I would have never left..Everyone was friendly and the Mananger was very nice
good,Id recommend any of my peers from ages 18 to 22 to work here. It is a great work environment for someone in hopes to go to college soon and need to save a little money to prepare.
good,"It was a good job just wish I gotten more hours and more days so I could have been certified. To have better trainers. But overall it was a good work place,  it was always clean"
good,"I always greeted and assisted customers as they came into our store. I helped several locate item in need. I developed some really great relationships with them and always looked forward to their return! Our management team was always helpful and kind."
good,Did a lot of chores it was my first job. I learned what it took to earn a days paycheck. Everyday brought a new experience into my life. I'm glad that I spent the summer there when I did.
good,I liked working there. It was quick paced but managers give their overall support. Hours are chosen by managers unless there are any special requests or emergencies.
good,Management could have been stricter. It was easy coming in and getting the job done. I learned about customer service and how to make the customers feel like they are welcomed.
good,"I was hired as a grocery stocker, then transferred to the deli. After a few months there, was promoted to nightime supervisor/manager.  We had a good crew that made it a little easier even on very busy nights.  We had more employees in our department, a very diverse group.  Management had a good understanding of the situation. I think we did a good job, with the occasional pat on the back."
good,Ingles Markets is a good employer with job stability. There are opportunities for change in position or department if you are not happy in your current position.
good,"Typical day work requires fast-paced service, collaboration with team members, and sometimes performing tasks that are necessary for the department even if not directly under your job description but is asked of you by your supervisor. The hardest part of the job is remaining calm with hard-to-deal-with customers and not being able to do relatively anything about shoplifting. The most enjoyable would be pleasing the customers and getting recognition from your boss on efficient work."
good,mi experiencia con esta compañia fue el servicio al cliente aprendí a ser mejor cada día y a esforzarme mas para obtener un mejor puesto aprendiendo sus normas y estandarizaciones
good,"The was great and they really helped out with your school schedule, however when they switched managers it became less enjoyable to work there. We went from getting treated like people to just workers that need to do the job they were told to do."
good,I would definitely recommend Ingles as a part or full time job for students. I would also recommend Ingles as a career. It was overall a great place to work.
good,"Cleaning: Bathrooms, parking lot, café, carpets, and sales floor."
good,"1: Día típico en el trabajo? saludable"
good,Ingles is a great place to work especially if your a student!  They are super flexible with scheduling!   My coworkers and managers were amazing people to work with!
good,"ingles is a very productive and slow paste job. As a stocker in ingles I would, love to further my career and have more hands on in the next work field I get accepted into."
good,The wages offered here are not competitive to other similar locations. The job did feel very secure. The benefits of working there were not competitive to other locations either.
good,"I find working with Ingles in the deli department to be very interesting and yet challenging because of the lack of training.  I have overcome the challenges by determination and willingness to learn against the odds.  Failure is not an option for me."
good,The job is just really good if you want a part time job mainly if you're in school they have good food nice they are racist well the older customers are but over all it's fine
good,Working at Ingles taught me a lot. It was fun when business was booming but also stressful trying to deal with customer service matters and making sure cashiers and service clerks were doing what they were suppose to. Holidays are not that fun especially Christmas. Most of the time the customers are friendly and you have the same select few that are your favorites but at Christmas a lot of people turn into the grinch and aren't too friendly or too pleasant to deal with.
good,"I loved my job at Ingles. I really enjoyed stocking shelves and being responsible for majority of the store. I learned how to be a better Manager and team player by helping my employees complete their assigned tasks each night.I really liked the people that i worked with and my customers. The hardest part of my job as Manager there was making sure all 6 of my employees aisles we're completed in time, before end of shift. I enjoyed most was the time I actually spent getting to stock the shelves with product. Matching up the barcode's and placing product neatly on shelves."
good,"long hours third shift takes time to get used to. quick paced physically demanding, health insurance and dental insurance are very good. fun job at times."
good,It's a grocery store. I worked full time at a Bakery Manager and enjoyed my work. Its a fast pace environment where challenges can arise randomly. Being able respond quickly can keep a mishap from becoming a disaster.
good,I've always been the graveyard shift type so this job was great for me. U have A chance to come in early to talk about the job with other employees. Everyone works and a team and thinks as a team player. When one person seems to be slowing things down or can't move as fast as another we was worked as a unit to complete the task
good,Great place to work at. I definitely learned a lot while working there as far performing an assortment of different tasks that later on helps you work your way up in the department.
good,"I love learning new things and being apart of a work family. its fast pace and it is a good place to get a work out, because of all the moving"
good,"A typical day involved me counting the main drawer and safe, creating tills and counting cashiers tills to make sure they were on. I learned how to keep track of a large amount of money, creating deposits, and also deal with various customers (good and bad). The management was fun to be around and mostly helpful for whenever I had any questions. My coworkers were all very nice. I tend to get along with everyone I work with (simply because I would rather not be in an awkward or tense work environment). The hardest part of my job was mainly in the beginning while I was still learning about instances where money would either appear or disappear. Once I started working more I began understanding where the money would go or come from and it became easier to fix. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people I enjoyed. My best friend worked at the Starbucks in the store, I usually worked with my favorite managers, and almost always made friends with new workers."
good,Been with the company for several years and I cant complain about working here. Some aspects aren't ideal but you can't expect everything to be perfect all the time. One of the few places where people of different backgrounds and cultures can all come together and work harmoniously.
good,"I enjoyed working at ingles and was with the company for six years. I worked primarily the front of the store either in a bookkeeping position or as a cashier. Friendly people and value of the employee were what made the job. However, my only dispute with the place was having to wear multiple hats. For example, as a bookkeeper, I would end up making flower arrangements in floral, writing on cakes in the bakery, cleaning dishes in the deli, or playing as stand in manager. "
good,"Nice people, very helpful mentors who were willing to patiently teach and train new employees. This was my first impression."
good,"decent place to work while you go to college have to stay there a long time to make enough money to make a living"
good,"I really enjoy working here, I would just like to make more money and they aren't very flexible in that category. I love working with the other people that work there, I love the customers that come in. I just don't enjoy the authority."
good,Ingle's Markets is a great place to work. The job isn't too hard and the customers are very nice. The employees care about their job. I found this surprising since most of them are teenagers not even out of high school. Management was always kind as long as jobs were filled and they were done well.
good,"I loved every bit of this job, only issue was some of the coworkers were not mature, due to their age of course. I enjoyed being paid every week in the middle of the week. This was my first real job."
good,This is a part-time job that I work on a cash register. I get to be be around people everyday. I enjoy my work environment and this is a great job for a high school student or part-time. I'm in need of a full-time position or higher pay so that I can surive.
good,"A typical day at work now would be working with my deli crew in the kitchen having fun, but also being serious and productive at the same time. Making our customers happy is our big priority. I was a cashier for the first year there, then I got asked to work in the deli in subs or on slice line. I do love my job, but I am looking for something more into what my future consists of, and that's in the medical field. The management there is wonderful, they are all great people with things behind them and great success. The hardest part of my job is probably working with non patient customers, but I try my absolute best to please them even if they are being hateful. I love all my customers the same and treat them the same. The most enjoyable part is the people I work with and how they treat me. We are all like family and love to joke around with each other. We do our absolute best at our jobs and succeed also."
good,Here I learned a lot about the dynamic of work places. You can work in many different stores but there will always be certain types of personality's that end up in this work place. I also learned that there are many people who don't use ethics in the work place.
good,worked alone in a gas station kiosk basically a dorm room with a convince station in it. pretty free as long as you don't mess anything up.
good,"I love walking into Ingles because it is always a very friendly and warming atmosphere. Management is always willing to help and go out of their way to help you or get anything you need. I absolutely love the people I work with, I've never had a problem with them. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude people but you will get them where ever you go. The most enjoyable part of working with Ingles is getting to bond and know your regular customers."
good,"A typical day at work is productive, standing at the end of your register to greet customers, bagging groceries, handling cash and transactions, maintaining a friendly smile and attitude, going on break, and finishing the work day. I learned how to deal effectively with rude customers and manage my time wisely. My co-workers were easy to work with and did their job; however, a few of them would slack off even during the busiest of times. The hardest part of being a cashier was standing for long periods of time. On the other hand, the most enjoyable part of being a cashier was working the register."
good,"I enjoyed working with the managers and the staff were great and my favorite regular customers who knew me by name made my days.  I got to work front end, stock crew and produce at the grocery store."
good,Always had a friendly environment with the customers and the employees. Everyone respected each other and the management was excellent.
good,"Despite how management and co-workers perform, customer satisfaction was a success."
good,"Typical day , ordering produce, daily rotation of produce, displaying produce, co-worker guidance, monthly inventories, daily inventories, employee and customer service and support."
good,"Typically I would stock all of the dairy products every morning from milk to cheese and eggs.  I learned that a lot of dairy orders that come in that need to be stocked had to be sold in a timely manner or they would have to be thrown away.  My co-workers were helpful sometimes at the job, but most of the time they were busy with their own tasks.  The hardest part of the job was selling all of the products coming in on time.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with different customers everyday."
good,"A typical day at work involved constant customer service, stocking & restocking inventory, and cleaning."
good,"Not a bad environment for part time supplemental income, but not recommended as a career."
good,"Handled Thousands of dollars daily while maintaining a the accuracy of the Office and Accounting Books. Responsible for the company's accuracy when money came to/from the Bank. Opened the business in the early mornings, and also closed late nights regularly. Trained new hires and helped to maintain company protocol. Kept an accurate filing on movies and games as a Video Sales Clerk. Answered the telephone with a customer friendly spirit by answering any questions, comments or concerns they may have. Worked in the Bakery performing duties such as baking, boxing pastries and pricing pastries. Had the responsibly of stocking shelves with Merchandise as a Grocery Stocker overnight.

good,start at 10 30 on truck nights we would break down truck before stocking shelves we would stock shelves till about 6 in the morning. learned alot of stuff how to make store look good for the next day and stock shelve break down the truck. management was fairly good not really on top of things. co workers made it fun to where everyone could make it through the night. blocking cans was hardest part they would always fall. getting my job done and making sure it was done right
good,A typical day at work usually consist of doing the same thing over and over and the day slows at at a certain time. The co-workers are very friendly and the managers realize they are human beings too and treat you the same as they treat everyone else. The best part of the job is being able to socialize freely as you choose if you are able to multitask.
good,I was a cashier and I bagged groceries. I also assisted with customer service.
good,"A typical work day for me includes opening the video department. This requires me to check in the due DVD's, stock the shelfs, assist customers, counting the money in the cash registar, and cleaning. Some days I would have to check in the new inventory, prep the incoming movies to be put out on the shelves, and special ordering anything the department needs."
good,Ingles was my first real job and it was so worth it. The managers were super nice. All you have to do is be respectful to everyone there. Including customers. It’s definitely worth it
good,Started with the deli..Was to be only for a short time then go to other department. But have been there for over a year. Looking forward to a promotion to another area to learn more
good,A typical day at work for me would be on a register handling the customers. The hardest part of the job would be the customers being disrespectful or the management not understanding why I changed my shifts. I do love the overall job. Just somethings working in customer service.
good,La gente que trabaja aqui es muy profesional. Lo que hace que sea mas sencillo resolver dudas que un o puedo llegar a tener.
good,I worked as a cashier and loved it most of the time. I love interacting with people and making the customers smile with my laugh or my bubbly personality.

good,"I am a cashier at ingles, it is still a new store so it is never very busy so the days can sometimes drag on. My coworkers are nice and fun to be around which much the hours of having to stand around waiting for customer worth it. "
good,Ingles is dealing with the public if your good dealing with people out there. Cutting meat and cheese for customers.  Some customers can be so picky. P

Elaboracion de quizes, examenes orales, etc. Lo que mas me gusta es tratar con  los niños y jovenes. La parte mas dificil es la carga excesiva de trabajo."

good,Ingles has a lot of good opportunities for different people to work. They don’t judge others. They work together and they treat each other with respect.
good,The manager's were nice and helpful.  Very laid back place to work. The rushe's were not bad at all. We worked as a team and kept our customers happy.

good,The clients that approached me at the register were very pleasant and were very pleased when I was able to take my time to locate the item that they couldn't find on their own.

good,My typical day at work if I opened would be to first start out by collecting all the sponges from the registers. I have to soak them for the baggers so they can grip the bags properly. Then I would have to go out to the parking lot and get all the shopping carts from the previous night. If need be I would fill up the ice coolers. While doing this all I would have to bag for the cashiers.

And they are very understanding when it comes to emergency or if you need help with anything . I loved working here ."

good,"The most i like about the job is the flexibility, the descent pay and its not all that busy. the hardest part about my job is stocking and lifting milk every morning but other than that its very easy.

good,Ingles provided me with a great work environment. My job was consistent with the basic duties and functions of most of my other bakery positions. The less appealing aspects of the job were the compensation and benefits that were offered along with the ability to advance within the company.

good,"I have been with this store for almost two years now. I have received two raises within. I've been promoted twice, from cashier to back-up scanning coordinator, to Head Bookkeeper. If you are an exceptional employee, you will move up. We recently had an issue, because our district manager decided to transfer our store manager to Athens, Georgia and we got their store manager. We weren't to happy about it. Even our manager can be a pain in the rear, he was a good manager."

good,stock shelves and displays and clean up back room and break down the truck the most enjoyable part is going home in the morning
good,"With this position I have learned how to coach individuals throughout their managerial roles within the company.

good,I would come in and assist customers with their grocery's.  I would put the food that they didnt want or couldnt around. I would recommend this place. Very friendly
good,"I worked at ingles #147 and it was a pretty positive experience. on a typical day i would pull pallets from back of the store to the main floor, break down pallets and sort product to according isles. rotated product on to the shelf making sure the newest date was in the back. Ran dog food, paper towels, chemicals, pasta and pasta sauce, and general canned isles. I would say the hardest part of the job would probably be going through a inventory. Another thing that is hard is having multiple bosses and sometimes they all can tell you to do different things or sometimes when they tell you to do something they can conflict. So all you can do is have patience and try the best you can."
good,The years spent at ingles were filled with much joy. I love working with folks and the grocery industry was very good to me for more than 10 years. The best part was bringing home recipes and food to my family. The worst part was when I saw a lady turn a grocery buggy over in the parking lot!

good,day to day customer service skills. Room for advancement. worked as book keeper in cash office. clean environment and friendly staff.
good,"The typical day was arriving at 5 am to make the donuts, pastries, and bread. It also consisted of baking cakes, pies, cookies, and brownies. I learned that time is essential especially when the items have to be available at a certain time. Despite opportunities for advancement; my co-workers were quite pleasant to work with. It may seem like a piece of cake, but the grease for the donuts is very hot, as well the icing for the donuts and pastries. This in turn makes the working area quite warm. I loved being able to be somewhat creative when decorating the birthday cakes."
good,A typical day at work would be a steady day full of the same daily customers you see on a regular basis. I've learned customer service and problem solving. Co workers are the best. The hardest part of the job is the rush of the holidays..The most enjoyable part is meeting new people and having the ability to create that one on one relationship with them.

Covered vacations times for manager and employees. Management was outstanding. Co-workers was good. Hardest part was not enough people to work, didn't lasted long enough. the enjoyable part is people cause you always know most of them"
good,"Working for Ingles was definitely a good place to start for my first job. My co-workers were very helpful and dependable, along with management. Ingles was very good to work around my schedule due to school but working late night shifts on weekends has put me behind in my studies. Working as a cashier has taught me to deal with all kinds of customers and improved my communication skills to satisfy all shoppers. I really enjoy working with people and communicating, so that is definitely a plus."

good,My bosses at the time were great. It made coming in each day easy. I started before we got the scanners so i have been trained to run 2 types of registers. My co workers were easy to get along with everyday. the hardest part was never knowing what my schedule was until it was too late to plan anything.
good,Boring of course because its a grocery store but you get to see different people every day. Really helps with working with people and communicating with the public. Wonderful first job for a teenager.
good,If you need your first job its good to start you off. After a while you start to want more pay... the environment is very nice and comfortable and its actually a very easy job.

I ordered products on certain aisles and I was also in charge of stocking those items."
good,"Ingles Markets provided an excellent opportunity for part time work during my time in college. They were flexible and understanding with my schedule, and were more than accommodating when myself and several other students had to take time off for exams."
good,"I really liked my time at Ingles. As my first ""real"" job, it was rather intimidating. However, practice makes perfect and eventually I was moving along with the rest of my co-workers. A typical day would generally be fun, as I had a positive relationship with my managers and my co-workers alike. The most stressful part would definitely be dealing with difficult or rude customers, or customers with large, however. Thankfully, my managers and co-workers were always very quick to help! I learned a lot of social skills dealing with many different strangers and having conversations of varying depth on a regular basis. The most enjoyable part of my job at Ingles is definitely interacting with my co-workers."
good,This is a place to get started if you're looking to have something underneath your time in opportunity in the workplace. The produce manger is the best manger cause ihe is a very understanding and works with you no matter what
good,"Grocery store customers are the best. I was in a small town where I really got to know the patients. Except for one store manager, all others worked with rather than against the pharmacy. Corporate management was usually helpful."

I highly recommend this company for anyone seeking a job, whether they're still and school and seeking a gas fund or someone looking to start over in life."
good,To me my favorite part of my job as a cashier at Ingles Market is definitely getting to meet and greet new people all day long. I loved working as a cashier! My store manager would hold contests every couple of months to see who was the fastest cashier. I won my fair share of them. I really think thats anther reason as to why I loved this job so much.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with and being able to help customers.  The biggest problem is management and how they treat us.
good,"Working at Ingles is a good job, fun workplace and friendly environment but the only ting that bothered me while I worked there was just the pay. I made $7.55 an hour working as a service clerk not trying to sound greedy but I feel like working there for a year I should make more."
good,Ingles was my very first job i enjoyed it a lot i made a bunch of friends and the managers were very helpful and always there if you needed them. It was a good job to learn communication skills and how to deal with customer service i would run the register and than sometimes stock if they needed my help.
good,"I always got my job done in a timely manner, I learned how to break down the ground beef grinder, Management was good, I got alone with all my co-workers, The hardest part was to leave, The most enjoyable part of the job was detail cut of the meats and the people's I got to know."
good,This has been a positive place to work.  The staff is professional and customer oriented.  It is a manually intensive job.  A person has to be able to stand the entire shift and lift moderately heavy objects like a case of water or a large bag of pet food.

good,A typical day at work starts off pretty slow. The relationships built there are genuine; with the customers and co-workers.

I was responsible for scanning groceries and other desired items set for purchase by customers, obtaining price checks when needed, collecting money for payment, checked identification for alcohol and/or tobacco products, placed unwanted items by customers back on the correct shelf, cleaned assigned work area before and after each shift, and as needed. I was also responsible for running self check out on certain shifts where I monitored customer product scan accuracy, refilled grocery bags, cleaned check out stations, received payments and provided accurate change when needed, and assigned as authorized personnel for access to locked tobacco cabinet. This job was a perfect temporary job as I began to start my work-life my senior year in high school."
good,"Very nice, clean environment. Great Customers and Co-workers."
good,"On a typical night at work, we usually start off the night by clearing out our back room to make way for us to unload the truck. We then separate the merchandise onto designated floats for each specific aisle. My co-workers like to crack jokes, which makes the night go by a lot faster. We then work our items to our shelves on our assigned aisles. In doing this job I have learned that I am capable of doing more than I thought I could. I feel that I have succeeded at this job when no one expected me to since it is typically a male related job. I live in a very small town and they have an old belief system here. I also got a better idea of team work."
good,"I didn't get enough hours, but it was an easy job. Co workers were friendly."

good,"learned how to handle customers, learned about responsibility, enjoyed my co-workers"
good,"I was normally a cashier. But I loved to stay busy so they bounced me from one department to the next. I loved to learn new things. I helped in the floral department durning homecoming season. I filled in when there were no-shows in the dairy department. But my favorite job was helping in HBC department where i stocked shelves with shampoo, tooth paste, ect. Customers loved that i could help them to find anything in the store."
good,"Ingles is a great place to work and they are very flexible with scheduling if you are a student, which allowed me to go to school and be successful and still be able to work."
good,"I enjoyed getting to know some of the customers. I did not like that some of the employees are unprofessional.  I have learned a lot from this job, and have enjoyed the experience."
good,"Overnight stocking can be quite physically demanding, especially because when I joined we were pretty under staffed. Also we went in at 10 but never knew when we were going to get out which sucks because either you sleep or you stay up and run errands and you’ll be exhausted by the next night"
good,always working it can be stressfull at times they will give you hours and a thirty minute break the people there are friendly my manager is nice also my coworkers
good,Wish some cashiers would be on time and more responsible . I work with a lot of teenagers . Show they care more about the customer (s).Just not pay check !
good,Was able to return for a second summer.  Still enjoyed same aspects of the job.  Culture was still flexible.  Working in deli there were fewer customers so less interesting.
good,"Job could be monotonous with some busier more stressful times. Learned a lot of codes for foods as a cashier.  Management varied, some were nice and some were stricter.  Culture was relaxed and mostly younger people most shifts.  Hardest part of job was when we had the new guidelines for selling wine that was frustrating to customers which they took out on the cashiers.  Most enjoyable part of job was that it was pretty relaxing, could talk to coworkers on evening shift."
good,Principalmente el orden al ver el desarrollo de todo .como lo que es un proceso todo proceso sin orden no puede ser llamado proceso
good,"Very fun jb to have when i was 16-17. Fairly easy, as well as, perfect for fitting in your school schedule. Management was very accommodating. The people were friendly as well as the customers."
good,This was my first time working in a grocery store. Management works hard right beside the employees. The store has a low stress atmosphere. Everyone gets along well.The benefits could be better.
good,"Ingles 249  is located in Westminster ,SC. My job was service clerk. I work First shift and occasionally nights and weekends. I work the front end by myself for the most part ,bagging groceries and retrieve cart/buggies from the parking lot. Working there was good. My co-workers were good people. Management at the store level was good. I think corprate was disconnect with store level employees. Other than that it was good experience."
good,A typical day at work I normally work 3p.m-11p.m. I will normally take my break around 5:30 p.m or 6p.m. I will come back from break and continue woking. At work I do go backs or even help my manager with a store reset.
good,"A typical day at work for me was I bagged groceries, collected carts from outside, cleaned, organized, I worked hard and was very productive. In terms of management some of the managers were really selfish, but there were a few that treated the employees like human beings. I loved my co-workers, we were all one big happy family, I only had a problem with one co-worker, but you'll find those kinds of people everywhere you go. The hardest part of the job for me was dealing with the grumpy customers, that you get. I enjoyed out doing the boys when it came to bringing in carts i'd bring twelve carts in by myself, while the boys needed help."
good,"I always had a routine, was always organized and ready to go. In opening the store We came in an hour early, started with counting the money from the night before, to make sure everything matched, put out all tills throughout the store, count deposit for bank. I was in management for four years there, I did everything from running register, customer complaints or questions, bagging, bringing in buggies, unloading truck, stock, make change or give loans to cashiers, western unions, cash checks, make bank deposits,and help wherever I was needed. Co- workers were great, the hardest part of the job, I really don't know of anything. The most enjoyable part of the job, I got to work with great people, customers were always nice, stayed busy, and always something new to learn."
good,"I love the people I work with. They are great and help me when I need it. "

good,Ambiente de trabajo muy agradable ya que la mayoria de los compañeros de trabajo son jovenes
good,"I have worked for Ingles for almost 5 years, and i have loved it. Some days (or weeks) we had some drama filled things, and you always had a senile customer at minimum 1 time a week. But the people you work with and the other good customers always make up for the bad ones."
good,You are always working but have fun while doing it. Work with friends and made new friends. Managers were caring and flexible with sports. Very organized.
good,"At both places that I worked at I found myself gaining knowledge about the average workplace and increased my work ethic. Each job gave me cashier experience and crew member interactions. Overall, however, both jobs showed me what it is like to contribute and be apart of a team. I made great friends and hope to continue to move up in the workplace and learn and experience new things."
good,Ingles is family to me! The people and customers are nice and wonderful. When I see customers walking in the door I greet then every time they come to the Deli.

good,enjoyed working with the employes wonderful store manager ..loves my vendors ....the hardest part of my job was pricing the wine
good,"At Ingles a typical day at work would be to take bank deposits (am) and look after the store front end including employes. The night shift a number of closing procedures would have to be completed before I the customer service manager or the book keeper could leave."
good,it was a good place to start for a first job. it worked around my schedule
good,Ingles gave me a chance that wasnt given to me by alot company cause i was young and experience.
good,Managers are excellent people and great at their jobs! Not too much security for the simple fact it’s a grocery store with departments! But an awesome place to work and I met some really sweet people at Ingles.
good,"Arrive at 6am make sure all paper work is done and bills are filled. Do any production that needs to be done. Put up trucks, clean, etc. During my years at Ingles I have learned to work in many departments and do many things from stocking, resets, scanning, tags, price changes, produce, dairy, to my current job as asst. bakery manager. Management has been a pleasure to work with. I would say the hardest part about my job is filling in for UN reliable employers. My favorite part would have to be the schedule and opportunity for advancement is."
good,A daily routine included meeting your numbers on production. The workplace had an excess amount of stability and was a very comfortable place to work.
good,Working at Ingles was great! I would still be there if I didn;t have to relocate years ago. I had awesome management throughout my career there. I learned so much about the retail business from them.
good,its not a fun place to work but it is a part time job that pay every day expenses for a high school student. I learned how to bag groceries and stock shelves. there is not much enjoyment other than closing with another person that helps you do the night chores.
good,Every time. I had a bagger they disappeared and walked around the store walk outside. Hide in the bathroom. And I couldn’t hardly get time to go to the bathroom.

good,"The managers would not listen and they would not take the time to understand situations."

good,"A typical day working at Ingles I scanned grocery's and helped customers with their needs. I learned how to count money quicker. I also worked uscan so I leaned a lot about double tasking. The hardest part about the job in my opinion was the times when we didn't have many customers. I don't like not being busy. Other than that nothing was too hard for me.

Learned how to stock shelves, run registers, open and close store and do reconciliations when closing of all cash registers and making night deposits for the bank. Also worked in the Deli and Bakery as a cook and cake decorator, bread maker, and meat cutter.  Management varied as I would work under the supervision of several different department managers. The co-workers were great as this was during my teenage years and early 20s so I developed my skills working with public and a variety of different people with different personalities and characteristics.  Hardest part of the job was the standing for 8 hrs a day especially the physical strain on my body working in the cold freezers in both deli and bakery and lifting up to 40 lb boxes on the cold concrete floors.  The most enjoyable was making lifetime friendships that I still have today, meeting and greeting customers to where I still know them when I run into them today and I always worked with the motto that the customer was always right, and that they were just as important as anyone else.  So I was always able to communicate and resolve any issues that may occur at the store."

Management was good, although we went through a period where we had a new customer service managers every few weeks. I really loved my co-workers, very easy going.

I was switched over to the pharmacy department where I became a pharmacy technician. I then loved every day of work. Both pharmacists were incredibly nice and enjoyable to work with. I had one other pharmacy technician I worked with and we got along great. When your coworkers have respect for you and treat you nicely, it makes the job atmosphere so much more enjoyable."
good,At ingles we are a fun group of people who work hard. Our manager makes sure our needs are met and if we have a problem she is more then willing to work with us and our problem proceeding that it meets the ingles requirements.

good,"Nome da empresa é INAC - empresa na sua época muito boa, dava oportunidade a todos , bastava ter um pouco de esforço."
good,Good Job with flexible hours. The manager was very nice and willing to work with you. the culture was good. the job is body intensive and requires you to lift and pull large objects.
good,Overall I loved my job. I loved helping customers and decorating cakes. I started out closing then went to train on donuts and decorate cakes. Just the pay sucks for what they expect out of you.
good,I learned a lot there I never worked retail before and the management was great the hardest part of the job was working on my feet all day on concrete floors
good,"Its a great job, great pepole and coustmores. Great work inviorment. Im only part time so i need more hours, by me being part time i dont get benifts or vacation time."
good,"The deli is a hectic location to work, but it is very fast paced and it comes with it's own drama. The store manager is nice as  well as the Assistant and Co-Manager and all the Customer Service Managers. They try to help when and where they can."
good,At the the time while I was working thereone of the CSM acted very rude towards customers and employees. Some people got fired for no reason because of her judgement. Overall I liked the weekly pay.
good,"As a previous employee of Ingles Markets in Clemson, SC the typical work day was fast paced but extremely motivating for me. I learned that you should expect the unexpected from customers but communicate with them in a calm and positive manner no matter what they say or do. I have to say that the management there was incredibly understanding and treated everyone equally. The workplace culture was very diverse and entertaining. I honestly cannot even think of anything that was really hard for me at that job because generally, people are going to be people. They're going to be mean, rude, and nasty but that's why you have to remind yourself that you do not know what anyone is going through so that's when you need to understand that you need to treat people the way you want to be treated. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with a variety of different cultures, personalities, and those customers that acknowledged the hard work I put in everyday."
good,"family owned, company is spread out over four states, sometimes you have to relocate to move up, not a bad place to work, good bonus program"

good,"I loved the jobs I was given, the friends I worked with, the customers I interacted with, and the support I received from ONE manager. Even though some workdays were boring, we still found ways to have fun. The hardest part of the job was seeing friends go; we become super close because we have to endure negativity from some customers and managers and we all know what it feels like, so we sympathize with each other. The most enjoyable part of Ingles was getting to know the customers; I have a list of names of the customers whom I will never forget (the list totals 40 total customers' names)."
good,A typical day at work is go in get your products out you are going to be working with. Complete items and put them out. I learned that with everyone working together things go smoother. The management is on task everyday. My co-workers come in with a positive attitude and are eager to work. The hardest part about my job is making sure all of my job is complete before time to go home. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to talk to the customers through out the store.
good,"Great people and great fun, very productive always something to accomplish in that area of work"
good,"It was a very good place to work, but management can be strict. They have certain rules, and you need to follow them. Overall, it was a very good place to work."
good,"I’ve been with Ingles for 6 years now and it took me 5 of those to advance in this company. With hard work and dedication you can achieve your goals however, this business is one that also takes patience. If you want to move up it will take time but it’s worth the wait."
good,The job was a great job. The place did not have many issues. The hours per week were very little for part time workers. The job otherwise itself want bad.
good,"I truly enjoyed working as a cashier at Ingles Markets as part time. It was a great place to work. It is fast paced and enjoyable. Once I got use to it I only got quicker at my job. The point was to ""Get the customers in and out as quick as possible""; especially since it was a grocery store. The manager was outstanding."
good,A regular day at Ingles primarily consists of being behind a counter helping people ring through their groceries and help with small locational problems. In this job I learned that Customer service is everything and that most of what I knew about how employees work and function is all different when you are the employee. My mangers were amazing and taught me how to aim for the stars. The hardest part of this job is dealing people who are having a hard day. I've learned that if they have a bad day you just give the most positivity and the biggest smile you can to understand what they are going through. The most enjoyable thing about Ingles was working close to all of the management staff.
good,Ingles is very relaxed and fun I liked getting paid weekly and all the managers were nice and helpful. Only time it was stressful was during holidays and snow days
good,"Well balanced. Usually everything ran smoothly. I would punch in, organize my people and get everyone assigned to the job. There were several administrative things to take care of after that. Once that was complete I would join my crew and help them until we were finished."

good,Ingles is a great company to work for. The job is not hard provided that you pay attention and do what you are supposed to do. The coworkers are friendly and provide a fun work atmosphere. I have learned how to correctly handle tough situations with customers and how to provide excellent service.The hardest part of the job is when there is hardly much to do but stand around and clean. I like to be kept constantly busy and some days are so slow there is not much to do but send people home. The most enjoyable part of the job is joking around with customers and making people smile on their really bad days.

The most enjoyable part of my job is talking with the customers, my co-workers are outstandingly amazing."
good,Enjoyed face to face interaction with customers. The most enjoyable time of the job was opening on a sunday morning.
good,"A good place to work. You can request days off in advance and generally get them with advance notice. They try to work with you when you have Dr's appointments or family affairs coming up. They have a book you put your requests in so when the schedule is made out, they just look in the book and see what you need."

good,"Typically a day at work includes you getting there and going straight into your job, you turn on your light and get as many customers as you can. It can be very busy at times, especially around the holidays, but as long as you have a smile on your face, the customers normally does too. With each customer you get, you always try to brighten their day up somehow just by talking to them. I learned how to handle money, how to deal with rude customers and how to how to perform well under stress. The management is great, I loved all of my managers and got close friendships with them."
good,Fast pace and can be stressful during the holidays. I learned a lot and built my pay up because i had so much experience there. I learned stuff i can take other places.
good,It’s a fairly decent place to work. I get about 40-45 hours a week. It’s great. I work deli and make $9.50 an hour. I would definitely recommend this job to others if given the chance to do so.
good,A typical day is getting your cash register stocked and prepared. I learned how to work a register. Management is poor. Workplace is good. The hardest part of the job was trying to find a replacement to use the restroom.
good,The manager currently isn't the greatest but the people and the work load is doable. They pay exceptionally well for a grocery retailer and work with nearly any schedule and days off are rarely declined.
good,this job was very caring when it came to a family member passing away and gave me the time I needed for my uncles funeral and also allowed me time to take off for school work

I enjoyed my two days off they gave me as well. And the days I needed off for the kids doctors appointments they were kind enough to let me off for them as well."
good,This opportunity was pivotal in my decision to become a chef as specifically working with pastries.  The knowledge I was able to gain as a donut fryer was monumental in my growth as an employee at Ingles.
good,Greeting and assisting customers. Its a great place for someone who is starting fresh or is in high school. The most enjoyable time is basically just talking to the customers and getting to know them. My Co-Workers are great we all help each other out at any time someone needs it.

good,"Don’t get me wrong I love my Ingles family. I am a bookkeeper who is full time but I don’t even get paid $11 an hour. I mean getting paid weekly is great but when you’re only making a quarter short of $10, it doesn’t really do anything."
good,"ambiente entretenido educando a niños, celebraciones de cumpleanos, compartir, celebracion de epocas como navidad, halloween, dia de gracias"

good,"The location I was at had a manager that was rarely there and when you ever came to him with a problem or question it was never answered or handled. And if you persistred to get an answer or solutions, he would lessen your hours or give a shift he knew was inconvenient for you. He also did not ever want to talk about raises or listen attentively when employees would ask to learn other tasks to try to advance. Other than the store manager this store is amazing. All the people are one happy family that looks out for each other. They understand what each other goes through because of the lack of help from managerS The store needs a better leader. With better leader, store sales and moral would increase 100%."

The hardest part of the job was trying to find a replacement to work for you the day you call out. The most enjoyable part is when you have happy, satisfied customers."

good,"Ingels is super fast paced depending on your position. Mine was service clerk so I had to bag groceries, clean get buggies etc. So at times, it's really stressful. It overall a good starter job but to be honest it doesn't pay well for the amount of work you have to do. You also get a 30 min break every 4 hours or so which isn't a lot if you're working an 8 hours shift or more. I was pretty much dead and waiting for my break by the time my break was available 4 hours later."
good,I was a cake decorator for 9 years with this company. I always had great bosses to work for. This is my passion and only had encouragement along the way. I wouldn't want to excel in the bakery manager because the benefits are not good.

The management is great about  completing tasks that may cause problems in the future whenever they may come up. My co-workers are fantastic. I love helping people out when they need me and they are also willing to help me if I ever have a question as well.

I attended to the drive through, reception, data entry, and product dispensing station at a fast pace. I love my workplace and coworkers. We help each other at all times.

good,Ingles is all about caring for the customer and helping them in a timely manner. I always had regulars who always came back just to see my smiling face.
good,I loved working at Ingles. I loved being a cashier and dealing with customers. One manager was kind of iffy at times but it was usually when really busy.
good,"management listens well, employees are happy with positions, ability to advance in job is available depending on effort put in. no favorites here. they try to be flexible to fit your work schedule with life, and the pay is good."
good,"Typical day at work is inviting and busy. I learned how to work with others, be organized, and maintain and orderly work environment. Management is fair and observant. Co workers are helpful and encouraging. Hardest part of the job was making customers happy. Most enjoyable part of the job is making customers happy and making their experience good."
good,"Manage, and encourage company through hands on training and motivation by setting the work ethic to grow the employee and  leading by example."
good,Well overall job. would return if i wasnt looking to move on. 9 out of 10 in almost every thing the job asks of you. however im looking to work in a different job market.
good,I learned a lot about how to work with the public. The management was great and there if you needed anything. They worked around my school schedule.
good,"fun enjoyable workplace , always busy with great customers, they always work with your schedule when needed , never get off on time , always either under or over staffed. hours get cut often."
good,"Ingles is a great place to work. The management is really just amazing. They have always worked with me and my schedule, from being a part time associate who was in high school to a full time manager. I learned quite a bit about the grocery business, well actually just business as a whole. I do have to say the best part of my job was being able to talk to the customers throughout the day because they made it interesting. I also learned a lot about how to deal with certain types of people as well as handling different types of situations. The only con that I do have to say is that my schedule was not a set schedule which I do prefer."
good,"Fantastic job with an incredible team of positive-minded associates. As a manager of the entire Frozen Foods department, work was stressful as I only had 2 days of training and had to learn the ropes during Christmas and New Year's season. The hardest part of this job was keeping the front stock high and the back stock low at the same time. It was extremely rewarding to be solely responsible for an entire department of an excellent store. My manager was compassionate but stern and gave me every opportunity to flourish in the work environment."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is, to see all the customers day to day .To come to work and work with some of the best managers and co-workers . if feel like every day at work is never the same and there is never a boring moment , due to helping customers and having such a fun atmosphere to work in ."
good,"A typical day at work is "
good,"I loved working here, it was a great environment. I hated being fired though for something that wasn't my fault."
good,I really loved working for Ingles Pharmacy. They have great managers who are very passionate about thier job. The employees always get along and we all helped one another when we notice a struggle in one area. Working at that particular ingles was like working with family. We would have the same customers year round who enjoyed seeing us. In which we enjoyed seeing them also. The enviroment there is what I miss the most. It was the best job I ever had.
good,"Cook, clean, take phone orders and customers at counter, slice meat and cheese. Make Sandwiches, salads, etc."
good,"Ingles was not only one of the very first jobs I had but it has had the same Manager for as long as I can remember. There is a reason for that.. He has always been a fair, honest, hard working, and would help anyone kind of boss. Most everyone there got along and everyone always helped each other when they needed it. Their are many different diversities, cultures, and it works well with each department.The hardest part was making sure always had something to do. The store was always so clean and stocked it got hard in free time to find things to do. The manager always knew what to say or do and went out of his way to help me and plenty of others. I learned more than just flowers, deli, and cashiering but also being a good manager is key to having great employees with a happy workplace."
good,Great company to work for your coworkers treat like family. We always had each other backs and if u walk in unhappy your are sure to go home with a smile on your face.
good,"Excellent company to work for.  Great pay, family atmosphere, excellent benefits, easy to move up in company if you are willing to work hard.  Highly recommend working for Ingles."
good,"Ingles is a great place to work with pretty good pay. As with any job, there are ups and downs. Very busy grocery store and very stressful at times. The management, at the Ingles where I worked, was very friendly."
good,As long as you show up on time and do your job you will not have a problem. Good management. Promoted after working there 1 week. No employee discount.
good,"Working here was my first job ever so I was a bit nervous about everything such as getting used to the work-life, communicating with a lot of people, and trying to just get my mindset right. The training was nerve-wrecking too because I would feel like I was going to screw something up and upset my trainer. After my days of training, they trusted me to work alone in the bakery and handle things myself which wasn't too bad. All I did was prep donuts, bread, cookies and pastries at night for the morning shift workers to put in the oven. I had only worked the night shift so I don't exactly know what all the morning workers did. I kind of learned how to write on cakes for customers but I wasn't very confident with icing skills."
good,help customers i learned to multi task and help people. management was great. great group of people. the hardest part is standing if your not used to it. loved it
good,I think Ingles is one of the best places I have worked. The management treats their employees very fairly and gives raises as they are deserved. Great dental and vision insurance. Best I have ever invested in.
good,"On average there is so much misleading for this company, there is less training on the position that is applied or there is so much less of the managers that will coop with their employees, also that the slip and resistant policy has been lacked for a while on what potential shoes is correct for any of the positions. On a average day you are position at something that you are good to handle on a bad day you get whatever is open, some is something that is not for training purposes, all positions should be at least trained for 1 to 2 weeks so that the position is known for all employees, if that person isn't there then you should know that position without asking how to locate the things for that position."
good,"Great job for anyone just starting work. Especially for people in high school. They work with your school schedule, help you get more hours on the weekends if needed. Friendly environment."
good,I enjoyed working here.  Had flexible hours and management during my tenure was amazing.  Cross training was encouraged.  I enjoyed working with customers
good,Ingles is a great company to work with. They are easy to talk with and if you do your job you keep it. They are not overbearing as is Wal Mart and Ingles treats their employees respectfully.
good,"Typical days at work included helping coworkers and management maintain the store while providing customer service. I worked here for a long time, and would recommend the company to anyone trying to get a good staring job."
good,"Over all I loved working here. The atmosphere was great. Job duties were simple. There were tasks like cooking chicken (fried and rotisserie), preparing salads, ribs, sandwiches, deviled eggs, pizza and puddings for the coolers. We also had to pop popcorn and fry tortillas into chips, cut meat for customers, price food items, etc. We were also responsible for unloading trucks into the freezer and cooler, keeping our station clean for the next shift, and making biscuits.  The management was the best part of working here. The hardest part of the job is probably memorizing all the prices for the items that were sold. Especially if you work morning and afternoon shifts. Also, it can be a fast paced environment."
good,Working for this company has challenged me to be more open minded about people. It gave me customer service skills and really opens you up and pushes you to do better and be better and give it your all!
good,Ingles is a very decent job. If you are looking for a stable time schedule don't go here lol. Home life and work life didn't mix well with 2  children. However the pay was acceptable for my first time back to work in 5 years. I could say however if you choose to apply here go for something beside the deli.
good,Staff was very helpful in training and also worked with my schedual with my other career and home life..Also had clean work station and overall very satisfied with this company.
good,"A regular Deli job like any grocery store, manager was good and easy to work with. Managers work with your schedule and daily life, It just didnt pay enough."
good,Ingles is and can be a fun place to work. You get to meet different people on a daily basis. You have great coworkers that you can laugh and joke with. The customers can give you a hard time. Learning to book keep was interesting cause I've never done it before. But they made it easy to learn.
good,I do enjoy my job but id like to b able toGinger make more money better benefits n if allowed some over time. Over time is a no no at ingles.I enjoy dealing with customers. The people that work at ingles are nice.
good,"When I was working at Ingles, I had graduated high school and was moving onto college. I wanted to find something that was going to relate to my major, which is Nursing, so I went to an assisted living."
good,"I was a great first job! Gets you really thinking about what you want to do as times goes on, great part time job! Very balanced and everyone pretty friendly, I like working in customer service!"
good,"An excellent company to work for and with. Very enjoyable environment and everyone seemed to have good management skills.I very much enjoyed working there and feel it is a shame when I had to leave. The most difficult part of it was troubleshooting because i was the night manager and while I could fix most problems, it sometimes required me to call someone else for help."
good,"Great experience. Great management. Store was kept well together and clean and orderly. It was a great atmosphere to work in. Unfortunately, it's a low paying job so it's not feasible for a long-term career."
good,started working there during high school 1998-2000. After I graduated from high school I left and went off to college. Overall the company was a great place to work.

good,"learn a lot"
good,I loved the work environment there. I was always given hours to work every week. They were very lenient on me while i was taken classes. I was able to choose the days I wanted to work and days that i could not work. i always counted on them scheduling me at least 20 hours. Very nice management.
good,"Ingle's opened a Starbucks in the store and I was hired with the opening crew. It was exciting starting something new. We had to practice all the drinks and we got to taste what all of tasted like so we could provide our customer with an opinion."
good,"My day included various duties from cashiering, to stocking and ordering for my department, and serving as assistant bookkeeper.  Typically, I was scheduled specific evenings to do bookkeeping work. On those days I worked in the office reconciling tills, providing change for cashiers, attending to customer service, and sending Western Union transfers via computer.  In the Health and Beauty Aids department I weekly ordered all stock and was responsible for stocking product and doing resets.  I also regularly inventoried the department and back stock and saw to the cleanliness of the department. It was my responsibility to assure that adequate back stock was available for all weekly sale items."
good,The management is very good at this location. They truly care about their customers and making them comfortable. The employee's there are very nice and outgoing. They always going above and beyond to care for others. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping my customers and employee's when needed.

They have seminars and functions for the residents in which the staff is always encourage to participate in order to get to know the residents."
good,I can't think of enough good things to say about this place. We had a few bad employees but they were fired. Management is always there to help and there is room to advance in you spot.
good,Easy work no matter how much was on our plate.  Learned how to operate pallet jacks and stack heavy pallets properly along with unloading full trucks every other night.  Management worked directly along side us most of the time and treated us all equally so there was never any looming pressure.  The hardest part of every night was breaking down pallets right off the truck only to restack them piece by piece in their respected isle pallets.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to socialize with co-workers while you worked since third shift can get pretty lonesome.
good,Ingles is a great place too work. The employers care and are always there when you need them. We all work hard together too get the jobs done.
good,"Giving my customers my all. Being able to work hard and follow my standers."

good,"Typical day- Meet new people stock shelves,Run cash register."
good,"I count the drawer and the safe on a regular basis, including all cash registers at the end of the cashiers shift. My managers are great people and very easy to work for. Sometimes customers can be very rude, but the people I work with make my job great!"
good,After leaving Ingles there was nothing but regret my store manager was wonderful to work with. He trained me for every job that I moved into as he did every other associate. All of upper management and corporate office was approachable and friendly. Everyone enjoy their job so well there was no room to move up. That was the reason I left the company and quite frankly the only reason
good,I worked here for four years and it was a great place to work at and I enjoyed it a lot. I only left to better my self and life for my family. Therefore this place was a great place to be at
good,Ingles was a good company to work for.  There is always a chance to advance in the company. The management works well with the employees.   flexible hours are available.
good,"Overnight Stocking for Ingles Markets was a wonderful slow paced job, it wasn't all easy but wasn't always slow paced, day to day work requirements changed due to the size of the truck orders."
good,I enjoy my co workers that I work with and the managers are understanding and helpful when I need it.  typical day at work is waiting for customers to come in and get their groceries so I could check them out at the register ring up their items. give money back if needed. and bag items when needed.
good,The management was unorganized most of the time. They didn't know how to treat or talk to their employees.   It started off to be a good job at first but then sometimes it would spiral off into something being said wrong or somebody being rude.
good,"I love working at Ingles Market.  Have been trained on every area of the Deli Dept, with the exception of Rotisserie Chickens.  Yes, some of it can be hard work - yet, speaking for myself, I love the challenges the job provides.  Hard work does not go unnoticed - even though I don't require a ;pat on the back'.  "
good,You make friends and are able to work in a friendly environment. You get to interact with different people and experience new things. You get to be a smile for someone who was having a bad day.

There was no blueprint or track record for me to go by since I was the first in that job for Ingles.

I made many friends during my 34 years and got along well with my bosses...mainly Mr Ingle.

good,"Good employees, great customers, the feeling of accomplishment when things would be completed. Great communication with management and overhead.  The feeling of leaving work knowing you could trust you're employees to do daily duties required to complete daily task, so that when you come in the next morning you're not having to do what they were supposed to have gotten done.  Just having a good relationship with my employees was important to me."

Schedule is sporadic when new but after a couple years you get your own truck and bid your days. The longer you stay with the company the better the job gets, your seniority actually matters."
good,Ingleside at King Farm was a fun place to work. Everyone is a like a family.  They know how to take of their employees. They had several rewards for the employees.

Other employees all understood that in order to get everything done accordingly, and for the store to be maintained properly, we all needed to work together. The hardest part of the job was leaving it honestly. I had to leave for school relocation, and I definitely missed the family I had there. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I came into work everyday knowing I had other employees to count on, and work hard to achieve the same goal."

good,"They are a great place to work and I really wish I could go back. I knew a lot of great people that worked there and also I knew a lot of customers who came in there. The great thing about Ingles is that you never know who is going to come in there. Also, the people who came in there weren't always from around the location. There was always someone new coming in. Its a great way to get to know other people."

good,Working with the public. Its was enjoyable. There is always good days and bad days. There was so many employees that there was not enough hours to go around. The management was great. It was a worm and welcoming business.
good,I came in every night and clocked in then i began my shift. I proceeded to walk to the back and find out what needed to be done and then i would proceed to begin stocking aisles and making sure i pulled product forward and got rid of old product as well. Then i would sweep and mop the floors by 6am.
good,The management is very rude to employees. Employees hardly got breaks and were overworked. People that didnt deserve promotions got them because they sucked up to the bosses

good,"good first job. very understanding, and lenient they compensate well for the work in all departments. very fair work environment. over all it was an enjoyable experience."

good,"While working at Ingles/Starbucks, I learned a great deal with working with customers and satisfying their needs. The hardest part of the job is like every other job which is adjusting to change.

good,Everyone seems to work well together but the place doesn't pay as well as others while the amount of work is sometimes too much to handle if you do not have enough help.
good,ingles was one of my favorite jobs and one of my first jobs . I absolutely loved working customer service and operating cash register. I enjoyed working as a team with the other employees.
good,I didn't like this job because of how unprofessional it was. I was using the slicer and there was no glove or anything to protect my hand so it I ended up slicing my fingertip off.
good,I started my day at 7 in the morning.  I was responsible for supplying and making numerous food items for a display case and also back up items.  I was busy from when I started till the end of my shift.  I helped other people in different areas when needed.  I enjoyed working by myself.  I knew what needed to be done.

good,Personally Ioved working for Ingles Market. I worked in the Deli and it pays great with excellent hours. If you don't want your night taken up than this is the great job for you. The Deli closes at 9 when you close the latest you'll get out is 9:30 p.m.
good,Good company bad employees and work you hard with little breaks or no breaks. Management needs to be improved not involved in the needs and where help is needed. Customers are the most important enjoyable part of the job. Wouldn't work for the company again.
good,Worked as a pharmacy technician for four years and greatly miss the field. Would love to go back and do it all over again. Pharmacy is fast paced and very efficient.

good,Started off cashiering but ended up as a morning stocker. Stocking is a bit more enjoyable because I'm constantly moving around and having something to do. I work at my own pace which hardly leaves any pressure on me to complete the task given. Everyone is friendly and most are willing to lend a helping hand if needed.
good,"A great company to work for, worked around my child doctors appointments, and cared about their employers, the managers were very professional and  I guess the hardest part of the job would  be working late hours, but they were good about switching employers hours up for every employer"

The people there are very friendly. The managers are really cool people . Everyone really don't like working but the thing is you have to do what you have to do .. ITS a JOB! you gone have responsibilities and you gone have people that's gone have problems.. you have to learn how not to take things personally ..

good,My work place is full of a great atmosphere. All the co-workers come together to strive to have make the best attitudes out of an situation that occurs. Our management makes sure the customers are getting the best service and price. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the public and learning more about our work place each day. I learn how to manage a positive attitude with different type of people with any situation.
good,A typical day as a employee would be come in go to your department and make sure everything is up and go good then I would take orders and start getting them ready. How to deal with the public . the management is great and great to talk to.The employees are great to work with.Not giving a order right. Making new friends everyday
good,"I worked in the video department renting movies. I love movies, so this was a pretty good fit for a part time job. The salary was low, but I did not expect six figures to stand around renting movies. It was something fun to do to pass the time and make a little bit of extra gas money. I learned how to interact with customers. I learned how to treat an angry customer, and how to approach that situation in a calm and calculated manner, but not in a way which would seem offensive. The best part about it was that I could just be myself. The management never really bothered the video department. The video manager is pretty cool, and she would never complain as long as your chores were done right and on time. The hardest part was probably telling someone they had a $50.00 late fee and watching as their children cried because they couldn't watch a movie that night. The most enjoyable would be talking about the movies to customers. We have a huge customer base, and I know a lot of them by name. It's fun to argue and just talk about why each movie was the greatest movie ever made, or completely worthless. There were no politics, and no red tape. Extremely laid back work environment."
good,I loved working there since I wassixteen. i havedone everything there is to do except the meat department they rarely put ladies back there anyway i kind of grew up in a grocery store so i can speak no ill of it
good,"Usual work days are 8-9 hours"
good,Ingles is a very good place to start off at. Hard to move up but its a really good place to work. Very friendly coworkers and it really builds you up working in customer service.
good,A typical day at work consisted of ringing up customers most of the day and renting out movies to customers.My managers were lenient.The most enjoyable part of this job was watching movies on my free time when my section of the store wasn't busy with customers.
good,"Working at Ingles Markets you learn how to interact with customers in a positive way. Although you are not constantly doing something there are chores that need to be done such as cleaning the register, straightening your till or sweeping and dusting. I have learned how to stand on my feet for multiple hours and complete orders that customers need."
good,"I appreciate the fact that you only hire those with experience in the field and your pay is more than acceptable. I served in upper management in retail for over twenty years and dealt with employee theft, loss prevention, and customer theft. I have personally had the experience of validating six million dollars. I also consider myself to have great integrity in any job that that I hold. I was a teenager once and had my fill of fun, but now appreciate the greater things in life knowing that my actions will follow me. I was a great cop and I had a great many Felony thefts. I really enjoyed my job. My wife is a Nurse Practitioner. After five years of my wife asking to move to Georgia to be closer to family, I finally gave in and requested of her to move to Ellijay,GA. away from the traffic and fast pace of life. I never realized there were no jobs up here and even cops started at twelve dollars an hour."
good,"From the managers to the employees, this place provides a wonderful working environment and is customer friendly. We work to not only communicate with our customers, but to build lasting relationships as well."
good,this job was the first job i worked at for starbucks and it was the job that made me realize how much i loved starbucks. it was a good time
good,"A typical day at work depends on how busy we are. The days that we are busy are the days where your moving fast passe. Therefore, on the days we are slow we stand and wait on people to come through our line. The things that I have learned is how to used a cash register properly and how to handle different situations with people. The Co-workers that I work with are great to work with for the most part. There are always going to be people you work with that are not the best people work with, but all you can do is be nice to them. The hardest part of the job is making sure the balance in you're drawer is right because if the balance is short or over you can get written up. If the balance is five or more dollars short or over that's when you get written up, but if it's just a few cents, you won't get written up. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet new people and getting to talk to them. I like meeting new people because everyone is different and different is always good."
good,"Great customer service experience"
good,having to deal with different attitudes and trying to maintain yours also . I love working at Ingles Market . I love working for them but i just needed something full-time
good,I enjoyed cooking each day for customer. Sometime they would asked for special food for next weeks or next day. They would tell you if they liked the food or not. Most of the time they enjoyed what was on menu. Great customer service. Most of the time we served the same people each day. Sometimes customer would tell friends and family about the menu and they would come to eat as well.
good,I loved my job at Ingles. I love the rush of the customers because it made the day go by faster. Especially holiday. My bosses were great and they work really well with your schedule if you're in school or play sports.
good,A typical day would start with checking in the vendors with  Direct Store Deliveries at 5:30 am. Then running the register  until the morning cashiers arrived. Then its off to get my scanning and price verification's done between the other vendors who made deliveries until 11:00 am. Sometimes if things were slow I would help with stocking and cleaning of the front end as well as bathrooms.I learned a lot. In addition to my cashier and scanning duties I also learned how to process payment for the vendors and issue their checks upon delivery. I trained as front end customer manager and learned how to prepare the daily deposits for the MOD. The managers were very hands on and supportive just as my co-workers were. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with my customers since most of them were regular repeat customers from the neighborhood we always had something to talk about.
good,Busy during holidays * Overall great place for beginners to start off
good,The job was good except for the management at the time. My co workers were amazing. They always kept you laughing and on your feet. The most enjoyable part was coming in in the morning and getting things set up for the hoildays

Hoy en día estoy agradecida de haber tomado esa decisión ya que necesito trabajar y los cursos tomados me habilitan para hacerlo.
good,"Chores including: Trash removal, Cleaning Bathrooms, loading and unloading truck, Reclaim, and stocking"
good,"Ingles is a fun fast-paced job. It is good for part-time work for students, or even a job after retirement. The customers are friendly and the co-workers are helpful. The hardest part of the job is the 7am-4pm shifts. However, the most rewarding and enjoyable part of this job is the feeling inside when you complete that 8 or 9 hour shift, possibly even 40 hours a week, and know that you made several people happy that day!"
good,"hardest part of my job is dealing with customers that can be rude and not get their way. I enjoy interacting with my co workers and customers that may or may not be regular customers, but who are friendly and enjoyable to see. ive learned that being a bookkeeper is harder than it looks, it takes time to learn everything and get the basics down. a typical day at work involves interacting with hundreds of customers daily, dealing with thousands of dollars, and being in control of 5 or more people at once."
