rating,review
bad,Terrible place to work.  No team work and employee are not friendly. you are basically on your own if you have an issue.  Not a team environment.  Do not recommend this employer.
bad,"Company provides very bad training and below industry pay, where in the end you will have to end up training yourself while the managers and other fellow employees breathe down your neck. The onboarding process is very stressful! A stress level I have never encountered before in my 20 years in the industry. "
bad,"Do not recommend  , not understanding,  they worry more about the company and not of the workers. Job is meaningful but workers not so much. I wouldn't recommend"
bad,Edwards Lifesciences is a growing company with options to learn and advance your career.  I have learned a lot at Edwards. The company has given me the opportunity to advance my career and product knowledge.
bad,very stressful i dont recommend as a top company it had a lot of poor management needed better people skills towards their employess.. overall not a good job
bad,"there are diversity of people working there but no opportunities for all of them to get promoted, plus senior employees believe they are the owner of the company and they don't help you at least you are ASIA,  yes there is a lot discrimination agains to other culture in terms of team work and management know about it but they ignore because all they care is about productivity and it doesn't matter about issues on the floor,  also if you do not play their games then you are out ."
bad,"College grad was hired for a position I was not experienced in. Manager was NOT helpful. Rather than coaching, the manager would just complain. Expected way too much from me, knowing I was a recent college grad (1 WEEK!). Ended up being laid off after 2 months. 1 Month to get the job then 2 months in, let go! Total BS! Make sure you really find out the department you are working in. If you have a small department and only a handful of co workers, then this is probably going to be an issue!"
bad,Fast past they care more of the quantity of heart valves even when all they rave about is taking the time and to do quality work but will give you a certain amount of time to sew a valve. They will work your hands hard holding this small valve for 6 hours and 30 minutes. Arthritis is a given not including youre seated that whole Time in a hunches over position looking into a microscope. Inhuman place to work and it seems they keep it staffed with Asians because let’s face it they are willing to work through the situation. Clueless management.
bad,I have been working in that company for a year and a half as a temporary employee. Never had any updates on my hiring or never had no one told me how my work ethic was or if i should improve on anything. Overall this companies managementt and the people like supervisors are not very supportive. The do not know how to manage their employees.
bad,"It's a high competitive environment and high target. The company expects you to do way beyond you can do as a newer. There are few bad leaders who don't have the team member. Those leaders just gave the pressure to do work as fast as you can instead of help. When you found mistake and ask them to help, they just passed it and said they thought it would be fine. However, the mistake wasn't right like in procedure. In the meeting, the supervisor would treat temporary and permanence separately, and he or she would keep repeat to make temporary feel not treating well enough. For example, when there was short of work order, the company will send temp people to go home and keep perm people.The temp people could be off 2 to 3 weeks without pay. Last but not least, it took the company extremely long to decide to hire you as a permanence employee. In conclusion, If you need money, you should try extremely hard to get into permanence. Or, if you are lucky when they have a lot of work, you will get hire sooner. Gooood luck."
bad,"I do not like to review companies I have worked for and do not like having to do this while looking for work, I make a point of not talking about the places I worked for"
bad,"Loved my customers and sales team.  It wasn't unusual to work a 21 hour day, nor work weekend trade shows and full time work weeks. During some busy months of the year, expect to work a month without a day off.  People are too intimidated to tell management how they really feel - as there are repercussions . Stock plan is nice, and a benefit of sticking it out.  Very few women in leadership positions, and women are often paid less than their inexperienced younger male employees.  Older workers are also forced to retire."
bad,"I have worked here for several years.  I am a highly productive employee.  Unfortunately, promotions at Edwards are nonexistent.  They have chosen people they will promote almost continuously, while others are completely overlooked.  The work hours are unsustainable, plan on 70 hour work weeks as the norm.  Very unfortunate and disappointing."
bad,"Well if your idea of a fun working environment is an unspoken Game of Thrones political culture and unlimited working hours, then EW is for you!  For every decent director, there are 9 others who are more interested in their own career advancement and think nothing of throwing people under the bus.  I can only comment on their corporate headquarters in Irvine."
bad,"The company makes great products and is successful. The personalities I dealt with in management were closed minded. However, most people seem to like it since there is little turnover."
bad,"You are given little training and the rest is a ""learn as you go"" process. This includes being told information that may contradict what you've been taught. You are not at liberty to edit documents and are sternly warned by your superiors if you do."
bad,Terrible place to work. Management is clueless. There is no strategy or planning. The company still acts as if it is a little shop.It is not. No coordination between global sites. People jump over each other to get promotions.Communication between management and employees is nonexistent.
bad,"I have tried resolving this amiably by emailing all personnel up the chain (including the CEO himself), but the lack of a response leaves me no choice but to make this post."
bad,Pay is comparable to other industries however there is no promotional opportunity within the organization. all second level management is done from the outside.  There is little to no culture and morale is not great
bad,"Tive a grande oportunidade de receber treinamento sobre cirurgias cardiacas numa escola de medicina em Phoenix, AZ. Tivemos aulas teoricas e de anatomia com colegas do mundo inteiro. "
bad,"As a contractor or temp employee, people in the culture treated you differently.  Is hard to get a permanently role.  No motivation from Manager.  Often time has to do your own research and solve things on your own.  By doing team work, permanently employees don't communicate well with temporary workers, and often get misleading information when solving problems."
bad,new regime of managers/supervisors are highly ambitious and lowly experienced. They would sell their grandparents if it meant advancement. General management is tasked with down-sizing - while builder highly paid director positions.
bad,"While I enjoyed the people I worked with there, Edwards LifeSciences' manufacturing employees are often stressed out to their physical limits and beyond.  Edwards management continues to push the heart valve assembler workers to be more efficient to the point where they receive injuries to their hands, wrists, arms, shoulders, and back pain.  Most of heart valve assemblers are older Vietnamese, Cambodians and Hispanic who are new to this country, lack formal education, ignorant of worker's rights, are often afraid to report of pain they have acquired due to work overload.  There are stories where an assembler hurt herself so bad where she couldn't lift up her shoulder.  Only then will she report her pain.  Heart valve assemblers should not be treated like a modern day slave by a so called ""world class company"" such as Edwards LifeSciences."
bad,There code is a mess (not up to date with best practices) and documentation was indecipherable. Very difficult work conditions. Tons of code was written in the code-behind files; MVVM was never implemented.
bad,"A empresa já foi muito boa, com um excelente ambiente, no entanto, após a troca de gestão, houveram alterações de cargos e vagas beneficiando conhecidos e amigos da gestão atual (VP)."
bad,"computer work"
good,It all depends on the department and manager.  This can be a great place to work that promotes innovation or some place where team work and innovation don't matter.  Pay was below par and advancement unlikely.
good,"Need to improve management control "
good,"Great company with an amazing cause.  Please hire new leaders who will push for life/work balance, better compensation, diversity, new ideas and creativity- REMOTE work would be a HUGE PLUS."
good,"The Critical Care group, GUI team, suffers from a lack of direction. There is a great amount of micro-management, keeping track of the times you are away from your desk. But they don't seem to know what we are working on."
good,"Good place to learn new technologies and advance in career, but no work life balance. Always, the management demands to work for 60-70 hrs per week. Unrealistic timelines, improper planning and no respect for the resources."
good,This job is just like any other medical assembly company. You work a lot of hours for little pay and are required to work a high amount of mandatory overtime.
good,It's a good place to work and interact with many different people everyday. There is a cafeteria on-site which makes it easy to get lunch. Co-workers are readily available to help brain storm. Working in teams was a big part of my job there.
good,"My co-workers are really nice to work with. But it is the same anywhere. They can't get people with experience to come and work for them. The majority of the work force is resent college grads. No experience, etc. Management pressing these kids like crazy, 10, 12 hours day. Management style is toxic. Bad energy all around."
good,"The legal department was undergoing changes, and coping with the changing markets."
good,"Maximum work hours expected daily to be worked to accomplish multiple assigned responsibilities.  Workload is too much for one individual but, it is expected and the norm."
good,"Enjoyed going to work, I like to keep busy and at Edwards there was"
good,"Edwards is a very dynamic company.  Products are interesting, important, and life-saving. This company is a good choice for individuals who are equally driven and willing to put it long hours and weekends for long periods of time to meet company goals. High performers are rewarded."
good,"Nice life saving products"
good,"Lots of meeting for wasting time, absence of focus."
good,"Nice place to work. They has central park, Gym, 7 buildings for employee - Sometimes they have visitors come in, they have a meeting halls for visitors. It's not bad to work there."
good,"Multiple managers over duration of employment; Too many chiefs, poor communications between departments; changes were made to processes and procedures without involvement of key personnel which caused workflow to suffer and lack of trust between field and in-house personnel - managers in place with lack of knowledge of what staff's roles, daily tasks and time factor involvement resulting in unrealistic deadlines. Focus tends to be too much on a person's scholastic background rather than whether a person is a good fit and can perform the job successfully. Not much room for career growth unless you transfer to another dept. Difficulties with obtaining work/life balance throughout departments causing employee burn out; Overall company is an excellent company and same goes for quality of products.  Benefits are excellent."
good,"Good people, weak backbone management.  I went through seven managers before I left due to incompetent management.  I hope they have improved."
good,"A typical day is usually spent in meetings. I've learned that the ability to influence is key. The management is average, the company values going with the flow rather than true talent and capabilities. If you are good at following orders rather than doing what makes sense, given enough time you will move up. Some coworkers are great some are not. There is a good sense of community, however career progression is not very forgiving if you are the type that would like to move up given capabilities."
good,"Great benefits"
good,"Time counting step to step for every product, so it makes me stress. The senior workers are not friendly. They usually take the easy steps of the line for them and leave the harder steps for the new ones."
good,"I worked as a sewer at Edwards and it was fun and like a family environment with mostly Vietnamese and Cambodian co workers. Supervisor is also asian and so are team leaders. If you dont mind these, then this is a good place to work but, if you want to last more than a year try to apply direct to the company and not go through their agency which is ULTIMATE STAFFING.  This is agency is a another review."
good,"Easy going work flow "
good,"good location of the premises, good work environment, modern office, good IT support, HR offers a good onboarding period with trainings and meetings, good induction day."
good,Great place to work in.  Deadlines are tight and management have very high expectations. Pressurized environment but stimulating providing room  for growth.
good,Very strict about attendance; will work you to the bone with overtime; was an interesting experience but working on tiny devices under a microscope is not for everyone. Not a bad job if you can stand it as the benefits and salary+overtime are great.
good,"High tech company with great life saving products, offer above market salary. However the money does not attract the right people working there - walk in the office you feel like you working for a warehouse/factory in Sydney's west -  radios on with annoying ""music"" in different corners of the office, very revealing dress on some female staff. The whole environment is totally UNPROFESSIONAL."
good,"This was the first medical company I worked for it was exciting at first to learn all the processes and rules that have to be followed making these medical equipment. I enjoyed my coworkers I feel on the line that I worked I was lucky to have the lead that we had. She would keep our group close and would suport what we had to say to our supervisor about our thoughts to improve the way we bulit things. The training was good, it was nice knowing how everything was made world wide. Unfortunatly the pay wasnt good and our supervisor was very one sided. The engineers were great and very hands on which I loved. I ultimately ended leaving dissatisfied with the pay, and we worked in one station for ten hours standing in one spot. Which  may seem silly but standing in one spot for ten hours takes a toll on the body."
good,"Edwards (as a whole) gives to the community so it is a good place to work. Once parking issues are resolved, there will be less stress.  Great Benefits."
good,High energy and demanding but overall a great place to work. Highly recommend for a young professional looking to get excellent experience. The company really invests in it's employees
good,It was a wonderful learning journey . Full respect to all of the seniors and assistants . They are very friendly and hardworking too . Company system up to standard
good,"Nice environment to work "
good,"Productive work place with right management. Its and enjoyable place to work. I've learned a lot about team work. A lot of employee turn around, needs better organization."
good,"A typical day will begin with a daily review of quality system update meeting with  area manager or supervisor."
good,Edwards gives great benefits but unfortunately its the only reason I continue working here
good,"Great historical valve business that brought leading innovations in pericardial replacement valves and mitral rings, but recent management seems challenged to bringing new technologies to market in a timely manner.  Transcatheter valve business seems to be doing well."
good,Its fun working there great. People but there are times when empolyees get treated like low class an high class no fair equal share someworkers get treated with no respect
good,"Edwards Lifesciences is the global leader in patient-focused medical innovations for structural heart disease, as well as critical care and surgical monitoring. Driven by a passion to help patients, the company collaborates with the world’s leading clinicians and researchers to address unmet healthcare needs, working to improve patient outcomes and enhance lives."
good,"Typical day at work is working all day and some department are not involve in the corporation activities."
good,"A lot of training in the company,  many activities and sports like a gym, volleyball, basketball.  Good balance family-work.  A little hard to advance in your career."
good,"One of the best companies I have worked for until a new director was hired. Changed the culture of the department and instead of being a happy place, now people feel like they're walking on eggshells. Not conducive to anything positive. This director wants robots to be programmed to be whatever this director wants. Not human beings with feelings and emotions. Too bad because the CFO is such a fantastic human being but the company has grown so much, he must not be aware of what is going within the company."
good,"Company with great innovative products with innovation in its mindset, unfortunately also quite disorganized, and political."
good,"Consistently have new management - from plant manager, to Sr Directors.  Have had 4 managers in 2 years, makes it difficult for promotional consideration"
good,"Great team environment, great technology, product-wise."
good,Company has been sold to a much larger company with a few top people getting golden handshakes but the facility is likely to be closed soon. Many fun company functions such as picnics and fundraisers
good,Training and support were lacking.  Lots of market development focused events.  Management support is lacking.  Clearly the market leader in the space.
good,"Its ok but the hours are long and the pay is not what I was expecting from a big corporation as Edwards but someway somehow, I enjoy driving for them."
good,"It is nice place to work with. It is hard from the begging but after you understand it is ok .  I love to work my teamwork, and pay good . It have a nice view ."
good,"I have some friends are working in Edwards. Based on their info's, this is a good company to work with, friendly and treat employees well. Good benefits."
good,"Leider löst sich der Standort Horw auf. Es war eine gute Zeit in meinem Leben. "
good,"The company compensates the employees with good benefits and fairly salaries. However, it is hard to get to move forward. The sense of moving forward in our working lives is important. It motivates and inspires me. In a busy work environment like Edwards Lifesciences, I expect that I can move up to experience more achievements and abilities. Those chances are happened all the time in here, but I wait so long to claim up. I hope they can understand my thoughts."
good,"I worked at Edwards for 26 and a half years.  Most of the experience was very positive.  The company always had a lot of internal politics going on and bickering between levels of management, product lines, and the satellite plants.  I was immune to it until my manager of 22 years retired.  Its a great place to work if you have a good manager.  But when you get on in years there, and getting close to retirement, they take a heavy handed approach to getting rid of people.  If you happen to work for a good manager, your experience will be a positive one.  The problem is that there are a lot of bad managers there who are career climbing and creating empires for themselves.  They don't care who they hurt financially.  Good luck!  The CEO is great, but didn't do me any good at the end."
good,"This is a wonderful company that offers many benefits for its employees. The base compensation is almost too low to accommodate living in the area though, so expect a mid-long commute. The CEO is an amazing role-model + often eats lunch in the main cafeteria with everyone. I do love this company but I wish they really valued my graduate-level education whether the job I do requires it or not."
good,"Edwards maintains a positive environment for it's employees, offering classes and programs for improving health and wellness."
good,"Concise management, clear and rational expectations, and very cerebral."
good,"Exiting product line. Results-oriented, relationship-driven culture."
good,Lots of pressures to deliver KOD's. You are expected to bring laptops & work from home. Frequent restructuring from top to bottom. The management are clueless: promoting non-deserving ppl & demoting / laying off those valuable employees. Not uncommon that you have 3 bosses in 1 year.
good,"hard job, constantly changing enviorement, lot of stress, very difficult culture employees to manage, a very fisically demanding place,Ilearned how to mange, guide, help, trained and treat very difficult people."
good,"Good benefits"
good,"Most departments work 4 10's, with the administration working 8 hour shifts. The managment does a good job of assigning tasks and giving resources to finish things. It is nice to work in an industry that is helping patients live longer and add quality to their lives. The best part of the job is hosting patient tours and wathing patient interviews."
good,"Foi uma empresa onde eu aprendia a cada dia que eu passava. Tinha um bom relacionamento com a minha gerência e com os meus colegas de trabalho, só me arrependo de ter misturado um pouco a vida pessoal com a profissional, mais isso foi uma coisa que eu aprendi. A parte mais difícil era o contato com os médicos, porque muitas vezes eles eram grossos. E a parte mais agradável era receber elogios por um bom trabalho."
good,"i learn how to run macine with care , and QA jobs , and to inspect the product to make sure the spring is machs the WO requirment"
good,Good stepping stone stone to create a career in the field of data analysis. Great place to start a career if you are looking for a challenging mathematical job.
good,Our sponsor was very cooperative and offered good guidance. Would have saved time if there was a better connection between the market audience and us as mechanical designers
good,"Although the company mission is noble, the projects handled encounter difficulties in communication, especially the dis-connect between USA and Europe groups. Manager is not very supportive of actions when it concerns the Europe group and lack of career advancement structure. On the plus side, many projects to deal with and are fun to complete them; however, your may not be given credit to the work you have done. Again, it highly depends on who you work with on a particular project to lead to positive outcomes. Recognition of your good work depends also on who you worked with."
good,"This a great place to work that has wonderful benefits.  There are many people that work here that a very approachable and are willing to help mentor and develop others. There are great educational benefits as well. Many options offered to employees with jobs, cafeteria, gym, etc."
good,"During my employment here I truly learned what hard work meant and what it felt like. We were structured and functioned like a well oiled machine, almost as structured as a military base, we followed all kinds of rules and regulations. We understood exactly what was expected of us everyday and got to be like little scientists and whos doesn't want to dress up and play with all kinds of cool laboratory equipment? Overall this place is an amazing company to work for and im glad I got to be a part of it"
good,"My previous company is an excellant company which i obtained job satisfaction from the job itself as i was involved in all aspects of the accounting function from GL to AP, from closing of month end and year end accounts, to internal and external auditing to treasury function."
good,I worked here as a temp. Typical day would start with pulling patient files to be typed into the computer system. I worked in a small department that was mixed in with other departments. Nice co-works and management.
good,Good company but too many temps. Great cafe. Flexible working - good work/life balance. Lots of on site events. Company stock doing well. Good product pipeline.
good,"Edwards Lifesciences is a very good stable company but you need to ask from the beginning the salary or income that you think you deserve. There’s no career advancement in our department. If you start in an entry level or fresh graduate then maybe you can stay all your career life with the company. People stay until their retirement age because that’s their first job and learn d from there. But if you’re an experienced, skilled and knowledgeable in your expertise. You need to asked in advanced the income you deserve in the next five (5) years"
good,"Edward Good company, good culture, Good work"
good,"Medical device manufacturing company with major operations in Draper, UT.  Multiple divisions utilizing clean room manufacturing facilities and distribution to US and limited global customers."
good,"I do daily meeting with my team (Scrum Board Meeting) to understand projects status, roadblocks and help required."
good,"Typical day at work is relaxed and productive."
good,"The pay is above average for my job title. The work environment is casual. Average benefits. It's very political when it comes to career advancements. Overall, it's a good company to work for."
good,Probably the best and nicest people I have worked with.  People were very driven to complete projects by the end of the year.  Some of the business line people that I worked with were technologically savvy which made the project much easier to compete on time and within budget.
good,"Good management and people and challenging work options.  Work/life balance for some - productivity expectations are high, but accomplishment is recognized and rewarded. If you like what you do and are good at it, you will enjoy working there."
good,"Great benefits with potential to grow depending on role!! Have cafe, gym, volleyball, basketball, bocce ball, soccer field and foosball on site! Edwards has a great future ahead of them. If you love a fast paced environment and enjoy challenges, this is the place for you."
good,"I loved the people I worked with, my uppers were helpful and easy going. But I felt like I barely learned anything working there. I felt stuck in the same spot the entire time. Also, I didn't like having to stand all day for 8 hours or more. I feel like no one should have to stand up for that long."
good,"Great company, people oriented but work life balance is tough. The Manufacturing areas work a lot of overtime and 2nd shift is hard to participate in family activities."
good,awesome place that is always hiring and you can move up the ladder if you put your mind to it. monitored bathroom breaks suck
good,"Solid, Nice, Aerospace Supply company, Typical on the job training type job. You would have to put in work to be able to be get paid. EXPERIENCE EXPERIENCE EXPERIEINCE !!!!!! get some yall !"
good,"Great company overall, your time at Edwards depends on your management. Management is mostly old and have only worked at Edwards therefore, management can be unfair and get away many unethical practices."
good,"Edwards is a innovated cutting edge technology company."
good,"Edwards (Formerly Baxter Healthcare) does its best to foster an environment of personal growth, work/life balance, health and wellness, and to ""act like an owner"", but some of that feeling has been lost over the past 5 years or so; whether it was the explosion of the Trans-catheter Heart Valve business, or the influx of recent college graduates with an ""entitlement"" complex, the company has grown quickly, but that might not have been the best for the culture.  It felt like the management had lost touch a bit with what made the core values so easy to buy in to when the company first split from Baxter, and rewards and advancement seem to favor the newer staff, while the ""originals"" are often left behind, without a true voice.  I loved my time there, and thought I'd retire from Edwards, but when new management came in my area and cleaned house, I eventually felt completely demoralized by their actions, and I lost all sense of accomplishment.  My decision to leave was a difficult one, but necessary to preserve my integrity and work ethic."
good,"The comapny makes heart valves and patient monitoring systems. You may work in IT but your work is a component of the process that delivers life-saving technology for prople that otherwise, would have no hope. You would be amazed at how many people are alive today thanks to this comany and it's dedicated workers."
good,"Edwards Lifesciences is a family-friendly work place.  Their products are made to save human life.  Also, you maybe have a chance to meet real patients who are invited to visit the site once a year."
good,This is a great place to work. They are very demanding in what they want because everything you do leads directly to the mission statement. Very few companies actually abide to their mission as much as Edwards.
good,"An everyday day to day basis where you enter a clean room wash your hands put on hair nets gowns and booties enter the production room to your line of assembly and work together with 5 or more people. Each line has a lead to double check and correct any mistakes before finished products are passed on to QC. Sat down for all working hours, twice a week someone comes in for 5 minutes and have groups of us get up to do some hand and arm exercises."
good,"Uses tools to sew a stent and/or valve"
good,Edwards in all is a really great place to work that goes out of their way to put employees first. It would be nice if they had less bias on having or hiring supervisors that have engineering degrees.
good,"Assembly work is somewhat strenuous, but starting salary for temp employees is very fair, and as soon as you are certified it increases significantly. For the most part, management is friendly and easy to work with, but intermediate parties such as team leads or supervisors are a mixed bag."
good,Very busy and fast paced.  At times work-life balance is difficult but good atmosphere to work.  Co-workers are very nice to get along with.  Good place to gain new experience.
good,"I am a temporary employee, I do not a lot to say about the company but I would like to say Edwards is a good company to work for."
good,Good work life balance depending on the department. Corporate Accounting area is heavier on month/quarter end. Advancement within the finance organization structure is flat so there are not many opportunities for vertical growth. Usually all lateral moves.
good,Working for a medical device company makes for an exciting career.
good,"I have a variety of responsibilities as a Sr. Financial Analyst in the Human Resources Dpt. at Edwards Lifesciences. I am responsible for developing, managing, and reporting on several different HR budgets as well as the US and Puerto Rico fringe benefits budgets. I also oversee many form 5500 filings annually. I assist with annual insurance renewals including pricing some of our self administered medical plans and doing various reporting and analysis on the claims experience for those plans. I prepare severance calculations as needed. I also do weekly audit and handle the funding for the US 401k employee accounts. Among my other duties is managing the company award program, and preparing analysis and reporting on our employees designated as ""High Potential"". I have several other responsibilties and I'm involved with a wide range of job tasks in my role. I've learned a great deal in managing the duties mentioned above and have developed a broad understanding of much of what a high functioning HR department can do."
good,"the Atmosphere and the people there are great. the company has great benefits. It takes care of its employees."
good,Good and growing company to work with. Innovative products catering to wider spectrum of patients. Managerial changes affect how business is run on day to day basis
good,Good Company to work for. Very Forward thinking. Promotes almost strictly within the company. Very rapid advancement is possible in the first few years of employment.
good,"I had a lot of fun, pleasure But also challenges working for Edwards. When hired in 2006 my mission has been to design and create our Customer Service Dept. "
good,"- High growth company"
good,"This job would have been great if not for my health issues and the hour-long commute. The shift can be strenuous, 10 1/2 hours Monday through Thursday, with occasional overtime opportunities."
good,The products that edwards makes are great and very helpful to those who need to product.  Working for edwards was great meaningful work.  I would have stayed there if I could have made more money.
good,"I like my job now at Edwards Lifesciences. the first thing is i get a high wage, then i learn a lot when i work here. In line at clean room, i work with good team. They help each other sometime."
good,"Faily paid but stressfull. A lot of hour working. There is good lunches, transportation, a good healthcare. People are competitive and they are very capable."
good,"Great cafeteria, fun employees. I enjoyed what I did there and was good at it. I really enjoyed the leads because they made everything easy to understand"
good,I am a Temp with Ultimate Staffing with Edward LifeSciences and really the NEGATIVES are that there seems to be miscommunication and not enjoyable work.
good,very rewarding career and exciting to work for an innovative company. I am passionate about cardiovascular health as were my teammates and leadership.
good,"Great place, deep pipe line, innovative, progressive. Leaders in technology, will spend money to acquire new technologies. The draw was that HVT representatives were not allowed to interview for TAVR."
good,A company able to work together through extremely stressful times and pull things together to meet extremely tight deadlines from external sources.  A place that was a lot of fun to work.
good,"I've been working at Edwards for just about 2 years now and I totally cherish it. The people, culture, management and work/life balance are all extraordinary.I'm continually tested by the work, which has helped me learn and develop so rapidly. Management additionally makes you have an inclination that your opinion and input really matters, and will place it into practice. Growth opportunities here are tremendous, and management is continually ready to help work with you to help accomplish your profession objectives.What astonishes me about this organization is that they are exceptionally centered around individual development.Managers are continually ensuring we see a splendid future at Edwards."
good,"Edwards is a great place to work at. There is a positive culture there and there is plenty of opportunities for advancement,"
good,Edwards life sciences is good company. the company's systems are good.
good,great place to work but it was a temporary job. there was just not enough job to keep the employees.
good,"Setting up meetings, processing POs, paying and tracking invoices, purchased PCs for company, monthly consolidation of credit cards."
good,"There is very good, secure environment and relaxing atmosphere here. There are gym room and big cafeteria. Besides that, it takes too long to hire as permanent employees"
good,"Only downside to this job is the 10 hours a day work schedule starting at 5am and OT on weekends. This is not helpful if you have young children or kids in school or if you are in school. Other than that it's an amazing place to work, including: the medical/dental/401K/stock benefits, fitness center, cafeteria, annual bonuses, generous PTO, advancement opportunities and awesome co-workers!!"
good,"I'm working at Edwards Lifescience (EL) in production line as sewer for sewing heart valve. We work at very early hours from 4:30 to 1:00 pm. Typically, we sit down and sewing a valve steps by steps, it sounds easy but it doesn't as we think. Sewing requires technique and experience to make a beautiful non-mistake successful valve. I love this job because it is very challenging, it makes you have to think carefully every stitches you sew until you figure the way for the valve to look smooth and pass all the tests after made. One mistake and the whole valve is scrapped, it requires great responsibility and focus in this job. I also love to exchange ideas, problems and sharing my experience with my teammates, team leader and supervisor to learn from each other to avoid problems. I think the hardest thing in this job is teamwork, if all team members do not follow procedures or schedules, then the outcomes of target goals cannot be reached. However, due to my allergic to chemicals, I decide to change the job because it affects my health greatly. Moreover, I want to focus on my career in Marketing, that is why I think it is time to look for another job that can help me gaining more experience in what I desire to do."
