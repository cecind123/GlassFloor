rating,review
bad,"This company was a great company to work for, now is just a shell of what it used to be. They outsource the few field technicians and others position just to save a buck. Shame."
bad,You never knew what was going on. There was no direction given to employees. I was dropped into software I had no idea how to use (nothing was said about it in the interview). A small group of new hires had to learn it on our own. I have an accounting background and was hired into a software testing cycle. Don't expect any help from the seasoned employees. The culture is cut throat.
bad,What we was discussed at the interview and what the job actually was were two completely different items. Nice coworkers but the company did not have a well thought plan
bad,"The organization is on it's way down.  Don't apply for any positions unless you have a backup plan.  The culture is non-existent.  Constant turmoil, not good."
bad,company culture and attitude has decreased tremendously with all the lay offs and changes in the company strategy.  There is no confidence the company will be sustainable - HR does not care about employees they only care about saving money.
bad,"I am honestly surprised that this...""company""...is still in business."
bad,CBRE' Alliance Director does not have a clue what he is doing!
bad,"Used to be a good company, but it has not been well managed so it has been going down and people concerning about their future are leaving. They always follow, never invest to innovate."
bad,"The good old boy's club is alive and well at Lexmark. If you are a male engineer, you will do just fine. Otherwise, I suggest you steer clear. Managers don't know how to manage."
bad,"Worked there for 15 years and was great company from 1998-2006, when incompetent management and constant reorgs/layoff began."
bad,"Many cliques, bully managers, and lifer employees that may or may not collaborate depending on the politics of the situation.  Hope new Chinese ownership will clean up and show them the light."
bad,"hire - layoff principles, no stability, no US-owned anymore. "
bad,"When I worked there, the situation was starting to become bad and my position was eliminated along with 20% of the workforce when the economy was still struggling and people weren't buying printers.  I know enough people that still work there to know that if anything, the morale is even worse today.  There have been many more rounds of layoffs and a lot of attrition, which is not being backfilled.  Not sure if the Chinese owners really plan to keep development in the USA long term or not, but it's clear they're happy to let the workforce continue to dwindle."
bad,"Low pay, very unorganized.  More politics then one should ever have to deal with in any company."
bad,"Zero development, zero career prospects, old boys club mentality, rub shoulders with the wrong people and you are dead in the water. Ask for training and movement within the company and it falls on death ears...."
bad,Lexmark would layoff employees every year after the Company was formed.
bad,I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. Previous CFO who became CEO was a joke. Kept many of old leadership and promoted many because they were friends of his. Existing mgt simply needs to be fired and new competent individual put in their place.
bad,The company had no forward-thinking plans.  Everything was done the way it had been done forever.  Many of the employees were afraid to say what was on their minds.  It stifled everyone.
bad,The environment is quite unstable both the organization and culture.
bad,"The company may not be the best to work for because of the industry that is in, but the people are really good.  While a lot of people have been here for 20 years there is a lot of good knowledge.  The down side is that all they know is the Lexmark way and are not always open to an outsiders point of view.  Managers do not manage and do more of watching out for themselves and there is no career advancement in the IT area."
bad,"Lexmark, while a good stepping stone for me to other companies, did not do a lot for me in the way of career growth and opportunity. I was given practically no introduction to their frankly massive and incredibly messy codebase and was told to just have at it. "
bad,"We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."
bad,"Never received any education related to new software components (i.e. introduction to Oracle or SQL db management....)"
bad,"As I stated in the opening line, I am not sure that this review will help as I have not worked there for a few years.  Overall it was not a bad place to work when I was there."
bad,"excellent local team - culture collaborative"
bad,I was told I can work with Cisco switches and Routers after my first year and I found out they have contractors doing that not Lexmark people. .......
bad,Lexmark has a lot of things going for it as far as the products they produce. Where they mess up is in the management and structure. The employees held their breath each Friday to see if they got canned.
bad,poco desarrollo personal y dificil de ascender de posicion
bad,No comments. This was a temporary job and the working enviroment was very boring with a lot of untrained people.
bad,"Work is interesting and challenging.  However, numerous changes over the years have created culture of uncertainty.  Significant turnover in executive management over the last few years.  Good pay with reasonable benefits."
bad,money is good but you cant advance unless you are a friend or relative of the manager or supervise. unsafe working conditions and lazy supervise and coworkers
bad,Their financial problems have led to large layoffs amongst staff. I'm not sure they had any real plan for the companies they acquired and so mismanaged their decisions regarding them.
bad,Typical workday includes hundreds of emails where everyone needs results and you can only get to 20 or so emails before you realized you've worked 12 hours or more.  It starts all over again your very next day which does not provide any feeling of accomplishment.
bad,"the First month was interesting seeing how the equipment and product was put together but it soon became mundane and robot like. Working harder and faster produced no rewards and I soon came to realize there was no room for advancement and was strictly a number.  The long hour day however did provide for enjoyable weekend with money to spare "
bad,"My experience with this company is not a positive one.  The culture is ""old IBM"" (which created the Lexmark brand).   They have little or no data required to run a business.  They want to retain customer maintenance contracts.  However, most of their equipment is sold through a channel that sells their maintenance contracts.  As such, they can't even tell  you where the customers are and where the equipment is placed."
bad,La direcci√≥n gerencia mantiene una tendencia de favoritismo en el proceso de promociones internas y externas.
bad,"Worked at this company from it's inception as a leveraged buyout spinoff from the IBM Office Products Divsion until my retirement Dec 31, 2014."
bad,Mismanagement has caused the culture to change. Drastic downsizing has become the norm and a constant stress . More contract jobs and less full time employees.  At one time it was one of the best employers in Lexington and employees were valued. When the company changed CEO's they went in a new direction and started the decline.
bad,Things keep getting worse unfortunately.  It seems we just cannot catch a break.  Management has been rotating like a revolving door.  So the strategy and focus do as well.  We change too much and stay focused on everything at all times and won't change our bad habits.  Systems are a huge hold back as well they are so choppy and put together.
bad,Work environment is good. There is no clear goal about professional growth. Co-workers are good how ever there is a politics observe for older employee.
bad,"Management is only concerned about cost reductions and can not see past the quarter-point, but the work atmosphere is good.  The executive team is clearly disconnected from the workforce and the market."
bad,"The bulk of upper management is from the IBM days. They still try to run the company as if it were one of the largest in the world, instead of a bit player of decreasing size and importance. If you have a job, the compensation is high for the area."
bad,This was during the early years of my career.  It was my first exposure to the sales world.  It provided me training to market and sell printers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with different types of companies and organizations.
bad,typical day was answering tier three phone questions for customers. This was boring as crud. I would never do it again. Company sucked
bad,"Was good for a long time, but after you turn 50 there is a huge lay off target on your back.  Upper management doesn't acknowledge you as a person.  They make no eye contact even if you have worked with or for them previously.  It's like ""never look the regular employees in the eyes, they may bite""."
bad,"Lexmark should focus on performance improvement rather than cost reductions through continuous ""restructuring."""
bad,productive company to work for.  Would recommend to a friend.
good,"Do not accept a job as a contractor at Lexmark. Only accept a full time position if one is offered."
good,"After graduating with my MBA, Lexmark offered an exceptional start to my career. I worked with talented people. The environment is the downsize. Most people don't leave simply because they feel trapped."
good,Lexmarks compensation plan is top notch but the culture has gone from working toward goals as a team to what have you done for me lately.
good,"Many good people, but terrible higher level management.  Actively practiced age discrimination.  Good pay and benefits, but no security.  Would not recommend working there without a binding contract.  Can't be trusted."
good,"A typical day at work is you have to talked to Americans which are mostly rude and they think they are previleged but I am able to pushed through everyday. I learned about printers. Workplaced was old and dirty. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the manager. The most enjoyable part of the job was as a team, we have a goal to shut the mouth of our manager by our performance. At the end, the whole department was released by the company."
good,"We did have enough time to get a small cup of coffee before we got started.learning to assemble the drawer was interesting because it had so many small pieces that the people in the line each put in a certain amount of parts to complete it."
good,Company develops some excellent technology but mergers have had a negative impact on moral. No clear message from management on direction of company. Management does not always rely on marketing feedback when determining which products to promote but rather relies on management's preference and which Board of Directors management may be associated. Promotions and raises can be hard to come by and evaluating employee performance is slanted.
good,"I enjoy the people and the work, for the most part.  There are plenty of opportunities to learn new things.  The people are great to work with as long as you don't talk about the company.  It quickly goes down the rabbit hole of, ""how much longer will we have the job""  The job is also very flexible."
good,"Worked 12 hours , operating a Neumag extrusion fiber line. "
good,"The title sums it up. Developers and management refused to implement my deliverables. I felt like I was never listened to. Several of my team members were kept as contingent workers for years. Layoffs occur every year or two and many hardworking employees are laid off, often with little notice."
good,"The company is still figuring itself out with new CEO and new initiatives. Work cadence is either very busy or very slow. A lot of good staff to work with and most managers are generally easy to work with. However, advancement is not readily available since there isn't much growth and all senior staff or managers are protective of their stature.  Advancement generally can happen when someone leaves the company"
good,Would not recommend working there. Very stressful environment. HR was terrible. Management was always critical and never complimentary even after you achieved success. I would not recommend any friends or family to work there.
good,"Engineering management generally has little respect for people.  "
good,"sem divulga√ß√£o de vagas internas, sem plano de carreira, sem feedbacks do gerente , falta de integra√ß√£o com as areas da empresa"
good,"Always concerned about job security. Projects were constantly being off-shored. Once project off-shored, opportunities for other projects were not always evident."
good,Faltava cultura de software na empresa.muito focada na venda de paginas.
good,Too many ups and downs on company direction.  Company eventually sold and continues the 10+ year effort of personnel reductions. Little to no job security.
good,"Undergoing changes since being purchased by a Chinese company."
good,"Overall a good place to work and learn a variety of new skills.  Flexible and for the most part pleasant work environment.  Very good benefits.  But the meetings and extra curricular 'activities' I found exhausting and kept me unable to focus on my actual job. There were many 'lateral' promotions, which means you get moved around a lot and have to learn new jobs and skills, but it does not effect your pay. They would rather spent millions of dollars on 'diversity day' and whatnot than give raises to their employees, although most of jobs have been outsourced by now.  They do have fun employee activities and training, educational opportunities. Co-workers were great and direct management pleasant and good to work for.  It became an increasingly stressful work environment over time."
good,"I was thrown into the role with little to no direction on how to conduct a true ""day in the life"". I am a seasoned rep with the knowledge of prospecting, negotiating and closing deals. However, I was not given the proper credentials to even access my customers. I sold on the Federal side of the house (step-child). Little direction or guidance from leadership on navigating the channel or even closing RFPs. I still managed to close deals and finish the year above plan."
good,Management has been a concern for the last four years.
good,Descent company to work for if your no a contract employee I enjoy the job most of the time but a lot of work is put on a few people .
good,The culture is shifting away from it's original US Corporation with international offices. It is now owned by investors outside of the US which has changed the feeling of  job security we used to experience
good,"Lexmark is a great place to learn and develop your skills as an employee. The Lexington office pays better than most employers in the area as well. If you want to to be at a smaller company with less management, it might be a good fit."
good,"Empresa, com otimos funcionarios, porem peca um pouco na administra√ßao e gerencia, deixando a desejar no feedback."
good,"Flexibele instelling i.v.m. internationaal reizen en werken in verschillende culturen."
good,A wonderful workplace culture with very good people to work with. A global company with strong colleagues working together to bring new value to the brand.
good,"Lexmark understood that it needed to avoid becoming the next Kodak. They had a great vision and strategy to transition the business from a commoditized print company with legacy technology into a solutions based software, services, and hardware company. "
good,"average company to work. good work culture. average salary."
good,"Working Friday, Saturday and Sunday on 11 hour shifts. Easy work with mostly good people to work around. Temporary with no benefits was the only bad part other than losing your weekends."
good,"Lexmark is transforming themselves into a technology, software, solutions and services focused company."
good,El trabajo es bueno al  igual que el salario. Pero para los empleados con mi puesto  no hay  oportunidades de  escalar dentro de la empresa. Ademas  de que  el salario que actualmente se tiene  ya no cuenta con evaluaciones.
good,"You can do your job well, have customers who appreciate your efforts and are very happy with your work, and yet be let go because you didn't meet the metrics requirements.  "
good,Facilidad de aprendimiento y capacitacion
good,"There is very little job security at Lexmark. The worst part about it is not just the frequent layoffs (one every year or two): it's that the layoffs rarely consider performance or value to the company. The first line managers are usually terrific, but most employees are simply numbers on a spreadsheet to anyone second line and beyond. What kind of company lays off employees who they ACKNOWLEDGE are good performers and do their job well?"
good,I love my current job as a buyer. Its always great when someone needs a product or service ASAP and I am able to meet the demands. I have learned many computer skills as well as 7 Habits classes. Lexmark does offer many classes to grow your knowledge. SAP has been the latest and greatest and I enjoy it. My managers over the past 18 years have all been great. They have helped to guide me into areas that have benefited me the most.
good,"Lexmark management spending 5 years and $2B on software acquisitions, when not understanding the software industry and business.  Then sold the company to Chinese investors who immediately dropped the got rid of the software business. The renewed focus on the hardware / supplies should be back to core, but the financial situation has taken it's toll."
good,"Lexmark a une bonne culture de l'entreprise et c'est tres agreable de travailler pour cette compagnie."
good,Es una empresa que se esfuerza d√≠a a d√≠a se interesa mucho el el trabajo de sus empleados
good,They offer a lot of overtime. They have good benifits. Overall a good work enviroment. Friendly co-workers. Receive good on the job training. Learned a lot about assembly line production. Meetings were producttive.
good,"A good place for usability guerillas who sneakily work with development engineers to do good for the customer before management obsessed with cost has a chance to make short-sighted decisions.  The best part of the job was solving customer problems.  The worst part was trying to convince upper management that we should even when the ROI was demonstrably high.  The problem, of course, was that the investment this quarter might not yield the return until next year."
good,"Great building, great co-workers, a great place to learn, support to different sites,interact with people of all levels"
good,The company and products are amazing.  Great benefits and incentives to attract anyone.  There is a strong sense of growth and development.  If you are looking for a company with flexibility and strength this is the place to be.
good,La culture de l'entreprise est forte avec une grande implication des salari√©s.
good,"Lexmark is stuck with declining usage of laser printers. They are also now a commodity. They need a new focus or a new direction, maybe in high quality manufacturing and design of complex equipment.."
good,"Nice place to work, but culture is changing. My experience was good until I sold the largest deal in my div, the install was slowed down and I was not paid as promised.  I would recommend getting your comp plan completely in writing and working with your manager to show your true pay once a deal is sold. After multiple attempts I never received a commission break down and therefore never knew what I was actually paid on. It was a shell game."
good,"I worked at Lexmark 23 years and enjoyed the people and atmosphere. However, the yearly layoffs made working there stressful. The ability to move to different positions was somewhat limited. Lexmark was a good company to work at during my time."
good,"If Lexmark wasn't in a declining industry I would've stayed.  Although the work isn't exciting, there were some great folks to work with.  Unfortunately most of them have left."
good,"I worked in the inject printer business, which as you probably know, is no longer existent. They had to close the business because HP took over the market share of lexmark (in sales).  In the other areas like printers hardware and later printers, Lexmark was very strong. If you like later printer development and cartridge manufacturing this is a good place to work."
good,Lexmark has been downsizing employees since the early 2000s and has been bought and merged with an overseas company.  Not a secure place to work and be employed.
good,buen equipo de trabajo y r√°pida soluci√≥n de problemas
good,"Decent company to work for, however the room for advancement does not exist with this company. the provide a decent work life balance for families however."
good,"Typical call center.  Worked on a phone cue.   One supervisor was always helpful and supportive.   Able to provide needed assist to customers.  Customers felt that they were getting a new replacement printer, not a refurbish printer."
good,Good place to work.  I have been there to see many of the changes.  Anticipate growth and company will do well.  Due to company changes there are opportunities to make career changes.
good,"Lexmark has been a great company to work for if you find satisfaction from alternative sources other than work. It has an unbelievably great work/life balance, as well good compensation and benefits."
good,"Generally, a good work environment.  The job was challenging but had attainable goals.  Overall, an excellent group of people to work with."
good,The organization has grown from a local start-up to a global organization. The most enjoyable part of my job has been the opportunity to put a team of individuals together who want to learn and grow with and from each other in order to continually improve upon our current service offerings.
good,Lexmark was a good company to work for. The benefits were very good. They are very focused on employee development. There was a good opportunity to develop multiple skill sets.
good,This company has a main concern with the product that is sent out on a daily basis.  The most enjoyable part of this job is that the engineers are available to work with aging equipment to make things go along much smoother.
good,Interesting and challenging opportunities with potential to be immersed in different cultures
good,"I worked for Lexmark International Inc. from Apr.2012 to Dec.2012 as a software developer in Network Application team, Firmware Department. This is my first job after graduation in 2012."
good,"challenging envt"
good,"Work hard, play hard, but don't neglect the office politics if you wish to gain promotion!"
good,"Typical day:"
good,Lexmark is reinventing itself as a software/ solutions company and shying away from hardware as a key business area.
good,Poor employee training program. Poor management leadership.
good,Upper management gives no clear direction on the company. Good work life balance. No one ever no's why things are done. There is no ongoing task to try to reduce cost other than cutting people.
good,"La empresa Lexmark es muy buena empresa, el problema es que estoy en un servis lo que te resta muchos beneficios."
good,"Work/Life balance and Benefits are the most positive aspect."
good,"Only if hard work that produced results mattered.  When people stood for something and had personal pride.  Big companies are great for average employees.  Excellent employees are often un-noticed and allowed to leave.  This place is ripe with management that will not extend their neck for anyone.  No real leaders, only product managers"
good,Productive and fun workplace with table tennis and foosball table. Got along with co-workers. Social events are fun times.
good,"I enjoyed a good professional development path."
good,Ambiente informale e dinamico. Filiale italiana della multinazionale americana con forte vocazione all'espansione ed alla qualit√† dei prodotti offerti
good,"Very challenging,  heavy work load minimal supervision, long learning curve associated with Lexmark designed products"
good,"I was a Lexmark regular employee back in the Philippines for 6 years. Here is the US i was hired as a contractor.  "
good,Desde el inicio quede encantado con la importancia que se le da a las habilidades de liderazgo para colocar al personal con talento en posiciones estrat√©gicas. Pocas veces se encuentra una empresa que le de tanta importancia a estos factores.
good,Good benefits and competitive salary.  A shift in strategy has triggered restructuring activities but is still a good company overall encouraging innovative thinking.
good,"En 6 mois, j'ai beaucoup appris de mon hi√©rachique N+1. Personne √† l'√©coute et qui sait encourager pour progresser."
good,Lexmark has great work life balance and the employees are great. There is plenty of room to learn about new things and diversify your work experience.
good,"I have enjoyed working at Lexmark for many years.  I have done some very interesting things and been to many places."
good,"This was a nice comfort job with some very intelligent peers, when I retired the average age of my team dropped three years.  I didn't want  to leave but I felt I couldn't keep up the pace."
good,"Lexmark is a great place to work. I have had all positive experiences there. The people are great. The location is great. The pay and benefits are fine for that location. The only problem, long-term, is that the company has been downsizing and restructuring for the last 5 years. Long term professional growth and job survival does not seem very promising."
good,"Lexmark est une soci√©t√© o√π il fait bon travailler avec une pression supportable."
good,"I have worked with Lexmark for 16 years. I have learned a tremendous amount about business and the various subjects and areas of how it all works together. I have encountered great people and made life long friendships. I have gotten to travel the country and world and experience may things because of Lexmark."
good,Great company in the middle of a changing industry. Corporate culture is changing to be in alignment with the new ownership that is focused on driving profitability.
good,"I am a highly ambitious and motivated hardworking with skills and experience in the following fields:"
good,"Phone support for printers and report righting, keeping track of incoming calls, trouble shoot printer problems and escalate to the correct department. Worked with Wal-Mart associates over the phone."
good,I like my job at Lexmark. Management team has work to do to ensure the right leaders are in place and not bosses.  The company is good to work for for a temporary time.  The hardest part is trying to work for a management team that doesn't take the time to work with their employees to develop their talents.
good,"My team supports all the networked printers in the CSX fleet.. roughly 3,300 devices. We handle, hardware, sotware, configuration pushes, supplies management ect."
good,"Timing was everything for me to move on. I started with a company doing  $5.5bn in revenue, and only five years later, was doing $3.5bn."
good,The environment is very laid back.  You get your work done and the rest is  very flexible.  They encourage you to do career development to gain new skills.  Unfortunately the previous CEO performed very poorly and the company is in serious financial distress.
good,The organization overall is good. There are opportunities to learn the technology yet a very demanding environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was the atmosphere within the teams.
good,"Typical assembly line job. Goals increase every time you meet one, management is only there to push you harder. It is what I expected, but not for everyone."
good,Working for Lexmark is a productive and a positive experience. It is a fast-pased environment that pushes you to overcome challenges every day. The management is very collaborative and helping to achieve the best results.
good,The company empowers employees to step up. It also exerts so much efforts in other activities that help employees de-stress such as hobby clubs and CSR activities.
good,"in my fast job, i learn to how to talk properly specially if the client is a boss or manager and i learn how to travel in different place in manila and provinces for me its so fun because i enhance my skill and my self confidence in my fast job.."
good,"Lexmark has a true community culture. It's small enough to support an internal family feel, but large enough that some talent ends out falling through the cracks."
good,"Geen dag is hetzelfde, hierdoor blijft het werk uitdagend en interessant."
good,"Great vacation benefits here. However, you must work hard. This is no gravy train kind of place. Your employment also isn't guaranteed, they will cut you lose."
good,"Great company to work for with a strong emphasis on extracting the best that a person is and has to offer.  If you're interested in a challenging work environment with a great future, Lexmark is it."
good,My company was a small startup of about 30 employees that was fun and challenging. We specialized in proprietary software that dynamically drives templates (virtual signs) with client product and pricing data. Providing an ideal solution for agile retail signage systems. We were acquired by by a large corporation 2 years ago and unfortunately that has resulted in several rounds of layoffs.
good,"Being a product company while the focus is on churning out quality products (be it software or hardware), areas such as innovation, embracing and adapting new philosophies such as Agile and work-life balance are also encouraged."
good,Work life balance is great at Lexmark! I was able to make my own schedule as long as I supported my customers. The training for the job was lacking a little.
good,"Good benefits, poor management.  Very uncertain future being bought by Chinese holding company.  Good facilities, labs tools, etc.  Offices are old and need updating, but at least they aren't cubes."
good,My working experience there was good overall. I worked with real good people and built up lasting friendships. The hours were ideal for whatever worked for you. ( 3 shifts ) Learned a lot. Management was a bit top heavy and was more of a fraternity. Some promotions made you scratch your head. But overall it was fine.
good,"Disconnect between top management and line managers."
good,"Great benefits package with unlimited vacation days."
good,"In my typical day I wear many hats as a system administrator, Help Desk Technician, Network Admin and a Field Technician."
good,Great Work Life Balance and exposure to cross-country experience. I'm optimistic about the outlook for this company.
good,"excelente trato alos trabajadores"
good,dynamic people to work with.
good,38 1/2 wonderful years at IBM and Lexmark has taught me to be critical thinker and to plan ahead.
good,Empresa con buenos valores y buenas prestaciones
good,Strong company but evolving at the moment. Many layoffs to deal with declining revenues but software side of the business is seen as the future.
good,"Lexmark is a provider of imaging, software, solutions and services that help customers."
good,great people to work with
good,"Lexmark has always been a good corporate employer with competitive wages and benefits. The work environment is balanced with times of stress, especially during the annual planning cycle.Overall, I would recommend Lexmark as a good place to work."
good,"Challenging work and fairly compensated with a good work life balance.  Local management is great, too much work being shifted to low cost geographies."
good,"code review, development, peer review, testing, guiding and motivating other team mates. I also use to manage the AMS part from Wipro side."
good,"Es una empresa dedicada a la innovaci√≥n de impresoras, cartuchos de impresi√≥n  etc y se caracteriza por brindar productos de buena calidad."
good,"Training new staff & working with original staff to train them in different areas of the workplace,"
good,A typical day involved conference calls with an international team of design engineers that I interfaced with or managed. This gave me the chance to work with several different asian nationalities to learn how to work with them and the difficulties that they live with daily. My coworkers were wonderful to work with and very talented and helpful. The hardest part of the job was working with and engineering team that is in Asia and the amount of communication that is involved to ensure that we are all on the same page.
good,"never had a person un-happy to see me. And love to fix a on-going issue with a printer,and seeing the smile on the faces when the problem is resolved.Pick up parts go to sites and fix the issues with clients printers. Hardest thing TRAFFIC."
good,"Trabalho como terceirizado pela empresa, √≥timos benef√≠cios, mas infelizmente por ser terceiro sem perspectiva de crescimento profissional pela mesma."
good,"I really love my manager, and my coworkers are all very impressive.  The only thing that worries me is that it seems like we have a ""restructuring"" about once every 2 years, so it's hard to feel confident that you won't be looking for a new job at some point in the future."
good,"When I was at Lexmark, things were unstable but at least it was a solid place to work. Most of the people that work there are really good folks. The only real problems that the company had was from the very top. The CEO wanted Lexmark to be good enough to stay ahead of all printer companies except HP. Instead of attempting to be as great as possible, the goal was to be good enough. Quality suffered and as a result Lexmark was easily surpassed by its competitors."
good,Lexmark provides a flexible work/life balance.  Working from home on occasion is an option.  Job assignments are challenging and meaningful.  Good workers
good,"Decent company to work for, but the job can end at a moments notice due to the ebb and flow of product sales and shipping.  They utilize Standard Works Procedures, expect you to follow them and put in 8 hours of solid work performance.  If you are caught reading, or playing on your cell phone you may be terminated.  There are plenty of down time periods to get caught up on required training.  Lexmark follows OSHA rules to the letter, safety is very important to them and if you can't work safe you are out of there."
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es bueno."
good,"started out just inserting paper into printers when they were empty, got promoted and took on added responsibilities (best part of job), responsible for product inventory and supplies for lab and environmental chambers, fact that testing was moving to overseas and plant was downsizing (worst part of job), enjoyed working in this work environment, management was aloof"
good,"During tenure, division launched excellent products tied to added-value proposition for business verticals.  Solid management team committed to winning the right way."
good,Over 23 years I've gain lots if experience in manufacturing and testing mono laser printers in the beginning years on into R&D of printer embedded firmware testing for 12 years and currently working in R&D mechanical laser printer fuser and fusing toner properties.
good,good money. had a very friendly work environment. I enjoyed my time there. gave there workers the opportunity to try different jobs.  factory in Dunfermline was closed down.
good,"Definitely furthered my knowledge of chemistry and various techniques and also gained some experience with many new analytic tools."
good,"- Learnt new skills and techniques"
good,Work with a lot of great people.  Company is working through a strategic transformation.
good,"Managed a direct team of 6, indirect team of 24. Handled Central/western region of the U.S. and Canada. Managed 24 accounts with over $285 million in yearly revenue."
good,Enjoyed added skill set and international experience. Very professional atmosphere.
good,"I installed parts in I.C. B.'s I soldered with both a solder pot and a soldering gun, washed the boards and assembled electronics."
good,Supplier Performance Management Process.
good,Supplier Performance Management Process.
good,"Empresa balanceada, orientada a objetivos, buen balance de vida/trabajo"
good,"Unpaid intern what can I even say and I have to add extra characters."
good,"Lexmark was a pretty good company to work with, they have a good culture and the ability to work from home was nice. Uncertainty and change prompted them to dismiss many of the contractors however, so that wasn't so good for me. The company did offer the opportunity to get plenty of experience and the team I worked with was very knowledgeable, so I learned a lot."
good,"I don't like being negative about a company.  I'm sure the executives had good reason to do what they did.  It was hard for the troops to understand though.  They sold off the inkjet division for much less than it was worth.  In addition, inkjet printing is the future with low energy and low total cost of ownership (TCO) as compared to Laser printing.  It is sad that it's now a private company owned by a Chinese conglomerate."
good,"recommend highly - the people set Lexmark apart.  it is a very welcoming culture and collaboration is favored over competition, internally.  The printing industry is tough and Lexmark has proven to be very resilient and continues to be strong after 25 plus years separated from IBM."
good,"Relaxed work culture with good work/life balance."
good,"Great Work/Life balance and salary benefits. Nice place to work."
good,"Lexmark was a good company to work with when I hired on.  Great Products and professional culture.  Things have changed quite a bit once they were acquired by the Chinese."
good,Over-all it is a good environment. A lot of opportunities that you can learn. If you're keen on looking for areas of interest they are willing to help you about it.
good,Flexibility is great! I have the ability to work from home as often as my management allows and the people I work with are great! The downside is the job training is very lacking. There was virtually no training and/or guidelines to follow. I would be expected to learn as I go and figure it out.
good,"Lexmark is a great work place that provides professional training. People there are friendly. The challenge is future is so uncertain, industry is weak, and hard skills is not transferable."
good,Lexmark is experiencing some growing pains but in a good way.  They really are a good company with great technology and services.  The work/life balance is good and if you work in one of the main locations you will be connected with the right people.  Working in the remote offices or from home offices tends to isolate you and present challenges but they can be over come by always hitting home runs with your sales or the work you produce.
good,"A company that has had the foresight to transition from typewriters, to printers and now to solutions and software, Lexmark is an innovative company with a good work culture and work life balance."
good,"Dynamic forward thinking company.  Work remotely, all new business Fortune 1000 accounts.  Rapidly changing work environment, structure, and engagement strategy."
good,"I had a great time there. Great people, who are passionate about new technology, design and implementation. There is a push towards innovation, but that needs more incentive, R&D needs real R&D jobs."
good,"The best part of Lexmark is they pay very well for an area of low cost of living.  They also have a very liberal vacation policy."
good,I considered my team and my coworkers as family. We had so many struggles with projects but we solved most of them through team work. We still enjoyed coming to work everyday. Lexmark also provided us with clubs that will relieve our stress and meet new friends.
good,I've worked here as an intern/temp for a few years and I have gained a lot of experience. I have had a few different managers. All of which were personable and professional. The most enjoyable part of my job is the atmosphere and the looseness that everyone works with.
good,Great career path during the good years. Senior management lacks vision and long term direction. Slow in making the necessary product changes.
good,"La pol√≠tica de respeto al empleado est√° desarrollada en casi todos los niveles, principalemente en las gerencias. Posibilidades de superaci√≥n, incentivo de un real trabajo en equipo, camarader√≠a con los colegas."
good,Lexmark was involved in the community. They partnered with other company's to improve the local area. Every year they participated in the United Way campaign with significant contributions to the community.
good,"Great place to work. Great work environment, great people. Promotes career development/growth. Job security is a bit scary with frequent layoffs over the past few years, but future looks a bit better with new management."
good,Lexmark es una empresa bien estructurada y proporciona gran equilibrio vida-trabajo.
good,Good environment to work. Good work culture. Good people. It was really a good fun while working at lexmark. I made good friends. Learning at lexmark was also good.
good,Paga muito bem e bem acima do mercado. A dedica√ß√£o costuma extravasar as horas legais e ficar at√© bem depois √© comum.
good,"Excellent work team; high level of integrity; technology industry"
good,I would recommend the company.  The pay is alright and so are the benefits.  The best thing is the work/life balance and the vacation time.  They are going through strategy changes so everything is a little fluid.
good,Each day is presented with new challenges. Almost everyday starts with a trip to UPS first thing in the morning. Then an average of 4 service calls a day throughout the West Metro Area.
good,"Too many changes of directions and too much focus on cost versus on increasing offerings, services or growth. People are awesome, always willing to change and follow leardership, even when it means 180 degree changes every 2-3 years"
good,I really liked my time with Lexmark.  Made many friends and enjoyed the challenging projects.  I liked the balance of work and family they emphasized.
good,"Powerful collection of software and hardware with positive management.   The merger with Apex is a great development with room for growth in Asia."
good,"Le contenu du poste √©tait tr√®s vari√© : comptabilit√© fournisseurs, comptabilit√© clients, reporting, budgetisation... Je pouvais avoir √† faire  toutes ces t√¢ches sur une journ√©e."
good,A chemical process operator at Lexmark can expect to work with computer controlled equipment and robotic loading and unloading equipment. Management has been with the company for many years and is knowlegable in the operations of the company. The employees are pleasant to work with.
good,"Lexmark was the first position in sales that I had with technical needs.  The training that I received at Lexmark on printers and connectivity allowed me to be successful there.  Lexmark was also the first place where I was taught about consultative selling and the total cost of ownership.  Overall a good company to work for; decent salary, benefits and retirement savings program."
good,"Everyone cares about your success, products do what they say. Everyone is there to help"
good,Horario de 6 a 6 l-m-m-j
good,Lexmark has allowed me to create organizations from paper management throughout the company to the outreach programs on collaborations with Universities.
good,Well equipped toolroom in a user friendly enviroment. They have a flex time in which you can start as early as 6 am or as late as 8:30 am which is convienant for people with kids. Great group of people to work for.
good,"Lexmark is a company that has a huge depth of resources, both people and equipment.  While it only focuses on printers and printing solutions, it has the capability to branch into any area of consumer product development.  The upper level management had no great vision beyond laser printers and this may limit the long term health of the company.  Additionally, much of the companies resources were squandered during the time the CFO, who is famous for his role in the Equifax scandal, ran the financial aspects of Lexmark."
good,"It's a very good and fun place to work at. People are very friendly, with a very competitive salary and lots of career growth. I would highly recommend Lexmark."
good,"I work on contract I would suggest that everyone hired by a contract pay attention to every detail on what your actually agreeing to by the contract company.  I pay for your own insurance, sick and vacation time through the contracting company, which already takes away from your contracted rate of pay. Lexmark it self cultivate an employee based company with team work environment."
good,"great work life balance but slow career growth, stagnant technology. people are cooperative, you are free to learn new technology. management follows a single track. entirely controlled by US main office"
good,You learn new staff every day.  Business is related to many customers and all it matters is the customer opinion for your activities. Great place to work.
good,"Great people to work with, After they finished selling off pieces of itself to foreign companies, I cannot say what the environment is like now. "
good,Management very supportive and available for questions and assistance in resolving problems.  Enjoyed working with the team. Providing support to the business partners.
good,"Lexmark was an introduction into worldwide marketing support. The team culture and success across the globe made working at Lexmark exciting, comfortable and satisfying."
good,"Great place to work, very collaborative atmosphere. excellent management and career opportunities. Corporate downsizing from year to year, other than that if you last 5+ years in the company, its a great place to be."
good,Work life balance is high. Most of the members are trying to get into a project driven by US head office not by local managers. US counter part is very very good .Local Managers are biased to specific members. Non-tech managers are difficult to handle. Feedback of an employee gets carry forwarded. He does not get any chance to prove once again.
good,Great place to work I learned a lot there I did a lot of different jobs electrical mechanical ultra ultra high vacuum high-voltage cryogenics learn how to work on different kinds of equipment troubleshooting upgrading and installing new equipment
good,I have enjoyed my work with Lexmark but due to the contractual parameters of the position it was moved to another state. Disappointing as I wanted this to be a long term company job. Management is young but well trained in multiple aspects. Always opportunities for growth and the companies meets regularly to check in to see if you are where you want to be or think you should be and is constantly promoting any training that you could want.
good,Was able to grow a lot in my position. Great work life balance. Liked breaking down silos. Didn't like the fact of not a lot of upward mobility. Overall good experience
good,Lexmark produces some world class products and services.  The company was purchased by a Chinese company a few years ago so I don't know what the culture is like now.
good,"- Good environment"
good,"Had the opportunity to significantly change roles every 2-4 years, learning new skills and aspects of the business.  While a large company, felt small enough to learn/understand the strategy and goals."
good,Es una compa√±ia muy Buena y adaptable para sus asociados buen ambiente de trabajo y me gusta su cultura.
good,The position allowed me to be hands on to a break fix on call operation! Covered a large scale of printers to ensure clients had the best product as well as a prompt on site service to maintain these products!
good,"Worked here for almost 15 years in many sales/marketing/consulting roles.  They tend to micro-manage the sales efforts but less so in other parts of the company.  Unlimited vacation means they treat you like an adult in terms of managing your time.  Low turnover outside sales if you ignore letting people go due to M&A (my fate).  In the consulting role, I was able to get a glimpse of culture at literally hundreds of companies and Lexmark held it's own.  It is just a bad time right now for morale (winter 2015) due to the restructuring.  I suspect this will continue for most of 2016 until the dust settles. Despite all that, long term prognosis is good provided the culture survives the current disruption."
good,"Lexmark is a great place to work as a work culture. Many of the people are very health conscious and work out at the YMCA during lunch break. It's great to have other people help you stay committed and fit when it's so easy to quit exercising. "
good,"I had a great experience at Lexmark. I was able to take time off when a family member was sick, I was able to take vacation when I wanted. The work environment was supportive, collaborative, and friendly."
good,Great place to engage and encourage professional development. Friendly management style. A few more meetings per day then absolutely necessary. I enjoyed my time at Lexmark and would go back.

good,"Entreprise qui souhaite franchir rapidement un palier et devenir un des leader sur le march√© de l'impression dans le monde."
good,Se puede crecer r√°pidamente en cargos regionales y con una din√°mica de trabajo en equipo muy interesante
good,"At my last position, I was extremely please with our job and job environment...Lexmark was a firm believer in work/life balance, and gave us the freedom, to work from home when needed as well as able to host meetings remote...since most of the teams I worked with were either in EMEA or the Philippines‚Ä¶."
good,Business model is not working anymore and the company is struggling to find a new one. Poor high level management  that cannot make the big turnaround that the company needs.
good,"Les √©quipes sont coop√©ratives et professionnelles. Un bon catalogue produits, trop riche en gammes."
good,"The job itself is very structured, you typically know what you're going to be doing when you come in and you can leave work at work when you're done. The hardest part of the job is when something goes wrong - but I also found that to be the most fun as you get to learn more and the day goes by faster. Co-workers are great, they help each other out when other areas are stressed and provide good mentorship if you're training. As long as you show up on time, do your job well and don't brush shoulders you'll get along great with management and supervisors, further, they are very understanding of life circumstances when they arise."
good,"I have learned many new technologies in this project. I started my career as Oracle Database administrator. After that I learned SQL Server, Teradata, AWS, Shareplex Data replication tool etc. This is very good opportunity for me to learn the new technology and implement them to reduce the infrastructure cost."
good,"The works task is different every day, so you have daily an opportunity to learn something more. Nice co-workers always have a positive attitude."
good,"Great place, full of wonderful people that makes you feel like family. The management is very supportive and goal oriented. With a good amount of procedures and politics."
good,"Buena; salario regular bueno, buen ambiente, buena administracio"
good,Lexmark is a very relaxed work environment.
good,"I service a large fleet of Lexmark equipment here. A typical day includes clearing paper jams,  performing maintenance tasks, installing supply items and repairing malfunctions..  be they machine malfunctions .. or human ones. I also maintain a parts inventory and manage the return of used/spare parts and used supply items for recycling. This is not a difficult job to do.. challenging at times but not difficult. The best part is the interactions with the people in the two buildings that I maintain. I am also responsible for assisting USDOT customers in USDOT satellite locations across the country over the phone and setting up service calls with Lexmark for those regional sites."
good,Nice place to work....lots of opportunities.  The devices they manufacture are of great quality and value.  The service team is full of knowledgeable and experienced service engineers.

good,Work environment is good and have freedom to test and work in ITSM tool. Managers and clients are good to do my job. ITSM migration was the hardest part in Lexmark and learnt many things during migration.
good,"Lexmark has been a great place to work. However, the economy and shift to paperless culture has hit the company hard.  Honestly, the corporate leadership has done very well managing an engineering workforce and expertise.  But economic forces have been causing the company to downsize to stay competitive so it is moderately tense atmosphere until equilibrium is reached and I believe it will be reached and the company has a future."
good,"Lexmark es una gran empresa, te deja trabajar y se enfoca en resultados. Tuve la oportunidad de colocarme en diferentes posiciones dentro de la empresa durante mis 10 anios de relacion laboral. Tiene la empresa una muy buena cultura laboral de inclusion y de seguridad para el empleado. En terminos generales toda mi estancia en Lexmark fue positiva."

good,"I love the family atmosphere."
good,"Starting with my employment at IBM (1980) until my transition to Lexmark (1992); ending with my retirement when in 2006 my department, along with several others, was outsourced to an outside  contracting company.   Initially, I found a company that valued it greatest asset - its human resources (employees).  A typical day at work was one that required being able to multitask as I was allowed to cross into areas other than just my immediate dept.  I learned that with continual education/courses/classes, you could advance by not only working smarter, but harder as well.  I had several opportunities for special assignments that sometime included travel.  Most co-workers were ambitious teamworkers that understood that sometimes to advance meant giving someone else a ""leg"" up.  Managment was a challenge that sometimes required early mornings and late nights, but was worth the effort which sometimes made it difficult to balance work & personal life.  Most enjoyable part of the job was the varied opportunities afforded me in my 26 years with IBM/Lexmark."
good,As a field service tech your always on the move i love fast pace work and this was it.weather its repairing a printer or desktop upgrading a server i did it all and everyday was different than tha day before.
